{"icuI3WpxQxk": "hi I'm Cass and this is honey and we're here with Matt Natalie and beautiful green sea to retreat into phyno and we are about to do the coolest thing we are making on our gummies so not Natalie they're the experts and they are going to show us so what's step one oh well first of all you want to get yourself some cannabis so this is purple blue so have a look at that and maybe you can pick a decent size and I'll go to that that we can chip apart a little bit maybe they're all done man that number to which you could have a look at a little darker so you both can go ahead and pick some cannabis out of that bag just how much can we pick maybe something close to 2 3 grams whatever feels right you can either choose a big mug or even just a few small notes we're gonna switch this down I'm not to a compressed pop okay so that's gonna be one of the first steps once we've picked out the cannabis so we are making these gummies from rosin so it's a solvent list product so it's a great canvas extract you don't need to use like any weird chemicals or solvents or anything like that so it's a super exciting way to D carb and income means a hundred percent it sounds like yeah pretty much all using is sweet and a bit of pressure to squeeze out the trichomes off of those buds so we're gonna have an extraction process to remove what we want off of the buds and you can play around with the different heats and pressures so the idea is to maybe find the ultimate way to get a great yield of different strains might be different pressures different temperatures so there's a bit of a science to it and a bit of a logging process to see if you can dial this in and get as much out of it as possible what are you doing here so we are going to pre press the flower so basically you're gonna weigh out how much cannabis you're using and we are friends at rose and unity have created this amazing database program it's online so you go to rosin unity our OS I am you and I - I gotta come and you can love all your information so you're going to want to weigh your flour and then you can track it so there's gonna be a little spa there it says how much weight and I'm gonna say 2.5 grams of cannabis and now we're going to put it into this crazy little 3d printer puck press that resin you'll be babe that's good and you're just gonna press it that's the muscle in this room right now I'm gonna let him and we status it is there a way that you could do this that you couldn't press it that hard is there like a machine that you could buy that we're doing are well in some in some presses you put them in a little baggy a little screen it'll lose through but in this case it's just parchment paper so you do need the puck in a sense to make this approach go down mm-hmm so there's a company called Kanna clamp and that's who we're gonna press our Roselyn today which reminds me we should fire them up yeah and they the Kanna clamps come with a little press a little box press so it's like that but instead of a circular puck it is a rectangle and so if you buy a set it kind of clips you will get one of those presses with it right in a sense but the kind of line look at that no there we are we've got ourselves a bit fragile actually you're a nice step president as impressed as possible so now we're gonna weigh that puck again just to double-check so at 2.3 to you or a 2.5 we're also gonna wear our parchment paper before we get anywhere further with this process so on the data base it's going to say paperweight in so this is just your paper parchment paper as it is culinary parchment from paper chef is the best rosin parchment paper to use paper chef's you should probably just make Brussels paper we're gonna basically fold it twice and make a little pocket this is mechanically they're made in the States so it's basically a hair straightener on steroids yeah amazing it's really easy to use one button to turn it on side button turns it up so you can try two different temperatures again you get to log them on your AWS and unity to see what temperature you squish that and see what your yield is like the one thing about the can of clamps it's important is first of all they get hot so do send them down on a silicon mat to protect your comb and the second thing is that you want to make sure you line up your bud in the middle of the clamp so you want to make sure that you're squishing the whole bud and the whole pot in otherwise you'll miss some of the squish so preferably the puck is centered so none of it is gonna okay those guys venture sure cos okay now I don't have much pressure on this yet but we're gonna want to start a timer as soon as I do apply some heavy pressure and from there we'll just see what happens all right I'm not quite there yet once I'm feeling I would say there's some pressure there now and you're at 225 so there we go let's do this so I'm gonna clamp this in as aggressively as I can't we're gonna get this nice and tight the handle is plastic so I'm not gonna go crazy and we're just gonna wait this is pretty accessible though like this isn't totally large of an appliance to have yeah and as the heat compresses this puck I'm able to actually squish down even further so over the minute now we're just over a minute I've actually squeezed it in even further what is the last thing we let it go to two minutes all of this information so the big thing is people are excited about what they've switched with turning this unit you're done is the main safety feature because these are hot so that is the one disclaimer to be careful is turning this off between squishes okay so this is your rosin here it is all this liquid here so you always get like a little clam better pop and don't throw these away because these are still good you can like melt these in with butter you make popcorn topping so they can't recycle then tomorrow can you maybe tilt that towards the camera so they can see what we got out of that now how its strong would you say that is well we'll find out we're gonna win see actually what kind of return on the switch we got we'll see exactly how much we have here and from there we can get a better idea how much rosin we have all right so everybody can huddle in and have a close look at this because any basic dab tool we'll just go ahead and clean all this stuff it'll all stick together so once you've got a clump going you can just literally almost like vacuuming the parchment it all just comes together and actually that may be why you're right it's really yeah it really is this was actually a nice consistency array of squish and just like that we've squished that bud and we've collected all the rosin so that was a an extraction just like that Wow yes it really is and this will be what we D carb activate and use for our edibles so we're gonna take the rose and look at addy carbon in the oven at 275 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes so we have preheated the oven to 275 and you're just gonna put it in a mason jar and cause a lid on it that's going to be carbon because Robin you don't get enough heat from squishing it to be carpet so you're just gonna get a little bit more for your cannabis if you and your awesome if you put it in the oven first so what does D carbon mean then her so deep carbonate is basically activating the cannabis so that once you put it into an ethylene it and your stomach acids will break it down so if you didn't decarbonise aim effect at all that's right yeah okay there we go two minutes all right blue represent movies well the stuff comes the long way to get old lady should now remaking rosin as well and rosin you know what your yield is so on that purple blue we've got a 13 percent yield no not bad 20 percent yield is like pretty fantastic they're not all beggars look at that yeah cool so that will make the bulk of our edibles all right from 30 minutes 30 minutes start your timer so you know so you want to use a quarter cup of water with your bus with yellow whatever flavor you desire no super classy weird jello gummies Angelica mystic so we only had a third cup measuring so you want to stir it yeah red her Brides putting a half gram of rosin if we had a larger ER with more rosin it would swirl more efficiently no we're scraping there yeah we got it nice a second in goes the jelly into the bowl to later go into the molds all right everyone get to see ours Easter Island bolt can't fire grotto like that show to the campfire Stern had to give him something and probably see him on the weekend at the event let me get out of your way Oh gonna put him in that fridge Emily and this guy says the fridge for 20 minutes so look at them how long were these in the fridge for these goes-- were like 22 minutes in the fridge we're just testing out this ice cube tray and it's silicone we did line it with an oil I would recommend using like a coconut oil we use pen a lot well because that's when we had access to it just helps it slide out [Applause] yeah Roz I love these I caught these perfect they make these in like 40 minutes a lot like mr. Z Z is making a cheesecake and so we use half gram of rosin so it's 250 milligrams and we broke it up over 500 their food was I don't know 15 milligrams per piece 40 so I would like start slow you know well it depends where you'll feel like this day don't give that to your grandma you taught us that such a clear easy awesome way and now I have these delicious affordable when I make gifts thank you thank you and huge other two rows in unity for hooking us up they showed us Ryan at rosa unity you go follow them at Rose music on Instagram they're killing it they go to super cool Rosen database and he showed us how to make these two days ago and now we're spreading the love and you guys I see it and we have been looking for and specific resin edibles and now we can make them thank you so much Matt and Ali and you have an amazing story and you're gonna hear about it on our show regular Canadians enjoying weed so with Cass and honey now check them out this time thanks green sea to retreat for having us here gasps gunfire we're hooking up today yeah it's been a [ __ ] wicked day all your eggs edibles this day has been absolutely perfect and kind of interesting so this is just gel our Joan something that kids know how to make thank you", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "uBlyb3dh02U": "good afternoon we're going to make some THC infused gummies first step is to make sure you have everything that you need out so our items are a three ounce package of unflavored jello or flavored gelatin not sugar-free I'm using two packets of unflavored as per the recipe that I posted and 2/3 cup cold water I've also got my lecithin to the side to put a little bit in because that is a nice fat protein that the THC bonds to there's a little machine that keeps it to a perfect time without having to go back and forth to the stove also has a link posted since we're doing super Lemon Haze on blue so let's again box tile I like to make sure it's very loosely powdery because it'll stick together I said it is a plant fat protein mini whisk mix all of these powders together enter water so we want to make sure that all of the gelatin is wet and separated and there are no clumps of gelatin that are still powdered the gelatin is mixed and 15 minutes has elapsed the gelatin has soaked up the water so enter the trusty little heater you turn that on I'm going to go ahead and break up the gelatin a little bit here and I'm going to wait probably about 10 minutes to come back and stir it again back quick search it's starting to look clearer for the record I'm doing blue for super-lon haze because true clear has a blue label just like I did read for indica and I did yellow for hybrid alright we're gonna let it sit another five minutes so it's been a little bit I'm gonna go with that is as clear as it needs to work because there's lecithin and it doesn't get that crystal clear like if you're doing candy but it is quite smooth quite runny I'm going to inject the super Lemon Haze truth here into it that has been so deep and warming in a cup of warm worth yeah it's tough [Music] and what i'm doing here is optional ma'am I usually pull that off but I'm going to pull some of the jello up in give it a shake and squirt that back in we all want to make the most of all of our product so I'm going to stir that in and once again I'm going to let it sit for five minutes to infuse before we put it into the molds all right we're gonna give it one more stir then because this is gelatin and not egg I'm not gonna whisk it super fast assuming it's going to stay in there [Music] smells like THC so the gummy bear molds that I put the link to hold about a milliliter you don't need to measure but they came with little droppers I'm going to hand this off to my partner because he has a much better non-payment you if you drip anything cuz it's silicone it's gonna that's basically gonna be one dose all of the little dots that end up on top of the silicone yeah kind of scrap all those at the end put them together it's almost like having an extra Bayer we use the opposite color or a different color than the jello you he's gonna go ahead and fill the rest of those up and we'll be back in a moment on to another bold [Music] we're gonna go ahead and stipple some cornstarch onto the back I put these in the freezer they've set and I've let them come back to temperature to make sure there's not a lot of moisture so this is my makeup brush there's a link to this this is the stipple the flat top that's what we're gonna stipple with so I've got cornstarch I just used the cornstarch lid they've got a little folded up foil and a paper towel in case I feel like it's getting too thick so I just went to stipple along the back of these and if you feel there's a bit much you can always go back and kind of wipe something away the nice thing about the brushes you can twist it and if you feel there's too much corn starch somewhere then you can use the edges of it so I like to know that my backs are good prior to pop them out I'm gonna pop this one out like so now gonna turn it over and show you the quick way I just stick my nail into it and pop them out and then lay them out afterwards welcome back to the final step we're going to say it's been 24 hours these will stay out overnight these have been out for 24 hours they're slightly smaller because they've now reduced down a little bit in size once they have dehydrated a bit as such I stipple them on the top with the cornstarch and I'm able to have them not to be sticky any further questions please feel free to send me a private message or post on the video however you'd like thanks", "_NZRC5BB2nw": "you see you guys cello's nice and stuff was not wet everyone throw something woo I think I need [Music] hey guys welcome back to pop my 420 I just want to take a second before I even start this next video and thank you guys like 1 1 1 1 1 1 I never expected it to hit over 1000 subscribers on YouTube so I just want to thank you and keep watching and if you haven't seen my last video please go watch the last video because actually you're gonna eat that video for this video so why are you down there watching that video make sure you subscribe and you get that notification bill so you know every time that I'll put it into the video up guys I'm gonna do a cannabis gummy bear and I'm gonna use the cannabis coconut oil that I made in the last video to make it so before I also get started guys I want to say this already I am NOT a chef I am NOT a perfect cook I'm just a mom like I said you can always do whatever you want there's no judgement but I'm gonna use a simple recipe because I'm a mom that's always on a go so I just want something quick and easy right now I'm on the west coast so it's gonna be Memorial weekend in a couple days so I just wanted something like I can chill out pop in my mouth gummi bears are always appropriate I have my regular jello you can use any flavor you want this one guys happen to be a six ounce we only gonna use 3 ounces I only had a thick box so normally when you buy this jello get the three ounces until you figure out how many companies you want to make we're also gonna be using a gelatin this is a 1 ounce box it comes in four packets we're gonna be using all of those four packets if you are vegan you cannot use this gelatin there is another substitute for individuals who are vegan so please don't use this if you're vegan shout out to all my vegan Watchers also we're gonna be using that cannabis infused coconut oil that we made in the last video this is a 4 ounce on jar by fall they make all of those mason jars and as you can see I left it out just so it can be liquefied because we're gonna mix that with our water look at that gold green that's nothing but gold green honey anyway so this is a 4 ounce star I have a bunch of them they were referred generated all that did was just took it out a couple hours before this video and let it come to room temperature and as a just sidebar I have some citric acid I'm gonna try to play with this after we make the gummies because I know you can make like your gummy sour so we could probably turn it up a notch if you want to there we go we got that citric acid so and I have a little measuring this is like a little measuring cup where it comes like 2 ounces 4 tablespoons I find it easier when I'm trying to measure out liquid cannabis so and we have a spatula and whisk is going to be important and these are just two measuring one is a half cup one is a four for my cannabis in my water measurement so you can use any shapes of cups long as you have a 1/2 cup a 1/4 cup and a whisk and a spatula that's all you need so let's get started guys so I'm gonna start out with my 1/2 cup and I'm gonna just fill it up with some water and that's what's gonna go into the pipe I dropped a little bit so I'll just add a little bit y'all don't tell nobody alright and what we're gonna do is put this puppy on and I'm gonna put it at like a low medium I find that you don't want it to cook too fast okay guys now that we got the 1/2 cup of water in I'm taking off my mason jar and as you can see my butters been out it's melted but it's starting to come back together so I need 1/4 of this so I have a 1/4 cup you might can't see that but that is and it just makes it easier to scoop sometimes you find it to get messy so I'm just gonna use this too together with that water and ain't gonna hurt nobody to add a little bit more cuz I know y'all like to turn it up up and you can also less let's get these gummies poppin yo we gonna make sure they live that's the young folks eh okay so mater we have I 1 4 plus that I added of the cannabis infused coconut oil we're just gonna let the let it heat up and infuse a little bit together then once we do that and we see it kind of coming together we're going to add those four packs of um gelatin so I kind of like wanting to do its own thing because it should have all been liquefied already but it all started coming back together so i'ma just let it spread out a little bit and now that those two are coming together I'm now gonna add those four packs of gelatin and what I like to do is just open them up two at a time make sure all the good stuff is at the bottom of the envelope and then that way I can pour it in and whisk it so you're not like pouring them individually and then they start clumping up on you I hate that so let's put all of them in there try not to drop the packets pop mine so the whole idea mmm excuse me voice just went out it's to whisk so it dissolves so we want all of that together all of it does just start to come together because you can see if you know yo is not all the way liquefied its clump up with the gelatin packet so I just find it easier when you just start getting three ounces I just happen to have a six ounce box I think I picked it up by accident and you can use any flavor I know some people use kool-aid I've seen videos with kool-aid which is pretty creative I've seen videos with food coloring which is also creative so you can get like so creative with this stuff guys don't take it like so serious that oil coconut oil is so good I'm so in love with it okay guys so like I said I have a six ounce box and uh I don't want to use the whole six ounce because if I did use the whole six ounce I would just have to double all of my measurements so if I had a half cup of what I would have to go to a cup of water so I could have used it but I didn't want to make a zillion coming so I'm gonna measure out three ounces my little cup here is two ounces so I know I just have to add one more element after this wash and I'm gonna add it and whisk it at the same time because I don't want it to start to clump up on me one more ounce in there and guys if you feel like it's like I don't know how to explain it maybe like a little too thick I have seen videos other videos where you add a little bit of water to it and I'm not saying like you know it ain't supposed to be super liquidy of course because it's gelatin I mean you know it's the gummies so it's supposed to have a little thickness to it but sometimes you find it just a little it's not coming together around just don't be afraid to just add a little so I'm putting in this last so that was a total of three ounce of that lime jell-o and as you can see it's turning green and you need to whisk even aside so make sure you get the sides of the pot and you want to whisk until all of that jello is totally dissolved and once it's all dissolved I'm gonna turn my heat up so it can come to a boil which I'm gonna start kind of now turn this up and I'm gonna I'm just turning it up maybe to a medium fire so I can start boiling and then once it starts boiling guys what I want to do is let this simmer for five to eight minutes now it's gonna be your choosing all the time the reason I said five to eight minutes because you want to try to keep some consistency the more you make this stuff I realized as far as cooking and enough use meant and the longer you cook things the THC potent it's burning off so I'm gonna be be cautious of my timer and if you could see on minds and say 11:50 to five minutes from now we'll be 57 so at 57 is gonna be my time to take this off and start to get it into those moles maybe cuz you don't want it to get cold so and I'm gonna for five to seven minutes and also be stirring whisking I'm sorry that's the better word whiskey hey guys as you can see it's boiling up it's getting all good and make sure in between your five to eight minutes that you're whisking and then you stop so what you want to do is just whisk in between let it boil up whisk again we'll be back in a few minutes guys it's gonna be ready all right guys our clock is at fifty seven let's go and turn that off see how nice and bubbly it is the green done came through in the jello I can clearly tell from my whisking that you know it's it's solidified together so it's ready to do what it does when it goes into molds and make jello now guys like I said I got these molds from probably Michaels and I made it with me from the East Coast so you can go anywhere I've seen YouTube videos where people literally put them in ice cube trays and I ain't mad at you if you can find some dollar ice cube trays and put these in do it stop saying like so serious and have a little bit of fun so spatulas always won't come in handy guys cuz you can do this with I just want to make sure that my camera guy sees that that's spatula cuz you're gonna leave some stuff on the side so okay this is the difficult part is pouring it in I don't have no trick if you know a way to get this in I tried syringes it takes too long this stuff moves quick so I'm just gonna use my half cup of my measuring cup thing I had and hope that this works so at least with this I can scoop the handle important just like that you're gonna get stuff on the edges don't worry about that you can always shave this stuff off I'm using this heart mold I probably won't even have to use these other moles because I only did the three ounces if I probably would've did more I would have been able to fill probably all of them up so we wanna that's why you want to make sure you get this in here pretty quick cuz it will solidify when you really quick so what I want to do is just take this and honestly y'all I think I'm gonna just eat this so I'm probably just gonna get my high on now because if I can't eat it yoshua can I think I'm just addicted to the cannabis oil cuz it just tastes so good for real so I'm gonna put these in a freezer you can put them in a refrigerator I just find it if you put them in a freezer it kind of makes it come together a little bit better I'm gonna leave it on this parchment paper that way if anything drip off it can stick right to this and see the good thing about the parchment paper guys look you got some little extra gummies coming on the side look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that that's what I'm talking about I think I might be high already but it's okay I'm at home this we're gonna put in the freezer for about 30 45 minutes we'll come back with the video and check on them and then I think I'm trying to turn up a notch just a little bit to make them like sour why not we'll be doing be right back alright guys so we're back we've given the gummies 30 minutes and let's get ready to take them out I tend not to leave mines in there that's a whole 45 minutes just because I don't want my gummies frozen so guys I got the parchment paper I'm just gonna use that paper and what you're gonna do is just kind of flip them over and you should be able to pop these puppies out let's pray they come out for me come on baby and remember we said we will have the access of stuff around it and again I told you what I was gonna do with that oh I don't really care about the perfect dummy because I'm not perfect so I don't care and I'd say are so good you can do any flavor remember and I love that they all just coming out which is always a great sign that there I was getting ready say cooked but there hold it correctly not cooking so guys and pop these puppies out and then what we gonna do real quick just turn them up a little bit and put them with I'll make them sour so as you can see guys here's on those Tommy's there's me eating them all right I got Lobo I got my measuring cup this is a half cup I'm gonna scoop out sugar yes people do some sugar in a ziploc bag so I'll put 1/2 cup of regular white granulated sugar and then I'm gonna just do like a tablespoon of citric acid no I lied I'm gonna do a tablespoon and a half I want to and that's the citric acid you can get it from right where the kool-aid is in Walmart and then you want to just start it up together like that now of course you guys are a lot smarter than I am I'm sure if you know something else that you can put in this to make them sour share it with me so what I'm gonna do take that out the way and then I'm gonna just pop these in and make somebody sour because I can that's what we want to do and then guys what I would do is put these back in a refrigerator they're kind of like let on kind of coke this is it this was mine do it yourself make gummies out of jello and not knowing what you're doing and I can still be to work in and out work and I got some dummies no don't take your gummies the work can get fired you see you guys the devil's nicest up was not wet number one notice I'm sorry whoa now I do think that lump with the citric acid does make it ten times our but the amusement tastes good then consistency in a dummy like some time you get gummy snake falling they all wet this is not so I did a good job on this I think I'm right now alright guys so that's it so until the

comments comment ok CC b9 Clare [Music] [Music]", "vu1RKWQtN-M": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video that's been highly requested and I'm sorry it was taking so long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]", "MS6BjTDtiOM": "cap dank here again in the smash lab today we're going to be using the nug smash or mini and we'll be showing you how to do a three and a half gram press on the new nug-nug smash 4 mini first of all what I wanted to show you folks is how to adjust the temperature setting on the mini itself you're gonna come to this particular button here you're gonna hit that button and then it's gonna start to flash and you can move your setting up or down and today we're gonna do this particular press at about 200 and let's say 15 degrees then let's make it to 20 okay once it's it can go over hit our button and we're ready to go now we have to wait for for the mini to heat up to our to our pressing temperature so in the meantime we'll get ourselves a three and a half gram hundred and sixty micron bag again we're gonna load it bottle textile so what we're gonna use today is we're gonna be using some of this key lime pie that was grown by Miller farms in rough-and-ready California just want to give a shout out to them so let's wake up three and a half grams of this beautiful flower I'm on the money okay like I said we're gonna load these this bag bottom textile which what that is it's been a load up and flatten into a coin versus some people just load them in flat and the nut smashers are really made for bottle tech that's how they design these and it's gonna give you maximum yield bottle textile so again what we do bottle textile is we fold in the corners right they use a little tool like this because it definitely helps to get the corners into place once you get the corners in I don't think to adjust it with my fingers yeah once again that's about what we're looking for bottle textile so let's let's lay it up beautiful flower okay bottle textile what we're trying to do is set up ourselves with a really good foundation here and just continue adding to that and what this will allow us to do is if it's packed in here correctly we will be able to you'll get a coin puck at the end of the press out of this and bottle textile should be something like that there okay that's about again what we're looking for once we load it up this point we want to cut the bag till we leave about a half an inch okay and again I'm gonna fold the top like a present and the last corner here it is when we load into the machine itself okay so looks like we're getting close to our temperature here so let me get a piece of parchment paper come down here you're gonna open up our open up our our plate these are 2.5 inch plates start our press what we want to do is slowly bring the plates up see how the bag is kind of accordion in on itself start the extraction process yes and we're gonna let our press go for 2 minutes and 30 seconds during the process with the mini you definitely want to keep it under maximum pressure and I think I see some rosin yes starting to flow they're golden beautiful resin about another minute here on the press [Music] about another 30 seconds or so here looking good ok we got 10 seconds left here paper together release your plates looks pretty good to me once again captain dick here in the smash lab with the nug Smasher mini", "Vc13A94RRBo": "[Music] what's up guys it's a happy grower here in this video we'll be showing you how to make cannabis infused gummy bears there's just a few simple supplies that you will need [Music] the lead one ounce with unflavored gelatin 6 ounces of jell-o mace half a cup of water 1/3 cup of cannabis infused coconut oil and if you don't have this part ready a previous video shows you how to make it the link is in the description and lastly you'll need candy molds these can be purchased online eBay or Amazon to make the gummies first turn on the stove to medium heat then add your 1/3 cup of coconut allowing it to know once the oil is melted add in your 1/2 cup of water bring the water in oil to low boil stirring regularly next slowly whisk in the unflavored gelatin making sure it isn't even consistency then whisk in the jello mix doing the same thing once mixed only allowed to cook for seven or eight minutes on low to medium heat until does a nice rolling boil as you can see here my husband's great ear candy molds for that sticking and then using the droppers transfer the candy mix to the candy molds take your time during this process spreading an even amount in each mold after 90 minutes in the fridge you can use will then pop right out of molds [Music] two events ticking you can apply a light amount of sugar and that is how you make canvas infused gummy bears if you mind that they do look like regular candies so keep them away from children enjoy [Music]", "9C2D6rp64Mw": "[Music] hey what's up guys we've got a really cool video for you today we're going to be making rosin infused gummies [Music] the recipe is simple all you'll need is a box of jello mct oil agave or corn syrup sunflower lecithin citric acid and gelatin first things first grab an eighth of some balm weed and go ahead and pack your bag bottle tech style we are going to be smashing on the nug smasher x so we're using nug smasher x 120 micron bags the x is a dream to operate one button extractions it doesn't get any easier than this [Music] [Music] [Music] we collected our rosin and we yielded a little less than a gram next we're going to heat our x-plates up to 240 degrees fahrenheit grab your d-carb capsule and throw your rosin in the rosin pot close up the d-carb capsule and put it between the plates for 20 minutes so we can activate our thc [Music] once our 20 minutes is up be very careful when releasing the plates a ton of pressure is built up in our decarb capsule proceed with caution when removing a decarb capsule from between the plates [Music] now that our rosin is ready to infuse we are going to add 10 milliliters of mct oil to our beaker [Music] add low heat to help the rosin infuse with the oil [Music] [Applause] [Music] now that our mct oil is infused we're going to add a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin and we're going to stir it until it fully dissolves into our mct oil [Music] once our oil is ready we'll set it aside so we can start making our gummies [Music] first things first we're going to add 1 3 cup of water to our beaker next let's add a quarter cup of agave to our water you can use corn syrup if you like we chose to use agave instead go ahead and turn on your magnetic stirrer next we're going to add a half packet of jello you can pick any flavor you like we decided to go with lemon [Music] add one packet of knox gelatin to our mix next we are going to add a quarter teaspoon of citric acid [Music] let the mixture stir for five minutes on low heat so that the gelatin can bloom and all of the mixture looks consistent and doesn't have any clumps [Music] and for the final step we save the best ingredient for last we're going to add our mct oil and let that infuse with our gummy mixture grab your gummy molds and spray them with cooking oil using a dropper carefully fill all your molds let them sit out for about 30 minutes and then place them in the fridge for another 30 minutes [Music] let your gummies aerate for 24 to 48 hours to achieve maximum gumminess this will also help with storage bon appetit your weed infused gummies are ready to eat thanks for watching and don't forget to keep calm and smash on nug smasher rosin made simple [Applause] [Music] you", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at

having a good day you know what I mean like I'm so sorry for my wheel being in the way but um here's the thing I can't do anything about it because I don't have my tripod my tripod broke I try to get a tripod the other day and they didn't have any for some reason so I'm guessing I need to either order one online or just somewhere else I don't know what to really do about it but right now you're just gonna have to kind of deal with this I couldn't move it but then I'm gonna be like up here to video so I don't know what you guys would prefer see I'm saying like I just don't have any like flat oh that kind of worked okay okay we're gonna roll with it anyway so today I'm doing a quick little review on an edible eye balm I love edibles I mean I love him but at the same time they're deadly to me they're strong girl I took a edible for 4/20 it was the la familia hot chocolate one I took the whole thing and that thing smacked so today I didn't really want like a chocolate or like a brownie I wanted something like more candy like so I got the Smokies edible and these are in the sour blueberry fruit shoes basically so it's a hundred milligrams there's two milligrams of CBD per not per actually the whole bag is I guess that's what it is now per serving it's 10 milligrams of THC so per gummy and then 2 milligrams of CBD in one little gummy so I'm not gonna do the whole thing and by the way you guys this review is going to be really really [ __ ] forward really honest I'm gonna tell you guys about the taste I haven't opened these or anything yet so I want to record like my reaction of like the taste that I get instead of like trying them and then coming back and then you know my thoughts would be kind of you know what I mean so yeah anyways these are vegan this is a vegan uh thing not all of them are weakened from this brand so if you are vegan and you know you stay away from Dairy and stuff so I'll definitely ask them which one is the vegan one because I know not all of them are vegan but I know that their dairy they're gluten-free all of them are gluten-free but not all of them are vegan so I just got this because of the flavor you know what I mean so I'm not vegan so it doesn't matter to me but it's a good thing that it is vegan so I don't mind it and I don't really care so yes so the ingredients on here is just sugar corn syrup pectin I don't know what that is but it is citrus acid natural and artificial flavoring FD&C blue one which is probably like the color of the candy soy let union I don't know and then cannabis extract so the weed basically you know so yeah the sugars in this is four grams I'm thinking yeah per piece it's four grams so if I'm gonna have three of them for 12 grams of sugar when you do the math it's kind of a lot so these are sour they're Fruit Chews had crafted gluten free vegan and so I watched a review on these and people said that only 40 will do the trick I'm gonna try 30 just because I want to see how I feel and if I don't feel it as much I'm so sorry about the [ __ ] Sun oh my god but if you don't feel it as much then I guess well if I don't feel it as much because you're not going to taking them I am but if you don't feel it as much then I'll take then I'll take another one pretty pretty much but I know how adipose are they sneak up on me I keep eating them like I eat them and then I keep eating them and then boom you know so these were $21.99 okay before attacks at my dispensary so I think with tags and all the little bag they charge me for because I've got to break minds it was like $25 so basically it's really easy to open I just rip this up hopefully it's easy to open it cuz I haven't even opened it yet already strong it's kind of like this there's like a little this in here and I'm guessing you pull that apart and they open up they smell like blueberry literally like [ __ ] they smell like powder aid okay you guys the blue powder right that's what they smell like I totally spot on that's what I'm getting and they look really cute and like flat and big oh they're soft they're like super gooey look at all that little sugar let me just you know I'm saying basically they're just coated in sugar they're sour they're pretty big I would say they're like as big as a [ __ ] let me see some money up in here so this is a quarter and then they're a little bit bigger than a quarter even so okay you guys so I'm gonna try one and I'm gonna see you in like a week [Music] mm-hmm gather my thoughts okay so I'll say this they taste really good they have they're sweet they are sweet you know I'm saying like I'm not really like a candy person but I like gummies and like sour stuff so I can make an exception but they're really good I had one of these they don't taste like we do know what I'm talking about you know when you take some edibles and they have that weird like nasty aftertaste of the weed you know you can you feel on the back your throat and all that I don't get it with these ones so I'm gonna take another one this is gonna be my number two you know I'm gonna take the three in front of you guys so you guys know what's real and I'll check back in with like in an hour and two I got some laundry to do so I'm gonna be a little bit busy and then they're just gonna hit me like a truck and I'm gonna be gone you know what I mean I don't know I hope so I hope these are strong they were saying these were strong so they better be so this is gonna be twenty you know what I'm saying these are really good you guys like even if they didn't have ween in it I would probably eat them they're kind of like okay they're like a sour patch kit all most like they kind of remember that but they're not as sour they're like they're like up from sourness it's like a good five it's it's the perfect amount it's honestly good with this week and see what I mean so I'm gonna eat one more you know I'm saying well you know we get lead tea today [Music] he was a [ __ ] fly in here anyways these are really good I wish they had like a pack where they had like all the little flavors that would be really dope like you know they had blueberry rhinos berry that would be mom like a little mixed assorted pack but yeah so I've had if I'm gonna have three out of like seven left so that's 70 grams seven milligrams so basically I'm ready to eat another one this is gonna be thirty and I will check back with you guys and an hour or I think on the back it tells you yeah wait two hours so I'm gonna wait two hours and I think he's gonna give me pretty lip but I don't know because I'm not smoking at the time maybe I will smoke a bowl but I'm not gonna like smoke because I feel like when you smoke weed and you take edibles it's both of them combined and it's just too much so I'm really trying to see how strong these are going to be just with 30 milligrams and if you guys the real tea on this you know I'm going to eat the last one and then I'm gonna go and go do my little [ __ ] wash my drawers and then I'll be back and then I'll tell you guys how they are so yep sure yeah of course chuckles you guys but I told you guys I did a little bun you know what I mean it's like a tank guys so it's like eight o'clock now I took those three edibles at 6:00 it was kind of like noise in there but anyways there's six it's been like two hours I smoked a bowl I'm not really feeling it all that much so I'm gonna wait until like 20 more minutes see if it kicks in and then if not I'll take another alignment so then I'm gonna give it the complete fill out two hours so you know it's good at all so we'll see but if not I'm gonna take one more or maybe two more to see if it's gonna hit me later but yeah that was 30 milligrams and it's been like an hour and 40 minutes I don't really feel anything but I'm gonna wait 20 more minutes because you know how they are they hit out of nowhere so I'll be back with you guys I'm kind of talking fast I'm not trying to but it's just a quick update you don't even a brief summary so I'll be back and I'll see you in a bit hey y'all so it's an update it's been I think a day or so two days I don't know when I recorded that video but basically I'm here to give my initial and final final thoughts you guys about that edible the was it the sour blue raspberry by Smokies the gummies the Fruit Chews to be exact you guys they were [ __ ] smacking okay when I had the 40 milligram that night oh my god was I gone was like on I kept [ __ ] eating I didn't really felt them like hitting me like instantly instantly but I felt like they really creeped up little by little and I also feel like it took a little bit longer for 40 milligrams to hit me it took like I would say to and I have hours and then I was just like Munchie [ __ ] madness you know I was eating anything I was just eating chips food I ate even after my dinner like have some snacks if you're gonna eat some edibles because trust you're gonna need up and then what's getting pulled in here okay and then I took 50 milligrams that I think the day after okay I took 50 milligrams and that actually hit me a little bit sooner I would say that one they fit me I don't know why maybe like maybe because the timing that I took them at I feel like the first time I took the 40 milligram I took it at like 4 to 5 so it was like kind of late afternoon already so you know it girl was tired she was doing her SH and she was tired but the second time when I took it I took it earlier in the day I took it out like 2 o'clock because I wanted to be like awake and [ __ ] at least enjoy my high you know so I took the 15 milligrams and on this sweet so I took him I took him I'm chillin literally I would say two hours later two hours and ten minutes later it hit me I was at Walmart I was grabbing some things and that [ __ ] hit me like a brick like oh my god I was literally in one of the aisles and I was just [ __ ] dying you guys and I know you guys don't really care because don't everybody feels that way but I was legit like [ __ ] dying like over nothing and I was just like the [ __ ] but I realized that okay the edible so I know decided it's my cool I left Walmart and then even when I was home after that my boyfriend looked at me and he was like you're [ __ ] what did you do like I guess I was that [ __ ] high guys but I was like I just knew what it was you know to me that I didn't feel like I looked that [ __ ] high but I guess to somebody that you know from their point of view they would get it but um yeah to me I was really [ __ ] high but still productive so I would recommend taking them on like a very like good day that you're not gonna do [ __ ] you're gonna be eating a lot you're on your own time definitely don't do it if you're gonna go into work or something like that it's noticeable if you're high you know what I mean it is for me so my eyes got a little they got sleepy they got a little low they got red so you know but you guys the edibles smack I totally recommend them I'm going to try other flavors you guys I'm gonna do more reviews on this monkey's fan because I think it's probably one of the good ones okay really good really good so I've been totally gonna recommend to you'll I haven't tried other flavors but I definitely like the sour blue raspberry because I'm a sour person so you know I like sour candy so they were really my cup of tea so if you guys are into that I definitely recommend these edibles so that is my review you guys I don't want to keep going on and on and on but the same thing basically I rate him a 10 the taste is a 9 out of 10 the potency is a 10 out of 10 because I was gone with 40 so that's good because you can literally take 40 40 and then maybe the other two before work because it's like okay they're not gonna hit you as hard at vicious 20 milligrams you know what not as me as hard but like so like 42 like 60 it's like the perfect range for me yours might be a little different so I don't know so be careful but your dosage and all that dogs barking so I'm just gonna go and yeah you guys have a good day I'll see you on my next one bye bye", "LpV7GEyzMsc": "all right what is going on people of earth my name is chilly dilly back at you with another chill ass video man and in today's video we're gonna be talking about does delta really get you high [Music] okay so i know i haven't really talked about delta e lately um i haven't really made a video over it uh just because you know sometimes i want to and sometimes i don't uh but i realize i've never made a video just me sitting down talking about do i actually get high from delta so i haven't smoked all day for the video so let's go ahead and get 30 likes on this video and we will make a cake cart review okay so the cake cart has actually been like really popping for delta 8. um a lot of people have liked it so i went ahead just bought one they didn't send me any so i went ahead and bought one with my own money so if i don't like if i don't get high i'm out and you just learned a valuable lesson through me okay so yeah anyway man so yeah 30 likes and we will do a cake review uh so i've tried like a lot of delta cards and edibles now at this point um delta companies out there if you're seeing this if you want to hit me up man send me some of your bud the concentrates i've yet to try those i would love to try those man um but i haven't found a company to work with that i really like so we're gonna go ahead open this okay so this i literally haven't smoked all day and this is a first review so i'm pretty pumped for it honestly i'm not gonna review it necessarily i will tell you like what i think about it how i feel about it uh or what i think like the taste is let's see gotta pop like five things open just to even get to it so that's cool but yeah i've heard a lot of good things about the cake parts um they're disposable this is what it looks like this is actually pretty nice looking i mean it's pretty sleek i love disposable stuff like i'm a sucker for disposable pins to be honest with you um so yeah let's go ahead we're just going to hit this a bunch hot box the whip and see if i get high as [ __ ] okay like i said i haven't smoked all day so i should feel effects pretty quick uh as long as it does get me high now i've tried different ones like edibles have made me high and some of the pins made me high whereas i took the deltae pills if you haven't seen that video and it did not make me high at all by the way we got lemon kush it's an indica so i'm trying to be in the couch because i got the night off don't uh worry about this i got it at work all right so we're gonna take a couple hits um yeah give you your give you my first impressions and see if i actually get high maybe we can take a blinker i don't know if it allows us to take a blinker but uh cheers boys [Music] okay it definitely tastes kind of like lemon one thing i will always say delta makes me cough like a [ __ ] so if you haven't seen any of my delta videos before definitely go watch them um getting high on delta is definitely a person-to-person kind of thing okay so don't come to this video expecting me to be like oh i got so high like regular weed because i don't think that's gonna happen that's really never happened um and i'm not really a big fan of carts anymore to be honest i've kind of stopped you know hitting carts or whatever anyway though and also for people that like comment and [ __ ] like oh i took this many milligrams will i be okay we don't know i don't know i'm not a doctor i'm not a scientist you'll be fine you'll be fine at the end of the day regardless uh so that first hit was pretty tasty honestly kind of like packed a punch my chest is a little heavy uh or felt like somebody just like hit my chest really um we're gonna take a pretty big hit now honestly bro cheers boys [Music] oh [ __ ] that was a big hit all right so i've two hits i'm already like my mind is a little at ease my body is a little relaxed i would definitely say that i'm not like big hot obviously if i took two of those hits off of a like a wax pen like a real dab pen i think i'd be pretty [ __ ] high but i will say that my body is really relaxed my eyes are kind of getting heavy right now i will say so far that this is living up to its height to be honest with you because these are better than other cars i've tried we might just get high off this man let me know what you guys are smoking a lot dabbing along eating long or eating on i guess um let me know if you guys are using deltae pens delta bud uh like i said i've never tried the bud would love to try it man i'm more of a bud person i love the ritual of rolling up smoking all that [ __ ] i've i've even seen that they have moon rocks now so like that's so cool anyway let's go ahead and take a third hit off this man let's try to get a big hit i mean i want to try to take a blinker but cheers boys all right boys we just took a massive hit i just had like a five minute coughing spree i thought i was gonna die not die but puke i forgot how heavy delta could be on the [ __ ] lungs bro i forgot how much it makes me cough it's been a couple weeks really since i've smoked any dull tape i gotta say though these three big hits boys i'm pretty high like i'm gonna be real with you i actually haven't been this high on any delta a cart so [ __ ] 30 likes man we'll do a review on this i think you could probably get your money's worth out of this to be real hey cake if you see this definitely hit me up man this is good all right bro three hits i'm high i'm pretty high man i think i'm gonna go in there still and smoke like a blunt to get the the full mind effects the psychoactive effect sometimes that i love so much um we're gonna take a couple more hits man we're just gonna dip out i'm high delta definitely got me high it's gotten me high before so don't always let tell people don't always let people tell you that it can't um like i said and i've said multiple times it does go person to person so i will say that this got me high man so let's take another hit let's bounce out of here 30 likes and we will do a cake review man make sure you do like comment subscribe all that good youtube [ __ ] man uh i don't get paid to do this so if you just you know do your part and you like the video man and you watch it youtube pushes it and we get to go up in the world and i get to finally tell my parents i did something with my life cheers boys yeah i'm not taking another humongous hit man that hit just wrecked my lungs like i just coughed for like 10 minutes straight i thought i was gonna puke i was coughing so much oh dude that was terrible though that [ __ ] got me high i'm not even gonna i'm not even gonna lie boys like i would not lie to you about this like i'm a little [ __ ] hot you can kind of see it in my eyes like i know my eyes look pretty [ __ ] but like that's just because i was coughing a lot all right let's take another hit and let's do it man i'm honestly i'm super pumped that i did this video this actually turned out really good i didn't have super high hopes for it it looks kind of like a jewel kind of i don't know i like it though anyway less hit let's kind of make it a kind of big one i don't know i really don't want to die but we'll see it's for the content all right man all right boys that's it man delta got me high i think it could definitely get you high and i think beyond getting just high it would help with uh you know the anxiety and [ __ ] that delta 9 can give some people so i definitely think this uh should be for a lot of people i think a lot of people should try this [ __ ] uh yeah anyway just happy to live in a world where you know this is partly illegal and cannabis is becoming more legal so yeah much loved you guys see you guys in the next video remember 30 likes a review over the cake cart itself yeah i will see you guys in the next video peace", "YmpPGpPUw0Q": "[Music] hi guys welcome to Diamond delight edibles if this is the first time you're joining my name is Liz and all-you-can regular guys welcome back thank you so much for your support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again for your support and let's get to the 50,000 whoo all right so you have an awesome rest of your day and thanks again for watching [Music]", "nGmzI-9S1GI": "how many milligrams do you eat bro the helmet what's up stoners cubans here and on today's video we are going to try some florida edibles edibles are a little bit newer in florida they've only been selling them for about the last year maybe a little less coffee's ready [Music] it's not even the best way to use tincture i'm just having fun oh there it is yeah i see it all just becomes one big drop at the end if you just let it sit and i'm gonna hit this while you hit that like and subscribe button and turn on notifications for future videos every time i pack a dry pipe i put way too much weed in it and i feel like i have to smoke the whole thing let's go [Music] oh yeah ice water from the dry pipe let's do it so here's some of the edibles that we actually got it's mostly like a hundred milligrams for the whole bar or bag of gummies or pack of cookies so they end up being about 10 milligrams per piece i think all of them except these nano gummies here those are like five milligrams per piece but i had 20 gummies in it and then you can see i've got some capsules here these are 50 milligrams so one of these equals five of any of the other pieces essentially that's why capsules are my favorite edible i'd rather just take a bunch of thc and then eat whatever i want later how do you think gordon ramsay would rate my plating do we kill it so like i said the capsules are my favorite because most of the edibles i got are like 100 milligrams for the whole candy bar the whole pack of gummies but two of these is 100 milligrams so this is most edibles right here so capsules are my preferred way to take it i'd rather get high and then eat cookies and brownies and not try to get high from eating the cookies and brownies i don't know high enough from edibles is usually i'm going to sleep i don't love edibles they don't hate everybody the same way like i mentioned 100 milligrams isn't gonna do the same to everybody a thousand isn't gonna do the same to everybody i've eaten as much as two thousand milligrams i have an edible mukbang video on my channel it's a pretty good brownie it's like little brownie bites little cookie bites that's pretty good it's kind of crispy i think i'm going to get a bunch of these and fill them up and eat them like like the cookie crisp cereal i'll be dope so nothing too it's just a lot of eating i mean i like eating but but damn this is expensive food they have a few of the better brands that are in other other states i got some wanna here i've had these in colorado like some of the better gummies in colorado the chocolate's really good see i'd rather eat this still only 100 milligrams for a whole candy bar sometimes i can eat a couple hundred milligrams of edibles and not really feel it so so being a couple pieces of chocolate a piece of brownie a piece of cookie that's only 40 milligrams and these are 50 each so let's do another 100 right here oh yeah see that's a good one i think i want to continue this outside so let's go over there all right let's see these wanna gummies are as good as i remember they have a good flavor but they're like they're kind of spongy i don't know how to explain it i said the consistency is a little different than a typical gummy but i like it i'll show you some nano gummies i think these ones are sugar-free okay not bad some people prefer to be able to taste the edibles when they're eating some people do not want to taste the edibles what do you guys think drop a comment let me know do you prefer to be able to taste a little bit of wheat in there do you not like it at all i mean tasting i guess reminds you eating an edible but you should already know what you're eating it's not great on flavor but it's it's medical marijuana it's medicine it doesn't need to taste amazing but it helps i don't know if these are the true gels or the vince ones but let's eat these pineapple ones from truly see these ones are really good but the consistency though a lot stickier than the other ones they're not as chewy as the other ones they're more like just like really sticky so i kind of get all in your mouth as my grandpa would say but i don't know where we're at on milligrams but i'm going to take another 100 i think this will put me at at least 300 maybe we're at close to four with all the pieces we've eaten all right we're almost at 400 milligrams let's see if we can get the 420 just like i don't want to eat all this right now i had some chinese food earlier today some fried rice you know i'm just gonna chew on all the gummies together gotta [Music] not gross but no they're gross i'm just gonna be chewing forever and that's how edibles work for me i have no idea how many milligrams i've eaten but i'm not worried at all because it's not going to be enough it's not good i said the three flavors of gummies were all battling it out of my mouth but that caroleep nano got me a [ __ ] one am i gonna eat this whole plate [Music] i guess um see the chocolate bar topped here chocolate bars are always primo it makes me wonder are chocolate bars the easiest thing to make like like we just take weed out of the equation and we're making stuff what's easier to make cookies brownies gummies chocolate bars i'm thinking with the chocolate bar they just melt chocolate mix the weed in it and then they just they get it cold in the shape my mom just told me we just spoke for like 10 minutes on the phone i forgot what i was doing um what was i saying guys somebody could somebody help me what was i saying i think we were just finishing these edibles i think i was trying i think chocolate bars are probably the easiest to make i feel like anywhere i've been to get edibles the chocolate bars always taste the best right my mama [ __ ] they're just like cookies and brownies we're both dry oh man that's a lot of edibles let's give me any more [ __ ] get another 100 down there we go here we go i think the wanna gummies my favorite although the truly ones are pretty close second they're just like different consistencies of gummy i think i'm more in the mood for the wanna ones now um if they all fit together there's only [Music] one how many milligrams do you eat bro we went for a nice long walk earlier but i might do another one i mean just look at him would you just look at him [Music] did you just look [Music] i feel so safe there's a kitty in here should we smoke a song before the doubles are kicking [Music] all right we're still waiting one thing about edibles i don't like i like taking a [ __ ] fatty bong rip and then my high is just like i'm like as high as i'm gonna be almost right after sometimes you know i'm gonna kind of take this off from there and like i said for me like edibles sometimes hit or miss sometimes i i'll eat a few hundred milligrams and just not feel it there's definitely a fun thing about edibles i couldn't do edibles every day i wouldn't enjoy wheat as much i don't think if i could only do edibles i mean maybe i'd figure it out but for me it's like either i think i didn't get high from it or i'm like i know i'm high from it and i'm just really sleepy i do like a 2 000 milligram edible mustang in one of my videos but i've got higher from other things when i smoked an eighth of weed in nine minutes i got higher than when i ate two grams of thc edibles basically and i think about this sometimes they ate the wheat has way less thc than 2 000 milligrams so it's like i've got higher from smoking flour than i have from eating edibles now mind you the edibles do last longer it is a different kind of powder but i'm just talking about me in my head sitting there and going oh you're high maybe i'm higher than i think i am i've been rambling sitting in this position for four minutes and i have no idea why so maybe i'm higher than i think i am maybe that's what it is maybe edibles hit like an hour ago you know i'm just like higher than i think i have also i did just rip that bomb and that's a good question man and like tinctures i mean this isn't really inedible but it's still in the i'm not smoking category so this is pretty good for some people i think i like this better than edibles but even more so than this i like a tac drink you get something that's really nicely infused and you just drink it it takes effect so much quicker than an edible i eat snacks and junk food all the time but i mostly drink water so when i reward myself with like a juice drink that has thc in it it's like out of the ordinary from what i normally drink and then also it gets me hot so kind of like a cold thing i don't know i'm not kind of on my pump that's not what it's a walmart how long are we i don't know it doesn't say on this i was just like is it 10 seconds is it a minute i can't even remember it doesn't matter [Music] the squares on that break apart easier than any candy bar i don't know how to tell you anytime i've ever tried to snap a hershey's it like snaps crooked right through the middle of one of me bro it's segmented how's this happening this is about amount perfectly there's so much chocolate how you [ __ ] up chocolate you're dome oh i kind of did a thing i mean it's just not as bright it still exists but let's get high about it [Music] oh these are just some of my uh adult gummies they have a medicine in them you wouldn't like them you wouldn't be interested how many milligrams [Music] like 10 each uh what they're not for you they're not for you because they're too weak damn [ __ ] kids man well if you like this video don't forget to subscribe to the channel for more content and check out

you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight edibles wish i could get that straight um thank you for joining diamond delight edibles it's been a pleasure have a wonderful day [Music] you", "zYgVCXcyrcI": "hi welcome to dive into light edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and to the regular subscribers thank you so much and welcome back new subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching you have a great so that's my little tutorial there on a regular gummies and sugar sour coated gummies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll get back to you as soon as they can I do apologize I do sometimes have a bit of a delay there I don't mean to but some life takes over sometimes but I do try to get back to everybody as I can and then here's our little of my little lemon and I did lemonade and or sorry kind of turned out like lemonade so there lemon and raspberry and these are there were little little puppies aren't they cute well good luck with your candy making and I'd love to hear how your how yours turned out and if you have any questions about the inverted sugar let me know and I hope you have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching and if you're new here and you like the video I really do hope you subscribe take care have a wonderful awesome day [Music]", "LZJbqRUlzRA": "[Music] uh what's up guys welcome back today we're going to do a little experiment with gummy worms and tincture so i just bought some like these are from walmart just walmart brand gummy bears or gummy worms this should work the same for gummy worms gummy bears um anything with this type of gummy texture um so we're gonna do an experiment and we're gonna soak them in tincture i don't know how long it's gonna take i don't know if it's gonna be like a few hours that we're gonna need in there or 24 hours but we're going to see how that's going to turn out all you're going to need is some gummy bears or gummy worms and some alcohol-based tincture [Music] so here i just have some gummy worms like i said they're just the walmart brand i have my tincture and then a little container that we're going to put our gummy worms into now i'll just line up the gummies trying not to overlap them too much and then i'm going to pour my tincture over them just enough tincture to cover them all or at least the most of them and then whatever tincture isn't absorbed you can just pour back into a jar and use it as you would have previously so as you guys just saw i pretty much just pour tincture over these gummy worms i did add one or two more because i was taking a thumbnail for it but that's how they look we're going to leave them uncovered and we're not going to put them in the fridge we're just going to leave them open on the counter and then i am going to check back in when i feel like these are ready so we'll see how long that's going to take and we'll see if they work out hi guys so it's been about 24 hours a little bit under and here is what the gummies look like so they don't look that much different so far but it's kind of hard to tell they might be swollen a little bit um but yeah so i'm just taking these out and i'm gonna set them out to dry and then once they're mostly dry but not completely dry we're going to cover them with some sugar of course that's optional it just because extra sugar is nice and then plus the sugar on the outside will help with that tincture flavor like as soon as your tongue touches the gummy now that they've dried so they're pretty much completely dry except for a little bit of stickiness i'm gonna cover them in sugar so i just have a little container with just plain sugar you can add citric acid if you want but if you use citric acid just please use a small small amount like one quarter teaspoon for like one cup of sugar type of thing because too much citric acid will draw out the moisture and then they'll get wet and they'll never dry so yeah so i'm just shaking those and it's kind of weird how um they're coming out not completely coated in sugar or at least that um orange one did but then this one here is only like parts of it picked up on the sugar so i'm not sure what's going on there um but here is how you want them to be sticky wise so if you put your finger on it it like kind of sticks but you can pull it off pretty easily still and that's a good consistency for it to be when you're adding sugar to it um but yeah so some of these the sugar attached properly and then some of them they didn't and i'll show you guys how we can fix that though it's not exactly the most efficient way but i mean you got to do what you got to do when you're playing around with these things i'm thinking for those spots that aren't filled with sugar i'm just going to use like a regular paintbrush i think this is just from the dollar store whatever it doesn't matter um and then i'm going to dip it into the tincture which i should have got a separate container for my tincture so the sugar wasn't going back and forth but um and then i'm just going to lightly wipe it on the areas of the gummy that didn't get any sugar attached to it and not too much you just want like a light light coat and then i just put it back into the container of sugar and shake it up and then take it out and leave it to dry and it came out very well it was all covered it just would be time consuming to have to do this for each gummy [Music] and i'm going to try one of the gummies that we're soaking so far they don't look like they've soaked up that much like they don't look much bigger than how they looked before so just doing a comparison here the ones on the parchment paper are the ones that were soaking and then this one my hand was not soaking so for size difference it looks like the soaked one may be like a millimeter bigger but i don't i don't know it doesn't really seem like it um and then with this one over here um which one is bigger the soaked one definitely looks bigger for sure but also looks skinnier and the other one looks wider so it's hard to tell i'm not sure if the gummy bears maybe just aren't all consistent or sorry the worms okay and then for this one the one on the bottom there is the not soaked one and it's significantly bigger than the soaked one so that leads me to think that the gummy worms are just kind of have some variance in size and that they didn't look like they've gotten bigger and expanded or absorbed anything so let's let's try and see how it tastes and see if we can taste the tincture you can definitely taste like the strong tincture on it right away i kind of got like weird texture on it it's like from i don't know if it's just the brand of dining rooms that i use but like kinda like slimy i don't like that well i don't not like the gummy worm i just don't like the slime it's kind of like a weird texture so far like but i don't know i feel like that you're i can only taste the tincture on the outside i don't feel like it actually soaked up anything so i'm gonna try it rinsing one off and like washing wiping it down really good with some water so that if the if it is just tincture on the outside then we'll be able to find out because if i rinse off water it should still taste like tincture on the inside right so i'm gonna go do that and i'll be right back and we'll try and see how that tastes okay so here's the gummy i just rinsed very well i taste exactly like the original gummy worm did so it does i have no taste of tincture in it at all which is proving that it didn't soak it up which is really weird because if gummies soak up alcohol to make alcoholic gummies why wouldn't it soak up tincture so i'm very shocked and i'm like wondering if i did something wrong like why didn't they soak it up i wonder if it was the brand should i try this same thing on a variety of different brands of gummies like buy a bunch of different brands of gummy bears and see which one soaks up the most would you guys be interested in me doing a video like that but yeah since um essentially they didn't soak up anything it's kind of a waste so i think a better way to be going about it is to just put some tincture on them like put them in a container and mix it up or something and then set them out to dry a little bit and then cover them with sugar i'll try that and we'll see how that works as well so here we're just gonna place some fresh gummy worms into a jar of tincture then we're just gonna close the lid and shake it up so that they all get covered in the tincture and then we will take them all out with a fork trying to be careful not to waste too much tincture um from holding them from the jar to the drying area so just kind of shake them off a little bit so there's not too much dripping and then just leave them to dry until they're just slightly sticky and depending on how much airflow you have it can take anywhere between 20 minutes to a couple of hours so once they're not wet anymore and they're just a little bit sticky you can put them in sugar you don't have to but it's nice so that you're not having that direct tincture on your tongue so i'm just shaking these up and then i'm gonna put them back out to dry but these were not dry enough when i did this so you guys are gonna see what happens so i could tell immediately as soon as i opened it you see how the sugar is almost like chunky on there i don't know if you can really see it but um so it chunks up in i kind of shook it off there but you can still see it's like the sugar crystals gather together so that's what happens when there's too much moisture and these are not going to dry so yeah they're nice and chunky um even i can try leaving them out but they probably will very likely not dry they'll just keep pulling out moisture so you guys can see this is what the sugar looks like because now it's been contaminated with moisture i guess you could say so you can see it clumped up immediately just from that little bit too much of moisture and i'm gonna get some regular sugar so you guys can see a side by side of what it should look like so there's a regular granulated sugar and then i'm gonna pour the one that had a little bit of moisture in it and you can see those clumps that it's made and how it has a less fine of the texture so just when you're making your gummies make sure that before you put your sugar on they're fully dry because this is a very common thing people their gummies get all like wet and moist and it's because your gummy was too wet when you coated it in the sugar so here's one of the gummies that was coated when it wasn't wet and just only slightly sticky and you can see the sugar looks perfect there's no wetness and it's not clumpy and then if we pull up one of the ones we just did where it was too wet you can see the sugar is starting to pull out the moisture and the whole thing is getting that wet look and i'm just gonna continue to keep doing this um in this case i'm just going to eat them like that because they're not really salvageable because rinsing them off will remove the tincture that we dip them in so you want them to be just sticky like this so they're not wet at all just only a slight stickiness we're not going to use that sugar that's been contaminated with the moisture because it's going to not give us nicer so i'm just dipping these little sticky ones into a dish of fresh sugar and then again leave them out to dry and it'll probably need about 24 hours to fully dry before you package them up overall i think the best method for trying to infuse store-bought candies is using my sour patch method um i'll post a link for it in the description box and i'll try and post one on the video as well um but yeah check this out this is a lot easier they're gonna be a lot stronger it's just an all-around better option the only difference is that you definitely need a candy that already has a sugar coating on it thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you guys enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe i hope you have a wonderful day", "cHz4xTYET24": "howdy howdy there beautiful people guys are all having a amazing start to your day night whatever the hell you're watching this hope it's going great for you we've got a little video here I haven't really done many of these but a lot of other cannabis content creators do these videos and I think a lot of people enjoy it we've got some strain reviews coming up today and of course we're starting with the hottest hash on the alerting rec market happy cabbage farms so happy cabbage farms they came into camp in probably about four months ago I don't know exactly when they came on to the Oregon rec market but at the time it was a pretty Minzy era in the Oregon rec market here in Benton there was just a lot of the companies have really slipped towards the end of the summer and a lot of their stuff really wasn't tasting as good as it was towards the beginning of the summer then comes heavy cabbage farms with hash robison and we don't see hot rods in a lot in the rec market because it's such an expensive and kind of niche product there's not very many people that are searching to pay a lot of money for hash rasam but when you [ __ ] try this hash frozen you're just sucked right on back in guys it is ridiculous this stuff I will tell you I have tried tons of hot rods and a lot of the times I'm going to say that's my favorite hat rosin because I don't get to try it very often happy cabbage now has been around for about four months and they are a group in our circle it's just been around I've gotten to dab it a lot and I've gotten to dab a lot of other hash rosin because I don't have to pay for it other people have it and I will tell you guys there's a couple strands that I have not liked from them but these four right here that I have are so titties I would stick my face between all of them and motorboat myself to death this is hands-down the best half rosin I have ever smoked and it's on the wreck more kit if you are over 21 you can buy this you don't have to [ __ ] buy it black market you don't have to pay the $120 for black market six star hash rosin it gets it cannot expensive for a while there guys so to see a company coming out with stuff that's between sixty and seventy five dollars and medic maybe even cheaper than that that's super impressive and just such a breath of refreshing air so this guy I've got open right here first thing when I open it this is the purple starburst og six star like just what in there is just a bad thing to say let's take a look at what we going got going on in this jar alrighty here we have the purple starburst og 6 star you guys can see it's nice and flaky there's no real huge clumps partly because I dabbed a lot of them partly because it is 6 star and it is just gorgeous look at that color sorry for the shaking I'm filming on my phone they check that out just absolutely gorgeous I am completely enthralled with the look of this rosin I'm enthralled with the look as well as the smell a second you open up this up you get hit in the face with the real ocean groan oh gee smell and it's been a long time since we've gotten that we're getting more chem more gassy oh geez out here this is real ocean groan oh gee and then on the end of it is like this almost faint hint of like purple lavender not in a floral way at all but in a very very gassy way like I can't even begin to explain this we're gonna go ahead and take it yeah we got two rigs out today we first we're gonna start out with the prophecy glass and get a little function shot and I'll shop for you guys we don't have the cleanest rigs or bangers today just kind of caught me on an off cleaning day but maybe we should still be able to see that function right we're gonna start off with the purple starburst it guys this stuff is absolutely amazing I cannot tell you how much I recommend going and trying just the strain right here all of happy cabbage farm is fantastic this strain right here hands down my favorite let's go ahead and get her heat it up and get into some freakin turf skies I am excitement for this video you can not believe how hard it is to have four jars of happy cabbage sitting in a drawer knowing you can't smoke it because you have to come with it it's literally heartbreaking I also want to give them a huge shout out for sponsoring the 420 of it at the Pacific Circle that was absolutely amazing they set up a tab bar anybody that came by could have their stuff a company that produces this high a product of this high quality of product just allow anybody to come up and smoke it no no [ __ ] questions asked is just amazing huge shout out to them for that call that good set a timer for 45 seconds alright we're gonna go ahead get in here and scoop ourselves out a nice flaky dab of this gorgeous six star here we go guys first dab of the half cab farms Cheers [Music] oh good lordy that is so delicious straight to the head immediately my whole head warm fuzzy dice feels delicious but you just know media we have strongest it because it hits you momentarily after you take it down man is a good video to be filming guys yeah I also got to say this is mind-bending how good that flavor is and how much flavor there is usually with a lot of even really good tasting dabs only a small percentage of flavor this there is a large percentage of flavor in that [ __ ] strain it is amazing how much you get out of it I love it for our first thing to have in the morning like if you got one dab to set your whole day straight that's it right there that purple starburst og alright move on to the next string I believe this one was a collab width Oh pull on a stick and throw it into my house I rip the [ __ ] alright I threw the Box away in the heavy collab on it [ __ ] oh no without gaps in garden Gadsden Gardens okay this one is a collab with Gadsden garden and this is Tropicana punch now this one has a much much different look to it let me give you guys an initial smell test it was like pomegranate and man what is that that is a good [ __ ] smell right there it was like pomegranate and fish I'm not like just weed but the actual cush like when you're exhaling a cush strain it smells like that oh man that's delicious now this one has a much different look to it way more waxy was this one what was this one called no just Tropicana punch hash rosin not six-star not their batter or their jam just hash shots but still absolutely delicious looking kind of looks like peanut butter and this was not what I do what it looked like when they gave it to me when it was cold it was much much more pretty and hadn't like waxed up into this solid state yet still [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna switch it up we've got the DBE 503 slimeball rig all ready to go over here a dab of this junk ambush I believe this is the one that gave me a job on the night of 4/20 and I was just absolutely mind blown by how good the flavor of it was so much rudiness to it but still keeping a really nice base in the OG gas cushy that kind of a chem that kind of a taste so I'm keeping it sweet waste in there but still having some food on top I'm a big fan of fruity strains but when I have to smoke all day every day it's not my favorite I really really want the Kim gasps og scum push stuff like that all right that's all set a timer 45 seconds that's not that's not the right dance isn't it there was a dude I'm just gonna stop him all right if vijaya tease this one's a lot easier to load up I'm just gonna take this a nice big chunk here boom I am gonna be so blitzed by the end of this guy's four dabs of hatch rosin and that I haven't gotten into this yet but I'm sure you guys read the title we're taking out Widowmaker at the end but yeah let's do it [ __ ] drop the dead Cheers [Music] [Music] get right with that safe before really really fruity but it keeps its [ __ ] feet planted firmly in a nice little og tastes good very clean - I mean like of course there's no solvents in it but a lot of other people's half-frozen I get a a wheezing in my lungs and that's usually the reason I stay away from hats Rossum as you guys can hear [Music] there is some coffee but there's no wheeze and that is what I love about this stuff it just seems so clean so pure you're tasting exactly what this amazing weed was meant to taste like guys we're going nips out go the [ __ ] nips out Jesus Christ two tabs of hash rosin in we've got the purple starburst and oh wait no the Tropicana punch and the purple starburst yeah okay yes yes boom so we've got punch breath up next this is their jam and this one unfortunately has slowly disintegrated in a series of very unfortunate dabs that were completely unavoidable but I think a little bit left so we have something for this video right here I'm gonna zoom the camera in so you guys can see it's really really clear and very very light in color but it is so ganbei good I can't even begin to tell you guys how many Terps they've got packed into that gorgeous little [ __ ] doing GM glove there when you get in this one it immediately has like a purple smell I use that to describe a lot away I don't know what the purple smell is I don't know what I'm describing there I'm sure there's some people out there that are gonna be like yeah and there's some people are gonna be like what the [ __ ] he's that high already but it does it smells purple purple with a hint of fruit punch on the end that's exactly what I'm getting clenched breath and it's really really cool how true their flavors are guys like you can't even begin to tell you how many other hot rods and strings like taste we're like this one's strong in and you taste it that's great it's amazing how many people just they'll name their strains anything just because that's what's hype that's what's selling right now these guys they've just got some fire a sweet in fire ass hash on the way out switching it back up again to the prophecy glass for our punch breath dab here I'm gonna go ahead and heat this up man guys given that Widowmaker at the end it's gonna be so brutal I have already baked like a cupcake my gourd is gone stone to the bone I just [ __ ] rent I think you guys a good idea of how ripped I am I've taken two gaps and I already am starving I don't feel like I need a turf map two naps like I thank you I'm taking seven gram damage guys this we just took like maybe point one maybe and I'm already ready for a turf down at the end of this I'm going to pass out right here after I've ordered new greens call it good BAM wham Shazam set timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla alright let's go ahead scrape ourselves out some of this leaving just enough left to put into our Widowmaker jab guys we got we got some crazy stuff going with a maker jab this punch breath was definitely one of my favorites it was a lighter high than the six star starburst og but had just about the same percentage of flavor it's fan-fucking-tastic really allowed me to go about my day if I was smoking it in the morning before say a meeting or something it would be really good for that not if you were gonna go out and want a dad that was gonna last you three to four hours that would be the purple starburst six star that stuff is just [ __ ] tits it is so strong BAM Thank You Carla let's take this damn choose people it's tons tons and tons of flavor [Music] [Music] now we got the sweats going big time holy Jebus how is it is hot in here oh my god keeping you close holy [ __ ] this was a good fight hey promised the Widowmaker again oh [ __ ] turf sweats aren't [ __ ] real oh my god whoa next up we got some margarita punch six star don't let the nips cool off for a second here wow that overheated a needle is in the red Oh rubbie oh my god I completely forgot we have water over here not sponsored by but shout out the can event for carrying the happy cabbage four guys are in Central Oregon looking for a place to pick this stuff up get a man got it they got so many different strains oh yes we got one left guys we've got the margarita place six star same with the starburst og let's go ahead and take peak here in this jar very very flaky but it is all stuck together none of it is gonna fall out I don't believe ya all stuck in there when I first got it was flaky like if you sneezed it would go everywhere like a pile of blow it was pretty [ __ ] flaky oh man oh man this one probably actually I'm gonna have to take my my vote back for the smell this one has better smell than the purple starburst dojin form starburst oh gee I do believe tastes better but god damn margarita punch they're definitely a hint of that tropic punch in there but there is a kick what is that kick gasps that is straight gasp oh man yeah once you get past that punch just gassy oh that is good it doesn't have the og smell of the purple starburst I mean it is just Tropicana punch instead of deep purple starburst OG um but it does have a massive undertone of some gassy flavors go ahead keep the slime ball ring up last one and probably take a little two-minute walk around the house and then we're gonna dive into that way a but nothing's more currently done I am so big guy so I can feel my hind legs coming down [ __ ] just set a timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla thank you very much I can feel my eyelids coming down like heavy hard it is I'm gonna be in for a real long afternoon here we got a photo we got the Gus glass show circle tonight [ __ ] I'm gonna be licking windows all night long guys so yeah super flaky super super potent smell let's get some [ __ ] taste in here oh yes oh yes wants to scrape it all off the bottom it is super flaky again yep all right we got a margarita punch six star and hash browns and over here I bring a ball right up in clothes for you guys kitchens function off the first initial hit oh my god I need a new cord after this video it's not even baked out of it it's just oh [ __ ] cheers everyone a lot more gas when you smoke it less of the push flavor than the go wow they're really not my favorite in terms of flavor definitely not bad whatsoever it's still delicious I'm probably ranked this number three the Tropicana punch probably be my least favorite out of the four but honestly I would buy all four strains again thanks they say that they're that good all scraped up on a piece of paper see if we can get it um damn er and then we will take a lap mop it off a bit and take this [ __ ] Widowmaker all those cobbles alright we got our four grams right here I have completely forgotten which one goes to which cap so that will be interesting we're just going to go ahead and see if we can take this damper here and get some of each of these on here it's not going to be a monster dabbe but I mean big enough for some fun boom there's our starting scoop of the punch breath now this is this is the margarita punch now this is gonna be a little difficult this stuff is so flaky I'm not quite sure we might have to get like a spoon for this so I'm gonna just take some of this and yeah there's no way it's gonna stick on there take that off and then last but not least we need the what what was this I forget [ __ ] I think I've lost more oil in here than I got out definitely alright well there's that there's what I've got and there's also some on this damper too this stuff has all different consistencies let me see if I can't like splurge some of this long as dabber just smush it all together that's kind of working I'd say that's working pretty damn good alright let's look at our dab here guys oh [ __ ] yeah oh Jesus

ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that tastes so freakin good I already look at the depths what's already coming in that was the perfect dab I kid you not watch this I love waiting all right the reason I love waiting that much time it's because you just get the smoothest hits the milk is hits and then the Terps now I'm tick I'm talking about I can taste everything in this I can taste everything man it's phenomenal and after you're done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button and reach so let's try to get 400 K subs I mean 40 K subs boys that's the next call right and you guys are gonna help me do that guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day and we're out", "efC57bwzEg4": "hey everybody um i'm gonna be reviewing these dialed in gummies from leafa i went to their dispensary today and they've got the most [ __ ] awesome dispensary man um i actually got a gram of this green dot labs uh black cherry og butter from them and uh it was only only uh 18 too man in green dot it usually goes um more along the lines of uh 30 40 dollar grams but uh they have green dot for really cheap so if you got a medical card you can get it for for 18 plus tax a gram it's black cherry og and it does have a black cherry smell to it man i can't wait to dab some of this stuff in a little bit um let's review these doubting gummies and i'll be honest with you guys i went ahead and opened them to check them out i haven't eaten one yet uh but down here if you'll notice uh i don't know if you can see that but uh the um the thc they put in here is cannabis risin extracted from ice water hash so i mean this is a saliva edible um i just ate a [ __ ] brownie like an hour ago i don't know if y'all saw my video from that but uh i'm already starting to feel pretty [ __ ] high and you know me i got a i got a pretty high tolerance to edibles sometimes they don't even really get me that high i think i'm uh lacking this uh compound in my liver that they say like 10 of the population has that edibles they just don't do you like they do everybody else like me i get a really heavy body high but people talk about like [ __ ] tripping almost off the edibles like my my cousin for example man he gets [ __ ] so high off of just one of those 50 milligrams man he if he ate a couple hundred milligrams he'd probably be hallucinating uh z you know you know you uh uh [ __ ] i don't know man i'm just mumbling i'm a little [ __ ] up already you guys gotta excuse me but i think these are going to be really [ __ ] good and you know what else is kind of cool i picked up they have the stickers for them they have these just for free laying out and it's actually the sticker they put on here they had those at the dispensary um now what i thought's really cool about these they make an actual numbered batch uh these medical uh batch number and then these are batch seven and it actually has the strain up here of papaya cake and puntain pie and they only make 420 of this particular strain and it looks like i got number 158 of 420 so you see that it's kind of cool it lets you know it's a real small batch operation um probably a lot of care goes into these gummies now it's a really cool little tin way you open this is you just twist your palms in opposite directions and it screws right up i thought these gummies were were pretty cool looking right here where they got them placed in which one should we try first let's go with the green one first what do you guys think got a nice green one right here thc label it's 50 milligrams you have a pretty happy good gummy only thing i like is it got a lot of sugar in it i make sure back your teeth hurt a little bit there's mmm and it's got the hashy after flavor i love that man if you don't [ __ ] want to know you're eating weed go get some [ __ ] wanna gummies they taste like [ __ ] sour gummies you buy at the gas station but if you want to know you're eating a little something have a little bit of a cannabis flavor because i mean he doesn't [ __ ] like the hashy flavor of cannabis is great [ __ ] buy these gummies these are the hashiest gummies i've had so far man that's pretty good um gosh i have an interview today shall i do one more why not for the video ma'am 100 mil or 50 milligrams more gummy these are superior um other might as well give you a little review on this if you're into nicotine salts the smok uh it's the new smart nord it's [ __ ] great mod i bought it the other day for 50 bucks that's wonderful a lot better uh than these [ __ ] little things i've been smoking on these literally all summer man and all through october and i just couldn't do it anymore i had to [ __ ] uh had to buy me a new mod but hey thanks guys peace out um got an interview this afternoon so i gotta go wish me luck on that and um [ __ ] buy these gummies if you're in the colorado area and have a medical card because these a plus taste and you can tell there's weed in them later guys", "HRhYgCOtrz0": "so i'm gonna be making a tincture today uh using everclear and some of the pucks i have left over from pressing yeah and don't worry guys uh nylon doesn't dissolve in you know alcohol unless you're adding extreme heat so i'll add a few more and then i think uh we're ready to add the everclear that's why i didn't play basketball all right so now i'm going to add the everclear and pretty much fill it up to the top so yeah guys like i said earlier uh you don't have to worry the nylon's not gonna dissolve in the alcohol so yeah uh i'm sure i'm still gonna get a few comments even though i've said it twice now but [Music] all right so got it to pretty much where i want it and uh just put the lid on just going to make sure the lid's uh nice and tight so you can take a quick look i'll let this jar sit for a week until i touch it again [Music] so after the week i'll take it out and see if it's ready to use or if i want to use heat to expedite the process so yeah that's how i go about making my tinctures take it easy guys", "CM7BgO_-Huk": "[Music] [Music] [Music] Mina McCain Katrina over FEMA it's like

marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we got some new things

keep on toking my friends", "CYUcoFmFx-Q": "hi welcome to 'angels anything show and we're back on another great butt hole of a February day but there is one shining light on this February day and that is this video and what we're about to do that is we are making weed gummies whoa that's right we've made brownies we made cookies we made chocolates we made maple syrup which that was questionable I think that worked but we have not made the quintessential lead food which is weed gummies now I'm a little nervous for this video because when you're  around with candy there's a lot less room for error and there's you know big risks on the table here this is quite a bit of weed so we're here I have the setup of what we need but really we're going to be going back there for the majority of this video to the oven I'm assuming you have a whisk I'm assuming you have a little pot I'm assuming you have water that's it those are the things you probably already have now hopefully you also have weed and hopefully you know how to make it into cannabutter because I'm not about to go over that with you I have my fancy towel here that my sister got me for Christmas it says the food has wheat in it and in this house that's probably true you're gonna need sunflower lecithin I think that's how it said this one is like a heavy all national cold press Papa bah a link to this specific one in the description box in fact all of this info will be in the description box below because I'm not a reliable source now on to the slightly grosser ingredients gelatin this is basically like horse hooves sorry and then jello which is more horse Hope's exciting but this will give us the you know candy flavor the recipe I'm using is from this place called the canna school and then their recipe they say use a half cup of water but then in the comments people were like it actually works better or tastes better if you use a half a cup of fruit juice just has a little bit of a flavor so let me show you what I got so fruit juice is definitely not my area of expertise so first I got power eat fruit punch in this tastes like medicine so I don't want it and I'm gonna have to like throw it out this isn't nobody's gonna drink it and so then I went and I got v8 splash berry blend I just want something that's like a nice sugary drink that's not like gross you know but it's actually really hard to find let's see that's exactly what I'm going part  Dan we were at the store yesterday and I was like trying so hard to pick out a juice that was good and I'm not well-versed in juices like I said and he was like that's gonna crop sex to me gross no Michael what about this he's like what are you grandpa like it's not the tomato based ones they're her bunch okay so oh and the final thing that you need is obviously mold no you don't actually have to use gummy bears you can use whatever you want but I want to use gummy bears because if I'm traveling with this I want to go to disguise them as I get a candy this recipe makes about a hundred gummies small ones weak ones I want big strong ones so I got the cutest gummy mold it's like the medium size so this is by the modern gummy and they had a small size of medium size and then a larger size and there are like 36 of these in here or 38 so really all that's left now is to go over to the stove and mix all this together and the reason it's a little scary is because oh and I have to heat this up too but the reason it's scary is because we're cooking sugar and candy and if you I have to do whisking it as I mean as I'm squirting it into this so time is of the essence you know so let me get us all situated over there and we'll begin alright guys I have everything all set up my station is ready because once we start this process you really got to keep it moving I have to whisk this liquid for like 15 minutes non-stop as we go so I'm gonna do my best to kind of like show you guys but this might get intense I don't know and I don't know I'm trying to make this video funny but it's probably not gonna be funny because I don't want to joke around and then up my edibles that ain't gonna happen so we're gonna stick to the script today okay I'm attaching you guys to this which is actually um for the car but it works on the oven so we're getting creative here and you're gonna see a little aerial view of what's going down my dog is like you when you're gonna take me for a walk well we need to medicate first little Jimmy we need to medicate hey it's a girl Angie KB I'm gonna tell you what I'm doing step by step so first you turn this stove on to medium low add in the cannabis butter add in your soy lecithin powder and start stirring rigorously and then once that's combined you add in the fruit punch as you're choosing and then you add in the gelatin and you've got a like whisk a lot as you're doing this or else it'll get all clumpy kind of like cornstarch you know and you know just whisking away whisking away oh then you add in your jello powder you can see in the background my dog licking his dick so that's nice it's getting a little clumpy okay so then you just whisk for like 10-15 minutes and then I started filling up these molds which took a while I ended up switching to a spoon which is easier but yeah that's basically it [Music] all right guys the deed is done I don't know how I feel about the fact that I got some of this on me and you literally can play with it like special effects makeup and it's not coming off but tasty sense so mmm horse hooves that was pretty easy it did get a little tricky with the hardening but they acted online as if like oh my god it's gonna harden in like two seconds so I know I think that I did all right I lost the dropper like halfway through it just got too thick and it like clogged and it didn't work and then I just ended up using a spoon from my cabinet which made it a little messier but I think ultimately a lot faster so now these are just gonna set it says to put them in the freezer but then I saw people saying that they were better left out so I think I'm gonna do what you would do with normal jello and just put them in the fridge I don't know I'll let them set for a few hours and then I guess we'll taste test one right I guess so all right guys it's hours later and these things are set they're dumb this is how these came out they look pretty legit and then I had a little bit of excess left so I just pour it in here you know I haven't popped any of these out but let's see I'm impressed with myself these came out really good like normally I do a really bad job with this stuff but let's do the taste test so I'm just gonna eat this big one because yeah mmm mmm all right little gelatin II I mean it doesn't taste awesome cuz I can taste a lot of the coconut oil but I mean you know I'm not eating this cuz I  want candy you know I mean this cousin trying to get my rocks off so if you're trying to get your rocks off try this recipe you try one of the you saw I mean yeah boo tastes awesome cuz it's like very coconut oil II it's not bad it's just like you kind of want to get it over with is it a fail I don't think so I mean I guess we'll find out if it gets me high it's not a fail you know it's edible thank God we use that fruit punch stuff because I don't know how it tasted without back umm-hmm right no all right guys but that's it what do you think it was actually really easy hopefully very effective we'll see I'll let you know remember the recipe link will be below I'll also link where I got the soy lecithin powder stuff and follow me on Instagram if you want Angie Kb thank you for watching this episode of 'angels anything show and I'll see you next time good bye [Music] alright I'm here to report that the gummies worked thus laylee to gelatinous gummies did indeed work I am hi and also I have a pimple between my eyes which I've had for this whole video so you guys already know that anyway it was a success so definitely make them alright also Dan just up a Hello fresh alright guys more time has passed and they feel they need to tell you that I'm even more up now as you can probably tell because my eyelid is even more closed and my pimple is even more red so I'm not sure what's happening - then no okay don't do try these at home do you tres know Dan's rolling a great bodysuit [Music]", "Oke0eNMVtrY": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm just showing you how to make infused super sour candy spray is so good I'm so obsessed with it and I'm so excited to show you guys how to make this these turned out so amazing they're so delicious they literally my favorite thing ever my favorite thing I've made my everything empty so they're just like they're just so good so I'm doing a couple different versions including some sugar-free and so much sugar I thought this sugar-free one might not taste as good as well as sugar because of course it's sugar-free but I honestly cannot even tell it's like it literally tastes like real sugar which is weird might be because of all the sour in there it kind of like throws your tastebuds off or something but it's absolutely amazing and it has no calories except with coconut oil yes actually and I'm going to show you guys how to emulsify coconut oil into a spray and they stay like this they don't um separate now if you don't want to follow the instructions for the emulsification of the mixture you don't have to you could just do the flavoring with coconut oil um and just shake it every time you use it it'll still work but if you want to keep them so they look like this all the time I'll show you guys how in the video the texture is a little bit different for the one with the sugar versus the sugar free the sugar free one is more liquidy and the one with sugar is a little bit more like the kind you get in the store so it has more of a syrupy texture I mean that one extra sourdough made then I did use coconut oil in mine but you don't need to I just added to help with the absorption if you choose not to use coconut oil just try to use your spray when you're eating something fatty or take like a soy lecithin pill or something along those lines here's what you're going to need a variety of drink flavors or flavor oils some infuse coconut oil or regular coconut oil tincture if desired water granulated sugar citric acid potassium sorbate mixture exams and gum and some spray bottles start by taking your infused coconut oil and melt it in the microwave until it's liquid our first step is to make our base for our sprays so we do want to add some fat to our sprays but unfortunately oil and water do not mix so we're gonna make an emulsion using water exams and gum and infuse coconut oil you could also use regular coconut oil but if you can up the infusion for this I say why not so we have 1/3 of a cup of water and 1/4 TSP of exams and gum this is what the exams and gum and water mixture should look like after blending it now I'm gonna add in two tablespoons of my melted infused coconut oil and then we're gonna blend that together alright here's how it looks and it's too thick so I ended up having to add it some more water to this so I added 1/3 of a cup more water and left everything else the same so if I were to do this again I would do 1/3 of a cup of water 1/4 teaspoon of example gum or possibly maybe just 1/8 of a teaspoon but I would only do 1 tablespoon of coconut oil now that I added water it definitely looks a lot better I'm just gonna have quite a bit left over now I'm gonna add 1/4 teaspoon of potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below and this is going to preserve your sprays so that they can last for months now I'm going to pour my mixture into my little spray bottles I believe they are 30 milliliters spray bottles and I'm gonna just fill them about less than half of the bottle I mean you can play around with how much you want of this it just kind of affects the texture but if you added more that would work as well the amount of mixture I have is enough for probably six or more bottles now we're going to start with our first spray which is the sour blue raspberry I want mine to be extra strong so I'm also going to be putting some tincture in here I put about 10 of these syringes I don't know but I think equals about a tablespoon you can add more you can add less you can add none it's up to you I could have added more but I didn't want to have too much of an alcohol taste now we're gonna add in our flavoring I'm gonna be using these kool-aid sugar-free flavor packages but you could use regular kool-aid or you could use a flavoring oil it's really up to whatever flavor you would like I'm just using one package but you could use more if you want a stronger taste now to add our citric acid which is going to make our mouth spray sour I'm only going to be adding in one teaspoon of citric acid because this drink mix already has citric acid in it you could use as much or as little citric acid as you like but I would recommend not using any more than three teaspoons of citric acid as I think that would be too sour even for somebody who really does like sour and as you can see I'm really struggling getting the citric acid to go through the funnel and that is because it is wet so I suggest either cleaning it and drying it before you pour anything through that's powdery or to put the citric acid into your containers before you use the funnel with any liquids now I'm just gonna fill the rest of my container up with some water and as you can see I over fill it so just keep a nice eye on how much water you're adding there to add less than have to add a little bit more after then you can shake it all up until everything is all mixed together and you can see it has perfectly emulsified oh never mind there's some clumps in there so with the clumps if you guys can see them on camera I tried to be able to get them but they weren't showing up very well if you get clumps in there it's because the flavor packet was not dissolving properly and that's likely because I use cold water so I just do this in the microwave for about 30 seconds with the lid off and as you can see it's perfect I have a very smooth nice texture now our next one which is the sour watermelon I'm going to be using this Jolly Rancher watermelon drink packet of course you can use a regular couid packet flavoring oil like I said you can really use anything that your heart desires now we're going to add our 1 teaspoon of strick acid as well as the flavoring packet then I'm just gonna give it a quick little mix and then I am going to add some more tincture to this again you don't have to add tincture this is just a personal choice to make my spray stronger now we're just going to fill the rest of the bottle up with some water this time I use warm water and then we're going to shake it up real nice and that's it this one is done and ready to use so now we've made our sugar free watermelon and our sugar free blue raspberry now we're gonna make one with sugar which is going to be our sour green apple spray the first step to making the sugar spray is to mix equal parts water and sugar so I have 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup sugar and I'm going to bring that to a boil and once it comes to a boil I am going to let it cook for another 2 minutes about and then I'm going to take it off the heat once it's off the heat I'm going to add in my flavoring and I am using a kool-aid package I didn't really know how much I was going to need so I just threw the whole pack in there you could use more you could use less again all down to taste but the 1 pack works well for this and of course you could also use a flavoring oil instead then we're just going to mix that all in until it's nice and smooth and evaporated absorbed I'm not sure this is all this the word that I'm looking for so you're going to stir this until all of the powder has been dissolved you can also add the citric acid in at this point I didn't I don't know why I just didn't but it would be easier if you added it in at this point then you can add in your sugar water kool-aid mixture into your jar with the base mixture of coconut oil water it sounds and gum so yeah just pour that right in and then we're going to add our teaspoon of citric acid and like I said it would have been easier had you just done this and while it was still in the pot but that's the really nice thing about making these sprays as they're very very very flexible the only thing you want to be a little bit careful with is making that emulsion mixture that is the base of each of them to bind that oil and water together now I'm just adding some tincture in here it is a unmeasured amount I'm just going for it here now we'll give it a nice little shake and mix it up until it is all finded this one you can already kind of tell when shaking and it has a bit of a different texture from that simple syrup sugar mixture speaking of which you could also use a few simple syrup in this recipe so you can see there's so many ways to do this so I tried it and it was super tasty but I felt like I wanted it more sour like I like it so sour that almost hurts my face so I added in a another teaspoon of citric acid and it turned out perfectly it's so sour and so delicious and the sugary taste of it is like even better than the other ones not gonna lie so I want to show you guys what they look like when they come out and the difference in texture between the sugar-free and the not sugar-free so this red one here is a sugar-free one and it tastes really good I was worried that the sugar-free ones were going to have a like meth taste because they were sugar-free but they were like really really good I almost wouldn't know they weren't sugar-free if no one had told me so but the sugar one has a very different texture and it's more like syrupy a reminds me of when you buy a sort of a candy sour spray from the store it kind of has that same mouthfeel but they're both very very good and I'm not gonna lie to you guys I have to suck this out of a paper towel after I just couldn't waste it thank you guys so much for watching I am so excited about these they're so good please tell me if you make them because I want to hear what flavor combinations and everything that he did and also thinking of doing a mint flavored one without sugar obviously it's better fruity and I don't know like maybe like a Mexican maybe like a spicy one I don't know what do you guys think what would you like to see it we got there so good I'm gonna dicted to this I named a green apple one of my favorite but I love a green apple thank you guys so so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave comment and subscribe thanks guys [Music]", "A24Y3JyHLAQ": "this video is made of a user's request today I'm showing you how to winterize frozen in a small batch here I have almost a gram of rosin about a point 8 I made just before this video I'm placing into a beaker and adding 10 ml of Everclear I'm adding the alcohol to the rosin so that I can inter eyes it apply like bleep and mix until all of the rosin is dissolved into the alcohol [Music] here importing the rajma and alcohol into a graduated cylinder this is just for the purpose of the video [Music] I meant place it into the freezer and my cool for about 14 hours [Music] after freezing you can see that the wax fats and lipids have separated and sunk to the bottom [Music] here I'm using two syringes to pull out the fats and waxes as well as the alcohol separately this is also just for the purposes of this video to show you the difference [Music] it does help however to pull them out separately as it makes it easier to filter the cleaner portion compared to the waxy portion [Music] here I'm pushing them through a point to two microns syringe filter the syringe filter tracks the facts and waxes and removes them from the alcohol [Music] [Music] in the end I've caused it in alcohol and it's been winterized and I'm removed of any of its fats and waxes alright once you've done filtering you know how fully winterized rosin you can go ahead and use this for edibles or you can further refine it by boiling away the S&L and using it for bait pens or lowell devs my half plate has a built in magnetic stirrer it's a magnet that spins around and spins a magnetic stir bar this automates the steering process and speeds up the overall evaporation it may take some time for all the alcohol to evaporate keep checking back on it every so often so that you don't burn your rosin I don't recommend consuming concentrate that may have ethanol and then often if you are going to do this regularly you are better off getting it back through the final purge process [Music] after you've reduced most of the alcohol up I'd like to put another beaker on top to prevent any ball tools such as terpenes from escaping that having already in this final process removing the last of the ethanol now you can't truly remove all of it without a vacuum so I went to do this for as long as possible kind of medium to high heat right now it's heated at around 95 degrees Celsius I like to let it sit like this for a couple hours from four I feel it's safe to smoke and the ethanol has escaped [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "x6BgfrYZ7sI": "this is 420 Ohio's medical marijuana product reviews Juanes our gummies are produced by Buckeye relief out of East Lake Ohio gummies are housed in a white plastic bottle with a pine green cap there are ten gummies per bottle each containing roughly eight milligrams of THC and CBD per coming one us our gummies are flavored like strawberry lemonade it is worth noting for diabetics that these gummies are not sugar-free containing sugar pectin and corn syrup the bottle itself is fairly easy to open and

crafted into the shape of the THC warning logo the gummies are a deep shade of pink almost like grapefruit and are covered in tasty sugar crystals in terms of flavor the name says it all these gummies are juicy bursting with strawberry sweetness and a tart lemon flavor that's just right I wasn't wincing or pinching my lips while chewing on this gummy like I might with other sour candies if you're looking for that experience though I'd suggest mixing this gummy with some sour patch kids medicinally wanna sour gummies provide a one-to-one ratio of THC and CBD per gummy this translates to a medicinal experience that's both mildly euphoric and relaxing used a few hours before bed this gummy is excellent for distressing after a tough day it's also great for inflammation relief rest and sleep euphoria creeps up with this one building to a crescendo about an hour or two after eating the edible I could initially feel a slight headband effect that grew in intensity before peaking and slowly dissipating this was followed by immediate pain and stress relief overall I rather loved one a sour gummies they are great for the evening providing gentle euphoria inflammation relief and

we're here in the smash lab and today we're gonna be making some very very strong THC oil using 17 different rosin pucks [Music] the thing about these rosin pucks is they are still loaded with THC we haven't been pressing super high pressure lately we've been doing around 650 to 700 so there is a lot of rosin left over in these the great thing is we've got a new teach egg tester so we're gonna find out just how many milligrams is left inside this oil at the end the last video you saw when our boss drank that entire thing he was completely loaded we are gonna find out just how many milligrams that was and we anticipate this one's gonna be a lot stronger so stay tuned to see just what the measurement comes out to we'll start by getting a little bit of coconut oil 60 milliliters and our beaker over there and warm that up to about 140 degrees for 5 minutes alright so there's our 60 milliliters what we're gonna do is add it to this larger beaker because we're gonna be putting the pucks inside here we need a little bit more space [Music] all right so we're gonna let that heat up for a few minutes it's at about 170 degrees right now okay so our oil is now at around 125 degrees we're gonna go ahead and start adding our pucks like I said we have 17 bucks right here if you want to take a look at these you can see these things are cake this thing has got a nice yellow color still kind of sticky smells great wish you guys could smell this we're gonna start by adding 2 at a time try to save a little time here so I'll take these two right here take a look at these I want you to see what they look like before and after they're gonna be a lot more clear and that oil is gonna be bright yellow by the time I'm done with these two so let's go ahead and have these in there make sure they're fully submerged and boom as you can see we can easily add two at a time in here as we lose a little bit of oil we might have to drop down to one at a time so this all depends on how much oil you're using [Music] all right so it's been about five minutes we're gonna go ahead and take a look at these pugs make sure we got all the rosin outside of them it was about five minutes and we're doing two at a time it's important to know that you can even do seven to ten minutes depending on how your puffs look after we're gonna take a look right now you can see that the oil is already a completely different color than it was originally so these do look pretty clear we'll probably go ahead and let those sit for about two more minutes make sure we get everything out and then we'll completely remove them [Music] okay so it's been two more minutes let's go ahead and remove these our first one here as you can see that was a lot more clear take a look at our oil here it's got a nice yellow color it was originally clear so we're gonna do is go ahead and squeeze the rest of the oil out of these pucks here okay so our first two pucks got them right here as you can see those things are really clear we pulled a lot of rosin out of those here's a one we haven't done yet next one we have done as you can see there's a lot of rosin inside of these puck still what we're gonna do is bill the other 15 bucks in there on a time lapse to save you guys time and go ahead and see how this oil tests out at the end okay so that was the last puck we just did all 17 as you can see these are completely clear now we pulled all the rosin out of those as you can see the oil is way dark way darker than last time we assume is gonna be very potent we're gonna go ahead and test it out but first we've got Adi carbon so let's get that last puck out of there [Music] okay so we just removed that last puck and we turned the temperature up a little bit on our hot plate we're trying to get around that 220 to 240 degrees range we're gonna let that boil sit there for about 10 minutes so we can de carve this is gonna activate all the THC that's inside that oil this should take about 10 minutes but we're gonna pay attention to the bubbles that are forming as you see those bubbles that means it's d carving and once those disappear you're pretty much good to go [Music] okay so next we're going to do is take a nug Smasher 37 micron bag and strain the oil through it what that's going to do is get rid of any of that plant material was left over [Music] all right so what were left with is 20 milliliters of completely activated THC oil what we're gonna do is use our new teach egg test machine a lot of you have been recommending this to us you really want to know how many milligrams of THC was in a in the oil when we were done what this does is it uses light to analyze the oil and give us the total cannabinoid count we know that flour that we pressed was predominantly THC however if you were doing heme it would give you the CBD results as well the only thing is it only tests up to 15 milligrams of THC or total cannabinoids per milliliter so we're gonna have to dilute our rosin oil right here in a twenty to one ratio with coconut oil so we'll do that now all right so let's get our scale zeroed we're gonna add a point 400 grams of clean coconut oil right here alright next we're gonna add point O two of our rosin oil [Music] turn this on alright so we're testing isolate infusion we're doing coconut oil temperatures about 75 and the infusion has been deep carbs we're going to go ahead and begin the test first we got to ensure the tray slot is empty which it is okay let's just calibrate yeah and while that's calibrated we can go ahead and add our oil to the tray right here [Music] all right all right we got the results ten point six times twenty so two hundred the point six times two would be [Music] so two hundred and twelve per milliliter and how many do we have twenty Destin that's that's a lot for one person to drink that's pretty heavy all right so extremely potent oil right here we just got this tea check yesterday we've been playing with it for the past two days really cool device we were really interested to see how many milligrams this was 4240 that's a lot more than most people would do in one dose like we did last time thanks for watching the video and make sure you stay tuned for next time hey guys make sure you check us out at Doug smasher com2 check out all of our awesome products we also have tons of

I'm starting with a half cup of cold water,\nand to that I'm going to add three packets of plain gelatin. I'm just going to open these up, you can find\nthese in the store, they're available in the little box. I'm using Knocks but any kind will do, and\nI just want to add this gradually so it won't clump up. So just with a nice spatula or spoon make\nsure that your constantly stirring. Stir, stir, stir. You can see it's turning into a gelatin kind\nof a mess here. Which is perfect, just what we're looking\nfor. So I'm just going to stir that around and\nlast but not least I'm going to add one whole packet of Jello, because I'm really just going\nfor it. And I'm using the blue one, but any flavor\nyou like will do. Just pour it in there and again stir it around\nso nothing will clump up. So that is it, I'm going to take my candy\nand I'm going to move it to I have a pot of water simmering on this stove. And then I'm just going to heat it up inside\nthis pot of water. So I'm using a glass measurement cup and I'm\njust letting the heat from the water, kind of heat up my mixture. So this way none of my gelatin is going to\nend up burning, it's all very safe, very kind of a gentle process. You could also just pop it right into the\nmicrowave if you prefer and that's fine too. I'm just going to let that kind of simmer,\nand get nice and thick. So my mixture has melted so I'm ready to go,\nand here I have a nice cute little I have like a jewel mold. You can get any kind of plastic mold that\nyou like or any other kind of candy mold that. The little bears are really fun and adorable. But just while my gelatin is still nice and\nsmooth and liquid, I'm just going to go ahead and pour it right into my mold. You can even go ahead and fill it the way\nup to the top or as big as you like them. That is it. I'm going to let those sit up on the counter\nfor about 10 to 15 minutes or until they're nice and firm to the touch, to keeping them\nto the heat of your house you might need a little longer or a little less. But as soon as they're firm I'm going to take\nthem out of the mold and we're ready to go. So my blue gummy candy are still setting up\nbut I have some that are already done, so these are just the same just with a lemon\nflavor and a cherry flavor. The same recipe and you could see them getting\nnice and firm and chewy. Now if you want to get that kind of classic\nsour candy coating, you take a little bit of sugar mixed with a touch of citric acid. And what that's going to do is give our candies\na nice sour coating. And that's it or you can leave them plain\nor you can just drench them in sugar. Anything that you like, but anyway, enjoy. That's how you make gummy candies at home.", "JEc8S-NYomU": "[Music] all right all right guys we're the first to do this 2 000 milligrams so on the nuxmaster mini there's really the unit was designed to do two different size smashes um it's really designed for travel personal use trade shows um to go and set up heat up quick and uh then extract either a gram nug or three quarters to a gram nug in a piece of parchment paper with no [Music] bag that's one of the presses that it's made to do which we have here in the back some dosey dough and then in the front we have some chronic kush it's also made to do a three and a half gram smash in a three and a half gram bag like this bottle loaded bottle textile um we advocate that extraction method so all of our surface area to pressure calculations on all of our units have been done assuming that you load the bags bottle textile like i said the mini was made for two two different smashes a single nug smash and a piece of parchment with no bag or a three and a half gram bag smash loaded bottle textile now both of these different uh ways of extraction the different weight of extraction are going to require the same pressure because at the end you're going to get the overall same surface area on the extracted material so if you're up to a one gram nug with no bag it's probably gonna be a little bigger so it'll be a little less pressure that you're applying you know um if you go closer towards three quarter of a gram nug with no bag uh it's going to be uh more pressure on that surface area because it's going to be smaller so you'll learn that as you get a unit and you start to extract you'll see the different different results in and out from the different product and whatnot especially if you're on the growing side so we're waiting for this oil to melt over here we thought it'd be a great time to read off some of your youtube comments on the latest videos believe it or not we actually read all of your comments so let's try to keep it positive um latest video was the bubble hash let's see what you guys are saying so connor 4k hey what do you guys do with the already pressed flower as you can see this is exactly what we do we like to make potent thc oil with it and it actually comes out really clean and really high quality don't recommend smoking it i would personally do the oil 10 times out of 10 with the pucks let's see what else we've got here shady 580 cop watch nug smasher is by far the best on the market you'll get your money's worth and then some my small one is paid for itself many times over i really need to get a bigger and bigger one now production is up well shady 580 we got the nug smasher pro ready for you here just give us a call and we'll get this sent over whenever you're ready what else we got better than watching porn nick garden i'd agree with that porn for stoners i dig it complete wash 86 i could see there's a some similarities there so jared stallman how much material did you start with to get that much bubble hash at once was it nugs and trim or just nugs um for that i don't know the exact amount because our friends over at 11 11 cannabis company uh provided us with the bubble hash but it i do know that it was a fresh flower trimmed right off the plant it was still live so if that answers your question let's see what else danny thompson it's like watching da vinci paint i'm seriously considering picking up a nug smasher at harvest time this year i used to be into the whole backyard blasting thing but figure now that i'm growing the garden of my dreams with all my favorite strains why half-ass it when it comes to concentrates that keef was beautiful i'll always have a soft spot for keith full melts i definitely agree with you blasting is cool but rosin is a lot cooler all right i think that's enough for now let me know you guys thought of that we can keep reading them off like i said we read all of your guys's comments so try to keep it positive if you can

to make rosin chip counter butter or coconut oil in order to make Roz and Chef Canada better of course schooner nice and Roz and chips you're also going to need some clarified butter coconut oil or olive oil and you need some water which is optional you can use the herbal infusion machine which we're using today you can also use a double boiler setup or an oven I'll show you that method as well if you do want to check out the herbal infusion calm please save $30 with the code ruffhouse and thanks to the herbal infuser comm for sponsoring this episode the first step is going to be to press your Asin and to keep the chips if you're wondering about rose and chips are they're the chips that are left over after you've used the rosin press to press out the rosin or the wax from the cannabis you can see I've got a handful of chips here it's about announces and now it's worth of cannabis that I press to get this here but you can use whatever ratio or whatever amount that you have or want the more chips you use and the less oil the more potent the next step after you've collected your chips together is to combine the chips and the oil or butter that you're using if you're using the herbal infuser machine you can just drop the chips right into the bucket or into the hopper there's no need to do any kind of breaking or anything like that because the blade on the Herbalife user is going to do that more than adequately but if you're not using the herbal infuser you're going to go ahead and break that the cannabis you don't need to grind it but you just want to break it up by hand until they're little pieces like you see there it's really easy to do that and you want to do that if you're using a double boiler as well and if you're using the oven method but like I said not if you're using the herbal infuser and now you're going to add in the oil and the ratio that you use is up to you if you use less oil and more chips you're going to get a much stronger oil but if you want like a cooking oil that you can use everyday you can use a large amount of oil and so for about an ounce worth of pressed cannabis I'm using the about 2 cups of oil but you can see that the oil that I have didn't quite meet the fill line and the Herbalife infuser machine and that's fine with our butter or oil you can go ahead and use water to fill that that little space in there so I'm adding in about a half a cup of water and then I had about almost two cups of oil in there and that we're using that water to get it to the minimum fill line and now the next step is going to be to infuse the cannabis into the butter or oil you do this using heat and with the herbal infuser machine you don't need to worry about that I used the mighty fast to cycle which is an hour and a half and it's going to be plenty hot enough to infuse that oil but if you're using the oven or a double boiler you set up over a double boiler and keep the water boiling for an hour and a half but if you're using an oven you can put it in the oven for about an hour and a half or two hours at 250 degrees Fahrenheit and after it's infused for about an hour and a half either way that you've done it you're going to be able to strain out the cannabis from the oil now here I am straining out the oil that I made in the oven and this is actually a really strong oil I used about over a quarter ounces worth of pressed cannabis and then a very very small amount of oil that you can see there it's just about a quarter cup of oil or less so I've got a really strong oil there that would be great for putting into capsules and just swallowing and taking like a pill and now for my cooking oil that I used about two cups of oil and about an ounce of pressed cannabis you'll see that it's a lot different color and a lot different consistency and it's gone through the herbal infuse or for its hour-and-a-half cycle and it's finished and you can see that the blades really pulverize to those rosin chips into a it's a very gelatinous murky mulch it was kind of disgusting actually but the oil that comes through the bottom is really nice and you don't want to press that through there because if you press that it's polarized so much it will come through the strainer so just let it run through it and drain out but you're not finished there because we have that water in the oil so what I've done is I've put that in the refrigerator or the freezer for just a few minutes and let it solidify and we're going to be able to easily separate the butter oil from the water as I said before you wouldn't want to use olive oil for this but because it would be too hard the olive oil won't really solidify so that you can separate it easily but with the coconut oil or the butter it'll be fine and two ways to resep rate the water is to one is to poke a hole and turn it over let it drain out or if you've got a bowl that will have a little bit of a tapered side you can just kind of tilt it out and the oil will stay solid and you can take that really murky looking water it's got chlorophyll and a lot of other inactive ingredients it's just going to help clean up the taste of your butter as well and I tested this oil just cuz I was curious so what kind of potency what I get I would get I got seventy two point six milligrams of THC per tablespoon which is a pretty decent butter which is really nice after you think you've got a cannabis that's no good anymore to be able to make a really good cannabutter a can of oil out of it is a really nice way to get the very most out of your cannabis so I hope you

tricks for getting the most out of your flower rosin so whether you're pressing at home on a hair straightener or using an industry-leading press like our peg speak rosin press we've got all the tips and tricks so you can get the most out of it tip number one quality in quality out this is the most important thing that you should know when you're making flower rosin or any rosin the better the material you're starting with the better your results are going to be and the fresher it is the better the clarity as material tends to age it's gonna oxidize and you're gonna find that that rosin is gonna come out darker so if you're looking to make the best flower rods and you possibly can get stellar material and press it as soon after its dried and cured as possible tip number two relative humidity makes a huge difference with flower rosin now you can go check out our other video where we did the full in-depth test but what you need to know is that your flower should be at least at 55 to 62% humidity before you press it this makes a massive difference in your yield so just make sure that your material is properly hydrated before you press it tip number three choose your temperature based on your desired results so we encourage a lot of experimentation and you're gonna find that most people are either pressing on the lower temperature range which is about 160 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit or the higher temperature range which is anything from 190 to as high as 250 degrees so depending on what kind of consistency you want to achieve that's where you're gonna set your temperature on the lower range you're gonna be looking at more of a butter on the higher range more of an oil or a shatter so when you have some material that you're playing around with we encourage you to try both ends of the spectrum and see which one you like the most tip number 4 choose the right micron bag type now you can absolutely press flower outside of a bag and get great results but that's usually only a gram or two you're gonna want to press in a 90 or 115 micron bag or at the most 150 we recommend not going any lower than 90 because that's when you're gonna see a huge drop-off in yield so if you're pressing flour in a bag make sure to stick in that range and finally tip number five if you're looking to make the highest quality flour on possible you absolutely don't need to overdo it on the pressure now you can definitely over press your flour rosin by applying way too much force at your bag and in fact we've seen great results not only with yield but of course with quality pressing at the lower end of the pressure range anything from around 550 to 1600 psi at the bag so when you're applying way too much pressure in the many thousands what can often happen is that you're pushing out plant fats lipids you know the waxes as well as all of those undesirable plant materials into the rosin really over pressing it so if you're looking for the highest quality rosin we recommend trying the lower pressure range and seeing your results thanks for watching we hope that you found that was helpful for more tips and tricks make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel and follow us on social media at Goa peer pressure thanks again for watching [Music]", "baduiKxwcqo": "what's up everyone we are here in the smash lab and today we are gonna make some weed jello shots these are gonna be very strong we are doing 15 different rosin pugs each of these are seven grams still caked with roz and if you've watched any of our other videos every now and again we take our rods and pugs that we've smashed and we make a really happily concentrated oil with MCT oil or coconut oil we're going to use some empty tea oil right now and we're gonna go over that concoction you could check out one of our other videos on how we do this method link in description but for now we'll go ahead and do that and then we'll meet back here so we can make those THC jello shots [Music] [Music] okay we're back we just finished making that a THC oil very strong very dark color check this out do you remember this was completely clear at first we use 15 different rows and pucks that's probably really strong this is how the rosin pucks look now completely clear if you want to take a look at a couple of them completely white at first those were a darker color really yellow we pulled as much as we can out of those I promise you that is a very strong now what we're gonna do is make some kickass jello shots we've got these cool jell-o cups we have our beaker here filled with a cup of water it's boiling right now so what we're gonna do is go ahead and add packet of a cherry jello all right so here we go you're gonna want to stir this while you're adding it I have a nice nug smasher everything tool right here let's go ahead and add that in they make some stove plates that actually come with a magnetic stirrer those are a lot better for this [Music] [Music] so next we're gonna go ahead and add this how much do we have left I'd say about 70 milliliters of a very strong THC oil she's gonna add that right in there like I said this is gonna be really strong the last time we tested a our rosin puck oil I believe it was 4,000 to 4,500 milligrams of THC and that was with 12 Roz and pucks we just did 15 so all right so I just added the THC oil next you want to add your sunflower lecithin this stuff is great it's an emulsifier it really helps with the absorption you'll feel the effects of your edibles way way faster and way stronger wouldn't you agree all right so now we got our sunflower less then you're gonna want to add a tablespoon I'll just eyeball it just a little bit [Music] like I said this would help a lot if we had the magnetic stirrer with us we didn't bring it today but we highly recommend buying a heated plate that comes with a magnetic stirrer [Music] okay so we got some cold water here we're gonna pour this in till we get to 400 milliliters boom 400 milliliters we're going to stir this up and we're gonna start pouring that in our jello shots right there [Music] [Music] okay so we just finished up check it out we have all of these freshly poured jello shots I highly recommend this way of doing it as opposed to gummies we got lids and everything you throw these in the fridge you have them all summer THC jello shots were the first to do it thanks for watching and we'll see you next time in our videos here at nuts nasha hey guys make sure you check us out at nug smasher com2 check out all of our awesome products we also have tons of great information on our site including calculator tools and Terp files be sure to check us out there at nug smasher com", "8YfY_NDparw": "and welcome back to my channel today I am going to be showing you how to make canna gummies I did a video on my channel on how I make that infused coconut oil so this is just pretty much a part 2 on how I make my gummies I'm going to show you what I use I had all measured out just to make it a little bit easier for you so you are going to need two packs of this jello it's 85 grams you only 2 of those you'll need 1 envelope of gelatin you will need 1/4 cup of cannabis coconut infused oil so I will link that video down below on how I made this and then you will need 1/2 a cup of water you can use juice or water I chose to use juice it just gives it more of a nicer flavor and you can't taste the weed then you are going to take your gummy bear trays which I got these on Amazon I think all for five of these were $20 so let's get started on the first step this is a very very easy recipe and anybody can do it I mean I can okay so we're going to put this on low heat and we are going to add our canna oil [Music] then our half a cup of water or juice you're gonna walk to so you're gonna want to get this to a boil I already pre turned it on so that's why it's sizzling like that so you're just gonna get it to a nice little boil and I do have this on medium heat so you don't want it to burn so just put it on medium then once it is boiled I will tell you the next step it's already hot so I should be able to add in my next ingredients which is the gelatin and the jello so again it's one cup of the gelatin and two of these 85 gram cellos I usually do not turn the burner on to warm it up so that's why it's like that this is one of the easiest recipes I have found so I am just stirring it and waiting for it to come to a boil which doesn't take long then I will start putting them in my trays so once it has just came to a boil like this you are going to turn it on probably one or two cuz you don't want it too high but you don't want it to get cold and then I have this and you're going to have to keep stirring it well you were putting it in the gummy tray if you don't the can't oil will kind of like go to the top like oil and water doesn't mix right so you just imagine if you stop mixing it like this it's not gonna work and then you are just going to put these in as you keep stirring it's kind of hard to do like both at once but you have to make sure that you keep stirring it I have not stirred it and then all of the oil goes to the top of the gummy bear and the gummy bear is just a terrible consistency it'll be gummy on the front and then the back it'll just be like pure cannabis so really it's not enjoyable for you to eat the gummies I usually get about four trays so I will just bring you a little closer and this is how the wheel gummies come out so not too hard so I'm trying to do this about hand just like this cute little cousin bears so that's how you make it it's really really easy to follow I can make it so you if you have any questions leave them down below and I will try to answer them for you", "BYajjMMwNsY": "yo yo yo what's good everybody bass drop keys your philly neighborhood negro in today's video guys i'm going to show you how to make a classic treat today we're going to be doing candy apples let's go ahead and get into it let's do way all right guys so welcome back to another great goodies 420 video before we get this video going i do gotta let you know this video is being sponsored by magicalbutter.com use base drop keys to get 20 off your order with magicalbutter.com i want to thank them for sponsoring me in general but also sponsoring today's video based drug keys magicalbutter.com 20 off all right guys so today's video we got a classic for you we're going to be doing candy apples where i'm from in georgia every october or november we have the country fair come through i remember going to the country fair i used to always love to get me a funnel cake and a candy apple in today's video we're going to show you exactly how to make candy apples and you know that they're goodies for 20 style so without any further ado let's go ahead and get into it this right here is how you make candy apples here we go all right guys so first things first is i'm going to tell you about the preparation as you can see here we have the apples here with our popsicle sticks in it you can use popsicle sticks or skewers whatever you want to use is fine also i have a piece of parchment paper right here that we're going to be using once we dip our apples into the candy we're going to need to place them somewhere so that it can dry and we're going to do it right here before we place the apples on the parchment paper we are going to spray it with some nonstick coconut spray here you can use whatever spray that you want to use but we're going to use this nonstick coconut spray before we place the candied apples on the parchment paper just to make sure that they don't stick as far as the apples go the preparation for those i wash those with hot water because you don't want to have any of the wax on there and then make sure that you dry them and then you also want to take off the stem and then put the sticks in there so the main thing is use hot water to get any of the wax that's on there sometimes you know your apples and your fruit will have that wax coating on there to get that off all you want to do is use hot water dry them off make sure they're really dry stick the popsicle sticks in there or skewers and then you're ready to go also guys what we're going to be using is some of this candy flavor right here this is the cotton candy flavor we're going to be using the drama this this is totally optional you don't have to use this but it does give you a nice flavor so whenever you see me put the tincture in there i'm also going to be putting this cotton candy flavor in there as well once again not 100 necessary but i do like it because it's going to give a nice flavor to your candy other than the flavor from the sugar you're going to have this nice flavor as well okay now let's go ahead and get to making our candy apples that's the last thing that we got to do is we got to go ahead and make them here we go all right guys so we're going to start making our candy apples now we're going to start off by putting two cups of sugar inside of our saucepan you can see that we have that here already to this we're going to add a half cup of corn syrup [Music] and we're not going to be stirring this up so don't stir this up okay we're going to add 3 4 cup of water we're going to add a quarter teaspoon of red food coloring and finally i have my candy thermometer right there we have everything in here that we need right now and so we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and turn on our saucepan to medium high heat if you have a 1 to 10 dial i'm gonna go ahead and put it on number eight and so for the most part that's basically it like i was saying before we're not going to stir this up at all all we're going to do now is we have the dial on number eight we're gonna let this warm up and we're gonna actually warm this up until it gets 280 degrees on our candy thermometer 280 degrees fahrenheit on our candidate thermometer so as i just told you we put our dial on the number eight setting on the dial here we're going to let this warm up until it gets to 280 degrees fahrenheit on our candy thermometer not celsius 280 degrees fahrenheit almost 150 celsius on there and once that happens we're going to put in our tincture and we're going to put in our dram of flavoring and then we're going to get to the dipping so i'm going to show you what it looks like whenever we reach the 280 degrees fahrenheit give me a couple minutes and i'll show it to you in just a second all right guys so as you can see we're starting to have some action inside of our saucepan here we still have to let it get to the right temperature which is 280 degrees fahrenheit so that way it would actually you know harden up in candy the way we want to while we're doing this i want to go ahead and talk about the dosage of this i'm using that one gram of flavoring like i told you before and we're using two teaspoons of tincture for the tincture that i have that you guys see me made we just recently made it on the channel that's going to be 85 milligrams of thc because we're doing three apples right here when we finished doing these apples each apple will be about 20 28 and a half milligrams of thc so that's our edible dosage right there each apple is going to be about 28 and a half milligrams of thc we're going to continue to let this go here and uh yeah once it reaches the right temperature i'll show you what it looks like all right guys so we're approaching 240 240 degrees on our candy thermometer i'm going to go ahead and add in our tincture and our dram of flavor that we talked about earlier let me go and add this in all right guys so real quickly here i want to apologize to you guys once again i did something stupid and i deleted the clip where i actually i mean the best part of the video where i actually you know the the candy mixture right here comes the temperature and then you see me actually dip the candy apples and because i had some extra candy mixture i grabbed some grapes and actually dipped them too so because i'm stupid and i keep making mistakes like i spent all this time energy and money upgrading the equipment upgrading everything that i'm doing but in the end if you make dumb mistakes then you pay the price so i'm sorry but uh what you just missed that i deleted was it just came to temperature you see me take the apple and what you want to do is you just want to tilt the pot over to the side you put the apple in it and you just rotate it around and it will coat it you set it to the side on the parchment paper don't forget that you need to spray the parchment paper with some nonstick spray to make sure that it doesn't stick on there i did some grapes and i did some apples once again sorry that i deleted it i keep making these dumb mistakes i'll try to do better in the future sorry all right guys so i just showed you how to make candy apples i hope that this video helped you out

Master\nBlaster we're back at Johnny's green extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here we\nadded a teaspoon and a quarter of food glycerin just to disperse the shatter\nin here now this is a little tricky to do so we've got to move quick here here\nwe go and

welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much for joining me today you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "gwyTK2hK9pc": "hello everyone and welcome to making gummies 101 today I'm going to explain an easy and simple way of making homemade gummies if you dig this video please punch that like button and don't forget to subscribe for future and easy 101 cannabis videos today i'm gonna be using cannabis infused vegetable glycerin and we'll be doing this without using additional sugar however I will be using jello and that's basically pure sugar I do use my own homegrown and I will be making a separate video on how to make the glycerin so materials I'm gonna be using today are gonna be a pan a whisk a spatula some gummy molds and a syringe the ingredients I'm gonna be using is one cup of cannabis infused vegetable glycerin 12 ounces of flavored gelatin of your choice so I'm using the cause of the blue raspberry jello yeah the blue raspberry jello one cup of fruit juice of your choice I use real apple juice I really like the taste of it and it makes it can really bring out the other flavors easy it's kind of a neutral flavor I don't recommend using citrus juices pineapple juice or orange juice nope two and a half ounces of unflavored gelatin I recommend knocks it's very sturdy keeps everything together it's it's pretty hardcore as far as gelatin scum a quarter cup of honey or agave syrup I use agave I recommend natural honey it can be a little difficult to mix but you know it's a lot healthier so either way is good and one tablespoon of tart and sour or citric acid powder in this case I use citric acid powder so I've started off by separating all my ingredients by my citric acid powder my Knox and my jello I'm gonna start by combining all of my gelatin together once they're in the same bowl I can give them a proper stirring okay that's looking good next we're going to be moving on to the agave syrup and the apple juice I've already added the agave syrup to the apple juice I'm just mixing them together now once they are mixed I'm going to add them to the bowl of gelatin powder now I want to whisk this gently I have to make sure it's mixed properly so I don't have clumps of sugar stuck together and you know in the end ruining some of my gummies once it's finished put it to one side and let it bloom while this is happening I'm gonna heat up my vegetable glycerin it'll take about an hour and a half and in that time the gel will starting to thicken so right here I have one cup of cannabis infused vegetable glycerin it's been on low for about an hour and a half it does take some time to heat up and start to smoke so just be patient don't let it smoke too much though or it will burn keep it low keep an eye on it and keep stirring it circularly every now and again with my molds lined up I'm ready to pour my jello into my vegetable glycerin since my jello has been sitting there for an hour and a half it's giving it time to solidify a little bit from here I can scrape it out of the bowl directly into the pan it's good to use a spatula for this part just to ensure you're not wasting anything and you get it all over the bowl at this point I'm going to use my whisk just to give it a nice gentle stirring it's okay if you want to turn the heat up a little bit at this point just to help melt the jello as long as you keep stirring it and afterwards you turn it back down again it's too high for too long you will burn you're just doing this to melt the jello once it looks thoroughly mixed in it's a good color and consistency to you grab your syringe as you can see I have assistance but it's okay if you're by yourself and you have to stop stirring to fill up your molds as long as in between filling your syringe you just give it a little stir give it a little stir so right here I'm basically just showing how I fill them up I'll edit this speed up the process but I try not to keep the syringe too high above because then it can create bubbles and your gummies and just visually it's not very pleasing that's all [Music] my personal favorites are the snowmen the very big you know I can use one syringe or I can use four syringes for me it's nice because it's a great way to control the dosage so I'm just gonna finish up these last little few right here make sure I finished with everything in the pan and then I'm just gonna pop them in the fridge give them a chance to cool down and get them all ready now for the final process I'm gonna keep them in the fridge for 8 to 16 hours usually the longer the better so they stay solid now that a few hours begun by I'm ready to take them out these those are my bears thanks to the Knox gelatin this should pop out righties look at that hey mister bear you look pretty solid I can actually identify what you are cool beans once that's done we can bag them and tag them so here's all my gummies in total not you shabby we got our festive snowflakes good our presence went mine done ripen one of those Halloween on Christmas we got our spiders we got our bats oh yeah and up here we have our snowmen well actually two sets of snowmen the badness to Frosty's you can see how thick those are my personal favorite and then there are smaller counterparts right there alright everyone so that's it thank you very much for coming by and checking out this video I hope you liked making gummies 101 don't forget to Like and subscribe for future videos and any comments or anything as well please feel free to drop them I'd be growing happy smoking happy eating", "5e6z6FHaeeo": "good day everyone today i'm going to be cleaning out my leftover wax containers to make some thc sugar this process was inspired by the fact that everyone is trying to save and reuse as much as possible i'll be following the basics of reduce reuse and recycle personally i am also a pack rat so i have extra containers and there is definitely no shortage of them we will start the process by using 98 ethanol i distilled this ethanol to pull out some of the extra water and isopropyl alcohol then storing it over molecular sieves to continuously pull out the water this process is similar to the start of winterization we then put the containers in the freezer ethanol especially cannot freeze under regular conditions the freezing point of ethanol is negative 173.5 degrees fahrenheit so we shouldn't really have to worry about it 24 hours later i pulled the containers from the freezer i am using a 10 milliliter syringe to pull the ethanol from the containers i then filter the ethanol through a 200 micron syringe filter make sure not to press too hard because you can rupture the filter from here we see we have about 20 milliliters of ethanol however i make a mark on the jar just to see how much we will evaporate i then turn on my heating mantle and place the jar i continuously take temperatures as to make sure it never reaches above 190 degrees fahrenheit ethanol evaporates at around 173 degrees so i should have a 17 degree window in which to evaporate the ethanol finally once i have evaporated most of the ethanol i will transfer to a five milliliter dram then wash the container with about two milliliters of ethanol as to make sure i receive all the thc from the container next i weigh out about 30 grams of baking sugar i will make sure that most of the clumps are removed giving more initial surface area for when i add the ethanol from here i mix in my ethanol and make sure to spread it very well throughout the sugar a vacuum purge would be ideal here however if you use a heating mantle or hot plate with a fan it should work about the same just much much slower i add the sugar container to the heating mantle and turned it on low at this stage we are removing the ethanol from the sugar which will just leave the thc this part of the process took about two hours to fully purge the ethanol it's also important to mention that this is why i pre-distilled my ethanol in order to have less water in my final mixture as well as take out anything that made it denatured like the isopropyl alcohol i continue to stir the sugar until i'm satisfied with how dry it is from here i funnel it into a clean glass jar and label it to thc sugar so that is the process i have taken to create the thc sugar from the my leftover wax containers i was originally going to throw away reduce reuse recycle and until next time have a great rest of your day", "-fWfip8_nkA": "hi and welcome to Kara basics today we learn five easy ways to use cannabis vegetable glycerin tincture marijuana vegetable glycerin or VG tincture is a thick sweet and usually golden to dark brown color tincture which has the amazing capability to allow THC to mix easily into water-based liquids there are several ways of making vegetable glycerin tinctures some involving the cannabis and VG sitting for months on end others use heat to speed the extraction and sometimes alcohol is used to extract the THC which is then combined into the vegetable glycerin we'll put links to some of these methods at the end of the video and in the description but no matter how you make or acquire your tincture here are five easy ways to put it to good use one of the easiest ways to use your vegetable glycerin tincture is to make jello with it you can use it one small package of jell-o and make it just for the directions and once you pour your jello into your boiling water you want to mix that make sure it's thoroughly mixed and then go ahead and add in your vegetable glycerin tincture for one small package of jell-o depending on the potency of your tincture one tablespoon is probably enough next step is to go ahead and make sure that you've fully incorporated and by that I mean really really mixed the hell out of it and makes your VG in there and then now you're going to go ahead and get a cup of cold water ready I like to do that by pouring a water over ice and then using the ice to water and then combine the one cup of cold water with the one cup of hot water and again mix it very thoroughly and making sure that we get that tincture mixed all the way through as much as possible and then as per the directions of the jello put that in the refrigerator for about three or four hours and you're gonna have a nice marijuana infused dessert treat that you can hardly at all even taste the cannabis in this if you use that ratio it's very transparent a nice way to get a small dose of the vegetable glycerin tincture and it really helps if you have a sore throat of anything and that jello next up we have fruit juice because the vegetable glycerin tincture allows the cannabis to become soluble in water you don't really even need heat or anything like that to be able to mix it into a water-based drink such as this is a watermelon drink here but you could use pretty much any kind of drink that you want or a smoothie and just simply take the cap off depending on how much you're gonna put in you might need to take one drink out to make a little room but I've only put about a teaspoon in this and I didn't need to take any room out but just make sure you shake it thoroughly and again now you just want to make sure you incorporate it good so you don't get all of your tincture in one drink so you don't want to shake it a minute or so and then if you let it sit for very long between drinks you'll want to shake it up between each each sort of session okay and conversely as well as you could add it to cold drinks you can also add it to hot drinks so the third method we're showing here is to add it to a cup of tea but of course you could also use coffee and you could also even use a cup of hot cocoa but especially if you're using tea what you want to do is you want to make sure that you go ahead and let your tea steep fully and then go ahead add in your any other flavorings such as honey or lemon or whatever you're adding in and then add the tincture and last and you certainly don't want to add your tincture in first because it's gonna absorb into your tea bag so make sure that you've taken your tea bag out squeezed it out added anything else and then add your tincture and last again mix it thoroughly I like to use the dipping spoon to mix it when it's hot it'll melt all the takes you right off there you've got a nice marijuana infused cup of tea or coffee or cocoa [Music] okay and the next method is to make silly syrup and what silly syrup is is basically taking any kind of syrup or honey I would recommend real maple syrup but I'm just using kind of just cheap breakfast syrup here which has a very similar consistency to the vegetable glycerin tincture and not adding in a ratio I would say at least two to one but you probably want to go maybe even four to one for parts syrup to one part of the vegetable glycerin texture then once you have it combined mix it well again and you can store it just like it is for on the counter for as long as you could store the syrup usually but the one thing is you wouldn't want to make sure that you thoroughly shake or mix it each time before you use it but once it's made you could use it just like you would any other kind of syrup I'm putting it over some waffles here with some melting butter and it's delicious again the artificial maple flavoring and this syrup totally disguised that a pretty large amount of cannabis tincture that was in there you didn't even notice that at all and it's a really effective way to to get your medicine into you on a daily basis without smoking or causing any further harm to you and it's a nice subtle way to do it the only thing about this especially in the syrups or anything like that you want to make sure you label it and keep it out of reach of children if you make any of these kinds of recipes that would sit around and then she could use on in and then our fifth and final method here is to use it as an e-cig juice a lot of people don't know that this vegetable glycerin tincture will just vape perfectly right inside of your ecigs cigarette device and you just however you fill your device normally you just put in the tincture I use a little syringe with the the big needles which is used for that and it's perfect and it vapes good it tastes good you could add in some flavorings some lemon or some pine or whatever flavor you might want to flavor up your tincture but it's great just as it is this episode of cata basics is brought to you about the roughhouse studios of smoke shop selling

you this real quick this is uh my next little uh invention not an invention but in the experiment we'll see what i got here is uh my buddy a good friend there dave west virginia davey sent me some coconut oil this stuff here the plastic anyways i got all these things all right with all my rosin chips from left over from my press i save them up and as you can see i've got a good stock of them right now two big bags full of them there's roughly 14 grams of marijuana in each one of these so i probably got over over a couple pounds there worth of pressing uh what i'm gonna do is i went out and i bought some more coconut oil a couple more jugs of it and i'm gonna put the oil in my slow cooker and i'm going to put in however many of these will go in it you know being overfilled and i'm going to infuse the coconut oil with my rods and chips i watched the video where they did this and you know they only put in like not even maybe 10 of these things a couple more maybe and their tests came back at over 3 500 milligrams of thc in the oil which is pretty potent so um this one here i put a couple in there just to check it out and you can see the amber oil that was clear oil before you can see the amber color in it up against the light there so that is all rosin oil whatever you want to call it medicine anyways long story short once it's all infused in my oil i'm going to take these babies here and somebody gave actually dave it was my buddy dave he gave me the idea i'm gonna take a piece of 2x4 and a drill bit that fits it and put it in my drill press blast out a whole bunch of holes that way i can put the bottom half of these in the holes fill them all up and then put the caps on instead of the last way i did it one at a time you know what a pain in the butt that was so that's what i'm going to be doing with all these babies there's a there's probably a couple of freaking pounds right there easily i could count eight ounces just in the first half so anyways that's that people that's what i'm going to be doing next and i'll give you a quick look here i took some more clones and that bottle flower i don't know what's going on with that thing whatever and one of my clones there i took it out of the corner the other one i don't know those are the first ones i took it had roots so if it goes it goes if not whatever not worried about it a little puny thing anyways but there's this put the first net on first scrugg and that's gone on it's so a lot of filling out to do i'm gonna give it about a week left and veg okay and then i'm gonna flip her in the flour it'll fill out once you put her in the flour they stretch and like i said it's got about another week roughly about a week another week left and it's gonna be close to two months of veg time so that'll be good for that there we go that one is in i got another one so that once these things are you know get up here a bit more a couple feet off i can put a another one across to support the buds hopefully they need it hopefully it goes like that anyway so there you go that's that people i just want to show you what i'm up to that's what i'm doing don't throw away your rosin chips if you're into making it i'm sure people that have been doing it for a while know about it but there is a lot of stuff left in these things tons of oil left on these and i only do two presses a lot of people do three people i know anyways they'll do three presses on it so there you go i should get a good little number back like i said look at this one there's only four pucks in there right now and i got you know an oil turned amber so but you gotta infuse it decarboxylate it with the infusion so that's that i'll let you know how it turns out and uh we'll go from there people all right you all have yourselves a great day like subscribe comment do what you got to do have a great day be safe out there peace out", "ixB4Jdr2CVw": "[Music] hey guys it's Tina and welcome to the antidote the cannabis cooking show that makes medicating delicious today we'll be making a recipe from my cookbook one of the most fun ones in here on page 19 canada's caramel apples i'm super excited to get started on this one I think you really are going to love it the ingredients we'll need for this recipe are four to eight apples I like to use Fuji apples because they're sweet and not so tart but some people like to use like the green granny smith apples but you can use whatever Apple that is your favorite wouldn't treat sticks one-half cup of light corn syrup one cup of brown sugar half a can or seven ounces of sweetened condensed milk 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and any optional treats that you'd like to coat your apples with if anything at all will be medicated today's recipe with 1/2 cup or one stick of cannabis butter if you're new to Canada was cooking and you don't know how to make cannabis butter check out my cannabis cooking 101 online course in the link below alright let's get started the first step in prepping our apples is to bring a pot of water to boil we're going to get that started while they go ahead and pierce our apples so you're gonna take your treat sticks make sure that your out looks pretty level because you don't want it wobbling side-to-side once you actually get the caramel on it so leave it nice and level and then you're going to pierce right down into the stem pressing pretty firmly we'll do it again now that our water is boiling we're going to dip each Apple in the boiling water for five seconds we just want to remove any dirt and any wax from the animal once you remove the Apple from the boiling water make sure to sit on a paper towel and also wipe it off with a paper towel now that our apples are dipped in dry let's get started on our Canada's common sauce we'll begin by combining our butter sugar corn syrup and sweetened condensed milk over medium-high heat we want the butter to melt down a bit before we add the sugar start continuously to make sure that the sugar gets well blended into the butter corn syrup is super sticky so make sure that you get a spatula just to kind of get it all out and into your car now that all the ingredients inside we're going to start continuously for about 25 to 30 minutes or until your candy thermometer which is about 248 degrees tops seems to be getting a little too thick on you it's totally okay to add about one ounce at a time of holding now under candy thermometer has reached 248 degrees while our last ingredients so grab your two teaspoons of vanilla extract import right inside stirring really carefully finally if you're like me and you like salted caramel you can add one teaspoon of salt right into your finished caramel that's what I'm going to do now that my caramel is ready we can start dipping our apples make sure that you have a parchment paper lined baking sheet because you're going to want to put the apples right there when you're done I like to use a swirl motion when I'm [Music] shake off any excess right into the pan if you're going to be using toppings the best way to do it is to hold your topping ball in one hand and dip with the other while the Crom was still hot [Music] and then use some slowly roll your Apple right inside the top we'll do the same thing with the chocolate chips keep rolling and see your Apple is fully covered it's okay to make a mess this is a very messy recipe the apples only need to set a couple of minutes to be ready to eat most of the time when making caramel apples you have some leftover caramel sauce that isn't quite enough to make more apples but we're never going to waste any cannabis caramel sauce so what I like to do is make a little bit of on-the-go snacky so that you can medicate on-the-go or pack it in your work lunch bag or anything like that so what we're going to do is basically make old-school caramel and apples so I like to chop the top right off the top and the bottom of my Apple then I take an Apple slicer you can get this like any dollar store place it right over the top there clear and make some delicious apple slices if you like your Apple a little thinner then these chunks that the spikes makes you can always go back in with the knife to make them just a little bit thinner usually where I do now I'll take our one caramel sauce is poured right into a bowl for dipping you can store any remaining caramel sauce right in a mason jar keep it refrigerated and then pop it in the microwave for a few seconds at a time and you want to use it this sauce is also great for ice cream or pouring on your sundaes if delicious but I'm gonna get some apples in here right now now let's sell them this is definitely gonna be my snack for this afternoon all right guys I really hope you guys enjoyed making cannabis caramel apples with me if you decide to make this recipe please do tag my antidote TV so that I can see what you guys make I would love to see it and let me know in the comments if you like this recipe if you want to see more what kind of recipes you guys would like to see on the show and as always please like share and subscribe I really do appreciate it okay guys I'll see you next week on the antidote [Music]", "W7Un2J1_My8": "[Music] it's mad at Rafal studios welcome to can of a six today we're doing an in-depth tutorial on how to make rosin chip cannabutter and then we're making danca forest Rowdies this episode is sponsored by the wizard puff online head shop you can save money with the code rough house on the tart press rosin press and many other really cool cannabis related products at wizard puff calm now let's get started with the first part of the video which is to make our rosin ship Kennebec for that you want to need rosin chips you're gonna need some butter I use unsalted butter you need an emulsifier such as sunflower or soy liquid lecithin and that is optional the amount of cannabis Ross and chips you need is you kind of Center you need three to four times the amount of rosin chips that you would regular cannabis so for a cup I'm using 66 grams which is a little over two ounces which would equal to a little over 1/2 ounce of regular cannabis okay so let's get started the first step is going to be to decarboxylate and some my previous videos I didn't decarboxylate the cannabis chips but I found out through some testing with my tea check that I do need to decarboxylate it will help so we're going to go ahead and decarboxylate crumble that up in an oven safe dish put some foil on it to keep down the smell and then we're going to put that in the oven to decarboxylate it it takes about the same amount of time as it what if it was on decarboxylated or unpressed cannabis so we're going to do it for 25 minutes 250 degrees Fahrenheit that gives us enough time to clarify our butter now I'm going to do all the steps today to make as good a can of butter as I can so one part of that is to clarify your butter that's and we're moving on the milk solids and so we will have a more pure butter oil that's remaining that butter oil will make it more bioavailable by concentrating the oil instead of having the milk solids still contain in there so it'll also help it be more shelf stable by removing the milk solids which will make it ruin quicker if you left it out on the counter so those the reasons that we clarify herb butter you heat that over medium medium-high heat until it foams and you take that skim and skim the white foam off and then if you get to the point of heat where it starts making the little burnt pieces on the bottom go ahead and cut your heat off you don't want to scorch your butter and if you get it a little brown it's okay it'll have a nice nutty taste but don't burn your butter okay and then after that you should have your cannabis decarboxylated your butter is clarified and we're going to do a new step here that I don't usually do and this is colored emulsifying step so what I'm doing is I'm taking the cannabis and putting in the hopper of a food processor while it's still hot or still warm at least from the oven from the clarification the butter and that's going to help soften up these rosin chips that are compressed and really hard and I've also added in my soy or this is sunflower lecithin which is an emulsifier that's going to help homogenized all these items together so you see I gave you several pulses there with a food processor that's going to grind up those rows and chips and help us extract out that remaining cannabis that's lodged inside of those pressed chips and I've given it about 15-20 seconds total just pulse it a few times there and you can see what what's happened is now those rosin chips that were you know thick and I'll press together have loosened up temperature and both that and the pulsing it have really loosened it and started the infusion process already but we haven't infused it yet so we're still going to use the heat infusion process so I'll put that back into the oven safe dish I've used the same piece of foil and I put it back in the oven 250 degrees Fahrenheit for two hours for infusion alright so we're just about finished with our can of butter here this is some really really dark and dank can of butter because we're using four times the amount of cannabis that we would usually use of course it's going to be a lot darker in color and you can see that really shows through a lot there alright so we're going to now strain out the cannabis and we're using our fine mesh strainer you're just going to strain it through and I'm using the back end of a silicon paddle there just to press and press and let it sit and let the all the oil press through and run through there because you don't want to leave anything in there you're going to lose some and you saw I started with three sticks of butter but I'm going to end up with one cup so I actually always count on losing a third amount of my butter between the clarifying it and all that and what's left in there and then what you can do with the cannabis let's go over put it in your compost and just put that back into the ground where it came from [Music] and now we'll continue on with the dank forest brownies recipe for that you need a half a cup of canned butter we just made a large chocolate brownie mix yes a store-bought mix 2 eggs 3 tablespoons of water 12 ounces of coconut pecan icing and some chopped pecans about a cups of chopped pecans okay the first step is going to be a 10 ml to measure out your butter now if you're using a store-bought mix I am recommending it here go ahead and measure out the amount that it says in your recipe it probably say to use oil vegetable oil just replace that with this butter oil that we made okay you might say 1/3 cup my say 2/3 mine's a half a cup alright so we're going to have that measured out and if you already had your can of butter or frozen or you know hardened up or stored up you'd want to you know put it in some dish of hot water till they got liquefied to measure it out properly ok when our leftover counted butter I'm going to store that back in refrigerator and a hair tie container and there I'm using this supreme triple Chunk brownie mix it's so good and I'm using the large size to make a family pan but I'm not going to make a family pan we're making big thick brownies okay and you're going to use the store or in the box recipes it's a mine called for water eggs and then the oils which I use the butter ok and then just mix it up as per the directions really simple to make brownies you just mix all the ingredients together and just mix it mix until you have a nice creamy consistency just like that everything mixed in together [Music] ok I'm using a 9 by time 9 by 9 pan for this recipe that's what I find to be perfect so if you use that same mix and the same size it should work out like this but otherwise follow the instructions for your recipe as far as cooking it goes ok for mine of baking that at 350 Fahrenheit for about 45 minutes and this is just sort of a pro tip here if you're gonna toast your nuts and I highly recommend it I mean if you're gonna put the nuts on there just toast them do it tastes great and it's a perfect to use the oven that's already on so while your brownies are cooking go ahead and toast your nuts in there to chop and toast them alright but then after your brownies are done you know how to check that by putting the little the toothpick in there when it comes out clean your brownies are done you're gonna go ahead and let that cool completely before you ice it so it it's the hardest part letting that cool and I'm using this Betty Crocker pecan coconut icing because I'm making like sort of like a black forest cake that flavor but with the the dang brownie so that's the dank forest brownies and so just loaded up with that coconut icing just just smear it all over I mean heavier like and a gross amount almost but just just load it up and then those nuts that we toasted earlier are cooled off and so you can press them down into that icing so that they don't fall off and kind of make it less later mess later it's just kind of use your palm a little bit wet your palm and just press them down into that it would be perfect and then you're done you're ready to enjoy these bad boys and these are so delicious you just won't believe how much that sweetness and that big thick icing on top and those toasted nuts adds to it you'll love these also be sure to check out wizard puffs calm they're a big-time sponsor of us we love them used to co roughhouse to save 10% off they have bars pipes vaporizers and rosin press machines are very convenient I hope you enjoyed this recipe if you did hit

kitchen sorry for the shaky camera but I just had my silly cat max jump on my shoulder Oh Manny way we are going to show you how I make my canna chocolates I make it with my half a cup of can of oil and it's coconut oil infused with cannabis I make it myself and a cup of chocolate milk chocolate for flavouring this time around I'm going to use raspberry laron oils they're fabulous I use them all the time I make heart candies as well and I use these flavorings in them too so sorry I'm gonna stutter a little bit I'm a little nervous this is my first video I'm gonna put up on YouTube but anyway so and this is my little spoon that I use with I used two of these this is half a teaspoon of measuring with the oil and then in these is what I used as my moles so I'm gonna pause it so I can put my half a cup of kind of oil in to the chocolate and then I melt it that way melt it down slowly in the microwave some people use like a double boiler or whatever but I don't do that I do it slowly in the microwave it doesn't take too long especially if I'm pouring my kind of oil over top of that and it helps the mixture actually it's probably good to go but I just put it in there I'm gonna have to put it in the microwave just to melt it a little further but dying out and then I melt it down mix it together and we'll be right back okay so we're back I melted down the chocolate and it's just a little bit shy of one cup but I'm not too worried about that because um that amount right there will probably make 45 chocolates so I've set out my molds I have my small these are half a teaspoon each these are a full teaspoon so this is a full dose one of these is a full dose you'll have to take two of these depending on your tolerance level some take two three four depending on my pain level my tolerance level is quite high so I switched from smoking to edibles and back and forth so anyway this is what I do I take a full teaspoon of the raspberry flavoring I put it in there stir it around and because it's just me doing this I'm gonna have to pause it again sorry okay so we're back so I've got a tablespoon of the raspberry oil in there flavoring mine if you're wondering within my little box it's all my Laurent oils she's fabulous I loved her oils I use them all the time there's the raspberry but I've got because I make hard candies too I've got different flavoring in there I have a green apple caramel butterscotch root beer creme de menthe and orange I believe so anyway here we go this is pretty well good to go just scrape off the knife it's kind of hard to do when you're looking at it through the camera all right the whatever so then I take my little half a teaspoon and I just measure it out obviously you just take whatever because it's going in the mom like I said it takes two of these because they're half of teaspoons I just find that the smaller spoon goes better into the molds without making too much of a mess so here we go we're gonna go in one of the malls takes two it is to get it falling up as you can see it's pretty level oh don't have it so we just keep going and going and going and going you have no time lapse so I'm gonna pause it and I'm gonna get these done and then they go into the fridge and they sit in the fridge I don't know about 10-15 minutes you can check them after ten minutes because but because my molds are fairly thick molds I keep them in there probably about 15-20 minutes just to be sure that they're all solidified and they're not going to again max jumping on my shoulder on you jerk ball just to make sure that they're solid enough that I can pop them out of the molds and bag them and put them in the freezer so I am going to pause it and fill the molds and put them in the freezer so we'll just end it here but this is what we do and I will pull them out of the molds next okay so there are linear molds and I'm a little medicated because I went licking the spoon after I filled all the molds up it's very good taste yummy that's why they call them edibles because they're so good anyway I'm gonna put them in the fridge now and the next time you see them they'll be ready to be popped out of the malls so instead of waiting for the other ones to solidify cuz it'll take 15 minutes anyway so I'm just gonna cheat here anyway so these are ones that I already made that I put in the freezer and I find that these chocolates I've had them in the freezer not these particular ones but some of my edible chocolates in the freezer for just over a month and they still taste great so I've never pushed it any longer than like maybe five six weeks because sometimes they might get that freezer burn taste so just keep it to your personal preference anyway they might not even last that long but me I don't always eat edibles so I just make them and put them in the freezer so that they're there when I do want them anyway so this is all I do is just you just push on the back of these silicone molds and they just pop right out and then I put them in my bag ease I put about a dozen in each bag and then because they're little freezer baggies they don't hold a lot anyway and then I just seal them off right okay so I got everyone's in there these are crime to match and the ones are in the freezer they're our raspberry so that's it so I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please put them down below and I'll try and answer them as as soon as I can I'll try and keep an eye on it I don't anticipate too many people watching it because I know there's a lot of videos about edibles on the internet but I just thought I'd try my hand on it and on my channel so again this is flower child and I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please post them below and I'll try my hardest answer them okay smile have a great day be true be honest be respectful stay true and stay unique bye", "Ie5Qg2A6I7g": "what's up guys we're here in the chronic kitchen where as you know we make great food and even better Rossi what's up guys we're back and we're gonna do something super special it's the holiday season we're doing Rasen infused snowball cookies we have our rosin right here it's about a gram we just pressed this we pressed about 4.1 grams of a motorbreath and we got about 1.1 grams back that's super high yield we did the math about 27% we just pressed it using the next Smasher XP the XP is great because of the pressure gauge we did this at about 700 725 material pressure that's pretty light for doing flour but we wanted to keep it light to get that really clean looking product back we did about 205 206 degrees you know not too hot not too cold and we left in about 200 seconds that's a you know longer time than usual but because of that lower pressure you can add a little bit more time get that good yield back and that clean results so we're really excited to deke are with the mini today this is our number one selling product everybody has a mini right now and we just came out with an expansion mini D carb this thing makes activating your rosin super easy so get yours now just came out we're gonna throw our rods and in that mini D carb we're gonna put in the Nook Smasher mini 250 degrees 25 minutes we're gonna do that and then we'll get started making those snowball cookies what's up everybody this is chef Eric here at the crown and kitchenware today for our holiday recipe we're going to be making snowball cookies absolutely my most favorite cookie of all time there are sometimes called Mexican wedding cookies but they're basically buttery and delicious shortbread cookies that are covered in powdered sugar and we're gonna make ours even more delicious today by adding in the fabulous motorbreath rose and then we have d carving right over there we have about eight hundred and twenty-five milligrams of THC be carving over there and the batch we're making today's 418 cookies so you're going to end up with about 46 milligrams of THC per cookie give or take some see how it goes when you make this recipe just make sure that your total amount of rosin is divided by 18 so you can get your portions just about right because you don't want to be givin

and today boy today we're looking at some yummy treats thanks to bc bud supply thank you so much bc butt supply you guys are making 2021 amazing i love the idea of having gummy extracts and and maybe some other ways to to enjoy your cannabis we're going to dive into it on this video right now first up let's talk about these twisted extracts bc butt supply sent out a indica we got indica this one's the black cherry this is the only one that actually is called a z-bomb or z-zed zed bomb what is it or canadian right um like all of them it's in a 8 by 10 milligrams dose don't know why that was so hard to say up next we have apple this one's a sativa these ones the next two are jelly bombs i think basically anything that's an indica is branded as a zzz bomb and anything jelly is everything else uh and then up last but not least definitely not least pineapple jelly bombs you'll notice these ones here on this side here unlike the other two who have the big fat thc warning these ones are cbd oops rcbd so um jelly bombs these ones are pineapple i will say this i um i had thrown the apple and the pineapple in the fridge after having a bit of a black cherry only because i thought the black cherry was a little bit too sticky and one of the ways you know to help deal with resin and stickiness is to chill it right so i thought i'd make a bit more malleable and i thought i almost wrecked the pineapple ones but after they they thought and everything you can feel them they've got a bit of a different texture than the apple and the black cherry i think this is because just like on the packaging they don't have the fancy thc warning i think they're just they've got a different compound right so they've got a bit of a different texture i think the pineapple flavoring is fantastic with the cbd these candies um if you're doing one of those micro dosing with cbd or um or any of the other benefits of cbd this is definitely a great way to consume it um especially if you want like something like on the down low and i mean how can you get in trouble there's no there's no warning like there's this is this is easy these on the other hand um i will say personal preference the apple was better than the black cherry i would say that a personal life if you gave me a black cherry candy and an apple cherry i wouldn't touch the black cherry i'm not a big fan of cherry so maybe that's it i don't like that's so i'm just giving that as a caveat i'm not a big fan of cherry candies uh i will say the black cherry when you pop it in your mouth you get black cherry it's a good black cherry it tastes good it's almost a lot of flavor and it's almost like it's there because it's trying to overpower the aftertaste of the black cherry and it's almost as bad where you're like oh i wish i was okay yeah no we're good we're good um so my only suggestion would be with the black cherry is um it wasn't nearly as bad the second time and i guarantee if you're watching this and you're gonna since i've given you the heads up it's not gonna be bad for you either uh it was just the kind of the oh surprise of it um that said the second time go around i did have a drink on hand i ate it i started tasting the bad calm i go wash the whole thing down we're good and i had a great evening uh the apple on the other hand i would say i don't know why like duh it's gonna be a green apple the packaging is green the candy inside is green it's gonna be a green sour apple right so i was really impressed with the flavor of these when i popped them in my mouth and i guess the flavor was if you want an example or an analog um the flavor was so good my wife actually realized that we had some jolly ranchers fruit roll-ups of all things in the pantry for our daughter and you know figured we were having some jolly ranchers candies and thought why not grab her something of a similar flavor the only thing i'll say is um where the black cherry tries to overpower the uh cannabis taste the apple kind of tries to pair itself with it almost the sour apple is almost a nice tangy flavor that kind of pairs with the kind of i don't want to say tangy taste of marijuana but not the skunky eve do you know what i mean it's uh it's it they pair really nicely and this this i definitely could just enjoy one of these gummies without a drink um definitely definitely enjoy this so if we go over to the website um i just searched for twisted extracts and i was just going to come over here and i wanted to show you all of the different flavors they have but before i do that i want to i just want to point something out here that i just noticed yeah one a single package is 14 bucks do i think that's worth it yeah it's definitely worth it now you're telling me that if i buy them in packs of six five four or three i'm gonna be taking a discount because what's what's three of those that's that's all i don't want to do math right now but i know i definitely know 42 is probably around it but 38 is definitely less than it and i'm getting a bigger discount the bigger i go um how many flavors are there one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve so if you want to try all 12 flavors uh you have to buy two six packs so before we go any further i want to mention one thing uh with the candy themselves they are this is just something like a little tidbit that i kind of might be a selling feature for you um each candy is like one solid piece of gummy but because of the way they're molded they've got divider lines kind of they're not pre-cut but they're kind of grooves they're pre-grooved we'll say and it makes it really easy for cutting out your doses and you get you know eight single doses of tin just like it says on the package i found myself needing at least two of the squares so 20 milligrams what i really liked about this is that it was really easy for me to measure out my dosage where and we'll get to the mystic metabols and they're great but each candy is 30 milligrams okay back to the website so what flavors do we have here so we have uh apple sativa black cherry indica those are the two flavors we've tried there's also a cherry sativa that says on a black cherry might be a different cherry uh haley's grape comet that sounds really good it's a one to one so you're getting cbd and thc in that one mango sativa orange sativa one to one orange sativa uh so i believe yeah sativa peach cbd jelly uh pineapple cbd that's the one we have here raspberry indica oh that's the one to one and then there's also a raspberry indica it looks like it's a blue raspberry by the packaging look at that that's that's got to be blue raspberry right i kind of want to try that one i think i'll be ordering one of those for sure um the z bombs too right so i definitely uh want to try and eat maybe more than two before bed and see see if that helps maybe i'm just not getting enough and finally watermelon haley's comment i buy that too that sounds delicious so maybe what do i need kyran's ordering the three pack just like this that's what we'll do i'll get a sativa an indica and a cbd that's what i would buy up next let's talk about the mystic metabols i was sent out some sour keys six in a pack three milligrams each sorry 30 milligrams each and cola blasts these cola blasts are actually really yummy they're not so when i thought i was getting cola blasts i thought you know remember those smooth coke bottles when you were a kid i thought we were getting those but and then there was always those like cheap knockoff ones that looked like coke bottles but they were all like coated in sugar so i got them and i would actually say these are better than the knockoffs as a kid yeah man these are great these are super yummy i would almost say for a thc gummy i don't think the smooth and i think that's why i was so excited i was like i want to see this train wreck to be honest fantastic choice going with this you don't even take the taste to see the thc and these guys at all they taste like coke bottles and like it's almost a bad thing because there's one left i'll be honest there's a reason why there's only one left and it's because i promised my wife that no one would eat it until we're done the video you know what i mean like these are great the sour keys on the other hand are also fantastic funny enough uh six again same kind of dosage but the sour keys were still quite impressive the only thing i would say about sour keys and for me it's a bit of a knock against them for my wife she said that was a that was a for them uh i think it depends how you like your sour keys i love a fresh soft chewy rip apart sour key where my wife says she enjoys the hard chewy ones this guy is somewhere in between but he's still a bit too close to the hard side for me uh just just because i thought it was fun isn't a comparison and because my wife felt bad that we were eating sour keys the other night and my daughter wasn't able to touch them when i was shooting you know some some fancy b-roll that you'll see in the video uh she bought her some sour keys from um walmart these are walmart specials these are those aren't sour keys these are um what were they tangy tongue teasers so i just want to show you these are the tiny ton teasers and then this is the sour key from mystic medables i think like these are clearly clearly knock offs this straight up dangerously you could probably get this lost in a pack of regular sour in fact i gotta make sure i put this you know better yet i'll just make sure i eat these ones the fake ones because then we're not gonna have any problems i think my favorite part about the fun shaped so just to throw these two at each other for for a second the twisted extracts are for some people who who want a more precision dosing aren't really here to have goof off and have i don't want to say these are for people who are uptight but you know there's there's a reason these these kind of gummies they taste good like i mean there's a reason vitamins come as gummies right they taste good they're easier to to to consume and these are easier because you're going to be able to to dose them out properly personally where i'm at in my life in 2021 during the global pandemic um having some candies that bring me back to when i was a kid and then give me a little bit of a high i think is kind of what i need right now and why i'm leaning towards these guys more because who doesn't want you know to have do you enjoy the candy that you had as a kid when life was simpler and then to enjoy that ride when that high kicks in man over here on the website uh looks like already it's a similar deal to the extracts where if you want to buy them in packs of six five four or three you're going to see a quote-unquote bill bulk discount my interpretation not their words flavors do we have guys one two three four five six so all six so what six do we have cola blast which we've tried is fantastic i want another bag grape shock so like sour grape sounds good gummy bears peach buzzies how much you want to bet those are like uh fuzzy peaches those again those are another one that you get them like a fresh pack oh man sour keys got those and watermelon sours how much you want to bet those are uh the watermelon slices so i know kyran so what's chiron ordering i'm basically ordering a three pack of the extracts and a six pack of the metal balls because i want one of each all right last on the block but definitely not the least presents got the most kick i'm talking about the space juice from milky way extracts yes i believe that is the same milky way extracts from our other concentrates video so milky way extracts is back now with they are 1 000 milligram thc 3 ounces flavored syrup this one this is it's going to make fun of this i'm sorry it's got fire grape fire i mean if i was going to put any symbol from from like like a printer that has a i guess that's the one i would i wouldn't want to put toxic right so fireworks it's not a spicy grape heads up it's a delicious grape um the only other knock i have on the product itself i would try and find new packaging i don't know what my issue is it's my personal problem i don't like that it comes in like a cough syrup bottle i mean i know that that's fantastic for dosing because you're i don't know if you're gonna be able to see it on the camera yeah you have your dosing size along the sides i think that's wonderful um i just don't like it being in a cough syrup bottle i have kids in the house i don't maybe that's what it is i don't want it to get mistaken as something that it definitely is not um that aside the actual product itself is fantastic i was reading the product's uh description again and i thought i had this great brainwave where i would mix the uh space juice since i had grape uh with some sprite or 7up we had seven up it was great it was fantastic my wife and i made one i think we had some extra vodka lying around i'm not saying that made its way into the drink at all um but what i think i actually would do with grape in the future and actually this is what i'm going to do i've already got a couple ideas for a couple martinis you look up um grape schnapps recipes and just substitute the schnapps for this i don't know what ratio you'd want to do i think i would want to feel like maybe a one-to-one hell do a one-to-one what what why not just be careful because this stuff does pack quite a punch and uh like the description does say a little goes a long way um if you are someone who does have a higher tolerance though i feel like um i don't want to say throw caution to the wind because no one likes being way too high it's not fun but um i know my tolerances were a little high so i had to take a little bit more i went a little too slow low and slow too low and too slow basically um uh and i feel like i wasted some of it that's my only real big regret with this is that i feel like i wasted some of but by not having enough of it and so that little bit that i did use went to no good i think i think this would also be another great way to consume cannabis especially if you if you have troubles because i know a lot of people uh even gummy vitamins are too hard to swallow or chew and i mean i cough medicine is really easy to take get one of those cough medicine over on the website milky way extracts there's only one product but there are multiple flavors we have fruit punch grape mango peach strawberry and watermelon personally i think i'm throwing on my cart i think i only want one because they're so expensive but i'm really torn between peach and watermelon i might have to do both might have to do both all right guys so which ones looked the yummiest to you was it the twisted extracts are those look the yummiest or are you a child like me and you really enjoyed the sour keys and uh coke bottles or do you just like drinking and you don't need none of that alcohol but you still want an adult drink then i think this is actually a really cool way i would just treat like i think the reason why i want peach is because i drank way too much peach schnapps as a kid and i i got some ideas of where to put the peach it goes really good in iced tea oh my god peach iced tea with this would be so good okay i'm ordering peach thank you so much for watching the video please hit like and i once want to say bc bud supply was so amazing to offer this product uh they are on twitter i know i've talked to them directly over there on twitter and

there but he's barking right towards the neighbor's house and i think he's trying to say hey i'm over here come get me follow and share copy and paste nate's garden on all social media platforms thanks david t baker monique jack i hope all is well tom shout out to langer i don't know what that means tom oh you're you're shouting out yourself okay how has everyone been um great question earl how is everyone been and i want to talk to you guys about the rosin chips that i'm about to smoke um i don't think they've been slightly decarboxylated at um 180 degrees at all i don't think and for two minutes at 180 degrees river you're not getting any decarboxylation you got to go up to 275 river there's a huge difference between 180 degrees and 275 degrees and i doubt that there's any decarboxylation going on within two minutes at 180 degrees if you're doing 180 degrees and you're trying to decarboxylate you're looking at like 30 minutes at that at that temperature right right okay so um but it's a great question river is why why do rosin chips get you so high i didn't finish my story you kind of cut me off before i could even start talking but the story is yesterday i was doing rosin and i always take my rosin chips and i put them in this jar and i saved them then i stripped the uh the the oil off of that with um alcohol and then i'll use that to make my trendy paint oil but hey tiffany good morning teresa hi monique you're planning and smoking nice masks you two i'm proud of you monique that's great so well nobody present river nobody presses at 275 you should already know that river um you know don't don't sit there and act like oh i didn't know what temperature you're pressing at though if you're pressing at 275 blah blah what are you [ __ ] what are you talking about river what are you talking about now you're just now you're just trying to show me that you know absolutely nothing about what you're talking about and you're actually trying to talk your way out of not knowing what you're talking about stop if you guys would just admit that you're right i don't know that's why i'm asking instead of trying to act like oh i know i'm just trying to get the i'm just trying to see what you're where you're coming from don't don't come at me like that i [ __ ] hate that [ __ ] it is so fake and phony and i can spot that [ __ ] from a mile away river okay it doesn't matter what temperature i'm pressing at nobody presses it too [ __ ] 75 okay and the reason why is because you don't want to decarboxylate your oil right right you decarboxylate it when you [ __ ] smoke it that's not the point that's not the reason why we are pressing the oil out now along those lines if you were trying to press medicine out of the rubbable medicine out of the cannabis then yeah you turn your plates up to 275 300 degrees squish it out and it will be decarboxylated but that's not really what you want is it you want to smoke these dabs you want to get high and you want to put them in your bong and you want to set them on [ __ ] fire that's the point of this conversation okay and know that they don't get decarboxylated in the in the press of course not so the reason i decided yesterday i had these ooey gooey pieces of rosin chips that were just on the crust on the outside of one of my rosin pucks and i looked at it and i said well i'm not going to press it because it's such a small amount i cut it off and save it and it was sitting in front of me and i'm looking at it and i said man i'm going to [ __ ] smoke that i'm going to smoke it on this show i'm gonna gather that all up that thin pressed cannabis coated with oil i'm gonna flake it up put it in my bowl press it down and smoke it see what happens i don't remember much after that but i do remember this when i to hit that ball i got so [ __ ] high i didn't know who the [ __ ] i was where i was what i was doing i lost complete perception of everything for a couple of seconds i got so [ __ ] high and i thought to myself man that wasn't even a concentrated dab that was some oil sitting on some flat bud flat bud now i get high as [ __ ] when i put oil on a bud and i smoke it down i do and it it gets me more high than a dab it gets me more high than smoking a bowl but man when i smoked those rosin chips that were coated with oil yesterday i got even more high it's not the dry rosin chip okay it's the edges that are covered with oil and this is what i think is going on i think because that cannabis flower is squished so thin that when you smoke it you're literally getting a different chemical reaction with the oil that's sitting on it than when you're just smoking straight bud it might be concentrated heat it might have something to do with humidity it might have something to do with a chemical um meshing that's going on like a um like an entourage type effect and i think that's it i think we're hitting on it i think smoking rosin chips that are ooey gooey with oil like i'm about to do right now for you i saved this from you remember yesterday i told you i was gonna smoke this thing i saved it for today's show i think that it is entouraging your brain in other words you're getting more of everything that the cannabis flower travels with the thc to to spread it around um jack you're not going to change my subject i'm just going to block you you know if you can't stick on subject and you think you're going to you think you're going to control what goes on in the show i'll just [ __ ] block you you know try to try to stick to this subject and maybe you won't get blocked guys that's that's just a little bit of a tip i love to hear from you and i want you to ask me questions i want you to be paying attention what i'm talking about and it's like if i if i walked up to that guy in person and i was talking to him face to face and let's say we're talking about [Music] telephones just grab something random and him and i having a conversation about telephones and i say you know the thing about telephones is is you can have a home phone or a smartphone and the thing about a smartphone is you could walk out of your house and you could use it everywhere now you go in the conversation and he says yeah i like ferraris and porsches well we're not talking anymore are we so it's not sorry to change the subject it's sorry i'm a narcissistic [ __ ] who can't sit for [ __ ] five minutes and listen to somebody else talk you're not the kind of person that i like having conversations with you're the kind of person that when i'm talking to you're not listening because all you're doing is thinking about what the next thing is that you're gonna say that's not a conversation that's a [ __ ] narcissist [ __ ] you all right so where were we this right here is going to get me more high probably than just about anything else i could ever [ __ ] smoke i'm really excited i wanted to share it with you guys this morning let me just find a lighter right here i just jumped on how you been stephanie i've been good thanks for asking steph look guys i understand you guys have your own [ __ ] going on this is not the time to come in here and try to make the show about you okay this is not the time when i'm doing a show like this you guys need to realize it you need to realize oh he's he's talking about something important we should listen and we should participate in the conversation and not come in and show everybody how narcissistic we can be all right there'll be more times when we'll be able to talk about you but this isn't that time all right i i i just uh i just hope you guys get that i hope you understand you know that we're all a big group here we're a family and we need to work together not against each other okay and if i'm the leader of this group and i have a topic then it's up to you to listen to the topic and try to pile on try to add to it try to try to um to foster and and help that conversation grow instead of taking away from it what the [ __ ] is wrong with some of you guys i just don't understand what's going on in your heads man you know this this show's getting way more serious we're getting a lot more attention there's going to be some big names coming in here in the next couple of days and i need you guys to start acting like it you know if you got to pretend pretend but don't act like the show is about you every day you know because it's not and i just need you guys to realize that all right and there's plenty of times when we will be talking and you'll be able to bring up that sort of thing but i need you guys to figure it out man just kind of hey he's talking about rosin chips hey the title is about ross and chips hey he's about to smoke some [ __ ] rosin chips hey he's explaining about decarboxylation and he's talking about you know why this is getting him so high and blah blah blah blah but i want to ask you know what's the [ __ ] price of tea in china what come back on another show okay and and maybe bring that up or maybe when we're all talking about it bring it up this is not your show and if you want to start a show and talk about that stuff go right ahead i i support you you know if i'm not talking about what you want to hear go somewhere else i support you see how hard it is to get 55 people to listen to you for three minutes it's not easy it's really not easy and you can see what i [ __ ] have to deal with then with some of you little narcissistic [ __ ] working against me you know i'm just like uh i'm struggling here guys just to stay [ __ ] treading water it's not a party when i have to block people it's not a party you know it's it's sad i want especially when i have to block legitimate viewers that are just not contributing to the conversation okay i'm gonna get us back on track i'm the engineer i'm gonna get this train going down the track okay you ready we're talking about rosin chips we're talking about the fact that i smoked some uh yesterday and i got more high yesterday than i have been in a very very very long time i had already been smoking i was already high but i hit those rosin chips and [ __ ] something happened so i said today i'm going to wake up i'm going to do a show we're going to talk about rods and chips i'm going to hit that bowl i'm going to see what it does to me and see if i get the same effect that's why it's a question are rosin chips the most potent form of smoking cannabis i don't know but boy oh boy yesterday they sure seemed like they were so here we go without any further ado yes river i explained it to you it's like you ask questions and then you don't listen to the answer i'm going to say it again yes you can carve box you can decarboxylate at temperatures lower than 180 degrees or lower than 275 degrees yes but it takes a much longer time not the two minutes or three minutes that it's in a rosin press getting pressed out you're not decarboxylating at 180 degrees you're just not and that's got nothing to do with it and besides use your brain river as soon as your lighter hits that cannabis you're decarboxylating it anyway why would it matter if it was decarboxylated before decarboxylated while you're smoking it it's the exact same chemical process it's the exact same stuff going into your lungs it makes no sense so do me a favor i appreciate you participating in the conversation but that's got nothing to do with it so just let that go okay that's not it it's not decarboxylation it's the wrong path you're walking down are we good i want to hit this [ __ ] ball it's going to catch on fire and i'm going to celebrate all right no law regarding cannabis cannabis isn't chiseled for all i'm doing my donald trump cheers why because easter easter sunday be a beautiful day for the covey to just disappear and people will all be in the peers of the churches celebrating and reveling and worshiping their dear dear leader me donald j trump the ruler of the world hey moo rhino man moo moo i wish i'd see you more often my friend good to see you cheers to you uh that guy came in and said not to change the subject and i really i wasn't really too interested in reading what else he said after that just to start a sentence off with not to change the subject that's like starting a sentence off with i'm going to be an [ __ ] here you should have just said that i'm going to be a subversive non-supporting narcissistic [ __ ] here and ask you a completely non-related question to what you're discussing right now and that's why i know some people don't read the chat when they're doing shows like this but man i'm always going to read your chat even if it's scrolling by at a million miles a second i'm always going to read your chat and when we do interviews your chat won't be on screen but i will still be reading your chat understand that um i'm not gonna let some [ __ ] troll [ __ ] say something that's gonna fly across the screen during one of my interviews it's just not gonna happen um it's it's nothing against you guys because i know you guys are great but you guys know just like i do i have no control over who comes in here and what they say um and i'm like i said i do have control over what's flashed on my screen and i will control that kelly cox thank you sava what's up long time no see sava wow that was a life-changing dab i did says debbie genman um well i gotta tell you i am h.a.f and boy when i hit that i didn't even know who i was again it is so potent and i didn't even get the most the biggest hit i could have off of it do you guys remember it was the second or third hit off that bowl that got me hey brad i'm glad you made it karsten is a splash willow says morning good morning willow there's the song called willow that none of you have heard it was from a local band in orlando um i can't remember the name of the band it was somebody's name though you know like leonard skinner it was somebody's name um i

just said to her at first i said you know what when you need the oil you can play you can pay triple price for it she's like i'll never buy your oil i said then you know and then i responded to that i said you know what then never how's that you'll never have any how's that or i said is that better oh and i think i'm at carson i think i'm out but i got to tell you i i really enjoyed the back and forth because i know how much [ __ ] pain oil helps people triage oil helps so many people and i know it helps me it makes my life better let me tell you something and let me tell you if this has ever happened to any of you press number one i'm laying in bed late at night and for me it was an electric shock feeling in my um it was i think it was in my knee i told you guys about this it was in a spot where i'd never gotten it before and i was like oh my god i was like it'll go away it'll go away it wouldn't go away after like 10 seconds it was really bad i was like i got trendy paint oil next to my next to my um look david c baker's already hitting one if you've ever been in bed and you've ever had a pain and you reached for your triage oil and it helped you press number one i was laying in bed i reached for my triage oil i put it on that thing that felt like an electric shock it was a nerve pain from when i had a motorcycle accident back in i broke my neck back in 2000 or 2001. i don't i forgot it's like erased from my memory so i can never remember the year isn't that weird i think it was 2 000. i i figured out by going to seriously i don't know but if i went to my youtube channel and checked out the year that i did a show at the house of blues and i think just look at the year that's the [ __ ] year it was thanksgiving that's the year that i broke my neck in february march february or march can't even remember that i can't remember the month so anyway that's not me losing my mind that's the fact that i got hit by a car so hard that it affected my memory from that portion of my life i can remember very little from that those years it's it's really it was traumatic i had the traumatic brain injury i'm sure my brain got rocked so um i grab that pain oil i rub it on the [ __ ] shop it goes away as soon as the oil touches the skin i'm like i put on like oh god instant relief i was like oh god i was like i am so thankful that i made this i am so happy i am so happy that i made this and that i've got it sitting next to my bed when i need it it's there for me when i need it i'm so happy i put it next to my bed i put it back and i went right to sleep and i just i felt so good knowing that i was like man i thought one of the last thoughts i had that night when i went to sleep it was just like a week or two ago was was i'm so proud of myself for inventing this [ __ ] this is just i'm just so fulfilled right now this is just amazing and i went and you know to have that thought and a [ __ ] what the rest of you say because you know i might be a cool guy and people might think that every single one of you is a lackey ball licking [ __ ] a wannabe you know suck-up brown-nosing audience member you know everyone else like that stupid [ __ ] [ __ ] looking in would assume that about all of you but i know from my own personal experience how this has changed my life and i know from all of you telling me your personal experiences that it's changed your lives too that it's not just [ __ ] my own personal perception or placebo you know that really helps and when i've got something that feels like it i'm sticking my finger in a [ __ ] socket it feels like i'm [ __ ] getting an electric shock and this makes it go away i'm [ __ ] man i think about that dumb [ __ ] on twitter and i think to myself you know the the audacity of people like that is unmeasurable and i can't even begin to fathom the amount of of ignorance it would take somebody to ignore hundreds of people on twitter with hashtag trendypaintoil saying it did this it did that it did this it did that it did this it did that it did this over 50 uses here's the 50 uses it did this here's a picture of my neighbor's knees it did this it did that it did this it did that here's my name here's my name here's my name here's running here's my facebook here's my facebook here's my twitter here's my twitter here's my facebook here's my facebook here's my twitter here's my twitter

__ ] show and like i said i'm shocked at that dumb [ __ ] on twitter shooting her fat [ __ ] [ __ ] mouth off as i am as that feeling when i feel like i'm sticking my [ __ ] finger in a [ __ ] socket in the goddamn wall and i'm not mad that michael malus is not accepting this do you guys remember what i told you about a week about a week ago i said please don't tweet at michael malus and i'm not

when i'm being sideways and you guys knew i was being dead serious and what did i say i said i'm a fan of his i love him my heart is broken that i can't see his tweets every day i wish he would let me follow him again and i won't ask him if i can send him free triage oil anymore there's plenty of other people out there who are going to beg me for it you know and i'll gladly send it to him i have no problem with that it doesn't have to be him you know he's going to eat his dick when he sees me on rogan he's just going to be like boy was i wrong about that guy and then he's going to hear my story and he's going to be like wow you know he's just he's gonna [ __ ] apologize i guarantee you he's going to [ __ ] unblock me on twitter and he's going to [ __ ] apologize to me and then i'll send him a [ __ ] bunch of [ __ ] pain oil i will but i was so sincere and and i am still so sincere and i just appreciate you guys leaving it be and letting it go and not beating the dead horse and tr and and when you're when you're engaging this dumb [ __ ] on twitter try to not at michael malus i mean by now it's probably [ __ ] impossible there's so many acts on him if you guys can drop it too that would be great carsten steve running you know i know she's a pretty girl and i know you guys are probably inclined but do it as a favor for me just let's drop the whole [ __ ] thing i i mean you guys ever all of everyone knows everyone knows you know steve knows carsten knows i know nick brown knows david c baker jr definitely [ __ ] knows you know as sure as the fact that david c baker is sitting

elderly you know that's the tri age or triage what you get before you you know go into a hospital you get triaged you don't need to go hospital if you use this right it's double entendre well it's [

into MCT oil cups my name is Adam pepper if you like this video don't forget to subscribe make sure you guys hit that like button and don't be afraid to chew me a comment if you have any questions today we're gonna be learning how to use our old rosin squish bags in our edible and here I have MCT oil medium chain triglycerides these are the fatty acids that bond very well with cannabinoids you're gonna need multiple rosin pucks these are leftover rosin bags from my previous squishes the leftover cannabinoids in these rosin bags are partially d carlock's they do not need much time to achieve a full d carb d carbon the oven at 250 degrees Fahrenheit for roughly 25 minutes try to make sure that you organize the rosin bags at the very bottom of the glass so that when the oil is there it's sitting in within the oil all together you want all the bags at the very bottom you blend the two together the MCT oil and the rosin bags inside the jar and just boil on top of the stove and the temperature doesn't really matter I try to bring it up to a boil but then I bring it down to a slow boil anywhere around 200 degrees is really good temperature for bonding cannabinoids after roughly an hour of this boiling on the stove you got to make sure that there's no pressure built up inside the mason jar and looks like after roughly an hour we do have some pressure we don't want this glass to break open inside this boiling water so I'll remove this take the cap off for a moment relieve any pressure that's in there and then I'll place it back in the water for another two hours I'll do this every half hour to 45 minutes just to make sure that nothing bad happens there are always procedures you need to take to keep yourself safe at home and this is one I recommend once you've allowed your jar to boil for roughly three hours you can remove the jar take the lid off strain it through a filter you can use a coffee filter you could use another rosin bag myself I'm gonna be using a large-sized rosin bag it just happens to fit over the end of the mason jar and then I'll strain drain and then get insane there you have it you have your final product strained and charred and then you've got your capsules measured and ghosts and that's how I make my edibles one of those bad boys does meet all night long", "FIvxTPO_x3A": "hi folks its flower child 1970 and as promised I am going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears the easy way this is the easy way there's so many ways on the internet I just this is what three ingredients four ingredients actually if you include the water okay so you are going to need Knox gelatin I'm gonna bring you up just so it's not crooked you will need Knox gelatin okay or brand name gelatin don't go I've tried to go the cheap route and just by no-name gelatin I'm telling you folks I don't know what these name brands stop having them but there is an extra ingredient or something that allows this to work so you will need Knox gelatin only two packets okay so I have my two packets of Knox gelatin you will also need half a cup of kind of oil which is kind of this oil or coconut oil infused with cannabis so this is kind of coconut oil a measuring cup because you need half a cup of hot water and whatever brand of jello you want to use today I am using grape okay so it's gonna get a little shaky I'm sorry so do not turn on your stove yet what you do first is put your dry ingredients in first so you're gonna add your jello I'm opening it up oh god I broke a nail okay so just put your jello in whatever flavor and use name-brand jell-o do not use no-name jello its I'm not sponsored by them or anything but it does make a difference folks okay you can try it doing in a cheaper way but I'm telling you it's not gonna work they won't set right though they'll separate that Kenoi 'el will separate from the jello and you'll get a two-tone candy gummy bear and it looks terrible and it tastes terrible so we put our gelatin in again you're doing the dry ingredients first grape jelly smells good my garbage aside and then you're gonna want to mix this really well so that you don't see the white crystals anywhere on top you can even do it this way just shake it about it works it either way of stirring it or just shifting it in the pot pan and I'm using a nonstick pot it's very important that you use a nonstick pot as well so I am going to add my half of cup of hot water I did boil it already and now it's okay to turn on the stove because you're putting in your water I have mine at medium art whoops terribly sorry about that just mix it around you're gonna want to make sure that the there's no clumps in here and all the grit is gone you don't want to feel great at the bottom of the pan you want to make sure it's smooth much like how you would make it when you make you jello so we're just going to stir this around for a little bit for a few minutes just to make sure everything's separated and something fell on my burner sorry so what you also need while that is it'll boil a little bit it's just on four but what you also need are molds okay and what I have here and you'll see it over on the other side once this mixture is ready and you will need one of these little plunger things but if you where did I buy these I think I bought these at bulk barn I think I bought them at bulk barn and when you buy them you get three of these trays which have 50 divots each they're little gummy bears 50 divots each so you get 150 total in three trays and you get two or three of these little plungers to suck up the stuff and the mixture and put it in here so you're not burning yourself or using a spoon or anything like that okay and because there's always overflow it makes more than 150 I have my other trusty Molde here with the emoji faces on them so yeah I mean it's pretty basic it only takes a few minutes what takes the longest in my opinion is having them solidify in the fridge so I think this is pretty well mixed yeah it's mixed so just because I'm going to rush it but don't rush it because of a mixture might not work out as well it's actually starting to bubble so I chose great because I find that you taste the can of oil I know it doesn't bother some people but I like to taste the sweetness and the sugar and stuff so I guess you could put it less than half a cup in there you could put a quarter cup in here depending on your tolerance but my tolerance is quite high I eat a fair bit of edibles and I do consume it by smoking it so throughout the day and so I use a half a cup of the can oil so it's pretty good right now I think I'm just going to add the can of oil okay so we're gonna add it slowly just make sure that it gets mixed in there's a lot of stirring involved in this it's just I mean I've watched different people do it online and I know some people just leave it be but I don't I prefer to keep stirring it because I find the more you're stirring it the more it's going to stay mixed together I find it separates a lot sometimes so just be careful of that be cautious and be aware because if they don't mix well when they're solidifying they separate and it gives you a two tone candy I don't like that I find the butter it just or the kind of oil separates from the gelatin and I don't know why that is so I prefer to do it mixing it a lot stir stir stir came and add the rest of it you know just see the gelatine ah oh no glad I noticed that it's a little hair there so you want to mix this once all the butter or the can oil sorry I keep saying butter and used to make it with butter instead of the coconut oil but it's just it's not butter it's coconut oil so I'm sorry if I keep saying butter I don't mean butter I mean it's kind of oil kind of as coconut oil so now it's starting to heat better and it's gonna boil up as you can see which is good you do want that but stir as it does that so you're gonna want to stir it for about five minutes you might have to turn your stove down like I'm going to do cuz I find that's bubbling too much I'm actually gonna lift it up off the stove and move you up I'm sorry my phone's getting a little hot I'm gonna move you over here okay you can still see hahaha sit in the bunk pot they're just silly to do that so yeah I'm oh five minutes four to five minutes you're going to want to keep stirring it as it's sitting on the stove on medium four or five degrees depending on how your stove how hot your stove gets but it's pretty well mixed even the stuff on the side is mixed into the pot I'm gonna lift it up just so I can see how well it's mixed and then it's all mixed and looking well together excuse me I'm sorry about that so I hope you guys enjoy this video I can't believe I've never showed you guys how to make gummies before but this is homemade gummies they're not gonna taste exactly like and the textures not going to be exactly like this way the way I'm showing you I mean they still taste gummy obviously because of the gelatin and this is the easy cheap way to make yourself some gummies you can use whatever mold you like but I prefer to use the little gummy bear molds and the emoji molds okay I'm gonna shut the heat or actually no I'm gonna keep the heat on low because the mixture kind of cools itself down when you're dispersing it into the mold so having it a heat source is a good thing because it helps keep it hot or warm depending on what temperature you're gonna keep it set at when you're putting it into the mold it's important not to have it too higher you're just gonna burn the mixture and it's not gonna work at all so I've got it on low because I'm going to get ready to put it into the molds and I move the pot back and forth but since I'm filming it I'm gonna put you in another spot yes so that looks really good it's mixed really well I don't see a lot of the remnants of the the cano around the rim which is nice that means I've been stirring enough and there it's gone off the spoon or the mixing spatula okay I'm gonna move you over here you're gonna see my broken picture on the floor I can't believe that happened to fell right off the wall and boom down to the ground it went and it smashed okay it's kind of crooked you guys are gonna be having crooked necks trying to watch this oops well I'm sorry for all the movement I'm just trying to get it so that I can film it set it like that then okay here we go you have our little little miniature turkey basters [Laughter] okay here we go so just take some up obviously you guys know how these little things work where are we start on this end okay and sometimes I noticed because it's so hot it'll squirt back out I'd yeah it's kind of hard to see that but just be careful this stuff is really hot so you just put it in squeeze it into your molds kind of at medium to fast pace because this whoops this stuff cools fairly quickly I notice when I'm doing them but you will get if you're using this small gummy bear molds about a hundred and fifty plus gummies yeah so you can once they are solidified I've noticed some people on the internet use sugar powder I can't remember confection powder sugar to sprinkle on them because they are a little oily from the kind of oil that's mixed with them but I don't do that I just keep them in the fridge and then if I want some because obviously the touched her when they're in the fridge constantly is a little harder than if you left them at room temperature once they are all solidified and ready to be eat so you just continue ba-ba-ba-ba-ba get them all in there squeezing as you go so yeah I just I couldn't believe I was looking through my videos going yeah indeed I've never shown anyone how to make the gummy bear so this is how you do it this is my way of doing it this is and I find the texture fine you just got to make sure that you're also doing this stirring it around because it does separate and putting it back on the stove is a nice idea to keep the temperature hot whoops making a bit of a mess but I mean I'm sure instead of using cannabis oil to make these like some type of edible or treat for the kids leave out the kind of oil obviously oops no there we go was a little raised up there we gotta have them even so they harden properly and they're all ready to go at the same time you know what I mean so I find this fun to do this I mean I love to bake especially when they're edibles we're almost done here folks I'm actually gonna put this back on the stove for a second be right back just noticed it was starting separate you don't want that to happen okay all right she didn't had the stove on hot so I might take a little longer for you guys if you have it on medium or low so obviously we're gonna get more than 150 there's 25 in each of those gummy bear sheets so we're just gonna fill these up now obviously the emoji the pink sheet that I'm doing right now is going to take longer to harden because they're deeper bigger so I won't be showing you those but I'm hoping that these little ones if I put them in the freezer will solidify really well and I'll be able to show you them in the video no guarantees because my phone's been really wacky lately and when I pause it it shuts off on my phone sometimes so we're getting to the very last of it and it will the last few gummies will be very mediciney because of the butter that stays behind that's really what I'm soaking up here I can just see the difference so I'm just gonna pour it in there okay okay so I am going to cheat and put them in the freezer alrighty and hopefully hey that looks see that that looks like the Mickey Mouse symbol you see that a little dollop right there two ears all righty so that's what we do so far so good okay got a bit of the counter in there that one was never used so I'm gonna put these in the freezer hopefully when I pause it it won't mess up but if it does I'm sorry and I'll show them to you in another short video so we're gonna pause it and put them in the freezer for about ten minutes okay see you soon folks and if not love and Huggies and I'll show you the finished product in another video if that's what happens okay so that's how you make gummy bears folks it's pretty simple it's pretty basic and it's really easy and quick it's quick nothing to it the longest it takes in my opinion is to solidify them in the fridge which is usually about 15 20 minutes but we're gonna cheat and use the freezer okay lemon honey see you soon right alrighty so it only took five minutes but here are some this is what they look like whoops it's just what they look like gonna eat one so yeah so there you go folks oh my gosh where's the camera here we go ha ha sorry so yeah they look like rug dummies they just taste a little different you know what I mean so there it is I'm actually gonna have a couple more and put them back in the fridge but there they are dummies ready to be eaten folks lovin Huggies stay true stay unique and enjoy I hope you enjoyed the video folks and I hope you give it a try and if you do please let me know how it turned out ok bye", "LKXcqp7bHWI": "99% of

anyway this is going to be a bit of a review and how-to video all in one I was given a free sample of this here bear mould and it is silicone it's machine washable and it makes 50 little gummy bears now it really only contains like for retail spoons with of liquid when I measured it out that's if you're just pouring water in there but we all realize you'll definitely need a recipe that has more than three tablespoons cuz trust me I tried to do like a micro recipe and it didn't get me very far but so far I really do love this mold I haven't had a spray it I haven't had any problems they just come right out so there's two main camps of homemade gummy bears there are people that are just making their own for the fun of it and they're gonna be using jell-o unflavored gelatin water then there's a camp that is usually doing it for the health benefit so they might have some kind of eye they will probably have juice and honey and unflavored gelatin most likely beef gelatin which is higher quality more health things to it so I that's what I'm trying for I don't have a special gelatin but I did try to do this with juice and honey and a couple of failed batches with double die vitamins but we'll get into that so this mold actually came with a pdf recipe book I really didn't find it very helpful but you can look around and find different recipes kind of experiment with what you like especially if you're doing a juice phase to go me what kind of juices do you like they do say to frown away from pineapple because the enzymes in it do not work well with gelatin just a heads up let me show you how I went about making some gummy bears myself so this is the ingredient list off of your store-bought gummy bears and you'll see here you know there's sugars there's gelatin but there are some extra waxes and that I just don't have in my kitchen I don't know about you but I'm going to give you two big tips on how to make this as close to legit gummy bears as possible less like just jigglers the recipe I have makes about 80 to 90 gummy bears and it calls for 1/3 cup of juice so I used some orange juice and lemon juice to top up that last little bit but it's primarily orange cuz that's my favorite and then it calls for two tablespoons of honey and 2 tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I did try grinding up some multivitamins it was foul and profusely disgusting so I haven't mastered that yet I'm going to show you how to do it without the vitamins take your juices and honey mix them together and then gently sprinkle your gelatin the unflavored gelatin on top and wait several minutes it'll kind of soak up like you see here and that's called blooming you don't want to add it directly into hot liquid or you'll have problems then I just slowly warm it up in a pan I'm warming up a larger pan to the side and then tip number one is boiling you are making a candy so with taffy with that sort of thing you have to boil the sugar and water to get basically a soft ball to get to the right consistency there at texture so since this is a really small batch I only did it for a couple minutes I was afraid of burning I think the consistency could have been nicer if I had done it longer but I was great so you can kind of experiment with how long you let it boil next I keep my smaller pot in side of that larger pot and just let them sit there with the spoon and dropper that they give you just so that they stay warm so they don't start setting that because then it becomes a real mess this little dropper that they give you with this set is awesome and yeah just fill them up one by one no big secret there try to fill them up as big as possible because they do shrink a little bit as you'll notice there are some bubbles you can try to skim off that before you put them in but I like them and then I put them in the fridge for just a few minutes or even the freezer and they pop right out didn't need to coat that with any oil or anything so here's the mold and I will say tip number one is to make sure and boil your sugar tip number two is to let your gummy bears sit let them dehydrate a little because in the factories where they make them they actually do put them in a drying room for a couple of days and so letting out a little bit more of that moisture should help them have a little bit more of a chewy consistency than just thick jello and here's the final product next to a Haribo Haribo gummy bear so it's a little smaller slightly different design but I like it I think it's adorable and I think it's tasty I hope that the video was helpful for you here are some of my orange lemon honey gummy bears you know they're not 100% like this stuff at the store I know they're gonna be healthier and they're cute and I still taste good so I'm gonna enjoy these snacks and if you don't want to take the time and effort for gummies even though these are awesome that you can make your own healthy version or custom flavors and colors if you don't want to do that you can also use this mold for chocolate bears make a little bag for your sweetheart for your kids throw it in their lunch a little bag of gummy or chocolate bears that says I love you very much I'm cheesy like that I would totally do that so all in all I definitely give this mold a 5 out of 5 recommendation I don't have any problems with it I really like it I love that it came with the dropper to help fill it up and if you follow my tips I think things should go smoothly let me know down in the comments below if you enjoyed this video what you think if you've had any problems or if

company creating better days and i gotta say the name that they chose for this line better delight is great because it definitely delivers there now for those of you who don't know as of the recording of this video delta 8 thc is a fully legal form of thc that is derived from hemp it's about one third to one half the potency of delta 9 thc which is its close cousin that's founded marijuana and the experience that you should have with it when used appropriately is purely relaxing it kind of strips away the potential for the paranoia or whimsical type of high that you can find with delta 9. also no munchies there's none of that insatiable appetite boost that you get with delta 9 a lot of times now it can have a little bit of an appetite stimulating effect but it's really nowhere near what people would define as the munchies i've just found myself getting slightly more snacky sometimes when i use delta 8. now i always like to give kudos to companies that can put out a product with excellent design and packaging and these guys definitely deliver on that as well it just looks so clean and professional and trustworthy that's the big thing because this industry there's so much out there that is not trustworthy in the hemp and cannabis industry these guys i have been carrying them here in lovely leaf naturals for a long time before they even made delta eight gummies carrying their gummies carrying some of their other products and i have never seen anything but absolute professionalism from creating better days and this product is no exception these are 10 milligram gummies so each gummy is going to have 10 milligrams of delta 8 thc in it their blue raspberry as i mentioned before and then there's 60 of them in the big jar they're also doing a 30 count jar but yeah full transparency i do carry creating better days in my shop and on the website so i've been carrying them for a while and they've never given me a reason to doubt them so you can get these over at the lovely leaf naturals website loveleafnaturals.com i'll put a link down in the description they're 49.99 for the 60 count jar we don't have the 30 count jars in just yet i don't know what those will be going for i think either 30 or 35 once we actually get them in the shop but yeah you can get these right now but stick around until the end of the video and i'm going to give you guys a discount code to get 15 off your first order of these so the first thing you're going to see whenever you open these up is that there is a seal across the top it's a tamper resistant seal that makes sure that you know if anybody has opened this jar before you it also says potent use responsibly and we will talk a little bit more about that in a minute but when you open it up you are going to see these square blue raspberry gummies they've got a sugar coating and they are delicious and i'm going to try one right now and yeah they're so yummy i hate that i can only eat a couple of them i kind of want to eat the whole jar now the consistency of them is a little gooier than i generally like my gummies but honestly this is not supposed to be eaten like candy so when people get into the flavor or the the consistency of gummies like this that always kind of bothers me i know i just talked about how good they are i mean it's not a bad thing for them to taste good but honestly you shouldn't worry too much about that because this is more like you're taking a vitamin than you're sitting down to have a snack for example the gummies that we manufactured under our brand name friendly hemp here in the store they taste extremely hempy because there's about 40 milligrams of full spectrum hemp extract in each of our little tiny gummies there's not much room for anything else so we don't overload them with sugar we just let them taste hempy but that's not me knocking these guys at all these gummies are amazing i wouldn't change a thing i'm just making the point that when it comes to somebody buying gummies in the cbd space or the delta 8 space or even the delta 9 space don't worry so much about the consistency or the flavor because you're probably just gonna be eating one maybe two and then you're not gonna eat anymore for a good long time now getting back to the subject of using this responsibly i always tell people start low and go slow whether they're here in my shop or they're asking me questions personally about cbd and delta 8. delta 8 you really really really want to start at the lowest dose i would recommend only taking one of these gummies if it's your first time using it waiting several several hours just to see what it's going to do and then maybe upping the dosage next time you want to take it i would not crank down two three of these the first time you've ever taken it now just to give a personal anecdote about this the first time i ever tried delta eight i was woefully ignorant of the potency of this stuff i was using an oil tincture instead of the gummies but i took about 30 milligrams equivalent to about three of these gummies 30 milligrams waited about four hours nothing happened i have a really really slow metabolism that was a big contributing factor to this but then i decided okay well i feel nothing i'll take another 30 milligrams see what happens about an hour hour and a half later is when it all decided to hit at once i was in the shop at that point and i ended up having to close down the shop an hour early i was laid out on our couch i threw up three times in the bathroom and i was just a mess i called my wife and i said you have to come get me because i cannot drive home and i was fully there mentally but my body just gave up on me so i tell people that as a cautionary tale start low and go slow whether you're taking it in a gummy form like this using a vape using an oil tinger using flour whatever you're doing start low and go slow and then just like every other cannabis product that we carry here in lovely leaf naturals these guys are sporting a nice little qr code on the back of their packaging so that you can see the lab results for this product that is a standard that we maintain very very

a half a cup light corn syrup [Music] [Music] and then 1/4 cup of cup of and turn it on medium heat medium-high heat and you keep it there stirring until it starts to boil and then you stop stirring it till all the sugar dissolves in Sirte candy thermometer in [Music] and the instructions say don't stir after your magic potion concoction I do potion so I couldn't say it yeah that see the other one I had to stir until it reached 300 and then put the stuff in well THC starts being killed at about 300 so I always wondered why are you putting it in yeah this is much [Music] we've reached boiling yep we've reached boiling now it's time to insert a candy thermometer there I go I'll put it over by the handle maybe it'll stay a little better I like to do not stir while it's being communal

"today I'm gonna be doing something really fun for children and this is my version of jell-o gummy bears so let me set up with all the ingredients that we need and I'll be back in a second so now that I've set up I'm gonna show you exactly what we need I have a silicon gummy bear mold a measuring cup for our water we're gonna be starting off with cold water but I'm gonna get to that step in just a second you're gonna need one tablespoon of gelatin that is equal to 15 milliliters and if you buy your gelatin in little pockets this is what it looks like it's a standard package and this holds one tablespoon or 15 milliliters and also a regular sized box of jell-o and this here is 85 grams so for our first step I'm gonna get my water ready and I'm gonna come back in one second for my first step I have added 1/2 a cup of cold water from my kitchen sink that is very important you need the water to be cold I am now gonna take that 1 tablespoon of gelatin and I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top of the cold water and I'm gonna let this sit here for about 5 minutes because I want this to completely dissolve in that cold water you can already see that it's dissolving quite quickly so I'm just gonna let that go for a few more minutes and then I'll come back so this is 5 minutes later and I've just taken a fork and just stir this around everything is nicely dissolved and now I'm gonna take my last little bit of water 1/4 cup and dump that right in so in here we have a total of 3 quarters of a cup of water I am now gonna take this put this into the microwave and just microwave it for about a minute until it's hot so that was 1 minute on high and you can see now that it's much clearer that's because heat has been introduced into the gelatin and water and now we are ready to add in our actual jello mixture so I've opened up our little box of jell-o and now I'm gonna get that right in there and because the liquid is hot all of the jello mixture is gonna really just dissolve that much easier in there well I smells good too and I am using a cherry today I'm just gonna mix this around so you don't have to worry about the exact temperature that you heat this to in your microwave just make sure that it's hot does not have to be boiling just hot and that will help all the you know the actual package contents mix up in there really well and that's good and now we are ready to fill our mold so I've just put my mold on a little cutting board because this is very very flexible and if it's very hard to lift up when it's full so we're ready to pour it just give that a little bit of a stir just to make sure that all the contents are completely mixed but nothing has settled to the bottom and then I'm gonna start filling our little mold and that looks good just like that okay I'm just cleaning this up and now we are ready to pop this into the fridge so you want to put this in the fridge not the freezer just into your fridge and just let this chill down for about four hours and you're gonna have a really really nice gummy bears so I'm gonna pop this into my fridge and I'll come back much later on and I'm gonna show you the final product and they are really fun and they are full of flavor a few hours later once your jello has completely set you can just peel out your little gummy bears that's what's so nice about the silicone is that you can get right in there and just peel them right out so I'll continue doing this so I'll be back in a second and our last one and there we have them let's get them around the right way look at that really nice let me zoom in so I've zoomed in just a little bit to show you how nice these are and there we have it our jello gummy bears and look at how really gummy these are really really nice you can see that extra gelatin will really set these up really well and these here are super super fresh hmm a burst of flavor right in your mouth super super fresh hmm YUM I just zoomed in a little bit more because I think I heard some of you say zoom in a little bit more I want to see a little bit more detail in those gummy bears and here we have them aren't those cute made with jell-o and gelatin a little bit of water there we have them really fun really really delicious that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really do appreciate that and that's it for today I'll see you next time you", "5ljRikoZgb0": "uh that's what it looks like this is what distillate starts out like that looks like a bucket of doo doo butter cannabis goes through a lot of steps to become nice clear distillate like this but you might be surprised by what is actually used to make all of your distillate pins and all your edibles and all your syringes i'm about to tell you how distillate is made right now on the strange show answers to all the questions you've ever had about wheat distillate is a weed extract but unlike other extracts distillate goes through an extensive process where everything is stripped away from the plant except for one specific cannabinoid if you're new here my name is matt this is the strain show and this is the channel for adults and patients where i teach you the answers to all the questions you've ever had about week if you want to learn all kinds of fun facts about weed don't forget to subscribe and you can put some nuggets of knowledge into your strain brain now distill it looks awesome but it doesn't have much of a smell or much of a taste the distillation process removes all of the terpenes and leaves you with only one cannabinoid usually thc or cbd this is a glass syringe with a one-to-one ratio of thc and cbd oil this stuff doesn't have any smell at all and when you dab it it looks super duper clear [Music] and it doesn't have much of a taste either you can't really taste it i mean you can taste it but it doesn't really have a flavor and this sucks because most of the medicinal benefits of weed and most of the high you get from weed is from all of the cannabinoids working together as a team in what's called the entourage effect sometimes they will add these terpenes back into the distillate at the end of the process and sometimes weird things are added to distillate like synthetic terpenes or maybe terpenes from another plant like lavender to give it a good taste but one of the biggest uses for distillate is making edibles almost all thc or cbd edibles are made with distillate and that means that none of these edibles are going to have any of those important cannabinoids or terpenes they're going to be just thc or cbd although the finished product of distillate is pure and potent it's usually made from the cheapest weed leftovers available to the extractor since all distillates look about the same at the end of the process you can use low-grade trim leaves like trim from a trimming machine to make distillate and it won't really matter with other types of extracts low-grade weed will make low-grade hash but not with distillate that's why some people say from trash to hash when talking about distillate the first step of making distillate is getting what's called a crude extraction oil uh that's what it looks like this is what distillate starts out like that looks like a bucket of doodoo butter this nasty crude oil is usually extracted with bho like most other concentrates but since we started off with such a low grade product this is what we ended up with but this crude oil has a lot of impurities that we're gonna have to remove before we can begin to separate this oil down into its specific cannabinoids and we're gonna do that in the next step which is called winterization in this step the crude oil is mixed with ethanol and that mixture is then placed in a very cold freezer for 24 to 48 hours while this mix is in the freezer all the impurities like chlorophyll plant waxes fats and lipids they all stick together and sink to the bottom of the container after a day or two of being in the freezer all the impurities are filtered out and the ethanol is evaporated with something like this rotary evaporator so now it looks good but it's not exactly very potent yet all cannabinoids that are in their acid form even thc have to be decarboxylated before they will interact with your body the way you want them to in the third step the oil is heated to 220 degrees fahrenheit and this removes the carboxylic acid group and that converts your thc a into thc now this stuff will get you high but it's not finished yet the last step of the process is the actual distillation process itself all of the different cannabinoids in the oil have different boiling points and different molecular weights so in this last step the extractors use vacuum pressure and heat in very precise amounts to evaporate off exactly what cannabinoids they're going after and at the end of the process sometimes they'll add terpenes back into the distillate sometimes they have the terpenes from the same weed they made the distillate from sometimes they add terpenes from different weeds sometimes they add terpenes from different plants and sometimes they add synthetic terpenes so if your distillate is flavored like a great popsicle you can probably bet there's some synthetic terpenes in there now that i know about it i'm ready to dab it so i'm about to go right here or if you just want to learn some more fun facts about weed i got those videos right here and yo don't forget to subscribe for good vibes i got them nuggets of knowledge because when you watch the strange show it's like going to weed college", "ZOEwJRlZG7s": "g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears before we get started you're gonna need some sort of mold like see what I've got now you can get this from an arts and crafts store basically this has got a little little bears in it now they're not easy to find so I will put a link to the place that I bought this from and and this cost me I think it was two dollars for one sheet now with a small saucepan just have it on the bench or somewhere put in 1/3 of a cup of water then add one satchel and these satchels vary the satchel I use has about 10 grams which i think is probably just a bit under a quarter of an ounce just slowly sprinkling there now this needs to be unflavored gelatin then you get your flavored gelatin and you want to use roughly 85 grams which is around 3 ounces now for this particular one I've chosen a strawberries and cream gelatin just pour it in slowly now once you've done this just leave this on the counter for roughly 10 minutes and it's about ready to put on the stove now put this on the stove we turn on to medium heat now we'll have this on here for roughly somewhere between 3 and 5 minutes and what we're gonna do is just give it a stir every now and then the idea is once this is dissolved it's ready okay that's ready to go let's do the next stage now just pour it into something that you can pour it out if it's got a little spent and just pull it into each mold leave that on the counter for I don't know five minutes a and then once it's just cooled a little bit and not for us to be able to transport it without it spilling anyway put the end of the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes well they're ready to go now what I like to do is I like to get a teaspoon of plain flour and teaspoon of castor sugar and just mix it together in a little shot glass like this once this has come out of the fridge just sprinkle it sort of over it this will just help the the gummies not to stick together so just do that again spread across it like that so make sure that you do wipe the excess off this because you know what spilling all over the place um well I hope you like my homemade gummy bears got so many yeah let's give them a go oh oh come come Frogger TV hmm I'll see you next time for my next meal [Music]", "059ZsVUl-3A": "hi and welcome to kena basics today we learn how to make rosin lozenges rosin lozenges are cannabis infused honey lemon ginger hard candies or cough drops that can be used for a medicinal or recreational cannabis use they use rose and pressed wax Akif to infuse the cannabis it has only four ingredients it's all natural and healthy so let's get started here's what you need to make rosin lozenges first you need 1/2 a cup of honey you can use raw honey or regular store-bought honey you need 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 teaspoon of freshly grated ginger root and 1 gram of cannabis rosin pressed wax or one to two grams of Keef I do not recommend using eh-oh or butane extracted hash oils for this or any other recipe because making hard candy can be a very time-sensitive endeavor you do need to make sure that you have all your ingredients ready to go so the first thing that we're going to do is go ahead and squeeze out our two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice make sure you strain out all the seeds and pulp and have that ready to go and also you want to go ahead and prepare your ginger again we're using fresh ginger and if you get organic that's even better but you want to go ahead and make sure that you peel off the skin and then use a grater and we're gonna grate finely grate about a teaspoon of the fresh ginger root and then it'll also be very helpful if you go ahead and pre measure out your half a cup of honey again I said you could use raw honey here or you can use just regular store-bought honey such as we're using here but you need a half a cup of honey and you have all your ingredients ready to go before we move on to the next step which is to put a small saucepan over medium-high heat and then we're going to combine in all of the honey as well as the lemon juice and the ginger and we're gonna bring that up over medium to medium-high heat and the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to sort of boil out the water and some of the other impurities and cook down the ginger so after we've combined all of our ingredients in our pan you want to go ahead and give that a little bit of a mix and let them combine together and then as the heat comes up we're also going to make sure that we have our candy thermometer available okay as the heat brings up a little bit you'll the honey will melt and you'll be able to come coorporate those ingredients together make sure that you have your candy thermometer ready and a candy thermometer you need to make sure that it's the kind of thermometer that goes up well over 300 degrees but you're going to want to make sure that you carefully monitor because what's gonna happen is and once you get up to about 212 degrees or boiling for water we're gonna start boiling out the water from the honey and there's also a water and the lemon juice that's going to boil it out and condense down the honey then honey and the lemon flavors both but what's what happens is a lot of foam occurs when this happens you need to be right beside it and make sure that you have a pan that has tall enough sides to accommodate at least triple um the depth and foam and then as the foam gets to the top of your pan you need to pull it off the heat and let the foam subside it just takes a few seconds for the phone to subside and then you can put it back on the heat but like I said just be there with it because this is going to occur several times but over time as the water boils out it's going to foam less and less and then you can bring your heat up to high and go to 295 degrees Fahrenheit and you would be very precise about that temperature leaving a little bit room there if it gets up to 300 degrees you're fine don't go over 300 degrees but 2 and 95 or 300 degrees Fahrenheit should be perfect if you don't have a candy thermometer you can also do this by having a cup of ice water available and take some of the candy when you think it's getting close and drop it in and let it harden and the high water if it hardens into a brittle hard candy then you've reached the right temperature and we're getting real close you can see it's really darkening till you don't want to go so far also that you earn and get a really better flavor so you want to be really careful you monitor your temperature and when it gets to 300 degrees or 295 degrees Fahrenheit pull it off the heat and immediately it's gonna start to cool once it's pulled off the heat so we're going to act fast make sure you still monitor the temperature when it gets to 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're gonna add in our rosin or our Keef what we're doing here is we're we're using that temperature so the one it'll melt into there and be easy to mix but also because we're decarboxylated are still activating the cannabis rosin pressed does use heat and pressure so it may possibly be decarboxylated but what we're using this heat just to make sure that we've activated our cannabis and if you're using Keef then that's gonna be necessary also to activate the cannabis so starting at 250 degrees and then as it cools over the next couple of hours we'll be decarboxylated them remaining cannabis well once you've added in and mixed in your cannabis you're going to now pour your candy into the candy molds the video always slows us down a little bit and so the candy is a little thicker than I would like for it to Bend when it poured in the molds here it would have poured a little more evenly if I had used it a little bit hotter but when I pour it into the molds but that's okay and those little drops that I put on parchment paper would also have kind of out a little bit more circular and nice so just make sure that you move fast enough when you're doing your candies but after about two hours and you don't need to put this in the fridge or anything just let this cool on the counter after about two hours your candy will harden into a hard rigid candy you'll be able to pop those out of the molds with no problem and this candy can be really sticky so you might want to coat it in powdered sugar which will help prevent them from sticking together and whatever storage container you put them in and if you don't have powdered sugar you can also use crystal sugar or you may want to anyway because it gives it a nice kind of a cool looking coating there and also adds some sweetness to the candy which can be a little bit better because of the lemon and the ginger but these are really good and they're the flavor of these is not so much like a sweet candy so much as more as like a lozenge and you get the the lingering numbness from the gingers are really good this episode is brought to you by the Rafah studio smoke shop selling raw rolling papers accessories much more

well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please leave a comment give us a thumbs up

Aurora Aurora drift these ones are their raspberry gummies I personally fan of indica I only get indica either a gummies concentrates flower hash anything like that I normally go for indigo this stuff is sativa I don't know sounds like we're all stuck together they're five per container two milligrams each which is hilarious but again not everybody has a tolerance that in every day user does so they're trying to keep for people freaking out and overdoing it overdosing and other people call it which technically you're giving not that you can die from it as people know I don't know I don't know why I'm buying all this stuff one this at the animals don't this low of milligrams I can eat the whole pack not feel anything again they are sativa so hopefully I feel a bit of a buzz they are nano emulsified so they're supposed to hit your bloodstream faster um this isn't sealed pack so these guys are just getting held on the shelves these guys had them for two days now I'm the fifth person to try these apparently so bust the seal I don't know right off the bat they don't it is a smelling raspberry I don't know it's a very very synthetic smelling this one is not coated in sugar it seems like they're the same type of consistency as the grapefruit gummies that I just reviewed again smell I probably get it give it a hundred I'll look at two out of a five they don't smell very good obviously they've been sprayed with something that's what it smells like to me yeah I don't know they're just they just don't smell good I'm gonna bring the clip the camera up so you guys can get some close-ups of what they look like and then we're gonna eat one we're gonna eat all five okay honestly I'm not really looking forward to eating I ate cookies so far I've eaten the grapefruit gummies and they're both lower than my expectations so that's saying quite a bit with these I'm not expecting much I can they're probably gonna taste terrible the consistency I'm probably not gonna like the bus is the main issue that I have with these gummies is they're they're also low THC that for me personally I need something higher these are high enough let's go ahead and try our first raspberry gummy from Aurora drift okay first gummy has the same consistency basically as the grape fruit gummies actually prefer this consist like they're basically the same but these ones are a little bit more gummy than the other ones I like that these ones aren't sugar coated the flavor they're their raspberry gummies like what do you expect I can taste the raspberry can't really taste the oil but again at two milligrams of pop and kill when you expect these were eight dollars by the way my kind of girl mommy it's too bad and they come in packs of five eight bucks ten milligrams for me personally I don't think it's worth it for someone out there who has a low tolerance that may be worth it for them again to me I don't think I'm gonna be buying them to enjoy because again 10 milligrams that isn't gonna do much to me I am buying this out of my own money to do my reviews hopefully you guys like my reviews I'm trying to be as honest as I can I don't know I still get a little bit of flavor after you know a minute or two of not eating them so I don't mind the gummies I would buy them again not for pleasure I would probably buy them with someone else's money or if someone else gave them to me how to eat them again I don't think I would actually buy them again personally not for eight dollars not for ten milligrams I have some BC pinkish and I'm gonna bust into pretty quick here I may do a review for that stuff this is from flower don't know if it will either way I hope you guys enjoyed this video look for my other cannabis to reuse because every animal that comes out and then I'm gonna buy them in regular review them hopefully I guess subscribe like this video I don't know like the content Cheers let me off", "dmFGGXRKRac": "[Music] and delight edibles thank you for joining me my name is Liz and today we are gonna be making chewy buttery caramels now this is a great recipe because it rme the recipe calls for one cup of butter so it's wonderful because you can use different amounts of cannabis cannabis butter depending on how strong you want to make it so for myself today I'm going to be using 1/4 cup um however you can go half a cup three quarters of a cup of can about this canna by no cannabutter and and then you just use regular butter to make up the difference so as I said today I'm gonna be doing a quarter cup of can of butter will do 3/4 a cup of regular butter and it's a really simple recipe and I'm looking forward to showing it to you as well as I'm going to show you how you can make turtles so you can just have the caramel pieces or you can turn them around you can make some turtles for for yourself or for the holiday season alright so we're just gonna get started and thanks for joining is a heavy a medium heavy saucepan and what it means by a heavy is it's got the heavy bottom this allows for even heat distribution to make sure that your candy cooks properly and evenly a rubber spatula or wooden spoon and a tray what I did is I just made a tray from a wooden frame and lined it with parchment paper obviously you can use any kind of baking tray line it with parchment paper a little trick that I do is to make sure to get it to fit in properly as I make a little slit into the corners and that way they can do it you just they're able to tuck in nicely you just tuck the corners in and that way it sits nice and flat and you'll also need a candy thermometer and so I'm gonna get into the ingredients and we're gonna start cooking you're gonna need 1/2 a cup of brown sugar packed 1/2 a cup of white sugar now I've used I said 1/4 cup of my can of butter and three coins three quarters of a cup of regular butter make sure get it all in there don't want to waste any and you're gonna need a one can of condensed sweetened milk not the regular milk not the regular evaporated milk it has to be the sweetened condensed milk you plop that in there and one cup of light corn syrup now you should be able to use the regular corn syrup I've never actually tried it with it I prefer the light corn syrup mainly for taste I don't really like the molasses taste in regular corn syrup but in this recipe I can't really see what difference is gonna make other than making it a bit darker as I said I haven't tried it so I'm not sure so you want it to start to mix all the ingredients mixed together here now is very important was doing this recipe is once you start cooking is that you never stop stirring you can't stop stirring for even just a minute or reduced even a couple of seconds because it will start to burn and you'll start to see little brown flecks appearing in it so you said the whole time you've got a stir so you're gonna be doing about a half hour of stirring time you're gonna turn your heat onto a medium and a medium or medium low and you're going to continue stirring until the bitter end so we're gonna be cooking this to a 234 to 240 so 234 is gonna give you a nice chewy but a very softer caramel the 240 is gonna give you that that chewy but really stiffer caramel so depending on what texture that you particularly like is the temperatures are gonna go to I'm gonna be cooking it to 237 because I wanted a little bit firmer than that really soft but I don't want that really really firm almost break yourteeth firm caramel so 237 is what I'm gonna be cooking it to and you're just gonna continue to stir clean off the sides of your pot and yeah enjoy put some tunes on and dance away so continue stirring until everything is nice and melted and there's no more lumps and everything is nice and smooth and at that point you can add your candy thermometer and then I said you're gonna cook it to between 230 to 34 to 240 and don't ever stop stirring so we've been cooking now for about 10-12 minutes and you're gonna see these candy the caramel is starting to darken up getting more caramel looking and it's also getting thicker you may not be able to see it but trust me by my arm it is getting a lot thicker and we're almost a temperature and so as I said continue stirring until you get to do your desired temperature alright so we're just coming up onto the 234 so at this point if you want that softer chewy caramel you would pull it at this point submerge the bottom of the pot in cold water that's what I've got sitting beside me there and to stop the cooking process right away otherwise so the heat will continue to rise for another moment a minute or two making it a little bit firmer than maybe what you'd like so if you want to stop the cooking process right away somewhere at the bottom of the pot in some cold water alright so my temperature now is 237 I am going to pull out the candy thermometer and submerge the bottom of the pot into cold water beside me to stop the cooking process so as I said you just want to stop put it in the cold water to stop the cooking cooking process and then you're going to immediately pour it into your pan that you've set up with your parchment paper earlier all right so for this I'm pouring half of my mixture into my pan there so that I can make caramel pieces and then I'm gonna be poor than the rest into a funnel so that we can make the pecan clusters or Turtles whatever you like to call them and I'll show you how to put those together now we're gonna put our turtle together so just get a whole pecan break it in half and that's gonna be the main body part and you take the other half break a piece in half and that's gonna be the front legs and then get another half break the break it in half and that's going to be the back legs and then you're just gonna take your caramel with the funnel and you're gonna plop some caramel right on top in the middle and you're gonna do that for for all of them or if you don't want to make the little turtle shape which I wouldn't really bother with because by the time he gets a caramel in the chocolate you don't really see that it's a turtle so I just make some pecan clusters and top it off with caramel and then we are going to coat them up with chocolate once the caramel sets so it's gonna take about 20 minutes half hour for the caramel to firm up enough so that we can coat them with the chocolate so at about the 10 minute mark while they're still warm what I like to do is to form them into into more of a ball because they flatten out when they're warm and you poured the caramel they're kind of flat so what I like to do is kind of push them together so that it creates more of a I'll be it more of a shape that you want more of a cluster instead of it just being flat so I've gone ahead and I've already melted out my chocolate I've got that ready I like to use the candy melts they're really simple to use and there I just call them pretty much idiot-proof you melt them you dip them they dry it's great so you just take your cluster and you dip it into your chocolate and use a fork to be able to get off the excess chocolate so you just want to tap it remove any of the excess chocolate and then you're gonna place it on to the wire rack and I'll let it dry and what you want to do is to put a piece of parchment paper underneath your drying rack to catch any of the excess chocolate that drips off so it's not dripping on to your counters [Music] [Music] I've taking my um Turtles out of the refrigerator after 20 minutes if they're a little bit stuck to the tray don't worry just use a flat knife there to pry them off or if you just let them cool warm up a little bit they'll come right off and there you've got it PK clusters or Turtles your friends and family are sure to love these for the holidays they make a great gift idea sark caramel now is completely cooled is about two hours and we're just gonna remove it from the parchment paper so just take it out of the pan and remove all your parchment paper from it comes away really easily and just remove any little tiny pieces that may be remaining now I had a little wet spot for some reason in my mold so I'm just gonna cut that out and what I like to use for cutting is I like to use a pizza cutter you can use you can use either scissors or a butcher knife is really handy as well now usually I use a ruler but I couldn't find it today so I'm just gonna eyeball it for us here it's not gonna be very accurate but it's gonna give you the idea and I'm using a piece of parchment here just to be able to hold on to the caramel while I'm cutting it cuz otherwise it's slippery and I don't want my handprints all in it so you just press down and firmly roll the blade through [Music] once you have them all cut up into pieces you can wrap them up in parchment paper or wax my backs paper I prefer wax paper I don't have any today so I'm using parchment paper as you can see it's not the easiest to work with but the caramels not going to stick to it so I kind of wrap it like a little present just tuck the ends in and if you want you could add attack a little piece of tape on but as I said if you use wax paper it's great it just wraps up really nicely [Music] [Music] [Music]", "k0rqhDVLjMw": "welcome back guys today i'm going to show you how to infuse gushers [Music] here's what you're going to need some gushers eggs to put them in tincture and a syringe needle all you need to do is use your syringe needle to get some tincture and put it into each of your gushers now if you measure out your tincture in advance you can know approximately how much is in each so if you do a tablespoon of tincture you can divide it by however many gushers you end up filling and that's how you can figure out how many milligrams is in each gusher i have not yet tried this with coconut oil but i believe it would work as long as you melted enough so the syringe would be able to pull it up thank you guys so

reviews honey by butterfly effect is produced by Gro Ohio out of Zanesville the bottle comes packed in a striking white box textured with an almost rubbery field inside there is a small recyclable plastic spoon for dosing and the bottle itself the spoon that is included is helpful but somewhat useless the design is very small and geared more toward measuring powders as such the honey ends up getting trapped in the corners of the spoon this measuring spoon is beneficial to use the first two times you dose just to get an idea of what you will need after I figured out my optimal dose though I found that a standard tea spoon would easily catch the honey without any loss and I could eyeball the approximate amount based on the amount I would use and the old scoop but be warned do not take a full teaspoon on the first go this honey is very potent so be sure to pace yourself in terms of flavor there isn't much to say here as the honey tastes exactly like honey sweet and delicious with gentle clover notes I noted a mild green cannabis flavor every so often especially when this Honey was mixed into foods I found that this nectar was at its tastiest when melted into a warm herbal tea or taken orally as is I do wish butterfly effect had offered some idea as to the source of the honey there are a lot of Ohio honey farmers it would have been nice to see an organic Ohio honey used for this product medicinally this edible was recommended for relaxation euphoria and stress relief the honey takes about an hour or so to begin working but once it does you will be treated to a gentle headband effect and waves of potent euphoria as this honey reaches its peak it creates a relaxing sensation throughout the body spreading from your toes to your head in fact I found this honey to be a terrific sleep supplement used about an hour or so before bed preferably mixed in a nice bedtime tea this Honey was also recommended for its versatile dosing a patient could potentially take one scoop 5 scoops or even 10 if needed one bottle of honey equals roughly 5 days of your 90 day ohio medical marijuana overall this honey is easily one of my favorite edibles and since this bottle is cheaper than many products on the Ohio market around 70 to 80 dollars this makes butterfly effects honey a rather great option for penny-pinching medical marijuana patients not only is butterfly effects honey a great deal for an Ohio edible it's also an incredibly versatile with dosing making it a great option for newcomers as well as heavy weights and that's without mentioning this honey's potent medicinal effects which keep you relaxed well into the night and possibly into the next morning do not miss out on this one final rating 4.9 out of 5 be sure to LIKE and subscribe below or share this

"pUhJnKKQDTE": "as marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today's review we are taking a look at a new to us capsule brand from the folks at get zen we are looking at their cannabis infused capsules today this is the high thc line where each capsule has 25 milligrams of thc uh for 750 milligrams in the total bottle uh like all of our wheats reviews we're not going to be doing all 750 milligrams at once we're going to be taking four capsules for a hundred milligrams uh and that is what we will base our review off of so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach california uh for i believe uh with taxes included uh around about ninety dollars uh so pretty expensive for these 750 milligram capsules uh certainly on the upper end for what i've seen in the area uh so we've got some decent expectations for them uh and on their website they've got such wonderful boilerplate uh text as this let's let's give you a read here gitzen is on a mission to improve the quality of life for patients by manufacturing the highest quality of cannabis capsule and other cannabis products our goal is to bring honesty integrity and accountability to the cannabis market and change the way cannabis is perceived by the medical community in the general public how noble i'm sure they are uh fulfilling that mission uh with the absolute utmost zeal every day of their existence so uh let's get into the product review here uh here's our little bottle uh it's got some lab testing results on the bottom that doesn't really give us more than just the number there uh which actually comes out according to these lab testing results to about 821 milligrams 10 more than advertised there's one of these like little funky stickers that you can pull away to get more information than you occasionally see on these pill bottles oh and uh back here we just have uh the ingredients which uh is more elaborate than i would have thought and now i am seeing that this is actually um rso in here or at least as advertised this is uh not just any um thc distillate it is rso rick simpson oil doesn't really change things that much it's just a different extraction method uh let's get that sticker off and get to the promised effects of these pills which are high euphoria we shall see i'm realizing now i have no liquid in here with me so good old-fashioned dry swallow it is and here are capsules ah okay these are quite a bit different than what i have seen these are just little gelatin capsules but instead of like liquid filled there's a very dry amount of i guess rso there at the bottom uh just kind of splattered in there i'm not sure how well it's showing up on camera uh but it just looks like somebody just took a little dropper of some really sticky goo and put it in this capsule um not very appealing looking but you know uh you gotta do it one way so here we are here is again our 25 milligram capsule uh let's give it a try down the hatch it goes one and two no taste believe it or not other than the elegant capsule two all right that's half of what we're gonna be doing for this review we're gonna do all 100 i'm gonna take about i don't know uh 30 minutes to an hour or so before i try these next two but once i do about uh 90 minutes to two hours after i have my second half of this dose i will come right back here guys to give you those most important part about all of the reviews the wrap up thoughts are these get zen high thc capsules gonna get you high for that guys you'll just have to stick around and i'll be right back in just a bit thanks for watching welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two and a half hours since i had my first get zen capsule i was about to show you the logo again but i ripped the sticker off i can't do that uh and about what did i say two and a half hours inside my first probably about 90 minutes since i had the second two the other half of my dose and these capsules work pretty well they're good uh the rso oil in there will get you quite high i'm still pleasantly high two and a half hours later um i'm not sure however that they are worth the premium over some of the other capsules uh of a similar strength at a lower price or higher milligramage um uh so if they are cheaper at your dispensary or if they're the only ones capsules they have available and you like capsules these will certainly do the trick but i don't think that they are necessarily worth a premium over anything else if um if they got some buddies or some papa and barclays or whatever in there and there's you know cheaper than these you're fine using those uh but these get zen will certainly get the job done so i'm gonna give them a thumbs up but again it's kind of a qualified thumbs up uh these are good but you don't need to spend the extra expense if these are more expensive than any other at your dispensary anytime we give a thumbs up we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that is not weed related we can give a little recommendation of very simple quick easy one this week just finished or re-watching the 2012 uh movie killing them softly uh which is i think available on netflix the stream right now stars brad pitt uh was a legendary bomb the year it came out but it is a great great film pretty quick like 90 minutes to get through too uh super cynical super dark uh about um oh uh what is the movie about uh it's it's about [ __ ] you pay me that's what it's about i guess uh so check out killing them softly on netflix and if they're not too expensive check out get zen capsules the high thc especially if you like the capsules they'll get the job done and that guy's then is gonna do it for this cherry on top it's gonna do it for the review until we see you for our next one stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "l5CnT3CzYMM": "hi there bugs in my last video i showed you guys how to make can of butter in the magic potter 2.0 machine if you don't know how to make magical butter click up here and i'll show you how in today's video we are going to bake something with it i asked you guys in the comment section what you guys wanted me to bake with it and the number one comment was chocolate chip muffins and i'm totally down for a chocolate chip muffin i love muffins and i'm a basic guy i don't like a lot of crazy like random things like cranberry muffins or anything like that like blueberry muffins chocolate chip muffins that's that's about it so today we're going to turn this can of butter into some chocolate chip muffins i want to give a huge shout out to magical for sponsoring this video and for sending over a magical butter machine to give away i will be giving away a magical butter machine on my instagram page check me out on buds and beards on instagram for your chance to win a magical butter machine thank you so much magical for sending this over and without further ado let's get into making some weedy chocolate chip muffins oh yeah you guys can use cookbook and beards to save 20 off at passionbutter.com okay now let's get into making some weedy muffins there are a few ingredients that you will need to make these cannabis-infused chocolate chip muffins you'll need one and a half sticks of melted can of butter two cups of all-purpose flour two large eggs a half a cup of milk 3 4 cups of granulated sugar 2 teaspoons of baking powder half a teaspoon of salt and lastly 1 cup of chocolate chips let's get to making some muffins the first thing you want to do is preheat your oven to 375 degrees [Music] the first thing we want to do is add all our dry ingredients to the mixer so i'm gonna add the flour the sugar two teaspoons of baking powder half a teaspoon of salt and then we are going to mix that up [Music] once you're done combining your dry ingredients then it's time to add your wet ingredients the first thing i'm going to add is the melted can of butter [Music] the vanilla and the two large eggs and mix those ingredients well [Music] once you've mixed that well you can add your cup of chocolate chips [Music] and our muffin batter is done before we fill our muffin pan with our batter we need to prepare the pan and what better way to prepare it than using more peanut butter i'm going to use a tablespoon of melted can of butter and i'm going to brush that all over each of the muffin tins now that our muffin pan is prepared it is time to add the batter to each of the tins all right we're going to place these in the oven for 20 minutes what just had a thought i think once the muffins are about halfway done baking i'm going to add on top a little bit of sugar and brown sugar just to give it a little bit of extra sweetness we're trying to hide that wheaty taste as much as possible so little sugar topping to it these are our cannabis infused chocolate chip muffins yes i went a little bit ham on the sugar topping but i'm gonna let these cool for about probably 10 minutes and then we'll try one all right you guys i'm back i've been waiting over these muffins waiting on them and i think they're ready i think they're ready i think they're ready okay so i'm so excited i have a nice glass of milk let's get one of these muffins out and try one first things first the can of butter worked really well at acting as a non-stick like type spray because it came out all in one piece like this is the most perfect little [Music] it smells a little weedy i'm not gonna lie when we were baking it it didn't smell at all but like now that it's actually in my hand i can definitely smell the candy butter which is [Music] um it's not the best it doesn't taste the best it's not the best tasting on a scale of one to ten i'd give it probably like a a six it's edible oh my god it looks green [Music] look at that it literally looks like lime green inside of the muffin from the can of butter and the taste is just like it's just so off it has like such a strong wheaty taste but you guys know i'm gonna still eat it so that i can give you guys a report on how did it make me feel i both said from the big bite that i had at first it just kind of felt like a walk on my stomach which is more like how edibles feel when i'm like this is gonna like slam me adding that sugar on top that was a good choice [Music] because there is such an aftertaste to this muffin you were gonna want that sugar it i think it's what it's like saving it like i keep lifting my fingers because like i have the sugar on it and it makes it like slightly better i need some milk gonna go finish my muffin and i'll be back i don't know if i'll have a second muffin or not probably not because like i'm not feeling the taste unless this muffin just like knocks me on my socks and then i might have another one like right now but they're gonna be something i'm gonna have to space out and make myself eat i'm not gonna lie to you guys all right i'll be back in probably like 30 minutes to an hour probably an hour it normally takes about an hour cheers [Music] oh my gosh when i smile ew what gosh no you can't have my muffin no no what the hell all right let's talk it's been like probably 45 minutes and i'm gonna tell you guys what i've never had an edible hit so like hard so fast before ever like ever in my life like these muffins have to be at least probably like [Music] 150 milligrams probably each like these are strong ass muffins um they taste absolutely horrible like no lie this was probably the worst tasting edible that i've had in a while like it was pretty bad like i did not enjoy the taste of it at all the feeling though is amazing like 10 out of 10 recommend for the feeling the only thing that i've ever made that i would recommend more than this would be the sugar cookies that i made at christmas time i think it was last year or the year before those those actually taste pretty good and they were like really effective these taste like crap but they they are really really effective so i'm not mad i'm not bad at all because like at the end of the day this is what we're searching for is like this feeling right here if i'm able to do that with like trim and like a little bit of shake that's amazing because that's just stuff that would have gotten thrown away anyway so thank you guys so much for watching this video if you like it give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below let me know what else you guys want me to make because i still have some peanut butter in this refrigerator over here like we still have three and a half sticks of can of butter over here to make stuff with and we're gonna make stuff with it so let me know what you want let me know what you guys want to see me make out of this canned butter i'm like having problems with my sentences now i'm gonna go check out my instagram page if you guys want to win a magical butter machine you can use cup buds and beards for 20 off at magicalbutter.com and i'll see you guys around for whatever sewing activity or video that i come up with for next time and i hope that like whatever we make is as effective as those muffins and i seriously think that it had something to do with this butter i think that that d-carve box really ensured that i was de-carving that cannabis properly because i feel like my oven was off not that i've made a bunch of edibles in this oven but i bet my other oven was off too and i wasn't de-carving it properly i think that that made all the difference in this butter which made all the difference in those muffins [Music] i'm like out of breath and i slightly have the giggles from the the um the muffin but anyways thank you guys so much for watching and i'll see you guys around for whatever show activity or video i come up with for next time bye guys [Music] you", "BzE0YPXhj3Y": "so if you click this video it's probably because you want to learn how to make some edibles and you want to make some really easy to do recipes at home edibles which is a good thing because that's what we're gonna do in this video I'm going to teach you the five most easiest things to make at home with edibles and cannabis my name is Judy Shekar and you're watching puff puff toast let's start off with number one cannabutter one of the most common things to make with cannabis it's super easy to make all you need to do is melt some butter and as you're melting the butter you add a gram of ground cannabis into that butter and you keep melting it melting and melting it until it's nicely infused with the cannabis and voila you have cannabutter super easy super simple and a lot of people use it the second thing that you can make at home is cannabis tea using the can of butter which is interesting because I actually wouldn't expect putting butter in teeth but a lot of people do and apparently this tastes really good so all you do is brew your favorite tea and a teaspoon of that can of butter into your tea and it's this blend of something really delicious warm and nice the third thing that we're going to talk about on how to do our Keith's cookies so Keith is basically the extra powder that comes off of the cannabis bud or when you ground cannabis any leftover powder that happens all of that can actually be used to make keep cookies and and they're really easy to make all you do is you get that left over ground Keith add in some cookie dough bake it and boom you've got Keith's cookie super easy super simple very very delicious apparently number four is I want to tell you how to make pot brownies okay so super easy again but one thing that you want to make sure that you want to have is a brownie mix that uses foil because what you're gonna do is you're gonna heat the oil up and as you're heating oil you're gonna add the ground cannabis to it and then you're gonna mix that oil into a brownie mix and then you basically bake it and you have pot brownies the last thing that I want to teach you how to make is called a firecracker very very very easy all you need are graham crackers peanut butter and cannabis powder so ground cannabis call you to as you spread some peanut butter on the ground cracker add some of the ground cannabis on top of it slap on another peanut butter spread ground cracker on top to make a sandwich cover it in foil put it in the oven for 30 minutes and then you've got this amazing sort of peanut butter brownie cracker sandwich with cannabis so those are the top five really easy ways to make cannabis edibles at home however I'm sure there's more out there and if there is let us know in the comments below let us know what do you make it home with cannabis that's all for me my name is Trudy Shekar and you're watching puff-puff post", "pQwaeMBquhc": "hi I'm chef Tony Galliano for

watching and don't forget subscribe to our YouTube channel just a goodness magical magical", "CSDc7_mWIXo": "great so should we like to smoke a J or something going yeah I don't know what the plan is but it seems like usually the time when you smoke a J here in Seattle everybody is about craft everything beer coffee beard oil you name it well I'm about to meet the folks over at craft elixirs who bring crap to cannabis and they're gonna give me a tour of their production facility and then later they're gonna show me what wheat hospitality and the Emerald City is all about let's get it to it how are these sauces or syrups used exactly the elixirs are really we made these to be for making cocktails the first one that I have is a little simple it's just a basic simple syrup people like to use them for making tea or like to make a mojito you'd use it to sweetening anything you want to see the other ones have some flavor to them it looks like oh yeah we have our Ballard beet which is our blueberry orange just is probably one of our most popular flavors this is one is our habanero syrup we call this one our Capitol Hill heat yam the craft tab you could see the grower that we work with whose Buffalo Bill Buffalo Bills the name of the stream and how medicated is like one of these bottles are one serving one capful is five milligrams okay there's yeah I mean had it ready it makes me think of like an Asian hot sauce you know what I mean that's sweet by hot at the same time so this is about five right here ballpark well that's virgin cuz you can't consume any cannabis on site okay how did you get started doing craft elixirs when the rules changed here in Washington for recreational business I wanted to be a part of it and I wanted to make something that you can do over and over again as we've been selling them I'm hearing from a customer all these other ways that they're using them it's been really exciting to go into store and some and we'll say something like oh I used the Bernita dragon and we marinated our pork in it and we made these fantastic pork tacos they're pretty versatile they're very versatile you can do a lot with our syrup you'll see when we get off site even get a chance to really tie them here we've got Calvin he's gonna show us how we make our syrup so today we're making our Ballard beet elixir so it's a blueberry Orange how do we get this and this and this and this to turn into some elixirs well first we just have to get the basic simple syrup base we just add in all of our sugar a lot of sugar I mean that's the amount on that then we're just gonna move this red over here so this machine right here is just gonna like stir the hell out of that pot is that right yeah that has to stir for about 20 straight minutes we really want to make sure that the sugar is completely dissolved in the water after that we'll just toss all this fruit into that sugar water pot and I will cook for about an hour and ten minutes and that's when everything starts to kind of like break down and the blueberries kind of pop a little bit I mean it just smells like candy right now it's incredible we're gonna strain this we just have to get all the large fruit chunks out first we'll take all these oranges later and add them to our freaks by dehydrating them these are gonna turn into those delicious little dried fruit candies yeah so rather than just tossing all this through in the compost we like to repurpose it now we need a fine mesh strainer and that's gonna get all those right there billions of them yeah there's so many all we have to do is infuse it all right we got to get the cannabis in there so how do we do that the strain that we're working with is from our grower noble farms and it's their blue berry strength we have a giant tub of oil that we've extracted ourselves cannabis alcohol extraction it's what we do we use on an organic ethanol so it's a cleanest food grade oil you can get it's vegan it's gluten-free it's non-gmo it's kosher it's been blessed by a rabbi this is about five pounds of trim five pounds of trim will make approximately 350 grams of THC this much will make approximately 5,000 bottles of syrup and one bottle syrup has about 60 milligrams of tea this is like some really thick stuff how do you get from this super thick dense product to something that's a little bit more workable that you can actually pour into that yeah well with this all we have to do is just add in like a few drops of our food grade ethanol into it so that just kind of allows it to break down into liquid form so that it doesn't just stick in like large chunks in the syrup so last step is we've just got a little bit of potassium that we're gonna add as a stabilizer to this just right in there all right cool so in 20 minutes we're gonna have some cannabis area Calvin thank you so much thank you you're showing me how it's done this was really cool I can't wait to try it since we can't consume the elixirs on-site Jamie's taking me to the Winston house a cannabis inspired bed-and-breakfast where we'll be cooking up some food to infuse with the elixirs Wow Sebastian this place is beautiful what gave you the idea to start a cannabis inspired bed-and-breakfast you know I've seen how there was a lacking like a lot of hotels in places wouldn't like let people come consume cannabis there and so I wanted to create a place where people could come a smoked cannabis relaxed you know explore you know this amazing house and and explore amazing food cannabis I imagined the bed aspect of it is pretty great what's the breakfast like here well today we're gonna be doing a number of things I'm starting with these crazy featuring Jamie's elixirs is rolling a crepe anything like rolling a joint it all gonna roll a lot of joints I if it's anything like that I can probably pull it off it's similar and I think you can do it alright cool let's do it we'll just get you a crepe then do yogurt sauce that I've squeezed fresh orange into and just a touch of people hear it then blueberries oh that looks so good then from here you just fold it over like that then we do okay so now we're gonna infuse this thing yeah what I really like about these elixirs is you can pour them over anything you can pour it over french toast or even just a piece of toast you do it of a fancy crepes and so then our final touch as we'll do just a little bit more of this orange cream yogurt and then use orange slices Wow that is a good-looking breakfast do you think you can handle more breakfast yeah okay we have a savory application for the elixirs remember the pineapple lime jalapeno yeah so this is gonna go on a Southwestern inspired egg dish we have some chilies that we're gonna stuff with and eggs and peppers and some really sweet they just will put the jalapeno line syrup on top all right you guys definitely have some really tasty weed out here in Washington props thank you let's do it oh man okay I'm gonna start with the crepe I'm gone wow that was a really good grape awesome Jamie how Infuse do you think this is based on how much of this syrup we pour it on I mean this just like I think we put one capful on album so there's five milligrams and one which is seems like a really nice perfect amount I think it's a really great way to be able to incorporate cannabis but without necessarily like being so done by having a you know full course meal the eggs are you ready to try a different flavor yeah this is really good wow that really balances out like all the sweet and sort of part of that crepe and we've got the savory part of the breakfast Sebastian you know I think it's really great that you've got like a cannabis bed and breakfast cos you know I travel a lot too cannabis legal states and even when I'm there there's nowhere I can really smoke legally so to be able to stay somewhere smoke weed is like a huge convenience working in industry seeing how that was an area like you're saying like when you go to a place and you can't smoke and it's like oh I have to go walk off the property or something where you know where it shouldn't be especially when it's legal like at a booth like that so creating a place where people could come enjoy that you know and also enjoy really amazing vibrant atmosphere this cannabis inspired bed-and-breakfast has more to offer than just a bunch of weed and a great place to stay after the stoner breakfast Sebastien invited me to try some flavor tripping so what flavor tripping is there's this very it's called the miracle fruit when you eat it and shoot around your mouth it actually converts anything that sour or bitter into a really sweet experience for about 40 minutes to an hour and I think one great part about flavor tripping is you know incorporating cannabis into it when you're chewing it like spread around your mouth how's the lemon tasty right now that's crazy it tastes like it's like covered in sugar what's salty supposed to be okay so this tastes like a barbecue potato chip we're gonna eat this goat cheese right here yeah it tastes like super sweet cream cheese you're gonna pour some vinegar shots all right cheers to our help what this is the most significant change in flavor it tastes like one of your elixirs Jamie Sebastien thank you so much for this experience it was really like fun hunting spected treat I've always wanted to try these flavor berries and I can't wait to see what else do you guys have planned for our hangout here at your bed-and-breakfast well I've got one more cannabis infused surprise for you I'm doing I'm gonna leave you in the experienced hands of Miss Hannah rose great thank you so much Hannah so can you tell me what kind of massage this is absolutely so this is a cannabis infused massage so we have a wonderful oil oil you need is love this has a little bit of THC so it gets in there with the CBD and relaxes the nervous system that's sure so it's not psychoactive but it's kind of like a body high on the surface exactly yeah yep absolutely perfect well this is incredibly relaxing and - a really fun day here in Seattle and now Hannah Rose is topping it off with cannabis infused massage I'm just gonna enjoy this and I'm gonna pass out at this weed bed-and-breakfast and I suggest you do the same until next time Bon Appetit I think weed tourism is here to stay", "o3fYypXjEeM": "hi buds it's candy here today I'm going to be making THC infused strawberry lemonade that I made with distillate so I'm going to be a hundred percent honest with you I'm leaving a timestamp here so you guys can go straight to the recipe because I've made this way more complicated than I needed to be and basically this video you're gonna watch me turn a mistake into something magical I can start feeling the heaviness right now Dex first things first you're going to need a gram of distillate roughly it does all the grams and I'll be talking more about it later on two cups of sugar 1 cup of Everclear this recipe calls for a two-to-one ratio and we're using Everclear to dissolve the distillate that Everclear is something you could potentially skip next we need roughly two cups of half strawberries as well as one and a half cup of fresh squeezed lemons next you want to preheat the oven at 200 degrees and leave it at 200 degrees so that where we don't activate the THC and I honestly just so it you don't need to activate the TFC because it's already there so we just want to make sure we conserve as much as possible next get the 2 cups of sugar and put it into a pan then get the 1 cup of Everclear important to a bowl now we're going to be putting that one gram of distillate into the so that we can start mixing this distillate roughly houses around a thousand milligrams of THC in it the reason I wanted to put it and Everclear was so that it would dissolve evenly and that way I could put it evenly throughout the sugar my original plan was to make granulated sugar about what I did was I messed up and I closed the oven door and then it turned into a syrup so then I decided to work with what I had but yes I will be making an actual tutorial on how to do the guy kneeling sugar now we just mix the Everclear and the distillate together next you pour the mixture onto the sugar you could use a little bit of a wider pan than we did then we mixed it all together and make sure that everything is saturated evenly next just place to the 200 degree preheated oven and set your timer for 13 minutes and check for daily and this is where I messed up my original plan I did close the other door so it did cook down and it created an actual cistern so if you do want to make granular sugar you simply just leave the oven door open so that way it can all evaporated but then you get this golden to cool this is where the real recipe begins you simply boil two cups water and keep it on a very low simmer because you do not want to activate the THC and then I poured the syrup that I created into the water just to dilute it a little bit now here I'm going to be placing the actual instructions on how you can make it a lot easier and save the headaches basically ideally you would just put the two cups of water melt two cups of sugar into it and then add a distillate right on it I actually enjoyed several clearer taste to it it had a little bit of a move to the lemonade so I didn't mind it now it's time for the lemonade start cutting an equivalent of two cups of hats strawberries put them into a little bowl and then start mashing away you could certainly use a blender but according to my friend he doesn't believe in them use this now it's time to roll some lemons and get the juices flowing and start to squeeze the lemon juice in there I did get a roughly an equivalent of a cup and a half of lemon juice it could certainly be anything ever they want and then I add the mashed and pureed strawberry onto it I actually enjoyed the masher because it left Jack pretty pulpy give it a good stir and then we're ready to add the syrup we created put it in along with two cups of water and that's pretty much it after giving it a good little stir simply serve in chilled glasses and enjoy I really enjoyed making this granted it was a headache and a half just because of a failed experiment but you can always turn something negative into a positive and definitely this was a positive hope you guys enjoy it as we did and I'll see you guys later we're gonna feel it slowly I'm happy you", "UKYpi07Z3Pg": "in this video we will talk about how terpenes influence your cannabis choice terpenes are highly aromatic compounds that determine the smell of many plants and some animals an example of this would be to think of terpenes as notes when you're tasting wines or the hop flavor when you're drinking beer here are some popular terpenes found in cannabis amnesia haze is recognized for its uplifting buzz and has been known to contain karyophiline lemony and mircine granddaddy purple is recognized for its sedative effects and has been known to have mircine as its dominant terpene but also a noticeable amount of piney understanding the terpene taste of the strain will allow you to find strains that will be more enjoyable and at the same time will help you avoid the strains that are not thanks for watching i

the frosting is a little bit more yellowy like ivory than my bad it's because of the whipped cream but it don't matter just pretend it's white and now for the foam part we are going to decorate and yes your hands are going to get a little you know what is this called food coloring that's why that's how i was wearing gloves so keep that in mind wear gloves when you're using food coloring so

present shopping and I especially love Christmas Eve when Santa Claus comes so with that being said I know it's a little bit hard to get motivated to get all this stuff done in time so I'm gonna show you a good way to medicate to get you motivated for a long period of time so today what we're going to do is I'm going to show you how to utilize a good way to use your THD t-shirt what you're gonna want to do is dose out on your dropper 0.5 MLS so it's gonna be a half of a dropper full it's gonna look like this I got the shakes and then you're going to want to directly put that into your drink of choice I've chosen orange juice on ice and you can use it in coffee you can use it in tea you can use it at the beginning of the day the end of the day however you want to do it but it's gonna take about an hour to kick in since you're doing it orally and it's going to last anywhere between four to eight hours of relief so this is going to be a really nice body feeling to get you motivated and just have an excellent time so with that being said I'm gonna go ahead and put my half an ml in there that's gonna equal five milligrams of THC so I think that that's a good starting point if you want to up your dose you can if you want to lower your dose you can this is just right for me to do focus drill today other than that Cheers and Happy Holidays bye", "6vazUdmzi0U": "None"}
