{"fXqFWTGU-_s": "This video is all about full spectrum CBD oil benefits What is full spectrum CBD oil and why is it better than regular CBD oil? Check it out. Hey guys My name is Johnny Ross. I am a student at the University of Kentucky right now And I just did some research on CBD so that you don't have to if anything in this video is helpful for you I would really appreciate it if you would stop by my subscription button over to onder and Smack it maybe leave a comment leave a like if you don't like it. Let me know why share the video Don't forget to stay to the end because there is CBD there so full spectrum CBD oil is a type of CBD oil So if you're not really sure what CBD oil is in general, you can check out the video in the card above Basically CBD is one of 104 cannabinoids which are chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant These cannabinoids are particularly Medicinally useful for things like pain recovery mental clarity Inflammatory relief depression and anxiety relief and a ton of other cool stuff CBD is really helpful for humans full-spectrum CBD oil is CBD oil that has been extracted from the cannabis plant which includes all of the chemical compounds that the plant produces this includes terpenes flavonoids cannabinoids fatty acids and even THC when you extract all of the compounds from cannabis in Context of each other. They're more beneficial for you therapeutically Did you say that was th seed that now I did say there's THC in there Some people want THC free oils and that's totally understandable but a lot of times the THC content in a Seabee full-spectrum CBD oil is actually Point 3 percent or less so it's a trace amount of THC at best and it's not going to get you high You're not gonna feel any of the effects of that but it is going to help with the context of all the medicinal benefits that all the cannabinoids terpenes and flavonoids have for within that CBD or full-spectrum CBD oil is different from broad-spectrum CBD oil and CBG isolate exactly as it sounds is 99.9% CDD it usually comes in a powder looks a little bit like cocaine, but it's not cocaine It's CBD. It has wonderful healing effects for you but you do put it on your gums or under your tongue broad spectrum CBD oil is a CBD oil that has been doctored to contain many of the cannabinoids terpenes or flavonoids But they are usually select by whoever's mixing them or producing them and very generally speaking Broad-spectrum CBD oils and never have THC not even a little bit So you might ask why should I care? because full-spectrum CBD oil is actually clinically proven to be more beneficial for you than CBD isolate or even broad-spectrum a study that I'm going to put in the link in the description compared CBD isolate effectiveness to Full-spectrum effectiveness, they found that CBD was producing anti-inflammatory and anti What when they increase the dose there was a drop-off in the effectiveness they then remedied this by adding CBD to a full plant extract full-spectrum CBD and the dosage and effectiveness both rised together so like I was saying CBD in the context of all of the chemicals that the plant cannabis Produces is more effective than CBD itself, and I just wanted to show you guys this it's not Super relevant, but it is relevant. There's a website that has a terpene slider so you can go see what effects you want And then it will tell you what terpenes and flavonoids that you should get in your oils That's pretty freakin. Cool cannabis has over 400 known chemical compounds that it produces the majority of medicinal benefits come from cannabinoids like cannabidiol and THC terpenes and flavonoids also have medicinal benefits, but they're not unique to cannabis A lot of essential oils are actually made from terpenes and flavonoids These chemical compounds are generally responsible for the way that a plant or oil smells or tastes Flavonoids are more responsible for the things but pigmentation as well So what colors are in your plant because full-spectrum CBD oil comes from a certain plant. It is actually very important to know what strain your CBD oil is coming from so You know what specific medicinal or therapeutic properties that you're getting in that oil because it's relevant to the genetics of the strain of cannabis That it came from that's what I got for you guys today except for one more thing Which is a link in the description to get some broad-spectrum CBD oil from a veteran-owned American company that sells CBD called pure American hemp oil Try them out first link in the description below and generally thank you guys so much for listening once again I appreciate your time. If you appreciated this time with me that we spent together just now intimately consider subscribing consider leaving a comment nasty or nice doesn't matter and leave a like or just keep watching different videos on my channel because they're interesting and maybe they would Benefit you Thanks for watching guys. Peace If you're not really sure what CBD oil is you can watch this video right here click the card above and Eat my the majority of medicinal benefits come from cannabinoids like cannabis can it be debited can't cannabidiol and THC", "HYMd4rhjF0A": "it's another beautiful day to watch another video and for me to be here with you right now I just want to talk about full-spectrum hemp oil what it is and what the difference is between it and regular CBD oil so full-spectrum refers to when the pure oil extracted from the hemp plant contains all the same cannabinoids and compounds found in the original plant cannabidiol is actually very very beneficial it makes up over 90% of the cannabinoid content in a plant it's non psychoactive and it's the main focus of the benefits of hemp oil full-spectrum hemp oil contains cannabidiol as well as everything else that's included with it so in addition to all the other different cannabinoids in a hemp plant full-spectrum hemp oil also has a great variety of essential vitamins minerals omega fatty acids flavonoids chlorophyll and terpenes health benefits of a full spectrum hemp oil go beyond just the therapeutic benefits of CBD itself the array of cannabinoids and other natural constituents and compounds that are in the entire hemp oil like the whole oil work together in what's known as the entourage effect and together these compounds all work harmoniously to magnify their therapeutic properties this mix of cannabinoids essential nutrients proteins essential fatty acids they'll work together synergistically to encourage homeostasis and balance in our health full spectrum hemp oil comes in tinctures edibles they also have like lotions and capsules available you guys might want to know like does it show up in drug tests did hemp THC is a very minor constituent and only appears in under 0.3% by dry weight so this extremely low level of THC in hemp makes the hemp oil the full spectrum hemp oil non psychoactive and safe to use for all ages and today we're gonna be checking out this brand called Veritas Farms which is a farm-to-table full spectrum hemp oil company located in Colorado they also have capsules and gummies as you guys know I have been going through a lot of anxiety lately I do have CBD oil but I'm also you know trying out different brands just to see what's different and what I like and so far various farms has been really great transparency and sustainability is really important to them they use organic ingredients as much as possible they grow extract formulate bottle label and ship all from their farm locally they are third-party tested and they also emphasize so much that they're not a CBD company they're not a THC company they offer full spectrum hemp oil which offers the benefits of the entourage effect this one is strawberry flavored but they also have a salted caramel flavor that I was interested in trying out but I wanted to go simple first so I got strawberry I just placed dropper like straight under my tongue I like using the oil tincture for immediate effects for anxiety and stress the gummies and capsules would be the best for sleep because they set in a little bit later and one more item from various farms that I really really have been loving is this full-spectrum Fido cannabinoid rich lotion and we're talking about full spectrum but CBD for sure is really really good for inflammation stress also like joint pain I've been using this on my face lately my skin has been breaking out my like bumps on my chin have been going away had these little things go on they've gotten better this has been really really good for my skin anyway that's my little talk about CBD oil versus full spectrum hemp oil if you want to learn more about full spectrum hemp oil make sure you look in the description below but now I'm going to go I need to take some of this because it's time to go wake my grandma up so I can get her all ready for the day my parents out of town I'm her caregiver for the day which stresses me out a little bit because being a caregiver is very it's really stressful and also when it's somebody that you are related to can also be I don't know it's caused me a lot of anxiety lately so I've definitely been taking advantage of this full spectrum take some of this [Music] [Music] so I really wanted to go to yoga class today at the studio but my brother I guess wouldn't be home until later so no one could take care of my grandma and it kind of life are shaded me a little that I had these plans that was really excited about because it's by a teacher that I've been wanting to go to but that like it didn't fall through and I'm really really rigid with my schedule and I get really frustrated when things don't go my way because I'm like a control freak I especially like when it's things that I'm planning for and then I'm excited for and then it just like doesn't happen for some reason and it's harder for me to be flexible which is really interesting because this morning I was reading a little excerpt from this book called don't sweat the small stuff it just lies around the house they're just simple ways to keep the little things from taking over your life so before I knew that my brother would be coming late and I wouldn't be able to go to this yoga class that I was excited about I read this excerpt said that says be flexible changes in your plans like once we get something into our mind a plan it can be tricky to let go of it and just go with the flow and it's hard for me to go with the flow is it more important to stick to my original set my rigid schedule or to go with what I planned them to be available for my grandmother is missing that yoga class worth getting upset over just because plans didn't fall through the way that they were meant to be the more general question is what's more important getting what I want and keeping my plans or learning to go with the flow clearly to become a more peaceful person you must prioritize being flexible over rigidity most of the time it's also helpful to expect that a certain percentage of plans will change if you make allowances in your mind for this inevitability then whatever happens you can say here's one of those inevitabilities in this little expert you said like you'll feel more relaxed yet you won't sacrifice any productivity you may even become more productive because you won't need to expend so much energy being upset and worried and I think that's a big thing it's like okay I need to just relax accept the fact that I missed a plan that I wanted to make today well rather than worrying about it and rather than be upset over it I could just make more plans and now I have space and room in my life in my head to just clear it out just relax and plan something better and do something else in that time I feel like this little rigidity that I have is what makes it hard for people around me to to like ask me for things or talk to me about things because I'm so rigid with my plan and I'm like me I don't want to change anything and that's what he says - it's like it'll make the people around you feel more peaceful and relaxed around you that they won't be walking on eggshells to ask about different things my mom definitely tiptoes around me because I'm just really rigid with my plans and I'm like very set in my ways and I get like upset over small things that change those plans so I don't know just a little a little tidbit instead of going to that yoga class I'm just going to do yoga outside in the Sun and enjoy it and also be present over here compromise being flexible me and although this might seem like a normal thing to most of you guys to me it's not and this is something that I personally struggle with and I hope I'm not alone on this but some of you might just be like what the heck Amanda it's just like a change in plans just go and do something else like it's not a big deal to most people but it's a big deal to me [Music]", "dBjFJRXboI8": "Marten Carlson: Hey guys, Marten here from\nMattress Clarity. Today, I'm reviewing the Populum Full-Spectrum\nHemp Oil. You've probably seen online a lot of videos,\na lot of articles about CBD oil. I want to talk a little bit about the science\nbehind that. I want to talk about the Populum here, my\nexperience with it, the benefits I felt, and some other things to consider. Let's get started. [music] Marten: I want to talk about the science behind\nCBD. First I want to say, if you want to see a\nlist of my top picks for CBD oil, Google Mattress Clarity best CBD oil. What exactly is CBD? It stands for Cannabidiol. It is a phytocannabinoid, a compound found\nin Cannabis sativa. One of the other phytocannabinoids which we're\ngoing to find in Cannabis sativa is THC. While THC is going to have some stony properties,\nit's going to give you that more of that high feeling, you're not going to get that feeling\nwith CBD taken from hemp plant. While THC is illegal in many states, CBD oil\ntaken from hemp plants is legal in all 50 states. Definitely keep that in mind. In terms of what exactly CBD can help you\nwith, while it's not going to give you that stony feeling, it can help with anxiety, nausea,\nand inflammation. Last but not least, it can help with sleep. As a person who deals with anxiety and that\nhas sleep issues, that's why I want to try out CBD oil. I want to know why you're interested in CBD\noil? Is it to help with your sleep, help with your\nanxiety, or for some other reason? Leave your answer in the comments section\nbelow. I want to see what everyone has to say. Now let's look at the Populum. Before I talk about the Populum, I do want\nto say I am not a doctor. If you're considering adding CBD to your medical\nregimen, or your sleep regimen, do talk to a medical professional. With the Populum here, you're going to have\nthree options -- 250 milligrams, 500 milligrams, and 1,000 milligrams. For the potency I went with a 500-milligram,\ntheir most popular potency. What exactly is in here? First off, you're going to have your CBD oil. This is a full-spectrum hemp oil. While some are going to be CBD isolates, some\nof those competitors are going to get only CBD oil, this is full spectrum. It's also going to have some other phytocannabinoids\nthat naturally occur in hemp plants. In here as well, you're going to have some\nphytocannabinoids such as CBG, which is also going to help with nausea and have anti-inflammatory\nproperties. In addition to that, you're going to have\nsome terpenes. Terpenes are essential oils found in the hemp\nplant, and those are going to have properties. They're going to help with the flavoring,\nalso give you some more sense of well-being. In here, you're also going to have hemp seed\noil, grape seed oil, coconut oil, and cold-pressed orange oil. There's a lot in this bottle. These extra elements are going to help with\nflavoring, also going to have some amino acids, help with your metabolism and your immune\nsystem. There's a lot in here. If you want to know exactly what's in this\nmodel, don't worry. Every bottle is going to come with your lab\nresults. You're going to know exactly what is in this\nbatch of CBD oil. It's also a third-party tested. While it's not FDA approved, you know exactly\nit's in this bottle. It's tested for quality and effectiveness. How do you use the Populum? It's very, very simple. You first, unscrew the top here, and it's\ngoing to be a dropper. In terms of how much you want to fill it with,\nit does depend on how long you've used CBD oil for. If you're just getting started, Populum recommends\nusing 8 milligrams to 8.5 milligrams. This is the 500-milligram potency so it's\ngoing to be about a half a dropper. Once I have that, I put it under my tongue\nand then squirt the liquid under my tongue. I'll leave it in my mouth for 30 seconds. They also recommend you can work the liquid\non your cheeks with your tongue. After the 30 seconds, take two deep breaths. You can drink down the liquid and you're good\nto go. Let's talk about my experience with the Populum. I'm going to break that down into three sections\n-- falling asleep, staying asleep, and then the morning after. In terms of falling asleep, this worked very,\nvery well for me. I took it for a few weeks. Every night before bed when I'm watching TV,\nI would take this about 30 minutes before bed, and it definitely calmed me down. My anxiety was less and I deal with anxiety. Before bed sometimes it was hard for me to\nfall asleep. With the Populum, I definitely fell asleep\nmuch more quickly. In terms of staying asleep, I slept through\nthe night with no problem. However, that's not usually a big issue for\nme, staying asleep, so take that into account. But it did not negatively affect my sleep. The morning after, that's where I had some\nissues with the Populum. Waking up, I did feel a little bit groggy,\na little bit washy as I'm started out my day at work, out of it a little bit, having trouble\nfocusing. I will note this is my first time using CBD\noil. I lowered my dose over the next couple days. It did seem to work itself out. But keep that in mind, if you're just starting\nto use the CBD for yourself. Let's talk about some of the pros and some\nof the benefits I experienced using the Populum. First off, it made it easier to fall asleep. If you're looking for a CBD oil to help you\nfall asleep more quickly, definitely ease you down into a nice state of relaxation before\nyou sleep, take a look at the Populum. Also, if you want something to help you stay\nasleep all night, the Populum worked for me in that respect. If you want to sleep throughout the night,\nthe Populum could also work for you. I'm also a big fan the fact the Populum is\nfull spectrum. You're not just getting a CBD isolate, you're\nalso getting other phytocannabinoids. You get the full effect of the hemp plant\nwith this full-spectrum hemp oil. Lastly, speaking about the third-party testing,\nI like the fact they bring in outside scientists to come in and test this product to make sure\nyou get the best quality, the best effectiveness with the CBD oil. Let's talk about the cons. Some of the things you might want to consider\nif you're looking at the Populum. First off, I experience some morning grogginess\nthe next day. If you want someone's going to help you wake\nup clear-eyed and refreshed, the Populum might not be the best match for you. Keep this in mind. If you're looking for something with a lot\nof potency options there are only three with the Populum -- the 250, the 500, and the 1,000-milligram. Some other companies are going to have five\nor six options, so more options for you in terms of potency. Also, this CBD oil is not FDA approved. That's not necessarily a con for the Populum\nbecause most CBD oils are not FDA approved. But keep this in mind if you're going to add\nthis to your medical regimen. Lastly, in terms of price, right now it's\n$99 for a bottle for the 500 milligrams. That is very affordable for a CBD oil, but\nif you're comparing this to other sleep supplements, it might be on the pricier side. In the end, I enjoyed my experience with the\nPopulum. It helped me fall asleep more quickly, stay\nasleep, very much a nice experience overall. I will just note, if you're looking for something\nto have you waking up feeling more refreshed, you might want to look elsewhere. That's about it.

CBD you guys a little background info about my story coming off of some super invasive antidepressants and talked about how CBD has helped me throughout that process and did a demo dab of the CBD isolates lab from Sammy distillery and a little review on that so you haven't already be sure to check that video out this last week and a half since that first video went up husband incredibly unproductive for me so I'm sorry that it's taken so long to get another video up but to catch you up I went down to zero milligrams so I am completely off the antidepressants that I was on I assumed that going down from five milligrams to zero would be somewhat similar to the ten milligram to five milligram drop which wasn't quite as bad as some of the other ones along the way going down 30 40 50 milligrams at a time but I definitely assumed wrong on that one when you're on such a high dose of a drug as invasive as pristiq is for as long as I was which was almost seven years I think that coming down to zero is just a total shock to the system no matter how fast or slow your weaning off of it I don't know if you guys could just tell I just had like a big chill go through my body yeah I could tell my body was pissed off and looking for higher doses still when I was on the five milligram but now that I'm totally off and there's no SSRIs or SNRIs in my body whatsoever that's like my system is just revolting and every way possible to get my attention so these past four or five days have been especially brutal to say the least my body's not really regulating temperature the right way the nausea has been pretty unbearable that's the worst part for me the zaps I think I mentioned in the last video at this point I've become pretty much non-stop I guess the best way I can describe them is it's what I imagined it would feel like if you were to stick your finger in an electric socket a dull electric socket but for the entire day or something it's a really bizarre feeling yeah not sleeping a lot not eating a lot my back and my neck are locking up a lot more than they were when I was still weaning down so some rough days but all that being said I got a couple more grams of the CBD isolate and some serendipity terpenes from the Seabee distillery a few days ago and I was planning on doing that as a review for my second video but I've been having a lot of trouble actually getting on camera to smoke anything with the level of nausea I've been having and when I do smoke it's feeling pretty tough on my body right now like the actual act of smoking so I was really really excited today to see that this package arrived with a bottle of 500 milligrams CBD t-shirt from this distillery so I'm going to review this instead could not have come at a better time I'm really excited to see how it goes um I've never tried any tinctures so this review is for you guys but I'm also pretty pumped to see what I can do myself so why don't you guys to be able to experience the whole process with me so yeah this is one of the CV distilleries new full-spectrum 15 milliliter teachers they carry at 250 milligram and a 500 milligram this one is 500 I've been getting a lot of questions about tinctures whether or not they actually work do I like them are they better or worse than dabbing and the truth is I've never tried them so I'm gonna go ahead and drop a couple probably a good number under my tongue so we can get it kind of into my system let it sit for a minute or two and then I'll come back and talk about the product so even here and just go right under my tongue okay so it's been about a minute and a half um first impressions first of all I like the taste a lot it's subtle but it has a pretty distinct hemp flavor to it if you've never tried him it's just pretty earthy and like I said though not too strong um the ingredients on the back just CBD extract hemp seed oil and MCT which is with coconut oil so we've got a high quality product here no [ __ ] you know I love that about the Seabee distillery I feel like a lot of the products that I see out there they're fun you know I mean like they seem like fun products which is cool but for me I want something that really is gonna do the job and CV distillery has not disappointed yet so far it's actually I'm kind of surprised at how fast it's working it's been about two minutes yeah and I already my nation is starting to go away which is always what amazes me about CBD and see the color of it is kind of a green Brown comes in this little glass bottle with a dropper top the size is perfect I like that it's something I could just have in my pocket or my purse in my car in a backpack super convenient that's a huge plus you know I love the isolate and it's my go-to but especially having this issue that I've been running into with not being able to smoke lately and also just not always being at home or somewhere where you can smoke I think this is a really really wonderful alternative so I like that it's super discreet it's quick it's easy to use you guys saw you can just put a couple of drops under your tongue yeah and now I'd say it's been four or five minute it's um I was shaking a lot before and that's gone down a lot I was sweating before I don't feel like I'm really as hot my body is kind of regulating a little better the knowledge is not totally gone you know don't get me wrong it's not like you use two drops and you're not gonna be sick anymore but I am interested to see if over the next half hour or hour the not completely subsides that would be cool to check out and I'll definitely let you guys know how it goes in the next video I'll probably start off with a wrap-up I guess of this team sure but um so far I can tell you that I already recommend this product coming from these past few days of not being able to actually smoke CBD and knowing how much it helps me getting this product today has been really really exciting and yeah I hope that this review helps you guys out if you guys are looking to buy some tincture or check out the CB distillery please check out the link in the description of this video and as always if you have any questions feel free to hit me up in the comments have a great one", "MlKEp5kFqss": "row row row your blood fool the CVB break it down roll it up line it up hit it no more is 8800 work you know what I just realized I'm not rolling a blunt today well I'm not running a blunder in this review I'm still going around a bluff fool to CBD break it up light it up he didn't know more as IDE my bow ties crooked what up um welcome to smoking legal or if you've been here before then welcome back to smoking legal that means you know how we do we're gonna review a couple of things we're gonna have lose each other down in the comments and we're gonna have a nice warm and open conversation before I go any further please forgive me how could I be so rude let me introduce myself I go by the name tears and our review [ __ ] mainly um and today today we have a product that I really really enjoy I'm gonna do a lot more reviews this year on things other than just the actual flower I'm gonna review a lot more CBD products and one of my favorite CBD products is tincture this right here is a honey lemon tincture it's 1500 milligrams and it's full spectrum CBD that you take a look at it this comes from let me get Michael let me get my influence at home and this how'd I do it oh yeah oh yeah it's the ozone Oh close close close Oh that's right sue me it's coming from Monroe farms it says to suggested for best results is to drop under tongue and hold for about 30 to 60 seconds one milliliter equals 50 milligrams of CBT the ingredients are MCT or derived from organic coconuts also help extract organic flavor organic stevia leaf extract extract of honey and lemon it's an all around the product it says that it's about you got to get about 30 servings per container um I like this product a lot mum reforms has great tincture see what I reached out to them and I ordered some one of the latest said they're not too proud of the bottle itself per se I don't think it's nothing wrong with it you know it's a bottle of tension but hmm almost [ __ ] some [ __ ] up it's a bottle of teacher I'm more into what's inside the bottle to see if it's actually gonna do me any good I've lived with this product for about a week now it's amazing for me you're not always gonna be in a situation to where you have access to be able to smoke the flower although I do think that smoking gives you the benefits and effects of the CBD the fastest tincture is excellent I use it throughout my workday and I'm sure that goes so you guys I got a one milliliter of it you see how it has just up that's like oh [ __ ] him it has a slight color to it so you're gonna put it up on your top [Music] now I'll put it up on the tongue you can still taste it I'm gonna do it another little jump on top of the tongue so I can just give you a little straighter flavor profile the honey is it's prevalent it's in the forefront you can really taste that honey I like honey hence the reason I really like this lemon honey tincture the lemon profile the lemon is there too but it's light it's not as strong as the honey is in it and with tincture I for me I found that it usually takes about 10 minutes maybe 5 to 10 minutes to kick in some people said 15 minutes there's just so many benefits from it everyone just can't smoke period everyone is not gonna be able to enjoy that CBD flower like that I have a friend who I gave a bottle of tincture to and she uses it she uses it for headaches she said it has done amazing things for her for her when she gets headaches you take some of the tincture and before you know it her headache is gone she also told me ladies she also told me that she uses the tincture for cramps she gets very very bad cramps and it just has her bent over sometimes so she'll use though she use the tincture for the cramps my aunty who is a she had a tumor removed from the back her neck she uses the tinctures she actually prefers the tinctures over prescribed medication I'm not trying to influence nobody in that way I'm just sharing the story of what my auntie does she swears by this CBD tension she swears by it she swam back she swept back I get it oh she swears by it it's been about three or four minutes and I can slow this off feel the effects coming in um it's it's gonna calm you down it's great for me it's great for my anxiety I can what I really like to do is I can have a meeting or something at work or if I'm going to be the client sometimes it you know stressful situations can cause that anxiety to kick in or or because that nervousness to kick in so I found that by taking the tension that it really helps settle that anxiety settle those nerves a little bit so that I can walk into that meeting confidently so I can meet that client confidently I can take this I can stand up in front of a group of people and talk fluidly and not be nervous I like the 1500 milligram there's a thousand milligram there's 1500 and I believe Monroe Farms also has a 3,000 milligram I've never tried the 3000 I want to know I want to try the 3,000 milligrams because the 15 milligram the 1,500 milligrams it usually I usually do - I'm not gonna lie I'll do one in front of the time I'll wait about 15 seconds let that kick in and then I'll do another one I'll do that one on top of the tongue and I won't even wait for that I'm gonna be honest I'll just go ahead and swallow it because I just feel like it's gonna kick in and I really like the 1500 I like the taste of the tinctures I really like the ease of access to them because even if you want if you don't want to just be doing drop something depending on the flavor of your Oh your tincture I like to add a droplet fool in my coffee I also drink a lot of water during the day I took a lot of water and what I'll do is I'll get my bottled water and I'll put me two or three drops in that bottle of water because I'm gonna be drinking on it so why not be getting me some CBD at the same time that's true it is it's kind of oily so it kind of sits on top of when you shake it up it's a little bit uh oil droplets other than your water it looks it can look kind of funky it can look kind of funky bleed bulid oh it's really really good like I like it a lot so I put it in my water and Monroe one wrong hemp is that they have good products I haven't I haven't had a strand of flour from them that I didn't like this is my very first tincture from them and like I said I've been having it for about a week living with it using it on a daily basis and I really enjoy it I plan on keeping me a bottle of it on hand I like to have it not only for myself but I like to have it for others around me that would like to try CBD and they're just not gonna smoke it so you know if I have with me and work and a co-worker's has a headache or

positive or keep it pushing oh wow", "_KOUuNB0N9M": "[Music] what's up everybody Alex from uncanny here and today I want to talk to you about the difference between full-spectrum broad-spectrum and isolate based CBD hemp extracts [Music] I get this question all the time and it is honestly a pretty confusing topic people throw these phrases around without really knowing what they mean but today I'm gonna tell you exactly the difference between the three so first let's just talk about what this spectrum really is in full spectrum a broad spectrum and the spectrum really refers to the different compounds that are in the natural extract so when you think of a CBD oil it's not just CBD that's in that oil there's different fats there's different terpenes potentially different cannabinoids and other things that create the full picture and so in that sense a full spectrum product would be just that it has the entire full spectrum of naturally occurring compounds that are found in that extract so on the totally other side of the spectrum would be what's considered an isolate and as that sounds it's the CBD that's been stripped away and isolated from all the other naturally occurring compounds in that extract and then in the middle between an isolate and a full-spectrum extract you have the whole range of broad spectrum and as that sounds it doesn't necessarily have the full set of compounds but it has a lot of them or most of them for example at uncanny wellness we remove the THC from our products so that is technically part of the spectrum which is why we don't call ours a full spectrum extract instead it's a broad spectrum extract so it has the CBD it has the terpenes the flavonoids and all those other naturally occurring compounds in the extract a common misconception that people have is that you need THC in order for CBD to work properly there is some truth in that because THC and CBD work synergistically together but you don't need the THC for the CBD to work going off of that something like an isolate would work it just doesn't work necessarily as well as a full spectrum product so full spectrum is going to have apps everything in it as such if you remove any part of that spectrum whether you're removing the THC or even if you're distilling down and concentrating what's in the extract you're getting into the territory of broad spectrum so really most of what's out there in the market is gonna be a broad spectrum and not a full spectrum because full is just a very absolute phrase and as a natural result of the processing and extraction and refinement in to that final product form you do lose certain parts of that spectrum another important thing to understand is that the spectrum a full spectrum broad spectrum directly relates to what's known as the entourage effect and the entourage effect basically says that when you have CBD in conjunction with the other naturally occurring compounds that it's usually found with it has a greater amplified effect versus an isolate which is just CBD has no entourage has no other components of the spectrum and is less effective than a full or broad spectrum product so you can kind of think of it like there's more entourage effect happening the more full the spectrum is and as you start taking things away you're removing naturally-occurring compounds from that spectrum you're losing members of the entourage and over time you go all the way to an isolate format which has no entourage effects happening whatsoever the nice thing about a broad spectrum extract is that you can do something like THC removal which is what we do and that's nice for people that may have to get drug tested or just don't want any trace THC in their system or maybe they want to give it to their kids or a pet or they're a pilot or any reason like that they can still enjoy the benefits of the entourage effect and of a broad spectrum CBD extract without having any residual THC because the legal limit for hemp products is 0.3 percent THC so a full spectrum product could have at most 0.3% but you could easily remove that making a broad spectrum or end up removing everything for an isolate for most people the best option for a CBD product is going to be a full or broad spectrum extract isolates are kind of the pharmaceutical reduction of CBD it strips it away from everything else reducing its holistic nature and making it more controllable as such isolates are the cheapest form of CBD available and a lot of times people will actually just throw isolate into a product to make it a really high milligram count and then end up charging you more even though you're getting a lesser quality product so when you're out there trying to figure out which CBD product is best for you it's fair to either ask the company or look for where it says it on the label to see is it isolate broad spectrum or full spectrum and that should help you decide exactly what you're looking for so in summary on one end you have an absolutely full spectrum product that's gonna have the most other compounds besides CBD and it's going to have the most entourage effect on the other end you have an isolate where the CBD is stripped away from all the other naturally naturally occurring compounds there are no extra compounds in the extract and there's going to be no entourage effect and then in the middle you would have the range of broad-spectrum extracts that don't have all the naturally occurring compounds but have most of them and you're still getting the benefits of the entourage effect because of the turbines the flavonoids the polyphenols and all of the other array of compounds that are naturally present in a CBD hemp extract so that's it that's the breakdown between full spectrum and broad spectrum and isolate thank you so much for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a like leave a comment down below if you want to share your thoughts and make sure to share this

full spectrum CB a hemp oil with amino acids and fatty acids it is gluten-free and non-gmo rich in cannabinoids and turkeys and it is a vegan product for all you vegan folks out there can ability all in CBD afx is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and is legally imported and produced hashtag feel the difference and again we'll go over that with the fact sheet and back to the front let's pop it up and check out the bottle so here's your bottle much like the box CBD f/x have plus MCT oil 30 milliliters 500 series and again contains full spectrum CBD gluten-free non-gmo and it is vegan the ingredients are exactly the same as we went over on the box so I will over those again roll around same with the Supplemental facts we already read those off on the box and roll it around one more time and we're back to the front alright let's go over those effects that we were talking about shall we okay so I got the fact sheet out and this is for the CBD part okay you've probably heard old CBD is illegal not so CBD effects and the CBD oil contained in it are illegal for the following reasons non psychoactive hemp was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 step one there have biomass which means basically their crop comes with an import certificate signed off on by Homeland Security because we did cover it it is imported we only use CBD derived from the stalks of European grown hemp plants mm-hmm products meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it must be industrial hemp and contained less than 0.3 percent THC last but not least our products are considered exempt from the CSA and DEA drug scheduling practices which classify whole hemp extracts as schedule one drugs then you're like wow so yeah don't use available haha extracts from the stuff stocks of EU European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice so there you have it guys legal alright long as it comes from Europe as long as it's industrial and as long as it meets everything else which it does you're good good now you're like well okay that covers the CBD what's MCT though got some facts on that too alright so MCT or what is it is MCTS our medium chain triglycerides okay and there are fatty acids that your body can quickly and easily break down and convert to usable energy okay MCT oil is often recommended for people with medical disorders related to absorption such as Crohn's disease because of their ability to help your body make the best in the nutrients it takes in they added MCT to the CBD tincture primarily to ensure that you get the maximum benefit from the CBD that you're taking okay so basically the MCT stuff makes you absorb alright all of the CBD goodness in there which is awesome is CBD plus MCT oil used for a ketosis or part of a ketogenic diet swap pages one of the main reasons MCT oil is used on its own as a nutritional supplement is to keep your body healthy absorbing all the nutrition you throw at it a side effect is to keep your body in ketosis essentially that's a metabolic state where your body gets energy from fats instead of carbs this promotes a healthy metabolism and it has been linked in some studies to healthier weight and body composition so I'm sure you've heard of like the keto diets and all that good stuff oh it's even keto diet friendly come on come on that's awesome it's awesome so let's go ahead and try it with the bottle just spin it around and you will find some perforations and then once you do that it's doubly perforated so you can just grab it and then bone and then just take the whole thing off oh you actually don't have to take the whole thing off just get it to where you can open the top push down spin oh yeah there we go and let's

relaxed right yeah that's CBD [ __ ] it saves vacations for me I don't stress out like it's it's it's I think it's one of the best things I've ever tried for anxiety it's it's weird and I didn't even know I had anxiety until I started taking CBD I think these little jammies these are this is uh this will [ __ ] you up though this is one in one one part CB don't put this one but yeah it does not put this in your you can put in your butt but you will get no nervous you're gonna get paranoid but it's it's a weird like the CBD THC high is a different high because CBD does something to alleviate anxiety it sort of just leaks makes you comfortable with your own demise lets you do the existential angst is the flames don't seem so hot so you like yeah we're all gonna die yeah but right now we're not dead cool look at the colors let's feel that feel the warmth the Sun but this uh this is not like funk this is not functional like you don't wanna I don't do this if I have anything super important to do but but just CBD oil hmm I just find it it did puts you in a great place okay like it but I'm journal not topical its internal yeah topical is really good for muscle aches okay it's really good really the probably the best thing I've ever found for like a alleviating soreness and stiffness and stuff like that because I found I was yeah in Europe all of a sudden discovered that they actually had ibuprofen like cream to put on ibuprofens terrible for you alright really really bad what I found out was that if you let your pets lick it they get liver failure and die so don't did you guys accidentally didn't know I had a person who works at the Humane Society I mentioned you know mentioned that I found this stuff and like I just in desperation and Europe like she had some storm muscles and uh she's like don't let your pets like that cuz they were trying to kind of figure why these kittens were dying Oh God my friend Cameron Haynes is a runner and he runs marathons and runs ultra marathons he runs he's 240-mile Moab [ __ ] ridiculous runs that last three days and he was having like all this joint pain so he's taking ibuprofen every day of st. taking 800 milligrams not just once but sometimes twice a day and he was just constant aches and pains so dr. Rhonda Patrick had been on the podcast she was talking about the dangers of ibuprofen and about what it does to your gut biome and how much it [ __ ] you up and it actually creates inflammation and actually can cause stress or it can cause strokes rather and all sorts of horrible horrible things so I call him up and I said hey man that stuff's fine to take every now and then for a headache but you can't take that [ __ ] every day you just can't do it and you're you're [ __ ] your body up just get off of it and I sent him the recording he listened to it he's like Jesus Christ I don't have a stroke so he gets off of it all his pain goes away it turned out his pain was being caused not just by the running but by the fact that he was creating inflammation by destroying his gut biome by taking 800 milligrams of ibuprofen 2 times a day so the idea of like fixing himself was [ __ ] him up crazy death chasing that yeah yeah so [ __ ] ibuprofen okay well we don't I take it every now and then but you can't take it every day so you're a liar no I mean just saying don't take it every day but if I had like a bad headache I'll take you some Tylenol or some [ __ ] it's not Tylenol right

night out you didn't drink enough water right okay boom coming ahead yeah then you're fine you can still do that but CBD does that too it's better better for you than all that stuff seems to be no side effects okay all right the side effects is people think you're a hippie that's the only side effect right", "lO6fagHWtQo": "health tastes so good sometimes hey everyone welcome back to my channel and if you are new here my name is patrina shell and i am on an endless pursuit of life and everything incredible natural healing whatever makes life incredible and high-quality hi vibe that is what I'm about today I'm talking about my experience with CBD oil now CBD oil is the cannabinoids from the hemp plant and it has the THC removed from it so it's literally just the CBD which is non psychoactive so you will not get high from it it is literally full of the most healing properties of the whole plant the cannabinoids in the CBD oil actually work with our own and no cannabinoid system in our body our body is full of endocannabinoid receptors and what they do is create a homeostasis within our body so when you're taking a CBD oil it actually just amplifies that and it helps create the homeostasis feeling it has been proven to have myriads and health benefits I wanted to give it a go myself and see exactly how it would affect me and what great benefits I would feel from it I have now finished one whole bottle of this I'm on to my second bottle and I started taking CBD oil because I was suffering from adrenal fatigue I was super tired all the time no matter how much sleep I got I would wake up tired come 3:00 in the afternoon and I would crash and burn and I need super healthy I live a healthy lifestyle so this was really getting me down you know and then come the evening I was wide awake and I would be awake till 3:00 in the morning and it would throw off my whole day in my sleeping patterns and it was just not fun not at all not only that I also suffer from anxiety have a really bad ankle and that can cause me pain when I'm on it a lot I decided you know what with everything I've heard of CBD oil I should give it a go now from the very first day the very first dose I innocently felt a difference like my first dose was in the afternoon when I was feeling that crash-and-burn feeling like I was hitting a massive wall and I took my first dose of CBD oil and within 15 minutes I felt totally renewed I felt super calm tranquil like I felt amazing I was blown away at how fast it worked and as I progressively took it day after day that feeling it completely went away I'm not even kidding within two weeks I have not experienced that feeling again I feel like a totally new person it also corrected my sleeping patterns and I fell asleep super easy and at the perfect time there was none of this tossing and turning staying up all night like when I lay down and I'm ready to sleep I'm out and when I wake up in the morning I feel great I do not feel that foggy headedness at all fully I was blown away at that that was probably the thing that was really getting me down was feeling foggy headed every day feeling like there was nothing I could do to get it to stop or prevent it so that changed my life and rocked my little world right there not only that when I'm feeling any sort of anxiety building up inside of me I take my CBD oil and within 15 minutes the anxiety is completely gone I feel peaceful I feel relaxed I feel clear-headed I feel incredible like zero anxiety and for those of you who have anxiety you know it's also not a good time you just feel it inside of you and it just makes you anxious about everything and that feeling of impending doom or something Bad's gonna happen that's totally gone CBD oil is also incredible for depression if you suffer from depression since it does create that homeostasis feeling in your body it will zap that feeling of depression you will feel more balanced and you will feel more general joy and happiness and your being with the pain in my ankle between this and another joint supplement that I've been taking I have zero pain in my ankle I can be on an all day no problems at the end of the day of being on my foot all day prior to this I was limping I could barely walk it was really also unpleasant yet that is completely gone now I can be on my foot for 12 hours no problem and it is all thanks to the CBD oil and obviously the joint supplement yet CBD oil reduces inflammation in your body dramatically and inflammation can cause so many health problems it's insane by combating the inflammation you are increasing the healing abilities and capabilities of your body there's been so many studies that I've read how if anyone suffers from seizures CBD wale will stop people seizures helps prevent cancer it is truly one of the most incredible products I've ever used in my life CBD well you do have to find your perfect amount take about 0.75 milliliters twice a day under my tongue I hold it there for a few minutes I take it in the morning and in the afternoon and that's used to be perfect for my body if you take too much for your body you'll know you'll maybe will feel bit irritable and a little jittery your body will tell you it will not do anything damaging to you it wouldn't be fatal if you take too much CBD oil yet your body will let you know and for people who have a lot more health problems and you know we need a lot more healing well your dosage would be much higher and that is just something you play with and you find for yourself you'll feel the effects of it like I said you hold on your tongue within 15 minutes I already feel that calming peaceful effect come over me I pretty sure this is like an addition to my life that I will not live without I'm excited to see what happens after my second bottle of CBD oil which I'm underway right now the benefits of it so far have been incredible and one of the great things about CBD oil is that as there is no THC knows kelex and it is totally legal so there is no problem getting CBD oil would highly recommend it for anyone it definitely promotes that homeostasis and that level feeling within your body so your body can do more of what it's meant to do which is heal itself and regenerate itself and just be an awesome body CBD oil for the win dramatically improved my health well-being and my general feeling of Awesomeness I am NOT a doctor I am NOT giving medical advice whatsoever this is simply what I've experienced from implementing CBD oil into my life into my diet into my body all do have that endocannabinoid system within our bodies so you're simply just feeding that and giving it a little more of what it loves have the opportunity or if you've been thinking about it for a while give it a go you know and give it a real go at least take a whole bottle and take it consistently as you will never get the benefits of anything truly if you just take it here and there or once in a while if you really want to experience the benefits of anything you're adding into your body or health regime do it consistently I say do it consistently for three months and then you really get a general feeling of how that's affecting your life if you give it a good 90 day go it's so good thanks for watching and if you enjoyed my video please give it a thumbs up and if you enjoyed your time

full spectrum cbd oil and as with any product that i review here on the channel i ask you guys to consult your medical professional and of course these are not fda approved so i am not endorsing or suggesting that any of these products are used to treat a disease or known illness here we are on the plant therapy website a very nice page very easy to navigate as you go across the option screens up here we'll go to shop and we'll go over to full spectrum from here then we'll go over to our organic kemp extract full spectrum unflavored cbd oil now as you can see here we have the 500 milligram as well as the 1500 milligram and just as important as many people will like to know what's in their product they do give us a nice listing for description test reports ingredients and disclaimers we go over here to the test report the reason this is important is you're going to want to know what exactly is in your batch what's exactly in your bottle and what the components are and as you can see here delta nine t h c 2.7 percent so if you are a competitive athlete or your place of work does testing you'll need to be aware that um there is thc in the actual product as you can see here here's our delta eight thc and many of these tests are typically set up to detect thc so just be cognizant of that you may want to contact plant therapy to see how long it would take for your body to uh process it and then the thc kind of you know just is eliminated from the body and i'm not an expert in this field so you're obviously going to want to consult plant therapy to determine that to see how long this would be within the body but it is nice that you do get these kind of reports that kind of let you know what is actually in the product so in part one of our review of cbd full spectrum oil we go over some of the distinctions for you guys for example most people are familiar with cannabis or delta 9 thc and then we have hemp which is where the cbd oils are extracted from now you have to think of them as two different breeds within the same species but if you guys want to learn more about thc or cbd i have additional information below this video as well as part one and all of the particular compounds how cannabinoids and cannabidiol tetrahydrocannabinol and all of these particular compounds work within the body cb1 and cb2 receptors from individuals who are a little bit more knowledgeable about these particular compounds and how cannabis and hemp work within the body and how the two are distinctive and some of the exciting things that we can expect to come out from hemp like delta eight which is something we're going to review in a future video we'll be starting it off with the 500 milligram full spectrum cbd oil from plant therapy now i'll be mentioning that they do have certain similarities to the 1500 in particular the flavor which really kind of to me tastes very much like an extra virgin olive oil so there isn't anything in particular really mentioned too much about the actual flavor some cbd's have a very earthy kind of a dirt smell type flavor to them but with the plant therapy it was a very smooth very comfortable experience within the mouth there wasn't anything that kind of stood out about the flavor so i would anticipate if you're taking it for the first time to just kind of expect it to have kind of a extra virgin olive oil flavor to it now what i did like about the 500 is now we're starting to talk about pain relief but very mild type pain relief those little aches pains and tweaks that you may experience early in the morning once you get out of bed i noticed that it really helped very effectively with that now for those who may have more chronic pain or more severe pain 500 milligrams may not be where you want to start for those individuals who may be experiencing anxiety depression ptsd and as i mentioned chronic pain this could be maybe your first introduction to see if the cbd oil is going to be something that will work for you now the way the cbd oil works after a few days as i noticed is it does provide a nice calming effect also provides a nice focus now the focus may be coming from the fact that it does provide a nice calming effect so the 500 is a nice introduction it has a little bit more potency than the 300 that we went over in the in part one so the 500 also provides nice sleep now it isn't the cbd oil in and of itself that provides the sleep aid but how it works within the body so what i got from the 500 that i think is worth noting is that a nice calm experience a sense of focus when you wake up in the morning you might be a little bit groggy but as you go about the day you do get a sense of clarity a sense of calm i was able to do a lot of my voice over work and a lot of my general work with a little bit more calm less anxiousness less stressful experience trying to do my work and i thought the 500 is a really good introductory level for that experience for all of you guys so if you want to kind of start things off address some body aches address some of the calming effects from cbd oil i think 500 would be a really good start for many of you so let's take a look at the 1500 full spectrum cbd oil from plant therapy so i think this particular 1500 milligram full spectrum offering from plant therapy is going to be where many of you who suffer from those little tweaks discomforts soreness and maybe even slight levels of chronic pain because what i found with the 1500 is a nice relief from many of the little discomforts the little tweaks a little soreness that you may experience either say those early mornings where you might get the most of those little kind of stiffness and just kind of soreness as well as post workout very good for post workout as i started hitting the treadmill and i found it really became a nice sense of relief particularly the following day i didn't feel nearly as sore or have the levels of discomfort that i normally have so the 1500 is definitely one that i can say is a good introduction to pain relief and even addressing maybe some slight headaches that you may experience i notice for example when i get some of those sinus headaches now because we are coming into the spring and i get a lot of allergies and sometimes i get sinus headaches and i found that the 1500 really addressed that very well also i noticed that i got some incredibly good sleep with the cbd oil now keep in mind here it isn't the cbd oil in and of itself but how it works within the body so i got some incredibly good sleep great soreness tweaks and pain relief also the flavor of course is exactly the same as the 500 so no particular difference there but the 1500 may be a great introduction for those with particular soreness pains and discomfort now as far as anxiety depression uh post-traumatic stress or ptsd for example i'm not exactly sure um if what manner of level of calming that it gave me with the 1500 than from the 500 i think the two kind of felt about the same i didn't feel any particular elevated sense of or or being more calm or more relaxed but mostly more in the pain relief area than in that but i can say with a level of confidence that you will get that sense of calm about it now since i don't suffer from anxiety or depression or ptsd well that's not to suggest that i don't have days or bad days where i may be anxious or uh just kind of down for a few days but i felt that it did provide a nice sense of calming a nice sense of focus so 1500 may be a good place for you guys but i've got some exciting news because as i mentioned earlier in the video we're starting to hear some exciting news about delta 8 which is an extraction from the hemp plant delta 8 thc very similar to delta 9. and i'll go more into that in a different video my overall experience with plant therapy full spectrum cbd oil was an excellent one i think the 500 and the 1500 met my expectations quite nicely for those of you who are looking for mild pain relief those little tweaks soreness and discomfort in the morning or post workout i think the 500 but more specifically the 1500 might be a great starting point for you guys for those suffering from stress uh and just maybe some levels of low anxiety maybe those with ptsd and levels of chronic pain may find some good relief with the 500 and or the 1500 as your starting point of course the potencies and the milligrams do go up in level so this is kind of maybe a starting point for you guys for those of you who are looking for a good night's sleep some good rest to feel refreshed in the morning i think the 500 and the 1500 will certainly meet that expectation but again i emphasize that you do take it according to the directions and don't exceed that because you may experience some of the side effects but my overall experience with plant therapy was an excellent one it was top tier and i'm very much looking forward to some of the additional products that plant therapy will have particularly when it comes to delta 8 which we will cover in a different video i want to thank all of you guys for your continued support here on the channel be sure to leave a

have been probably hearing a lot about and that is CBD oil now big disclaimer right up front I'm in no way shape or form at all recommending that you take CBD oil this is something that you've got to do your own research you've got to decide whether or not it's right for you alright today I just want to share with you my experience and what I have found as a result of using CBD oil every day for the past seven months these are my bottles of CBD oil a few months ago back in April I did a video talking about my nighttime routine in that I sort of told you that I was starting to experiment with CBD oil and I was liking the results but I wasn't ready to share my thoughts I did that last video back in April about trying CBD I got tons of companies reaching out saying hey do you want to try my CBD do you want to try our CBD do you want to try our CBD the issue with CBD in this industry something that you're going to find out if you start exploring and experimenting is that anybody and their mother can create a private-label CBD company there are a lot of companies out there that manufacture hemp or that grow hemp that are like oh let's get in on the CBD market and their private labeling the stuff and so there are so many tons of different brands out there now the big issue is that you have no idea what you're taking you have no idea of the potency the strength and with CBD it is my personal opinion that you got to know what the hell you are actually taking a lot of these I would say the majority of these CBD companies out there you really have no idea and the only way you're going to be able to figure out dosage and if something's working and what you can change is if you have a super pure form of CBD oil and you actually are buying it from a company that is like in the business of standardizing things testing things and making sure that the product that they're giving you is pure and plant therapy is a company that's been around for years I have known about the because they specialize in essential oils and oil therapies and that is why the company plant therapy is my choice and my partner for this video I've been using plant therapies CBD oil for the past four months they're in the business of oils and extracts and making sure that the quality is there the transparency is their plan therapy is the best in the business in my opinion I have tried a lot of other CBD brands and I noticed the biggest difference when I was actually able to know what specific dosage I was taking and then monitor it and adjust it from there the plan therapy extracts are pure they do the research they cite all of their research guys they have done an amazing job cutting out all the [ __ ] and making sure that they are providing you incredible information something that I asked them to do for you because there are so much information out there when it comes to CBD oil on our landing page down below they have three sections that I encourage you to go and check out if you're thinking about experimenting or trying CBD oil number one is the frequently asked question you've got a question about CBD oil chances are somebody else has had that question it's going to be listed there along with the answer there's also going to be a section about the proposed benefits of CBD oil and then there's also and this is something that's incredibly important the serving chart so that you know sort of what you're taking how to sort of structure a plan that's going to be right for you and if after and only after you do all of your research you decide that you want to try CBD oil guys you will not go wrong buying from plant therapy we have a discount code there are also three different strengths there they have three different flavors you've got natural you are like unflavored you've got cinnamon and you've got pina colada I am a fan of the sentiment and the natural just doesn't really taste like anything that's it now let's talk about my experience with CBD alright so about seven months ago I decided it was finally time for me to try CBD oil I had been suffering with a little bit of anxiety I've also been suffering from some injuries from working out I've always slept like really good but three benefits primary benefits that you hear people reporting from trying CBD oil is sleep anxiety and sort of like inflammation now the reason why those three things are so like reported when it comes to CBD oil is what CBD oil is now I'm not going to attempt to try and explain what a cannabinoid is and how you've got different receptors like in your brain and in your body that's part of like the endocrine system I'm not going to go into the whole independent how cannabinoids work but if you are interested in learning why CBD oil is actually effective for treating certain things guys hit our link and go read sort of the FAQ s and more about CBD oil and how it really works but at the end of the day about seven months ago I decided I was going to give it a try for one is anxiety I have been a little bit stressed lately and not like feeling like myself and so I was you know like hey if this can help a little bit with anxiety and kind of just like take the edge off I'm good um the other thing is sleep now I typically sleep very well but I was like hey if it can improve my sleep I know that sleep is like one of the most important things that you're going to do during the day or during the night that's going to help you with so many other things and the other thing is inflammation I have been suffering because I exercise like all the time and I use my body hard I am always dealing with like some type of injury and I had something called plantar fasciitis for a few months and probably started about I don't know probably nine months ago and it just wasn't getting any better and it was a bit debilitating and so I'm like alright I got to try something because what I'm trying is not working and I did not want to go to like a position and just get like shot with like a cortisone shot or something like that I am a firm believer that nature can heal us but I'm not like some like crazy over-the-top like weirdo like never use like antibiotics and definitely get your vaccines but I am a believer in in nutrition I'm believer in supplements and taking multivitamins and vitamin b-complex and C and d3 like I believe in all that stuff I grew up on it I was in the nutrition industry for a long time and it's just something that I personally believe in for me and so I decided to give CBD oil a try I went to one of my buddies who was sort of in the business I'm like yo can you hook me up he's like yeah and so he sent me this I'm like all right I had no idea what I was doing but I was like all right I'm gonna try this at night now something else you need to understand they're really two types of different CBD oil there is full spectrum and there is broad spectrum CBD full spectrum means that it also has THC THC is the stuff in weed that gets you high now in CBD oil that is full-spectrum it is a very low dose like I think legally it has to be like under like 0.3% and and I could be wrong about that in order for it to be sold legally but I didn't want to take anything with THC I don't smoke weed personally not that I have anything against it I know a lot of people some of my best friends some of my loved ones absolutely do smoke weed it's just not something that I like I don't like the way that it makes me feel and so I decided to go with a broad spectrum full spectrum CBD has everything including a little bit of THC I didn't want that and so I went broad-spectrum and so I got my bottle I was like all right he's like yo use one dropper I'm like all right I had no idea what milligram I didn't know anything about that but at night before I went to bed like after I brushed my teeth and did all that I took a dropper under my tongue held it there under my tongue for about a minute swallowed it and that first night I slept like a frickin rock was it the CBD I had no idea all I knew is that I slept like a rock I'm like damn I slept like super sound I didn't sleep longer but when I woke up I felt just like invigorated I felt like I got more sleep than I actually did and so I'm like yo that was pretty awesome and so next night guess what I did boom exactly again and guess what I slept like a rock so month number one through three I took it one time a day at night before I went to bed and my sleep was good my anxiety I didn't really notice anything my plantar fasciitis in my body it's still eight and so I really didn't notice anything there and then once I started doing more research I realized that a lot of people are saying that you need to take CBD oil actually twice a day and so when I started with actually I started with this one therapy I started with the lowest dosage 16 milligrams or 16 milligram milliliters 500 milligram bottle like I said guys if you have no idea about dosage that link down below there's a chart that actually will talk you through sort of how to start using this and trying it and all that's good stuff anyway took it at night but then what I started doing in the afternoon at around 11 o'clock after I got done exercising I started taking it again and almost immediately I felt this like it was weird I felt this just like calmness and I'm like could it be like the CBD oil or is it totally like placebo effect but the next day did it again afternoon along with at night and I was chill I felt better and then I'm like alright I really got to test this out and so then the third day I didn't take it and I I don't know like I said I don't know if it was placebo effect I personally don't believe it is because I was like I was chilled I felt good I wasn't all like stressed out and anxious something else that happened about like two weeks after I started taking it twice a day my foot my leg it started to feel better I wasn't all like sore and getting like muscle cramps and spasms now I'm not saying that everything is linked I'm not saying that CBD oil cured everything but I know that my foot started to feel better and so the next bottle that I got from plant therapy actually upped the dosage to thirty three milligrams with a thousand milligrams bottle and and that's when it kind of like went away completely my pain in my foot twice a day rocking this and honestly I'm on my fourth bottle now of of the plant therapy CBD I feel better than I've felt in a really long time and I was a bit skeptical from from the first time I started hearing about CBD am I you know like I was like okay this is just a fad this really doesn't work and so going into it being a skeptic and really taking my time over the past seven months and sort of analyzing and trying different dosages and and and different amounts like I feel like I have like my formula for me and I'm going to continue to take CVD oil because I truly feel for me it was beneficial and I feel great and so I just wanted to do this video and kind of share my opinion my opinion is for me I feel like it's made a big difference for me I'm gonna keep doing it but I don't know I mean you've got to decide for yourself like I said there's a ton of information out there there also a ton of brands you've just got to be careful you've got to make sure that the brand that you're buying is pure you've got to make sure that you know what you're doing and you don't just like try like one milligram this day and one milligram that day and just like all over the place typically you don't just try something once and feel like amazing for me I don't know if it was placebo effect I don't know if it was the CBD oil but I noticed the difference my anxiety I noticed that immediately my sleep but regardless of if it was possible effect or not I don't care because I feel better I just wanted to do this video I told you that I would back in April when I sort of mentioned that I was starting to use CBD oil and seeing some positive results for me I'm gonna keep doing it for me I love it for me I truly feel like it's been a bit of a game changer in my overall well-being in health I don't know what the long-term effects of CBD oil is I don't know that it's been out long enough there could be adverse effects I have no idea but I know that for right now you know I I dig it and I encourage you that if you're somebody who struggles with something of you know sleep anxiety or maybe you know pain or some issues but but there are other things right because you know this endocrine system it's like a collection of like glands and it regulates hormones and just makes everything in your body work better and so do your research like I said there are other reported benefits but these were the three most reported and the three that I was interested in seeing if it would actually have an effect on me but at the end of the day guys you've got to decide for yourself do not do it because I'm doing it do it because you want to you have to do your research", "tFYJYBTCTmE": "this is Jes CBD specialist with ambery Gardens we're here today talking about our full spectrum daily 500 now this is one of the middle concentrations in our full spectrum a daily line of internally taken oil products and it's going to dispense you 17 milligrams of CBD per dose if

tincture our tincture comes in two different strengths a normal strength and an extra strength normal strength comes in a 15 milliliter and 30 milliliters serving size extra strength comes in a 30 milliliter and 60-million or serving size our THC free hump oil contains the full spectrum whole plant profiles including terpenes omegas flavonoids and other trace vital cannabinoids it's infused

down our tincture works best when taken consistently we recommend taking one to two servings daily and the time depends on your name", "jfYaSky511Q": "what's up CBD lovers welcome to I love CBD so first of all I want to apologize for being away for so long but life life has been catching up to me and I haven't had any chance to review any CBD products lately so sorry about that but uh I got some new stuff for you guys and I'm gonna start out with this one right here and this is from koi CBD so I was driving around and I saw a big billboard that said koi CBD on it and I was like wow and CBD company bought a whole billboard this is pretty impressive I gotta try this out so I looked him up heard some pretty decent stuff about him so I was like okay let's try it out and give you guys a review and let you know what I think of it so this right here is a tincture bottle it has 250 milligrams and it's peppermint flavor I ordered this off their website keep it quick turned out that they were actually here not that far away from where I lived there in California as well but I think they have other locations this is what the bottom looks like and the liquid inside is pretty clear there's no substance or anything in there see it's almost two hairs water and actually the taste is also very clear tastes like when you taste it all you taste is that peppermint and you know it's almost like you're taking water with peppermint which again you know it's okay I don't mind that the pepper is pretty refreshing I'm usually expect a little bit extra flavor or something in there but this has none the ingredients are COI prism full spectrum cannabidiol blend natural peppermint extract and the oil so pretty simple no fluff no additional stuff that it doesn't really need to be in to your CBD and no weird stuff that I can't pronounce so I like that I like that it's simple and straight to the point however the recommended dosage on this bottle has one full dropper so just wonderful dropper like we just pulled out at the bottle right now I tried this three days before I made this review because the first day I took the recommended dosage was just one full dropper and I didn't really feel much the second day I was like okay let's double up the dose and take two full droppers and I actually felt more effects at that point and you know if felt more relaxed and little loosened up some tension and you know muscle soreness also eased up a little bit I wasn't sleepy but I got good sleep when I went to bed it's pretty deep sleep as well so pretty decent so yeah on the effects part it's you know it's not bad so it's okay it does what it's supposed to do flavor-wise the peppermint is good I didn't mind it and price wise it was 39.99 off the website you can definitely find some coupons online if you search up going CBD coupons you'll find it on some website and you can probably at least get like $10 off or 10% off I'm sorry I could get 10% off your order sometimes you know special occasions or whatever they might have a higher coupon get more of a discount but you can almost always find that 10% off so yeah for this I would give it 4 out of 5 stars I'm not disappointed I'm not overly impressed either it's okay it's fine I think for somebody like me I'll probably go to higher dosage if I do get it next time not sure if I will or not but you know I have nothing against getting it again and that's it for coy CVD tinctures and yeah I also got some gummies which I'm pretty excited about because I haven't tried CBD gummies yeah before so that's gonna be coming up on next review and I'm excited about that I hope I'm not disappointed and I look forward to putting up a review on that one all right I hope you guys find this video useful if you liked it and you found it useful give me a like if you have anything to share about koi cvd drop us a comment let us know what you think and if you like CBD like we do subscribe and you'll get all my reviews and happy CBD I will see you guys in the next review goodbye", "-790Tzzh794": "hi everyone welcome back to my channel today's video is going to be something i think pretty timely i know a lot of people are feeling stressed and anxious right now i wanted to do a video ranking all of the cbd oils i've tried over the last few years i'm gonna go through all four ranking them and leaving the very best for last so make sure you stay tuned to the end when i first tried it i was a little bit skeptical but over the years i've really found stuff that works for me and really helps manage my stress levels and also help me manage my tmj pain i suffer from jaw clenching and teeth grinding in my sleep my tmj pain is often triggered by stress and i need a little help in the stress management department i will also be doing a video all about cbd beauty so make sure you subscribe so you don't miss that i have a lot of skincare and body care products to share in that video all the cbd oils in this video are hemp derived so you can buy them online number four on the list is the first cbd oil i really tried on a consistent basis this is by the brand rosebud very cool female founded brand this is their old packaging so since they've launched a couple years back the packaging has been updated the logo has changed a little bit this is their 350 milligram bottle i found that in the beginning i would just add a couple drops to my coffee and gradually work my way up to half a dropper it was a great introductory cbd obviously a female founded brand which i love supporting so while i have the 350 here they do offer higher doses on their website so check them out that is rosebud next up we have reed's remedy calm and this is a really unique one because it's a spray and the nice thing about a spray is that the dose is consistent and this is the calm blend so this is a distilled hemp oil with terpenes infused this bottle contains 500 milligrams of cbd the spray design is genius because it's a controlled dose every single time unlike a dropper where you really have to look closely to make sure you have an accurate dosing especially if you're starting out and you're very sensitive for a one spray serving size you get 75 servings in one bottle really nice format and it has a little bit of a grassy flavor so it's very uplifting and awakening huge fan of this one i really think the packaging is quite innovative i've never seen another spray cbd oil so definitely want to try more from this brand raking in at number two is bloom farms cbd oil this is their relieve tincture this bottle has 600 milligrams of cbd really nice box really pretty frosted glass bottle just very elegant looks premium so this brand uses 100 organically grown hemp and also 100 usda certified organic mct oil bloom farms also has a really nice one for one initiative for every bottle sold they donate a meal to a family in need so when i was getting used to cbd i was just kind of putting it in my coffee a couple drops and gradually working my way up from there by the time i tested this out i was just using it in tincture form just taking a half dropper or so and putting it under my tongue and letting that kind of absorb in for 30 seconds to a minute so i would use this in the morning kind of to curb the jaw tension and headaches i'd sometimes have in the morning from my tmj and then i'd also take it after lunch and in the evening time to kind of just keep me leveled off and i feel like cbd truly has a compounding effect if you take it once you're not really going to notice a whole lot but if you take it daily i feel like it has a true compounding effect and it helps kind of curb those anxiety and stress levels at least that's been the experience for me so really enjoyed this one from bloom farms love that it's out of oakland love that it uses organic ingredients and had a pretty good taste but number one definitely wins for taste and coming in at number one the best cbd oil that i wanted to recommend is by pachamama and this is the natural a 750 milligram cbd it was founded by two brothers and they have a really inspiring story about overcoming addiction and i encourage you to go check out their website or their instagram to kind of get a feel for the brand the only thing they could really improve on this would be the packaging sometimes i had a hard time opening this so this has been my favorite cbd oil to date i love the story of the brand i love the taste it has a very unique taste that's different to the other cbd oils that i've mentioned in this video it has more of like a smoky rich taste to it versus like a hempy grassy taste to it i can't quite explain it this brand also has topicals and i've been trying their athletic rub it's a very very rich kind of body butter sal that you can put on sore muscles achy joints and stuff like that and it smells like girl scout thin mint cookies it smells incredible but anyways that's the other product i've been trying from pachamama that i love but in terms of their cbd oil it tastes the best and i really like the story behind the brand if you're curious my affiliate link will be down below i super appreciate your support if not just go check them out i think that they're doing really cool things all right friends those are all of the cbd oils for stress that i can recommend you now know my absolute favorite if you have a favorite cbd oil definitely leave it in a comment down below so we can all check it out so thank you again for watching i will see you very soon in the next one [Music] you", "Hr22KInfWJg": "before buying CBD oil you need to know your choices and full spectrum CBD oil is one of them cannabis and it's byproducts are gaining popularity in many of the places both in the United States and around the world that have loosened their laws surrounding this plant the majority of the united states now have at least medical marijuana laws in place with 11 states legalizing the plant and its byproducts for recreational use CBD oil has staked its claim as one of the most beneficial and popular cannabis products being used to treat everything from back pain to seizures as you probably guessed not all CBD oil is created equally and there are actually four different types and you should know about one of which being full-spectrum so give me your attention for the next few minutes and we'll address what full spectrum CBD oil is and how it varies from the other varieties first type we'll talk about is marihuana derived CBD oil many of the early studies regarding CBD oil point to a very synergistic effect between the compounds of THC and CBD thus people who have a medical card or do not mind the high that comes with taking CBD THC might want to seriously consider this oil onto CBD isolated CBD isolate is the purest form of CBD you can possibly take it is normal for manufacturers to distill the CBD as many as four times to get the purest product possible scientists think that this may not be the best way to take CBD though since you are losing out on many of the other cannabinoids and minerals in the refinement process but if you are in a situation where you need to closely monitor what goes into your body then this is your product finally full-spectrum CBD even here we find two different variations of full-spectrum CBD oil the first type is zero percent THC full-spectrum much of the oil currently produced comes from the head plant which normally has a small percentage of THC in it in most cases this is not enough to produce the high feeling but still will leave a small percentage of THC in your bloodstream so there are a lot of situations when a consumer may want to avoid THC completely if that's your situation then this is the type of full-spectrum we recommend last but not least is full-spectrum CBD with THC full-spectrum CBD is also commonly referred to as whole plant CBD because it is derived from the entire front plate there are a lot of benefits to consuming some face CBD in the full spectrum variety since you were able to get all of the cannabinoids flavonoids and Terrapins first present in the template now we realize that this is just one of many questions that are common for new users of CBD oil with that in mind we've created a free ebook detailing everything you need to know about this powerful product the arrow is pointing to the link where you can download this ebook or you can find the link in the description below thank you for watching our video and we would love for you to comment and

extraction method that produces a clean product that's free of solvents and rich and natural synergistic compounds this means our whole plant CBD products contain not only CBD but secondary

"s4LCzj5l69M": "[Music] have you ever wondered what exactly is meant by the phrase full spectrum cbd oil is there really any difference between a full spectrum product and say another type of cbd product let's take a look let me go ahead and remind new viewers to subscribe to the way of leaf youtube channel we deliver the industry's most accurate and up-to-date information on all things cannabis and cbd anyway back to the topic of what actually full spectrum cbd oil is it's really pretty simple cbd is just one of more than a hundred different compounds naturally found in the cannabis sativa plant a full spectrum cbd oil well contains pretty much all of these compounds a product like cbd isolate oil on the other hand contains just the cbd compound by itself after it's been filtered and fractionated off during the manufacturing process depending on what exactly you're trying to achieve full spectrum cbd oil can actually work better than a cbd isolate in fact research shows that when cannabinoids work together rather than isolated by themselves they're potentially more effective in terms of a therapeutic benefit this phenomenon is known as the entourage effect but we'll talk more about that later as far as what a full spectrum cbd oil actually contains they can include a variety of natural ingredients found in hemp and other types of cannabis these ingredients include things like phytocannabinoids essential vitamins and minerals beneficial fatty acids like omega-3s and omega-6s plant-based protein and fiber chlorophyll terpenes and flavonoids also it's important to understand that full spectrum cbd oil can come from both hemp and marijuana most of the cbd products you see for sale online and in places like gas stations and grocery stores are made from hemp that contains 0.3 thc or less full spectrum cbd oils can also be made from marijuana these oils have higher levels of thc but are only available in dispensaries in states that offer legal medical or recreational cannabis one of the most important studies relating to full spectrum cbd oil took place at the hebrew university of jerusalem in 2015. the study compared the performance of a full spectrum cannabis extract with one that contained cbd only and concluded that at least in mice the full spectrum oil was more effective for pain and inflammation in fact authors of the study claimed the whole plant cannabis extract was ideal for clinical use as compared to isolated cbd another great quote we like to use in order to describe the effectiveness of full spectrum cbd oil comes from dr ethan russo in a 2019 publication in frontiers in plant science dr russo's paper claimed that one molecule i.e cbd is unlikely to match the therapeutic potential of cannabis itself as a phytochemical factory in other words while pure cbd can be effective it appears that full spectrum cbd oil is the better option for therapeutic purposes do you have any more questions about what full spectrum cbd oil is is there anything that we left out feel free to join in the conversation by leaving a comment below also if you enjoyed this content and found it helpful don't forget to hit the like button and

this is your first hour episode with us welcome today I will be reviewing the entire line of the Pachamama full spectrum CBD tinctures there's six options so there's five flavors and then there's one all-natural flavor all of them full spectrum tinctures I want to point that out so there are the trace amounts of 0.3% of THC nothing higher but those will not induce the intoxicating effects that you get if you smoke you know cannabis you won't get stoned so you don't have to worry about that but I'm very excited to review these Pachamama line of CBD teachers just because of the uniqueness of them there is many many ingredients such as you know goji and cacao kava kava and valerian agencia and green tea you know many of these ingredients have been leveraged for thousands of years in ancient medications so I am excited to review these because I think they will be a perfect pair with a full spectrum hemp extract and really kind of elevate the potential effects because many of these ingredients have really been studied so there's known benefits about these known health benefits associated with it that many of which pair perfectly with the potential benefits of cannabinoids you know such as CBD the trace amounts of THC and many of those minor cannabinoids you know CB and CBD so on and so forth that's present in a full spectrum tincture so let me go ahead and actually walk you guys through the six options of the Pachamama CBD tinctures before actually jumping in and reviewing them oh I do want to point out the Pachamama CBD teachers they're available in 750 milligrams and seventeen hundred and fifty milligrams so one thousand seven hundred fifty milligrams per there milk bottles so very very awesome stick around until the end where I will have I will let you know of an exclusive discount code that you can use on your first purchase of the Pachamama tinctures from wallace e-comm and you know what I'll give you a little hint if you check the description below you can access this exclusive 15% off discount code that you can use at well as c-calm starting right now so let's jump right into the appacha mama line alright so first up we got the goji and cacao mmm alright that's unique some goji berries with cacao so I'm expecting you know a little maybe a notch goji berries with I guess a little bit of a chocolate taste so I mean hey I'm excited about that then next up we got the green tea and agencia okay let's get that party started I mean who doesn't like some green tea at Trent see I'm not really sure how that's gonna taste but hey piqued my interest for sure then next up we got the kava kava and the valerian CBD teacher from Pachamama okay alright and then we got this is a very unique one I mean it makes sense but I mean some of you may be like oh that's interesting is the we got the black pepper and the tumeric tincture from Pachamama okay I'm excited about that see I see I hope you're starting to realize how unique these flavor profiles are these aren't you know for if your user restricting by a product off flavor which I never recommend you should buy it for the effects this maybe not be the line for you because this is for this line is really designed for the all natural health and wellness consumer that doesn't really mind an all-natural taste of many of these ingredients and yeah I think these ingredients are gonna be great tasting they're very unique it's not gonna be like a blueberry or a strawberry or like a fruity cereal that you see you know there's a lot of flavor teachers and even vape juices out there so I want to point that out guys these are very all-natural tasting teachers and you know you should at the end of the day when you're buying a hemp products you should be buying it for the potential effects that you're experiencing not strictly based off the flavor next up number five for Pachamama is the holy basil and yelling laying teacher okay baby here we go and then of course last but not least is the the all-natural patre mama DVD teacher which is just full spectrum hemp extract and MCT oil that's what Pachamama leverages as they're carrying agent in all of their teachers is MCT oil so you know there's only the base ingredients only what's required is what's in there it's all natural ingredients from you guessing mother earth you know Pachamama literally means mother earth so you know like the goji and cacao there's goji berry extract cacao and then there's MCT oil and then full spectrum of extract that's it guys and what's awesome all the ingredients are right on the box and it'll even say i'll walk this through once i get into each product but it even has some potential the effects right on the side of the bottle based off of the ingredients you know because you can't make any health claims around CBD or full spectrum hemp extract at all that is against the law but many of these ingredients have been studied many many times and for years upon years and they have been proven to have these effects so let's go ahead and try our first tincture and all of the teachers i'll be reviewing for Pachamama today will be the 750 milligram version so very excited i mean a very very potent option you know so basically how you figure out how much dope how much CBD you're getting per dropper full is you just do 750 milligrams or the size of the bottle 750 or if you have the 750 milligram bottle then you would just do 750 divided by the size of the bottle and that's how much you get your serving per milliliter and guess what guys that comes to 25 milligrams of CBD per milliliter which is um you know these dropper foals it's a full milliliter so let's go ahead and do the goji and cacao from Pachamama looks really good beautiful packaging very very solid you know it even has right on the side of the on all of the boxes it has a little explanation of the Pachamama hemp like where they source it from what's really awesome is that this that they say you know it's a single origin sourcing it's from it's made with less than 0.3 percent THC which is great It's Made in a cGMP compliant lab non-gmo Fairtrade triple lab tested very key all naturally sourced ingredients and it's all made in the USA with ingredients sourced from around the world you know goji berry extract cacao and then right on the side of the cacao box it says it's got focus because let me actually walk you through before I actually get into actually tasting the goji in cacao you know so what are some of the potential benefits of you know goji cacao you know goji has really high nutritional value it's an excellent source of vitamins it's high in antioxidants very very key provides immune system report of support you know if you're feeling sick this should be a great king sure to leverage and it promotes healthy skin you know goji berries contain beta-carotene which is great you know for skin health and last but not least about goji that I really wanted to touch on is it first uses were recorded you know in the year about 250 BC so like I said guys these ingredients have been leveraged for a very very long time and then you know then we got the the cacao cacao I mean you know let's kind of get a give you like the the chocolate chocolatey taste you know this is rich in minerals high in antioxidants 40 times the antioxidants of blueberries we all know how much we've been told by our doctors to eat these blueberries because of their antioxidant benefits and it's a natural mood enhancer and antidepressant very very good seat pairs perfectly with those potential benefits of cannabinoids it supports energy production sparks libido oddly yeah in case you're looking for that and it can also help relieve stress so you know all of those sort of effects and benefits that you're experiencing from the goji in cacao many of those are the potential benefits you experience with CBD and cannabinoids so that's what I'm talking about guys Pancho I really took their teacher line to the next level by pairing these ingredients with these Kanab with a full spectrum HEPA extract which i think is just a brilliant idea so I applaud you guys on that nicely done Pachamama you guys um I mean I just I love your products I love your product lines so let's do it I'm I just want to point this out just like with all my review videos I'm honest I don't get paid by Pachamama at all to do these videos so I just want to point that out again beautiful packaging so shake it up as always boom child-resistant cap and what's awesome look at that that nice golden hemp extract look it beautiful and what's awesome is right on the droppers right on the t-shirts they're actually labeled so there's one male point seven-five half mil and a quarter of a mil so you know precisely how much CBD you're getting every single time you dose yourself out so let's go ahead and there's sublingual delivery do not vape these lift your tongue and drop the oil right under your tongue let sit there for 30 to 60 seconds you know mmm wow that is taste like chocolate mm-hmm ooh all-natural taste you know I do get right when I drop that teacher the God you can accounting sure right into my mouth I do immediately start getting a I start tasting that cacao you know the chocolate the all natural source of chocolate you guys guessed it I like that and then as I swallow it I do get like the aftertaste is obviously chocolatey but I am really getting sort of a faint kind of caged I believe what would be the goji berries I mean I've never actually personally eaten goji berries so I'm not sure what they exactly taste like but I feel like I am getting a residual sort of berry taste out of the goji and cacao um so you know it's I like that I like that sort of chocolatey taste that is along with it and then the sort of berry taste kind of rounds out the flavor um you know as I always like to give flavor rating just so you guys know but at the end of day should not be buying a product strictly off of flavor and plus guys flavor is very very subjective so if I had to rate the goji and cacao on a scale of one to ten hmm that chocolates still linger in my mouth I do like that a lot I would have to give that a seven point five out of ten so actually a very solid score I'm impressed by that then next up in the review today we got the green tea and echinacea full spectrum hemp extract tincture from my good friends over at Pachamama CBD look at this bad boy you know it's just looking at this the branding of this you know it just feels like I'm about to you know eat like a green or drink a green tea smoothie earth or something you know but before just like with the goji and cacao it will walk you through some of the benefits that you experience with the green tea and echinacea you know for the echinacea for example it's great for reducing inflammation it supports and improves your immune system health which we can all benefit from next up we it can help treat health ailments and illnesses which I mean hey you can't argue with that whoo why wouldn't you want to take something that can potentially help with that and it also helps to aid in healthy cell growth and helps manage anxiety guys helps manage anxiety anxiety it makes sense while the echinacea is inside of this tincture with the full spectrum hemp extract because I mean many many people use full-spectrum hemp backstrap broad-spectrum or CBD in general for its potential anti-anxiety effects you know we live in an anxious world nowadays guys so it's that it makes sense why CBDs one of the largest use cases of cannabinoids is for you know anti-anxiety then for the green tea benefits we counted touch on that I mean I'm sure many of you do know of the green tea benefits could green teas all over the place but some of the best benefits are its anti-aging properties it's rich and anti-aging antioxidants you know that such as the EGCG which is a poly phenyl that actually increases cell turnover to fight those wrinkles guys RIT and it's rich in these polyphenols which are micronutrients that are packed with antioxidants and other many health benefits it provides metabolic support cellular support strong antioxidant properties okay and it can also help to improve brain function so I know I don't I take CDs just for it it's Jenn CBD excuse me general wellness benefits I don't have any diseases they're ailments but one of the largest use cases for me is my focus and concentration that's what I've noticed that really really helps me so the fact that having this green tea teacher from Pachamama and knowing that the green tea can help to improve brain brain function I it's just a match made in heaven in my honest opinion so let's try the green tea and echinacea full spectrum teen chef from Pachamama again beautiful packaging right on it let me take a look at this real quick Oh yep perfect they got the QR code right on the label so you can scan it for the third-party test results then they even make it super easy and let you know how much of like the green tea and echinacea and plus the hemp extract how much you are getting per dose which is very very crucial guys there's a lot of companies other than that that really make dosing very confusing for you guys as the end consumer and what's really awesome right at the bottom there's a sticker if you guys can see this but it's batch tested which is a win in my book you know there's no there's no regulations in the the hemp space yet so I just like here at Wallace II we regulate ourselves in an unregulated industry and Pachamama is following suit as well so I do applaud you guys on that there's just simply not enough companies that are regulating themselves you know and just trying to hide things from the in consumer which is not OK in my honest opinion so green tea and echinacea tincture for Pachamama boom look at that okay ooh I mean honestly like it just smells like a natural full spectrum had that extract like that's what it smells like so all right let's go hmm okay now I wonder a little different I do it does kind of feel like I have like green tea leaves kind of in my mouth but I mean that's kind of what to be expected it's natural so it honestly just tastes like for me it's like it's not very overpowering but it's very I taste the natural hemp extract you know but I just feel like I kind of just have sort of some like green tea leaves like I was kind of just like it's almost like I was sucking on like a really small small bag of like green tea leaves you know like kind of like a snus pouch you know for like true like if I had like a snooze pouch of like green tea leaves in there and I just like had it in my lip like it's very faint like it it honestly isn't a like it just more than anything it does kind of just remind me of like having faint a green tea taste in it with um you know the full spectrum hemp extract so I am a fan of it it's very very faint it's not like you don't put in your mouth at you're not like uh it's a great solid flavor all around I mean it's not like flavorful to the max but the great Teaneck Anisha teacher I mean it really doesn't taste like much I mean I taste the green tea though faintly but I mean like echinacea it's you know it's sort of like a flower and so it's not I was expecting maybe a little more floral taste which I mean I guess maybe that's a good thing they kind of muted it a little bit but I understand just take the taste the all-natural full spectrum hemp extract with the faint sort of green tea leaves that I that I was describing uh a few minutes ago but I I like it I mean the goat cheese cacao I feel like I like to go Jade cacao a little bit more just because I did like that cacao and that sort of chocolatey berry taste and I rated the goji cow seven point five out of ten on the flavor scale the green tea and echinacea I got it just because it was kind of lacking in flavor for me if I had to just strictly base it off flavor and I'll touch on the effects on everything later on in the review video towards the end but I mean I'm gonna give that a six point five out of ten on the flavor rating so it's not horrible but I mean like like I enjoyed it like I'm just basing it strictly off of flavor but I liked using it it was it just tasted like an actual full spectrum hemp extract and I like natural flavors so you may or may not so just keep that in mind next up we the kava kava and valerian root full-spectrum extract t-shirt from Pachamama so kava kava and valerian here's the cute little box I you know let's just call it cute just has got that nice little pink you know it's got some of the the benefits for the kava kava just read on the box and valerian is for relaxation so you know if you're looking to relax you know reach for this kava kava and the the valerian you know whereas the goji like the goji in cacao you know that was for focus and then the green tea and echinacea that was for recovery so now if you're looking to relax and chill after a long day you know who doesn't like to do that reach for this kava kava valerian so what are some of the potential or the benefits that have been associated with let's say kava kava you know it promotes tranquility it promotes muscle relaxation aids and feelings of anxiety so combat some of those things those anxious feelings that we're always talking about and aids and feelings of restlessness so the relaxation benefits can really help you know so you're not having that anxiety when you're laying in bed and then you could really reduce that restlessness so then you can actually go to sleep at night because guess what guys sleep is very very important if you don't sleep and your whole entire life begins to just go downhill next up we got the valerian root so what are some of those benefits associated with well valerian you know it promotes relaxation has calming benefits anti stress benefits aids and feelings of sleepiness and promotes hi-hi promotes a better quality sleep so as you can see guys up makes sense why Pachamama paired the kava kava valerian root with a full spectrum hemp extract could provide those relaxation benefits alright let's go ahead and now taste the kava kava and valerian again beautiful packaging 750 milligrams pop this box open here we go and guys every time you go to use as teacher or even an oil anytime you a full spectrum HEPA extract oil or a CBD ISIL oil broad spectrum oil you should always before you use it just just to do it just shake it up you know mix up all the ingredients and everything so there's no separation or anything so I always just sit here and kind of shake it kind of quickly you know just and then you're good to go all right beautiful beautiful bottle as always and then so and now it's also got the batch testing so sorry guys I'm kind of just looking at the label the levels really beautiful all the information you really need from this product is read on the label so if I rating the Pachamama tincture labels 1 to 10 I give them a 10 at a 10 it's very very solid everything you need is right on it they're not hiding anything from you so I applaud you on that Pachamama alright kava-kava valerian look at this oops alright so there's a full mill let me make sure you get a full mill in there oh look at that golden goodness that's how you want your full spectrum extract you know a little maybe a little bit darker maybe a little sort of a brown gold or a gold like this that's what you want that's how you know it's a high quality full spectrum hemp extract all right now look John mm-hmm okay I mean many of you guys have maybe leave a comment if you take cava cava or valerian or any of these ingredients kind of on their own on the side let me know what you take it for and some of the benefits you've experienced so I'm talking my mouth full but huh that one was very very like a natural taste with it you know the kava kava and the valerian valerian root I mean I've actually tried kava kava before and that's definitely what I taste out of it I mean like kava kava taste very very natural and earthy I don't know if any of you ever had like a kava kava tea but that it just it tastes just like kava kava in my opinion it's just a it's just a natural earthy sort of tasting a sort of an ingredient that goes in there but it's not I mean I like the kava kava valerian Pachamama teacher better than just drinking kava kava tea that I can't do that I was like but it was too much for me but I feel like it's very toned down and it's a nice mixture and I think just having like those terpenes of the full spectrum headaches fragmented with the MCT oil and then you know just that terpenes in that hemp and that full spectrum hand back stroke I really think they kind of just blend nicely together and you know at the end of the day Pachamama just their overall formulation of these products is very very solid you know it's not like you know if you eat some like kava kava for example and you were to just like dump it in your mouth they're like drink a tea where you'd be like it they just really I obviously they did a ton of our I need to make sure these formulations were perfect so it doesn't make you gag but at the same time you still know when she dropped in your mouth like okay this is a very natural teacher that I am taking right now and I can definitely taste these ingredients so if I had to you know rate the pot or the kava kava and the valerian tincture on us just based off the flavor you know of effects are most important I got to keep saying that guys I you know I think I do like that one I mean I still got to put that with the green tea and agencia I'm gonna put that at a 6.5 as well you know I mean I'm not you know it's not like I haven't had any of the three teachers I've tried they're not making me gag I'm not like well you know spitting it out I'm able to need you know put in my mouth swallow and as you can see I'm not I'm not even washing it down with water because I just want to show you I mean you could certainly do that if or even coffee you know either ooh that goji and cacao would be really good mixing and coffee side no and you want to point that out but you know just you can always rinse it down with some a liquid or something but I mean at the end of the day in my opinion I don't think the flavors are too you know they're not gag-worthy in my opinion right now number four the fourth teacher from the Pachamama line full spectrum have extra teachers on if reviewing today that I love is going to be the black pepper and the tumeric so here's a quick little look you know it's got the hem and the black pepper and tumeric box right on the side it says this is intended for you know some detox benefits so let's go ahead and discuss some of the potato and tumeric so let's first start out with black pepper you know it's a bio enhancer which you know this means that it increases bioavailability of turmeric anti-inflammatory compounds plus with that black pepper can help to increase you know that bioavailability of the cannabinoids you know the bioavailability that's crucial when you're taking a a hemp extract product as CBD isolate broad-spectrum whatever you're taking bioavailability is key you know it varies from consumption method to consumption method you know whether you're using a teacher edible capsule vape juice they all have very bioavailability so violet bioavailability if you aren't aware is the amount of CBD that is actually delivered into your body you know CBD and other cannabinoids that's actually delivered into your body after going through and being processed their internal bodily rate system so you know after being digested after being processed by you know either you're inside of your body which then delivers it into your bloodstream so bioavailability is key you know typically you know edibles capsules have a lower by a bioavailability and then teachers and vape juice are more higher up on the spectrum so some other benefits of black pepper of course is a it's a CB 2 which is cannabinoid receptor number 2 receptor agonist very very crucial and it contains the first the world's first bio enhancer piperine interesting enough now some of the tumeric benefits is it's rich in poly phenols which we talked about a little earlier which you know these are micronutrients that are packed with antioxidants and many other health benefits and turmeric can help improve digestion it aids an oxidative stress which you know this occurs naturally and plays a role in the overall aging process and this can actually be harmful to your body if you know you have extensive oxidative stress and then also turmeric helps to you know support inflammation just like cannabinoids such as CBD and you know some of the minor cannabinoids very very crucial and it has antimicrobial and anti oxidant properties that improve skin health so guys many of these things have been used you need detox it makes sense you're detoxing your body the oxidative stress you're detoxing all those harmful chemical all those harmful things inside of your body so it makes sense for these black pepper tumeric all right yeah the black pepper and turmeric are paired together with a full spectrum hemp extract who I am starting to feel very very good like I just feel like my overall alertness I just like as I was talking I just say kind of just like all that all hit me by storm at once because I mean I've been doing a milliliter of each of these 750 milligrams teamsters I've been taken I mean 25 milligrams 50s at 75 milligrams of a hemp extract that I've taken you know CBD inside of my body so I am ver my overall alertness verbal fluency focus concentration I feel good right now and just my general wellness I feel very very high the edges I'm very content in life right now so and it just it's easy to feel that way because I mean it when you're taking a high-quality HEPA extract product it of course you're gonna I mean I can't guarantee any effects but when I know the way my I react to taking CBD and I just know that I I can feel it and when I take a high quality product such as for Pachamama I I know I'm in for I know some of the effects that I can begin to expect so now we got let's go ahead and jump right into the black pepper and tumeric here we go guys look at that nice little label I like to show you guys this batch testing right at the bottom and you know they got the CRC caps of child resistant caps and they also come with those little shrink wraps that I kind of just don't really I don't really rip off I can just twist them all off but look golden goodness black pepper tumeric let's see hmm I mean all of them really do do smell like that all natural hemp extract but I mean maybe faint like tumeric or maybe maybe a little bit of tumeric a black pepper but I mean let's see I'm keep I'm interested to see how this tastes here we go whoa definitely contains that black pepper once you initially drop it and I taste the full spectrum hemp ex-truck right and then the black pepper starts to come out and as it sits in there the tumeric starts to come out but it's not like it's not like you were to pour black pepper into your hand and just putting your mouth you know that probably make you cough sneeze and no it doesn't taste like that and then same with tumeric you know it's not overpowering like you were to just eat like a handful of tumeric it's good it's I I'm surprised I thought the black pepper into work might be with the one that was like they threw me off but I like that a lot like it's very subtle though like I could see like you know that black pepper and turmeric if you're making like some spaghetti or something you know like a meal at home you could like mix that in with your food anyway I think it would just like enhance the overall flavors you know if you're cooking with black pepper and turmeric I feel like this black pepper and turmeric teacher would be a phenomenal additive into your food or whatever whatever your main I mean obviously food but I feel like whether you're making like a sort of like a gravy or like a dressing or you know pasta or something that would be a great additive I like that I'm surprised I'm saying this I like the black pepper in Toomer more than the kava-kava and the green tea and at Trent and the green tea I like that one better I mean I rated both those you know 6.5 so I mean the goji cacao that's still my favorite I mean the black pepper and turmeric I got to give that a 7 out of 10 on the flavor rating alright so the last flavor teacher from the Pachamama line is I mean of course you got two more but that's natural is the yel ylang-ylang and holy basil okay and you know right on the box it says right here these us if you're looking for some creativity boosting effects you know that's what the holy basil and yeah Lang Lang teachers for you know it's for that creativity helps stimulate your brain and help you really you know if you're at work that's where I could see this works cool let's do or you know at home when you're doing your side house or whatever you're doing reach for that yeah ylang-ylang and holy basil teacher from Pachamama so what are some of the benefits of y'all angling well I'm glad you all us it can reduce stress it promotes relaxation throughout the body and your mind okay I need some of that improve skin and hair health all right I mean the skin health out here I live in Colorado so I as hell so okay I'm getting behind that has anti-inflammatory properties and it's popular in traditional Chinese medicine now what are some of the potential benefits of holy basil I'm sure you guys basil you know probably cook with basil or have in the past so you're familiar with it so now what are some of the benefits of holy basil you know basil you cook with it you're familiar with it I'm sure I you know it helps your body to adapt to stress okay we live in a stressful world so we can all use some of that it can take hundreds of phytochemicals that have proven to be beneficial for human health all right and it helps maintain homeostasis you know balance equilibrium throughout your body that is what happens that's why you feel you know that's how CBD and cannabinoids can be so effective because it works with your endocannabinoid system it stimulates your endocannabinoid system works with those cb1 and cb2 receptors provides relief where you need it because your endo cannabinoid system is in charge of many important bodily regulations so once you take it it helps to promote homeostasis you know cannabinoids do that it helps promote homeostasis so it's even better that holy basil can help to promote homeostasis as well throughout your body you want balance and equilibrium in your body and holy basil can also protect your body from toxins and infections um what what else are some of the benefits you know it's high in vitamins A C as well as calcium and zinc and last but not least some of the most important benefits of holy basil are its antioxidant antiviral antibacterial and mewn enhancing benefits you know as you guys are starting to realize like hope many of these ingredients also play off the backs of the potential effects of cannabinoids such as CBD so it's just all of these ingredients are a match made in heaven you know Pachamama didn't just like randomly like oh we're just gonna throw these all-natural ingredients in here just for the hell of it you know they did not do that they did it because they were calculated they did their research and they want to do it to make sure that you guys at the end consumer have the best possible product with the best possible effects so let's go ahead and do the you ylang-ylang holy basil ii you know the creativity boosting effects I like that um you know I honestly am thinking that like it's gonna taste like some like basil that's what I'm that's not feeling alright so I you know I'm expecting that the you know the legal angling is going to you know taste like what am i what should I say I'm like basil I mean obviously it's got basil but also I mean some of the yelling like I don't know if you've ever tried your ylang ylang but it's sort of like like I guess the taste could be you know compared to like a honeydew and sweet complex enough to stand out on its own you know kind of like a honey sweetness flavor maybe I mean it's honestly I mean a lot of people like compared to like you know your ylang ylang should be like the new vanilla like a new sort of additive it like it's a sweetness kind of thing so let's see how the Elaine going taste with the basil whoa it's smell this one shows a little differently I can smell the basil but like the your ylang ylang I think that's like the sweetness and I'm getting all right one full milliliter beauty-full left the time hmm all right basil all the way but it's sweet that's the you ylang-ylang mmm so you know Lang Lang's like a sweet flavor kind of um basil we all know a bit you know you're familiar basil mmm you taste like basil a sweet basil honestly see I'm kind of impressed by how much I like that flavor like wow it's sweet and then it's got the basil to flag I didn't think those would pair well together but surprisingly enough they do and I mean if you're cooking with bass I mean you know that you're angling and basil mix together but I mean even if you're like making tea or something else I mean I would just I like these just right under the tongue Wow it's sweet sort of like I guess sort of like honey air like yeah it's a little sweetness of honey I guess you could look compared to with the taste of basil perfect paired it's not like too much basil it's I like that a lot you know flavor scales had to rate that out of a scale of one to ten you know I Nana I actually do like that it's up there with a go gene cacao with me so I got to give that a 7 point 5 out of 10 boom here we go so that is it for you know the flavoured options of the Pachamama line of full spectrum have extract tinctures but you know there is one more option there is if you don't like any of those I mean I would recommend trying them at least you know especially because of all those incredible ingredients that they got in there I would recommend you know if you want if you just want an all-natural option Pachamama has an all-natural option because guess what you know what's in here full spectrum have backtrack and MCT oil that is it it's no no additives nothing so this one I mean I'm not really gonna be able to do flavor because I mean it's all natural it doesn't taste like it just tastes like full spectrum hemp extract but you know I do want to use it just to you know finalize the review so I can say you know I did all of my shake it up here we go and the natural guess what MCT oil all natural hemp extract boom there we go beautiful all right boom I love it I enjoy all natural tinctures it's just I love the taste of hemp extract I liked terpenes you know those naturally-occurring terpenes I don't think there needs to be flavor I get it while some of you do want it that's why you know like it well c-calm our full spectrum tincture we have a chocolate mint that people love but i enjoy the natural so just like with ours the pocket our mom and natural phenomenal it doesn't make me again very easy to use boom it's dropped in on my tongue held it there so all it you know and the natural you know this should be really good you know if you're making like salad dressings if you want to mix it infuse it into things that's when the natural would come into play but i mean you could be making a spaghetti sauce and mix that in there if you want or even the yelling of basil you know so start thinking of it like that you can use this as tinctures but you can also cook with these you know or mix it with beverages I mean might be a little far of a stretch to make sure the beverage unless like the green tea and the echinacea that would be good you know your drink green tea mix it like that so just think of it like that but you know overall the Pachamama line of full-spectrum tinctures are incredible you know like so for example let's walk through my ratings on the flavor you know the goji cacao that was a seven point five out of ten you know the green tea and echinacea that was a six point five out of ten the kava kava and valerian that was a six point five out of ten the black pepper and tumeric that's going higher that was a seven out of ten you know the ylang ylang and holy basil I give I gave that a seven point five out of ten and you know the natural I can't really it's just a natural hemp extract so I can't really just say the flavor but overall very very solid but again guys the Pachamama did not set out to make the you know the best tasting teachers they made they set out to make the most effect give tinctures that have the greatest potential to work for you and your personal needs and I think they achieved that goal especially because they're available in 750 milligrams and 1750 milligrams at CBD per a 30 ml bottle hey guys I did want to jump back in here you know it's been about 45 minutes since I started taking the Pachamama CBD tinctures and let me tell you so I take CBD cannabinoid you know full-spectrum have an extract isolate broad-spectrum for the general health and wellness benefits because I'm lucky enough where I don't have any you know illnesses or you know ailments that are really kind of deterring me from function in my day-to-day life you know I'm not I don't have a disease or anything so I just take it for the general health and wellness benefits and the sort of the mind inducing effects like the mind boosting effects I guess I should say of cannabinoids and let me tell you so here's what I'm really experiencing right now is my general wellness health and well-being I just feel fantastic like I'm just happy I have a positive outlook on life and I'm just I just I feel good I'm I'm happy right now my verbal fluency is on point I really feel it if you guys you guys would probably start telling throughout the review video that I feel like I can just start talking and talking and talking and just the words there's no delay from my thought process to my mouth it kind of just flows so that verbal fluency is on point and then my focus and my concentration levels are really really there and that's what I become to expect when I'm taking a quality hemp extract product because like I said I take it for the general health and wellness benefits and those are the things that I really look for and that is exactly what I have noticed since taking the Pachamama CBD teaches and I feel very relaxed and just chill I'm just I'm happy in life I'm content you know and I just feel like you know what while I was kind of sitting we know waiting for the full effects of everything to kick in and for tea know where to start stimulating my endocannabinoids system I did pause this video so that I could come back and film this but I did start to notice that my mind was starting to really wander and ideas were really starting to generate in my brain so I feel like that's the cannabinoids starting to work and you know help with that you know the the sort of the mind effect so that's I'm really noticing that because especially like you know the holy basil in you ylang ylang like did mention that that does have sort of those creativity boosting effects so that's where I think that's coming from and honestly guys I feel like I need to stay here and talk with you all day and I just I feel great so the overall effects that I'm getting and the improvements in just what I'm feeling right now this is knowing me guaranteeing or expressing that you will feel the same way or anything at at that but right now the effects that I'm experiencing after reviewing the entire line of Pachamama CBD products I gotta give it a 10 a 10 10 it's a very solid line of products very unique and just the ingredients in there are just top-notch so nicely done 10 out of 10 guys so that's you know I mean hey you can't argue with the results that I'm experiencing but who knows what you'll experience maybe it'll be less maybe it'll be more who knows it is really up to you and you won't know until you start taking the Pachamama CBD tinctures and guys if you check the description below there is an exclusive 15% off discount

we're with best dosage so today we have a little bit of a different product we have cbg oil which also this product also has cbd oil in it it is a one to one ratio so you get this whole bottle has 500 milligrams of cbd oil and 500 milligrams of cbg oil and with each serving you get 17 milligrams of cbd oil and 17 milligrams of cbg oil so before this we found this product we both didn't know much i didn't really know a whole lot about cbg but this definitely turned us on to it yeah we found this product and let's read a little bit about cbg oil so on this box it says cbg binds with cannabinoid receptors in our neutral system which helps to regulate your pain mood inflammation motor control nausea memory appetite pleasure and immune function so this bottle has a lot of good effects in it with cbd oil and i definitely feel like they are true yeah we definitely feel like they're true this is full spectrum cbd and cbg oil um yeah we really seem to love this product let's just try it yeah let's see a little bit how it works so first the directions you shake before use and then to open it you press this dropper in and turn so it's not super easy to open but that's that's okay and then you to fill up the dropper you press the squeezer and it fills it up and then you squeeze it under yeah when you fill it up it's a full dose and then you would squeeze it under the tongue let it sit for what 20 to 30 seconds no let it sit for 15 to 20 seconds and then you swallow so let me give you a little bit you can tell us about the flavor let's sit for a second i found the flavor to just be like just hemp flavor it's just like neutral oil oh it's salty i definitely agree it's very mild and just kind of earthy and it definitely it says on the bottle it says natural hemp flavor and i definitely agree it's very just earthy and just heavy though yeah it tastes pretty good um let's see what else it's definitely not the best taste in the world but it's really not too bad and with all the benefits that i think that it helps me with i definitely yeah it would definitely be worth it let me try a little bit of the oil too on the camera what is it pretty swallow oh it's really not bad at all you don't really taste it too much it's like a natural flavor yeah and i definitely agree the benefits are worth it for the flavor and for you know and not tasting the best it doesn't taste bad um it has the serving size listed out on here also cbd distillery's website is very easy to navigate i have it up on my phone right here we like a lot yeah we like the website super easy to use they have a lot of reviews too this product only has 19 reviews right now as we said cbg oil is just just starting out so um the product effectiveness customer experience and pricing is all five stars so very good review so far yeah um let's see robert says it's great stuff it's a great flavor and it has truly had an impact on his over overall well-being so people seem to really like this adam says it's the most effective cbd he's ever tried craig says it's an excellent product leah says i've been using these tinctures for years this new product is great i take it in the evening it definitely relaxes me more than the regular full spectrum product so i seem to be sleeping better so that's good if you've been using cbd for a while and you're you know starting to lose the effects maybe try cbg oil because it's something new and again this is a one-to-one ratio of cbg and cbd oil so we'll definitely be perching purchasing this again i feel like it's definitely been helping me sleep as well too because it just helps me relax and everything yeah just puts me really calm yeah so we'll definitely be trying this again give cbd distilleries website a look it's really easy to navigate and we really love their website so thank you for tuning in today and have a great day thank you", "pYsO9slIUF0": "[Music] how's it going today guys today we're doing something not vape related but it is CBD related and you guys seem to be really interested in that so we're gonna talk about this stuff today well this is hemp extract CBD oil by potent potions they sent us it um thank you guys so much for sending it to us now this stuff is twelve hundred milligrams meant to be taken orally or I guess apparently you can like rub it on your extremities that are in pain or whatever I'm not too sure but this stuff I'm gonna drip directly into my mouth um that's how you're supposed to take this stuff so let's jump beat around the bush I'm just gonna go for it uh-huh so you shake it up real good first and then you just pretty much grab a dropper full and then pop it in your mouth let it hang out for a minute so if fully absorbs and then you swallow it and then you should be chilled out so I'm going to do it here goes a drip one minute 57 seconds later alright it's been about a minute there we go alright oh when you swallow it you really taste the flavor it's um it's pretty minty which is cool yeah I'm going to let that CVD effect really set in and I'll tell you guys a little bit about this stuff so potent potions is a company out in California who makes really cool stuff it's completely organic and if you're interested in doing this stuff and you want something organic these guys are a great choice to check out now I will warn you guys this stuff is kind of expensive this 1200 milligram bottle was a hundred and twenty bucks so that's that's pretty that's pretty steep but apparently I mean it's super deluxe like 1200 milligrams is pretty pretty high potency makes sense I guess it's potent potions on the back of the bottle it tells you the nutrition facts which is kind of funny um apparently it's 9 calories per serving so if you're watching your weight only take one serving but yeah every serving is one dropper full and it gives you 40 milligrams of CBD in the filming of this video I [ __ ] it up a bunch so I'm on like eight servings right now and I'm pretty freakin mellowed out Motz crazies you know you're not stoned you're you're chilled out it's CBD there's no THC so it's supposed to help relieve anxiety stress pain all the normal things that weed helps with without getting you stone or so I'm told I don't smoke weed but apparently it's supposed to help you out in that way which is cool now if you look closely on the bottle guys this stuff says it's medical grade so I don't know what that means I wouldn't take it too seriously I think that's kind of a marketing strategy I'm not sure but it's definitely good stuff you know flavor is nice and it tastes like CBD stuff like if you have experience with CBD vape juice or whatever or if you've done other oral you know means of taking CBD it definitely tastes like it and this stuff some got like a mint kind of overlay on top which is pretty cool top to bottom you know this stuff is pretty cool I've used it a bunch already and you know on video right now after a bunch of different servings I'm pretty I'm pretty chilled out which is great it definitely works but you know it's pretty expensive now there's other options you can get it in lower concentrations and obviously the less concentrated it is the less expensive it is but I'll link down below for you to check out but yeah if you really want to get into it and you want something that's strong check out the 1200 milligram it's a 120 bucks like I said but you know it's definitely worth it and it'll last especially like I mean [ __ ] we've had this stuff for so week and a half using it everyday pretty good and you know if you don't want something so so powerful you can jump in at a lower concentration and really get your feet wet see if it's something you want to check out and if you do use our link because it helps us grow

awesome as all and until next time guys peace out", "3AkjvwPweiM": "[Music] science tells us that the effect of cbd in the body has a bell-shaped curve meaning that taking more of it doesn't mean that you're going to experience a higher effect the best practice is to start with a lower dose and slowly increase until you find the dose that is perfect for you the first step is to find the total cbd potency of your tincture which weed is closed at the bottom of the front side of the tincture bottle we suggest that you take advantage of our graduated droppers which offer four different measurements a full dropper means that you're taking at least 16 33 or 83 milligrams of cbd in your toes for three quarters of a dropper you'd be taking at least 12 24 or 62 milligrams of cbd in your dose for half a dropper you'd be taking at least 8 16 or 41 milligrams of cbd in your toes and for one quarter of a dropper you'd be taking at least 4 8 or 20 milligrams of cbd in your toes if you're new to cbd this is probably a great starting point you can take one to two full droppers daily in the morning and before going to bed shake well before every use and remember as with any other supplements to consult your physician before using our products", "s5Lp4O8TRRI": "[Music] full spectrum vs broad spectrum what's the difference and what's better hi everyone my name is emily and today i'm going to be diving deep into the difference between these two types of cbd products the main difference between full and broad spectrum is the amount of thc that is in the product you know the cannabinoid that makes you feel high hungry sleepy and so on when the united states passed the 2018 farm bill they set a limit of 0.3 thc weight that can be found in hemp and that goes the same for cbd products full spectrum products tend to contain anywhere from point two to point three percent thc while broad spectrum is thc free or to be more specific it contains non-detectable levels of thc don't worry this isn't enough to get you high unless you take high doses of cbd like 100 milligrams of cbd at once and at a concentration of 0.3 percent thc this would be roughly 8 to 10 milligrams of thc that's not a lot but for the average person like me who doesn't consume marijuana products then there is a good chance you will feel a slight psychoactive high here is an example of a full spectrum lab report and as you can see this extract contains 0.15 thc or 1.41 milligrams of thc per 30 milligrams of cbd so if you take one serving of this which is 30 milligrams of cbd you would be taking 1.41 milligrams of thc as well broad spectrum on the other hand contains non-detectable levels of thc there are instances that you may see broad spectrum 100 thc free but from a scientific standpoint thc free means non-detectable levels of thc so there is a chance that very minor amounts are in the extract but it's not enough to show up on lab tests because it is so little and there is no chance of feeling any psychoactive high no matter how much cbd you consume this lab report you see is a broad spectrum extract and as you can see it says nd which stands for non-detectable also another crucial aspect of full spectrum or broad spectrum extracts is that they contain other cannabinoids other than just cbd such as cannabidrol which stands for cvg cannabinol which stands for cbn or cannabicharmine which stands for cbc these are only four of the 100 plus cannabinoids found in hemp also found in hemp and full spectrum and broad spectrum extracts are terpenes and flavonoids which also have their unique medicinal properties in another segment we'll be talking about why having multiple compounds rather than just cbd or just a few cannabinoids is a lot more effective so stay tuned just to recap full spectrum cbd products tend to contain 0.3 thc which is the legal limit and broad spectrum cbd products are thc free meaning they contain non-detectable levels of thc if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to reach out to us we are happy to answer any questions and guide you in choosing the right product thank you for watching and see you in the next video you", "WMNFyC15q-Q": "hey y'all it's Cody from sleep populace and in this video I'm going to introduce you to my favorite CBD products for sleep now a lot of CBD goodies in the market promise to help folks slumber but in my opinion these four are the absolute best now what are they well you'll just have to keep on watching to find out all right first things first let's chat a little bit about what CBD is now if you haven't checked it out yet I highly recommend that you take a peek am i what is CBD video which I'm gonna put right there I think yeah and it goes over what CVD is how it feels the research that's been done into its side effects dosage all things like that basically like it's a full rundown of CBD as a compound but in case you don't have time right now or simply don't want to watch it I will give you a little bit of a breakdown right now but what CBD is so CBD or cannabidiol is a compound found on the flower of the cannabis plant it's one of more than a hundred different compounds or phyto cannabinoids contained on the flower and they range and feel and type but the two most popular ones are probably CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol or THC however unlike THC CBD is not psychoactive and it doesn't trigger hallucinations or intoxication it's usually used in oils creams and pills to treat things like joint pain anxiety poor appetite and even poor sleep I should also mention that it's totally legal to buy and consume hemp derived CBD in all 50 states as long as the product doesn't contain more than 0.3 percent of THC alright now that we've gone over a little bit about what CBD is let's get into my picks for the best CBD products we're falling asleep and I want to start with my absolute favorite CBD product for spalling asleep fast which is the CBD PM tincture from CBD MD now this little baby contains both CBD and melatonin so it is literally designed to send you off to snooze town in a flash and when I tried it myself I found that it pretty much did that within five to ten minutes of taking it I felt totally relaxed and like I was drifting off to Dreamland with ease another thing I liked about this tincture was that I didn't really experience any next state grogginess which is pretty unusual for a melatonin based product so if you're looking to fall asleep super fast and need to get up and go the next day I think this could be a great product for you another good thing about it is that a 500 milligram bottle of the tincture only costs $45 which is pretty affordable when you compare it to other see many products on the market next up is what I find to be the most relaxing CBD oil and that's the American hemp oil from American hemp and I say most relaxing because I found that this oil had a really nice sort of like calming effect all across the body within 15 minutes of taking it I felt like tension in my shoulders was being alleviated my mind was quieted and so it helped me to fall asleep at night for sure but I also found that it was really just nice for lounging around the house reading a book watching TV and when compared to other products that I've tested I found that the effects lasted for a longer time around an hour and an hour and a half so if you're looking for a subtle CBD oil that'll sort of carry you through an afternoon or maybe carry you through your bedroom time routine I would highly recommend this one as I found to be very relaxing however it's like caveat is that a 2,500 milligram bottle of American hemp oil retails for $140 which makes it one of the more expensive ones I've tested next I want to share my favorite CBD oil for general use and that's the CBD premium oil from CBD MD now you'll recognize the brand from the first one I shared with you all for falling asleep fast but this one is different in that there is no melatonin here it is all CBD oil and I like it for general use because it helps me fall asleep at night but I also found that it had a really nice subtle relaxing effect during the day you know if it was like a weekend day and I was just hanging out I could take it go see friends go to the gym you know do errands and I found that it was just a really nice Zen tone I was highly recommended for general use and something else I really like about this oil is that you can choose your flavor so you go on the website and they have like four or five different options so you can choose the flavor that's best for you and something else I like about it is that a seven hundred milligram bottle of the CBD premium oil from CBD MD regionals for seventy dollars which puts it in a nice mid range between the least expensive ones the most expensive ones and finally my absolute favorite value buy has got to be the CBD oil from some soil now here as 600 milligram bottle retails for $30 and a 1200 milligram one retails for $60 so it's definitely more in a budget friendly zone for those of you who want to try CBD but maybe we don't want to fork over more than $100 to try it and even though it's less expensive than some of the option other options on this list I'd say that it's just as good it helps me to fall asleep fast and it made me feel really relaxed during the day so I think it's a great option the only thing I really don't like about the CBD oil from Sun soil are the flavor options and either comes in chocolate mint or cinnamon and personally those just aren't tastes that I like well folks that does it for my guide the best CBD products for sleep for more sleep related content and resources make sure to go to sleep obelisk calm and is subscribe to our YouTube channel until next time happy dreaming", "prC-C0HpFJM": "all right today guys we're going to be talking about tank chips alright so today we'll be talking about tinctures all the textures that we'll be using in this video will be our essential CBD brand good thing about our brand we use all the same drivers for all the bottles so they're all going to be calibrated you're never going to be guessing on how much oil I should be taking so it's something like this you could see where we would have a calibrated dropper that way you can get to that one milliliter line and know how much you're supposed to be taking instead of taking about 20 drops or about five drops you know just fill it up to where you need it to be take your dose easy enough something else that we have would be something like this this would be a different kind of tincture we offer so the first one I showed was an isolating sure that was 16 milligrams for one full dropper this is a full spectrum tincture and what full-spectrum means is that instead of getting just that CVD isolate you're gonna be getting the full plant so rather than being just CVD with the carrier oil which we use MCT oil for you'll be getting the vitamins nutrients the other amino acids your fatty acids as well as the other candidates and there is some THC in a full spectrum formula one thing that we do not have to offer here would be a broad spectrum and what broad spectrum is is isolate with all the cannabinoids vitamins nutrients but with no THC still so what we're really looking at here is isolate and full-spectrum we do not have a broad spectrum option at least as of right now so this is what we'll be working with today two more options we have would be these two teachers and what these are are the red is a isolate tincture just like the yellow one but instead of being 16 milligrams for a full dropper it is a 60 milligrams for a full dropper and this blue one it's a full spectrum just like the green one but instead of being 10 milligrams it's 40 milligrams one good thing to know to just while we're talking about the bottles is the big number on the outside of any tincture bottle that might not always be right at the top but there's gonna be one big number somewhere on here that is always going to be the full contents of CBD in that bottle that is not what you're getting per dose a good way to look at it is the big number divided by servings that's how much you're getting per serving all right so I wanted us to ask Patrick you know one super common question we get when people come into the shop so are you able to use any of these tinctures and put them in food beverages or are they specifically only for like under the double use yeah of course I mean like he said you know we need asked that a lot one thing that I usually tell people is it doesn't hurt you're not you know I mean you might lose some you know of the CBD through digestion but you're gonna get that with an edible anyways you know just the same way the only thing you really lose is traditionally you would take the tincture under your tongue but you know we died you tell people yeah it's it's okay the only thing you're losing is instead of taking it under your tongue and getting into your system quickly it will have to digest you know so instead of you know under the tongue right into the blood vessel you mix it in some water mix it in some food you just got to wait until it gets in through your system that way but yeah nothing wrong with it really you know nothing wrong with doing it that way okay and I heard them for you explaining the differences between the isolate and the full spectrum and I've also heard you know the term water-soluble being around with tinctures are these water soluble or no these are not made with a water soluble CBD what we use is just a you know regular isolate extract it's a pure co2 99.99 now you know a completely pure clean isolate rather than the water soluble yeah that's just kind of what we go with her now so what we're gonna do is we're gonna now show you just a quick demonstration on how to use the tincture or how we suggest use the tincture you know like I said before you can use it you know just put it in food or put it in a drink but this is the suggested way in the best way to use it we're gonna start by just filling up our tincture dropper to that 1.0 line or at least to as close as we can get it to and again we're talking about the very top line on this dropper that's gonna be that one milliliter mark that would be one full dose so that's what we're gonna try and do we're gonna try and get up there you know sometimes the tincture doesn't fill all the way with just one squirt so yeah so with here we got to just about the 0.75 line and I'll take this point seven-five I'll fill it back up to the point - that'd be a full dose but what I'm gonna do just for the demonstration is just one one shot at the 0.75 so you take your dose and we're gonna put it right underneath our tongue hold it for about 30 seconds and then swallow at 30 seconds - 90 seconds is what suggestion that's the longer you leave it the more time it has to soak into your blood vessels the more we'll get directly into your system and hopefully the quicker you'll start to feel that effect so without further ado we'll take our tincture all right so 30 seconds is what I counted in my head just swallow and after that mouth clear took my tincture so now that I've taken the tincture that's really it there's nothing much more to it I know it might look a little bit more intimidating than it you know truly is but once you get that step down I'll just getting it up to your dose under the tongue holding it for 30 seconds it's not bad it's bearable good thing about us here on earth is that we don't add any artificial flavorings or any additives or anything at all besides what's necessarily needed so like you've seen on those isolate bottles that says unflavored because it has a no taste to it at all there's no taste the MCT oil we used is completely under flavored CBD isolate has no natural taste as well so it has less flavor than a glass of water you'll get from your sink the full spectrum formulas on the other hand they have some type of a hemp you know natural earthy flavor but they're not unbearable a lot of companies which you if you are afraid of that hemp taste when you go to buy a tincture if you don't end up going with our own you know check essential see be calm if you are interested or come on down to earth dispensary but if you do decide to shop with another brand and you know you're just watching this video for you know tincture advice or you know how to is things like that if you don't want that real heavy taste and you don't want those artificial flavorings to try and cover that up just don't get a brand that uses hemp seed oil some companies like to use it to throw in the extra vitamins and nutrients when it's not full spectrum and some people use it as just the carrier oil but hemp seed oil will amplify that hemp taste to places you never wanted it to be before so again if you don't want that hemp taste don't get hemp seed oil stick with us MCT oil flavorless or even the full spectrum with that watered-down flavor where it's not as strong and that was all thanks for watching the video then forget to check our central CBD comm for all your CBD needs tinctures topicals smokeable vapor bulls anything you can think of we got it or just stop on down to Earth's dispensary at 1200 East Oklahoma in Bayview Milwaukee Wisconsin thank you", "3wD0KpsGIhI": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats and it is tincture time guys one of my favorite things to review here on your marijuana review show uh we are taking a look at a product from select we've reviewed quite a few things from select in the past they're sort of the jack of all trades of uh marijuana companies we've reviewed carts i think i've reviewed um disposables um they're in a lot of different uh markets select they're selling a lot of different products and one of those is the tincture and they have a pretty uh wide tincture line now have had it for a while with a whole bunch of different kinds of dosages and mixtures between thcs and cbds and different potencies and yada yada yada so this one here i purchased at a dispensary in long beach for 50 i believe um and it is a pretty good value for what you get inside of this box and it is a little confusing i'll show you here um so this is a one to one tincture uh one to one thc cbd one milligram for one milligram however that's not actually true uh it does say there this is the unflavored 500 milligram thc 500 milligram cbd well actually there's a sticker up here clarifying it's actually 600 milligrams thc and 513 cbd so you get a little extra great who doesn't love that uh and then uh as i said this is their unflavored i think they also have like lemon and ginger other things uh and on the side we've got our dosing uh sort of guidelines um they recommend that each full dropper is 10 milligrams which is a single serving and they say this whole uh tincture bottle has 60 droppers in total which makes sense for 600 milligrams of thc um so we've reviewed a lot of tinctures here i really like tinctures uh they usually work pretty well for me and i absolutely love the form factor uh we'll be doing this one sublingually like we do with most of our tinctures under the tongue which means it actually comes on quite a bit quicker than if you were just taking it like any other edible uh the effects can start to hit as soon as about 15 minutes and really get going at about 45. um so uh let's go ahead and get this open i was looking okay so this is uh an mct oil based um tincture i was wondering what their base was and it is mct oil which is basically just coconut oil so it is coconut oil but just a specific uh chain of molecules i guess um okay so let's open her up our one-to-one drops now i'm not particularly a big cbd guy uh it's not something that is especially um helpful or useful for me i i don't really um uh get a lot of benefit from cbd uh more power to everybody who does i'm i'm glad you really enjoy it uh i don't dislike cbd it's just it doesn't seem to have much of an effect on me but i will definitely keep an eye out uh because this one is almost equal parts cbd in here as well we'll see if that makes me feel any different than the normal thc review uh so like all of our weed reviews we're gonna do uh or excuse me tincture reviews we do uh 100 milligrams not the whole thing and not just a single dropper i like to do that as our baseline for pretty much every tincture so that would mean 10 full droppers of this is going to be our dose we'll see how that goes uh i'll probably do three or four two or three four on camera with you and then the uh remainder that i will be doing the next you know six seven i will probably do on a live stream i've been doing a lot of live streaming thank you to everybody joining in um and i'll probably do uh a little bit more there so i hope to see some of you guys join in for our live streams anyways i'm going to shut up now and i'm going to go and open this up and get this process started smells like nothing at all not a thing okay i'm expecting this to taste uh very neutral uh as mct oil tinctures normally are uh not able to get the full milligram it's only about the 75. got to keep that in mind i have to do uh maybe closer to 13 drops in total uh hung ahaha [Music] um [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] okay that's all i'm gonna do um i i there are uh various opinions about how long you should leave it i usually go for about a minute or two and that seems to do the trick pretty well uh and as i i suspected largely tasteless just that vaguely kind of coconutty oil aftertaste um but it's so un you know it's just it's it's really uh it's not a big deal at all i took three droppers full and don't even feel like i uh need to rinse my mouth out or anything um so in terms of the uh unflavoredness of this tincture it is really unflavored um so we've done our first three or two and a half worth droppers there i've got another you know we'll say 10 to do because i wasn't able to get the full one dropper uh and as i said i'm gonna hope to do some of that with you guys on a live stream uh before i wrap this review up oh i think i forgot to mention uh like all of our wheat's reviews after i do my 10th dropper or so uh about two hours or so after that i'll come back here and let you guys know if this select one to one cbd thc tincture is as good as i am hoping until then stay high stay healthy hi guys i am back about three and a half hours after our first journey with the select one to one drops 600 milligrams of thc in the very specific 513 milligrams of cbd that's not how much i did i did about between 100 and 150 milligrams would be my guess which is probably between 80 and 120 milligrams of cbd and a lot of you got to hang out with me while i was reviewing this we did a little bit of a live stream and i appreciate everyone who tuned in uh and to all those who were there you probably remember that i liked this quite a bit this is very good um an affordable tincture i see it for about 50 bucks normally which is already a good deal for 600 milligrams of thc then you get the added bonus of that one to one cbd double-year cannabinoid goodness um so normally the cbd stuff doesn't really do a lot for me i'm not a big big big huge user of cbd or even sort of i don't really get the uh too much of the positive effects uh i respect it as a product it's just not super effective on me but i did notice it here um the the the high i'm experiencing is way more relaxed even than normal um sort of very very pleasant kind of experience less cerebral than normal for me not really neurons really aren't firing quite as much but i feel very at peace so i'm going to attribute that to the almost equal amounts of cbd in here so this select one-to-one unflavored drops it gets a really really big thumbs up for me i like it quite a bit my dog's thinking about barking but she's not going to she's not going to she really wanted to um so yeah huge thumbs up for me and before i bounce here guys i want to share with you a little cherry on top a little something that you can enjoy that i can share with you that isn't necessarily about wheat in this one you may not want any weed before you check this out because it might be a little too much i'm going to recommend a couple of books from a japanese uh illustrator it's manga i'm sorry i'm a nerd i guess it's only the second one i've ever read so don't judge me too harshly um the artist and writer is a guy by the name i apologize if i'm mispronouncing it junjie ito um and the two books i want to recommend from him that are utterly grotesque i mean truly some of the most shocking images i've ever seen somebody uh put pen to paper but i mean that in the best kind of way uh they are depraved in the most uh wonderful kind of cosmic hori sense of depraved uh and those are guillot geo again probably mispronouncing it which means fish in [ __ ] japan um and uh the other one is uzumaki which means spirals and it's all about spirals and i think adult swim is gonna do some kind of adaptation i've talked a lot about genji ito don't mix the two that's my advice definitely try this and definitely give junjie e2 a shot if you're a fan of gross stuff but keep them apart all right guys well that's going to do it for this review here on wheats really like the select give a huge recommendation my boy genji whatever however i'm sorry i'm still very high so thank you so much for watching guys stay high stay healthy and we'll see you for the next review i'm hoping my dogs aren't going to trip they might we did it [Music] you", "MSzIYGWRXbE": "- [Narrator] You've probably already heard about cannabidiol,\nbetter known as CBD. It's exploded in popularity with claims of treating everything\nfrom insomnia to diabetes. - That's the only thing that would help me with my migraine headaches. - [Narrator] It can be consumed as an oil, applied to skin, or inhaled it as a vapor. We know CBD is a component of marijuana, but it's derived from hemp,\nusually does not contain THC, and won't get you high. The game changer for the\nCBD industry came when President Trump signed a farm bill legalizing hemp cultivation. One prescription drug\ncontaining CBD has been approved for treating two rare forms\nof childhood epilepsy, but the vast majority of\nwhat we know about CBD has been limited to personal experiences and unproven animal studies. - More often than not, things\nthat look good in animals, when you go into humans,\nthose effects aren't there. - [Narrator] According to a\n2018 Harvard Health Blog post, scientists say they still don't know much about how CBD affects the brain or which doses and\ndelivery methods work best. For example, if you put a few drops of CBD under your tongue, you\nmight consume 10 milligrams. But some researchers say you\nwould need 30 times that amount to reach a threshold\nthat can relieve stress. And since CBD products\nare primarily marketed and sold as supplements, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration doesn't evaluate whether these products\nare safe or effective. That means if you buy a CBD\nproduct, you don't really know how much CBD is actually in the container. There's no denying the\nCBD revolution is upon us and the marketplace is buying in. However, there's still\na lot of TBD about CBD.", "5bfR8e9hdD4": "[Music] it won its Ivan kept agile calm here to bring you what will ultimately be part one in a multi-part series in my experience ultimately with the uncanny full spectrum CBD oil so I mean probably just lost your mind you're like what drugs yes CBD is absolutely a drug just like caffeine in a plethora of other things ultimately drug being something some sort of substance that is going to either inhibit or promote some sort of chemical reaction in our body which is going to give us ideally a desired effect so to that in like 30,000 foot view what does CBD where does it come from all that stuff lots of misinformation confusion with respect to it because we have cannabis and then within that we have hemp and we have marijuana marijuana of course being THC based the drug that gets you high THC and then hemp on the other side though industrial hemp which while it does have THC that drug component of marijuana they don't want thinks of over here on the side of hemp it's like 0.3 percent THC comparatively to marijuana which spans anywhere from like five percent up to like thirty percent THC significantly more so two totally different things but unfortunately hemp has been demonized for a long time because of basically back in the 70s with Nixon and the war on drugs cannabis gained turned into a Schedule one narcotic and all these other things with a controlled substance act and our war on drugs which is arguably gone as well as our war on like poverty and obesity considering we can't even keep drugs out of maximum-security prisons but I digress finally came full circle with the farm bill in 2018 which removed industrial hemp from the controlled substance act and put it over in the domain of the FDA Food and Drug Administration now that industrial hemp is easier to farm more and more companies are moving into the space of creating CBD oil can a boy do I don't know how to pronounce it but CBD based products with that there's more and more research going into you CBD both with kind of the properties as well as effects benefits things along those lines all kinds of clinical testing so to that end one of the companies that's entered the space is uncanny veteran owned company and per their site their mission statement is to be the leading voice of advocacy for CBD in the military and veteran community provide the most accurate information and comprehensive access to research in the industry to reverse the Department of Defense ban on natural CBD supplements with education campaigns in political action in order to allow access to those who have no alternatives provide the highest quality most trusted products at a competitive price I think that's pretty cool having said all that what does CBD do well start with what it doesn't do it doesn't get you high again 0.3 percent THC so if you want to smoke some industrial hemp you would probably die smoke inhalation before you ever felt the effects of THC which is the drug component of marijuana so it doesn't do that what are potential side effects of it hasn't been used in documented so there's not like tons and tons of evidence but the one kind of side effect that it looks like there is potential is basically interfering with prescription drugs that someone's already on so putting that stuff to the side what are some of the benefits of course can't make any claims because I'm not a doctor and the FDA has to approve drugs we know they can be trusted because the head of FDA is pretty much like a revolving door to the Board of Directors for like Monsanto and all your pharmaceutical companies that's what has it been shown to do well there I've been clinical trials with use for treating epilepsy and beyond that kind of this really broad spectrum of use whether it's helping with sleep-like altima sleeping disorders stress anxiety depression not to mention essentially kind of those symptoms of like PTSD and then on top of that basically other things whether it's kind of inflammatory diseases like within the body or even treating Alzheimer's all kinds of different uses that people are kind of dipping into with respect to research and CBD which brings us to the question of why am I taking CBD what am I looking to get out of it well I don't have epilepsy don't think I have Alzheimer's I don't think I've PTSD but everyone's looking at the world through their own lens like where do you even start trying to define normal I will say largely in part because of basically my journey and where I'm at with Kip Adger entrepreneurial pursuits there's absolutely some stress in my life and with that probably some anxiety and like honestly sometimes I don't sleep as well as I'd like sometimes I wake up don't get as restful sleep as I would like so if it can pretty much do anything for that that would be amazing not only for me personally the bigger picture for me is basically help me be a better father to my boys if I am stressed if I don't get much sleep that basically translate into me not being as patient as I would like to with my boys so I don't know we'll see what it does for me one of the other really important factors with respect to CBD from on canna that I've looked into doing my due diligence is the way it's made so it's produced from industrial hemp more importantly though from organic hemp why is that important well if you take something and you concentrate it the last thing you want is like concentrated pesticides like I don't want to drink roundup not good so this is made from organic industrial hemp on top of that third-party testing to actually verify it it's purity all those things and overall just even vetting them through Instagram follow mine Instagram and the overall message that they basically pushes to live an awesome life like that's it like that's at least that's what I draw from it and I can get behind that like absolutely so with that I have two of these bottles probably enough to get me through probably about two months also came with a handy dose charts right on the front of it each individual's dosage is unique dosing tips start low work your way up take one dose in the morning one at night monitor effects adjust adjust doping doping adjust dosing as needed and yeah basically give you days of the week weeks through the month and PM all that stuff so you can keep track and kind of figure out find the sweet spot for yourself so what am I going to be doing well I'm gonna be taking this you can take it with food or under the tongue I'm gonna probably just take drops under the tongue end up ultimately revisiting it probably in about two weeks maybe a month and we're in there see where I'm at as far as my dosing like what's kind of working for me and where you visited at least once if not twice more like as I go through essentially the product and kind of my takeaways at the end of it if you want to join me on this journey that is unknown at this point you're welcome to they actually reached out gave me a discount code if you guys want to pick some up and yeah ultimately I'm excited to try it and see what it does for me but as always thanks for joining us to keep badger calm look forward to seeing you next time [Music]", "8cAHF-AL8rs": "[Music] hey everybody welcome back to tea gardens TV today i have a special product that i want to share with you all we've been getting a lot of questions about this here at the shop and i figured a million of you out there will probably curious about it as well we're gonna talk about the hemp green leaf CBD product is Nick come on in guys all right everybody let's dive straight into these products here so we're doing two review today on the green leaf hemp oils here okay there's no difference between heavy oil or CBD oil it technically means the same thing I just think it's slinking purposes okay I mean this really we're gonna tackle three things today it's gonna be the difference between isolates and and full-spectrum hot into how to divide into your dosages how to actually dose your dosages properly okay in a different basis that they offer widows VG base or water base or even PG base okay how they're all used alright so the first thing we're the tackle is isolating and full-spectrum here you can see on these bottles it says isolates and in the red labels as a full spectrum what is the difference difference is full spectral I mean isolate means pure CBD it's been through an additional process to remove all the other cannabinoids okay all the other like THC and all that jazz and it's only just pure CBDs okay I generally always ask people before selling it here do you know does your job test and and if they do go with the isolates do any pop up tez or any drug test in that nature always use the isolates it's gonna be safest when it comes to you know just in case you get that even though in California or whatever state you're at the legal limit is 0.03 percent out here in California if you take the full spectrum and you take enough of it you might store you know your fat cells might hold enough THC where you get pop of the test so just on the safest side isolate means pure CBD there shouldn't be any THC at all okay now full spectrum means all cannabinoids from from the plant okay now like I said the legal limit in CBD here that's not sold and any collectives or dispensary is supposed to be 0.03 percent why did why don't you some people hear that it's better to take THC with a little bit of THC with your CBDs okay because they do work in conjunction somehow now CBD here doesn't have any THC in it I've taken this before I feel like it's about the same I mean such a low low dosage of THC may not make a massive difference or I mean very little difference at all because it's 0.03 percent member is not 0.3% its 0.03 percent okay how do we dose this the best way to dosage dose this CBD here is now generally always tell people 15 milligrams is kind of like the dosage where you can feel the CBD enough for you to feel the relaxation okay if you take CBD and a compound dosage you actually can feel the CBD working through your nervous system okay so it's much more relaxed as much more body of foreign but if you take it in a low dosage look for instance let's just say you take under 10 milligrams per dosage it's probably like a dietary supplement you may not feel it most likely you won't depending how sensitive your bothering body is depending which a tolerant level is okay everyone's body tone is a little bit different but generally under about ten milligrams you may not feel the CBD at all okay so that's how I generally tell people how much they take now how do you actually know how much to take let's just say you're trying to achieve a 15 milligram per sitting okay number one you get the bottle shake up really well obviously - you can look at how much milliliter this bottle is okay by volume this here is a 30 milliliters so you take 30 milliliters divided by the milligram by volume this is 750 milligram by the volume by the bottle okay so I think the math comes out to 25 mgs okay now in in the 30 milliliter bottle each squeeze of the dropper the entire dropper if you pump one full dropper into you know your cup or your directly under your mouth it's actually a 1 milliliter per vial per pump okay not per drop per pump okay that means I squeeze I'm squeezing and let go one full vial take it out squeeze it into the cup that is one milliliter verse and now now if you remember this bottle is thirty milliliter that means you have thirty pumps here okay that means each pump is a total of 25 milligrams I don't know if I made that clear but you take the number from the milliliter of the bottle divided by how many milligrams the volume of the bottle that will give you the milligrams per one squeeze which is one milliliter okay that's how you do the math for anything whether it's a thousand so I take a thousand divided by thirty which gives me thirty-three point three three mgs per pump okay that's one milliliter thirty three point three three mg milligram per vial per squeeze okay now if pretend this was 33 and you want to drop it down the half obviously you would squeeze half the vial that'll give you 15 point three three or fifteen point something all right so that's how we're able to dosage dosage how much milligram you're getting per content so somebody like me I have lower tolerance I take 15 milligrams I am all good alright I feel it any more than that you might get a little more nosh not nauseous sorry a little more tired a little more relaxed a lot more extra relaxed depending on your your your body weight to the fat ratio okay you like I said there's a talk there's a self learning curve between you and and the product I would start off with 10 to 15 milligrams see how you like it if you want more in the next usage you just you know throw in an extra full squeeze or one and a half squeeze okay however you come figure this out now the different basis of your CBDs here now we're talking specifically bottles dropper bottles here okay there's three types of bases here there's water base which is the one I'm holding right here okay there's PG which is propylene glycol base okay Andrews VG orders actually PG VG alright the water base and the water base and the VG base and the PG base you can actually directly do sublingual under your tongue or your foods or drink okay now the PG VG is all if you if you want to vape these oils in your vape pen okay they have to be a PG or VG base or both is okay PG VG or PG PG alone or VG alone you have to make sure you use a propylene or VG base not water base okay if I take this water base here and drop it into your CBD tanks or your slim tanks and you run that you're gonna get a lot of leakage because remember the solution is so much thinner just gonna seep right through the Cotton's out the breather hose it's gonna get all over your pants or your duffel bag or your backpack wherever you have it it's gonna leak right out okay so I don't recommend putting water base into your tanks only PG or VG base here okay I believe that's it if you guys have any questions comment below we'll get that we'll get back to you guys there if you guys have been using these products you have your suggestions for the audience for this community we're always learning about this stuff this is such a new industry we're still learning here we're trying to teach what we we come across here most of the time please share it with all the communities of CBD users and until next time if you guys like this video please give it a thumbs up and we'll talk to you guys next time have a great day [Music] [Music]", "Bpsp0DZAQwM": "everybody Jennifer Dixon here with Drive yoga and wellness and the thrive hemp store today I want to talk to you about the funky Farms lemon tincture this stuff is awesome there are 500 milligrams of CBD inside each 30 milliliter bottle and guess what folks this is a full-spectrum bottle of CBD oils so that means you're getting all of the plant all of the aerial parts of the plant mix it in together to create a more holistic value into into your CBD supplement so as you can see this is a little bit light for a full spectrum product it looks it's a little bit lighter than some of the full spectrums I've seen and comes in a clear glass bottle for those of you that couldn't see that in case you weren't watching it has a glass dropper that does not have the measurements on it which I I mean I prefer it to have measurements so then I know exactly what we're getting and I am a terrible drop counter so I love to have those lines on there so then I know about how many I'm getting because I'm not gonna sit there and count 15 to 20 drops underneath my tongue who's got time for that and I guess my tongue is just not that sensitive because I always miss a few so the way you you apply it you pull this puppy in and each one one little I guess suction of it fills it - not quite full it's about three-quarters full so I'm gonna assume that that's what their full dropper is one full dropper would give you about 17 milligrams of a full spectrum CBD this is lemon flavored which folks actually taste pretty good for a full spectrum oil this doesn't taste as what's the word folks love to use earthy I actually really like this and you can even smell it even here with the the cap on it but not screwed you can smell the lemon and I love lemon flavored things like almost like a lemon drop so this is a really nicely flavored supplement I've used it off and on for a few weeks now funky farms sent me some samples for us to carry inside the Thrive hem store so I've been using this with some of their other products like by original hemp and so I've been mixing this one in different various times the things that I love about this particular tincture is that it tastes awesome like if you are one of those people that are super averse to the earth scent the earthy flavors of full spectrum CBDs then you will really appreciate the funky farms lemon because it's very light and it's not super thick really natural dirt piney flavor it just tastes kind of like a lemon with a little bit of oil it gets to work pretty quickly usually within 15 to 20 minutes I can feel a difference the one thing about oil is that it it starts to act a lot faster but it also leaves your system a little bit faster than like a capsule so if I use this one like at night it'll help me to fall asleep but I feel like personally the capsules or an edible help me to stay asleep a little bit better this is really great for like during the day it will help to knock the edge off of pain knock the edge off of stress my husband likes to joke and say it makes me nicer yoga and CBD make me nicer folks it'll it'll help make you nicer too this is currently available inside the u.s. it is a I'd say that this is average price maybe a little bit on the higher end of average price the the thing about funky forms that I love is that they are actively trying to make CBD something that it's okay you know CBD is still kind of new to the market there's still a little bit of that ooh what is this in funky farms they have a nice fun branding and it's and it's just making to me it kind of helped to kind of calm down any of those fears that might be with CBD cuz it's like a fun brand fun fun colors it's like a fun name so it's just trying to I feel like they're trying to demystify some of the CBD reputation if you will and create something that is is safe feeling to take because we all know that CBD taking CBD is safe and I love it I take it every single day so let me take it for you guys to see so that maybe you will believe that I absolutely love this stuff I'm going to take a full dropper because my hip is bothering me today you fill up your dropper and then you put it underneath your tongue and you're supposed to wait 30 seconds I'm not gonna make you watch for 30 seconds but I'll hold it for a little it the longer you hold it the faster that it can stay with your cat endocannabinoid system which is right there under it's basically all over your body but it's really close access underneath your tongue which is why they tell you to put it in there and leave it there for about 30 to 60 seconds I'm just gonna leave it in there for a few seconds the one bummer about ingesting a CBD supplement unless it is nano emulsified which you will have to google because I have actually not written a blog post about nano emulsification but it basically is this really cool technology that puts it wraps up the CBD molecules into little bitty fat bubbles that can break make it past all the acids in your belly so that you can make it's a little more effective way of getting the CBD into your system and the other really cool thing about nano emulsification is that it can bust through that blood-brain barrier so you can actually get more CBD into the brain tube so side that was a little rabbit hole for you right rabbit trail we're gonna take this little puppy put it underneath your tongue smile and then feel better in about 15 to 20 minutes so the things to keep in mind when you are supplementing with CBD especially brand new is that when I first started taking it did make me a little sleepy now that I've been taking it for over a year I don't get sleepy anymore I just get chilled like I know the difference between being sleepy and chill before in order to be calm I guess I that was falling asleep so now it helps me to focus it helps me to get calm but if you're new to it it might make you a little sleepy so I would recommend starting out with this at night something cool about funky farms is that this is a full spectrum product that means it has the entire plant all of the terpenes in it and it's a non GMO product and it's this one's vegan friendly and so this is a really nice way this concentration this 500 milligrams is a great concentration to get started with if you're brand new to CBD the price points a little bit easier to get into than some of the higher concentrated products it's very very very mildly flavored I actually like I don't taste any of that earthy flavor that Pope folks talked about so it's a very good flavored funky Farms lemon tincture 500 milligrams 17 milligrams of spectrum CBD in each one milliliter dropper do keep in mind this is a full-spectrum product that means there are trace amounts of THC in it it's not enough to get you high but it is enough to possibly make you fail a drug test now this is very dependent on everybody's body type everybody's metabolism so what I take and what you take if your metabolisms faster than mine then it might not show up but frankly if your jobs on the line I would look for some other options I know that there is we carry a product in the studio green roads they actually advertise non detectable amounts of THC so they actually say that you will not fail the drug test so look around do your research this is a full spectrum I prefer full spectrums I really like it as I throw it up in the air and let me know what you think have you guys tried the funky Farms lemon 500 milligram CBD have you got any other brands

to start out low and gradually work up but if you're not noticing any results it can be tempting to double or even triple a dose in a single day doing this can be counterproductive so make sure you establish a clear dosage plan if you anticipate taking CBD over the long-term it's important to remember that CBD is not a miracle cure don't expect to take a few drops of tincture and voila all your symptoms are gone the effects of CBD oil are not instant and many people make the mistake of using CBD once or twice and then writing it off completely if it doesn't work in terms of where to start with dosing we recommend just starting out with a low potency oil a dose or single serving is pretty universal at one milliliter of oil which is exactly 20 drops so rather than trying a single drop or two of a high potency formula start out with a low potency 200 to 300 milligram bottle take a single one milliliter serving and see how you feel in order to know exactly how many milligrams of CBD you're taking you need to know two things the total CBD content of the bottle and the size of the bottle in milligrams for example let's use a standard 30 milliliter bottle that contains 300 milligrams of CBD total if you take a 1 milliliter dose this would equate to 10 milligrams of CBD the key in deciphering dosage is to stick with how much you're taking for at least a week in other words don't immediately up your dosage if you don't notice any effects at first and give the CBD time to work with the receptors in your body if you still don't notice any effects after about a week then you can start upping the dose however be mindful of the fact that your CBD oils ineffectiveness could just be that you're using a low quality product the manufacturing of CBD oil is still largely unregulated so the amount listed on your bottles labeled could in fact be far from the amount that's actually contained inside also when administering servings remember to put the drops under your tongue and hold for at least 30 seconds before swallowing this will give the CBD ample time to be absorbed into the bloodstream before entering the digestive tract and lastly increased dosages gradually and be patient it could take time for your body to respond to the act of CBD compound so don't get frustrated if a week 2 weeks or even more goes by without noticing much effect also if you have access to a doctor or healthcare professional who's willing to talk to you about CBD be sure to speak with them do you have any input or first-hand experience dosing CBD be sure to share your thoughts with the community by leaving a comment below [Music]", "8AjfOxhmjcM": "how much CBD should I take when starting out with CBD many people want to know what's the best amount of CBD to take it depends on what you want to achieve each person is unique and will experience different effects CBD takes time to build in the body much like some vitamins you can take a small amount every day well you might not notice an immediate effect over time you should begin to detect more balanced calm and peace of mind in your life some people may notice a more extreme difference than others imagine someone who is deficient in vitamin C taking a vitamin C supplement will create a radical change in their health CBD is similar to a vitamin and that it helps to maintain and support overall health if your endocannabinoid system is depleted or imbalanced taking CBD could produce tremendous changes more quickly than someone who has a healthy endocannabinoid tone if you're already healthy CBD may not be noticeable right away what your friends may take a high amount of CBD and notice immediate changes you may not need the same amount the following is a general guideline a good way to start is with the mild range take the amount recommended for your weight not feeling anything within the mild range if mild doesn't work for you it could be good to reach for a higher dosage and try out the medium range go for the high dosage if you haven't noticed any changes in the medium range some people take more than 100 milligrams of CBD each day it all depends on your health and your body experiment to find out what works best for you how often should I take CBD there are three main schedules that people use to take CBD once or twice per day every two to three hours so that they feel the effects throughout the day and hourly micro dosing for CBD oil we recommend starting with one quarter drop daily during the first week moving up to one half a dropper during the second week three quarters of a dropper during the third week and a full dropper on the fourth week for CBD balm it's suggested to apply a healthy amount to the area where you are experiencing pain dryness or stiffness every six hours for vaping CBD you should start with three normal inhales and wait 30 minutes to fully feel the effects until inhaling more for edibles and soft gels start with one shoe or one capsule every 12 hours so what is the right amount of CBD to take there's a few key points to remember when you're determining the right amount of CBD to take remember to start slow and work your way up there is no right amount of CVD to take each person is different you can use our chart as a starting guide until you figure out what works best for you enjoy the process and the wonderful calm and peace that CBD can bring into your life [Music]", "ngWuODwllSs": "[Music] each CBD product that we carry comes with a standardized dosage the dosage of CBD for the oil that we carry is twenty milligrams per ml for a hundred and fifty pound person the daily dose of CBD is basically twenty milligrams or one full dropper inside this bottle is a glass dropper with a line indicating the ml or CC mark so it says milliliter that milliliter mark indicates that's the 20 milligram dosage and for anybody who weighs more than 150 pounds you can adjust the dosage upward [Music] you", "t1IDW45TEgk": "all right what's going on guys set here back at it again with another video and today in this video I wanted to do a review on this CBD oil right here in this cannabidiol or broad spectrum hemp extract that I've been using here for the last few weeks and so this is from a company called Manitoba harvest all right so this is broad spectrum and I've been using it like I said for the last few weeks and tracking my deep sleep with my word ring also suggests objectively speaking and yeah taking a few droppers of this before bed my sleep the last few weeks especially my deep sleep has been very very good I've been getting over about two hours and 30 minutes of deep sleep which is almost every night for the last few weeks and my sleep has been really tremendous so yeah I really haven't tried to be honest too many CBD products I know that for the most part just hearing all about the benefits and how a lot of professional athletes especially like in the PGA Tour and the MLB they use CBD to be able to get better sleep at night to be able to wake up with more energy lower inflammation really just help you tap into that parasympathetic state the rest and digest and so forth so I figured I'd give it it give it a shot and so yeah taking the CBD it just I felt really relaxed I like to take it well I have been taking it in the evenings so when I get back from the gym I'll just take it after dinner that's generally the the timing that I use and then yeah it just it puts you in a really good mood I've noticed and this so this looks like it's co2 extracted and this this company I had a lot of really great reviews I got it from thrive market and you can actually get an additional 25% off your first purchase and they're a really cool membership website actually have on their site it's like Amazon meets Whole Foods where they ship you all your groceries straight to your door free of charge and it just shows up and you just yeah you don't have to go to the grocery store or anything so that's make sure you go ahead and check that out and anything they sell everything is organic you know has ton of different tremendous values and so forth so I love thrive market but that's where I pick this up so yeah overall taking the CBD you know it's pretty pricey but I think that it's you know maybe just taking it on the days that you really need to make sure that you're recovering from your workouts if you're really getting after it with the weights maybe you're playing a sport or something like that I definitely say give it a shot so yeah if you have if you have tried CBD I'll definitely let me know down in the comments section just what your experiences are I'm really curious to know what you guys have to say in regards to that but yeah with that being said guys thanks for

is the highest concentration of really any product that we actually make here at ambery Gardens but is also the highest concentration in our full spectrum daily line now these are internally taking products you would either put on a spoon to drink down or put under the tongue and this particular one has 5,000 milligrams of CBD in the bottle if you were to take it in the amounts written right here you would have 84 milligrams of CBD per press we'll get into a little further details of how these breakdowns work here in just a little bit this is an MCT coconut oil version of our product which means you're getting a long-lasting and natural breakdown of CBD over time this is perfect for individuals that have been told by their doctor to find a larger amount of CBD we find some people as well coming to us that are addressing more severe health challenges and are wanting to take a larger amount of CBD as well everybody is different and some people's bodies require just a simply larger amount of CBD per day so if you are looking for the breakdown of this product on our website go ahead and head to the description tab of this particular product and you'll be able to find a written version of this breakdown there but let's go ahead and go into that here for you now in our dosage scale we have two units of measurement we like to use and let's go ahead and establish those now the first one we have is a dropper which is the amount you're gonna see written right here on the side in this particular bottle that is getting you 84 milligrams of CBD to get that amount we're gonna go ahead and start from a completely empty dropper so we'll just kind of press all that out of there press down as hard as we can on the top of that dropper making sure everything gets pressed in push this down in and let it go and we'll get this exact measured amount of oil that we're looking for okay now in this particular version once again that is 84 milligrams of CBD that's in a pretty small amount of oil which is why it's so dark like that it's a very highly concentrated form in this guy now if we wanted to break that down further we like to do that in drops to get a drop you just need to give a slow small amount of pressure allowing for that to form and fall giving a little bit in between each one so we can really make sure that we're consistent okay now in this particular one here one drop is going to be worth about one point eight six milligrams of CVD so one drop is actually worth a pretty you know a consistent and solid dose in in a product like this three drops is going to be getting you about five milligrams of CBD so one two three that was five milligrams right there and if we were wanting to get ten milligrams we would do six drops and for this bottle about 20 milligrams of CBD you can get from 12 full drops of oil now this particular product once again we have a lot of people coming to us with more advanced health challenges their doctors have recommended them to get a larger amount of CBD this is the product that we turn to we also have some folks that are wanting to maintain a consistent daily dose but at a lower amount of oil so you could maintain something like that with this product it has a very long shelf life looking at two years on this guy so you'd really be able to keep it in a cold dark place for a very long time to keep a consistent daily dose of CBD in a smaller capacity like that once again the 5000 milligram of our full-spectrum daily oil 84 milligrams of CBD per press so if you have any questions about this or

the difference between our root oil and our heart oil now the heart comes in right now we have it in orange lemon and no flavor 30 milligram bottles also a part of our sample pack which you can see here and then we also have the so we have the root extract in right now we just had our new bottle put together there's the the the root extract and so the difference between the two is really just at the concentration so both of which are made out of PCR fight a cannabinoid rich hemp oil extract or hemp extract and coconut oil and it's just a matter of the concentration of the you know the mixture of the two so we'll start with the heart which is our you know the first hemp extract the oil that we came out with so the heart has and both of these this is all based on one milliliter and in one milliliter you've got 940 milligrams of fat it can have annoyed rich hemp extract and coconut oil so with the heart you've got a total of 20 milligrams of that hip extract you know that have extract based on the analytical that we received 17 milligrams is cannabadiol point 2 milligrams is kin of the different and then the rest are terpenes 3 point 8 milligrams and those are what they believe enhance the benefits of cannabinoids so to get the remainder of the balance of that 940 milligrams you've got 20 total milligrams of fighting cannabinoid rich help extract mixed with 920 milligrams of coconut oil so that's really good shows benefits for people taking you know for daily maintenance of anxiety some osteo arthritis joint pain we right now we recommend you take about one point five milliliters total per day of the heart now the room which we blended designed on our own based on feedback from customers is really one of the highest concentrations of PCR hemp extract with coconut coconut oil out on the market that I've seen so it one milliliter of our root which is our flagship to maintaining a functional healthy balanced body you've got out of this 940 milligrams there's 205 milligrams of fight a cannabinoid rich hemp extract it in there so based on the analytical that's a hundred seventy milligrams of CBD per milliliter two milligrams of Canepa different per milliliter and then 33 milligrams of terpenes per milliliter leaving 735 milligrams of coconut oil homogenized with the PCR so the whole the whole premise behind the root is really more for the if you've tried the heart and maybe you needed that extra kick a little extra benefit that's where it comes in but all of which you know whether it's the heart of the room it's gonna help you as you know it's an anti-inflammatory anti-anxiety increase focus great on bone and joint relief and all of this information is posted online as far as our data sheets product datasheets what is in our hemp extracts what

are not 18 years old please exit the video but if you are 18 years old then welcome to my bedroom now I know in a lot of videos I'm like making them in different areas we'll just bear with me because I'm very spontaneous when I record so I like to record in a lot of different areas as you can see I was just playing my xbox one if anybody has an Xbox one and they want a game out put your comment below now let's move on so we are reviewing koi naturals CBD oil now I know what you're thinking oh this is the stuff that goes on your tongue and you can put it in a vape no stop right there people you cannot put this in a vape this is for your digestive system only okay let's reiterate this digestive system mouth orally only not Lumley orally alright now that we clarified that I would test some but this is pretty much empty I used this for years and of course that just goes to show this is a definitely childproof cap child definitely proof cap which is another thing I like about this company not a lot of stores sell these so if they do then you're in luck I actually had to order this bad boy online okay so this is 250 milligrams they go all the way up to like a thousand milligrams if not more I don't know I don't need to be overdosing on this kind of stuff but you know so child proof proof lock cap definitely a plus but other than that let's talk about the product so positives of this childproof cap I'm sorry I keep stressing that but I'm not about to stress it enough childproof caps are the way to go people I do not know a lot of things that have childproof caps nowadays and your kids can get into them like what's going on with that this stuff can be digestible but not to kids so we need to make a petition to start having more childproof caps and they're like oh you got to be responsible parent you know what kids can get into anything so shout out to the moms and dads with kids that are watching this video moving on koi naturals has great tasting stuff there's a lot of CBD oil out there that you taste it you kind of get this like a waxy slimy feel and it almost tastes like your how do I put it like you're eating like some sort of like starburst now I know starbursts are juicy and they're delicious and wonderful and hey what am I talking about what I'm talking about is that kind of feeling that you get I'm not sure how to describe it I don't know I've always felt starbursts to be chalky so anyway moving on it does not give you a really bad taste in your mouth this flavor is lemon-lime clay natural I have to say hands down not only tastes good but I wish I could compare we'll do that in another video it's so it's so like liquidy and this costed like $40 you walk into a shop and I guarantee a bottle this side is gonna easily cost you like a hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars excuse me it's very amazing it's cheap it's childproof cap it's honestly I couldn't have asked for about our CBD oil so the the directions of it and let's just let's just put it down here when you look on the back of CBD oil and look on the back of all these seedy BD products there's so many different chemicals that go into it and the reason why I say chemicals is yes I believe that they're natural and you know they can help you better than like vicodin or something like that abso-freakin'-lutely Viking it this stuff is not gonna make a make you addicted to it and be make you like hallucinate or drugged so I absolutely say go with CBD if you're in pain or anything along those lines over taking a vicodin or something this stuff helps you with pain headaches anything that you wanted to that involves your body now as I was saying the ingredients on this bottle full-spectrum candid can I bid all the hi spell it I spent it is that how you sound it canada Badal blend natural lemon line extract in coconut oil that is it people that is all they put in this full spectrum can above Badal be dial the dial but little blend natural lemon lime extract in coconut oil that's it I literally have done this is my third review and this has the littlest amount of ingredient in it in everything that I have been reviewing and you ingest this so it's great childproof lock the consistency goes down very smoothly I don't know if anybody else has tried CBD but usually the consistency is thick it's it's thick it doesn't taste good it take it leaves like a really gross feeling in your mouth but this does not only do the job and it makes the pain go away the headaches the muscle aches and it definitely comes your head calms your mind just remember to take it in the appropriate amount of doses okay now the negatives I rate this 5 out of 5 stars there is no negatives to this coy Naturals is exactly koi Naturals it is amazing it tastes great it does great and they have so many different milligrams to choose from please if you're thinking about or if you are in pain if you have headaches if you're having Sayyidi anything please pick up a bottle of this because I guarantee you with my life that this is gonna do the job but make sure that you get the appropriate amount of milligrams okay alright well thank you so much for tuning in like I said if you have any questions drop them in the comments below and on top of that you know subscribe if you liked the video you liked the content you liked me subscribe if you didn't like it give it a thumbs down but I can honestly say that I'd be I'd be pretty sad okay but anyway thank you so much for tuning in on my third video and everybody have a nice amazing weekend gay yay", "daruvRCWN3A": "today's review and lab test are on medterra's 1 000 milligram broad spectrum tincture strawberry mint flavor they uh now call this ultra broad spectrum i've tested a few med terra products in the past they were one of the first to go nationwide in cvs stores they're best known for having thc free products and my lab tests and reviews have showed they have squeaky clean thc free cbd products this is the brand that i recommend most for people that have to take drug tests because you're not going to get confused they don't even make thc products matera's out of laguna hills california remember that show laguna hills was it laguna beach a bunch of rich kids meh you're not missing much but despite being out of a rich kid town in california they're actually well priced however you guys know i'm not really a fan of broad spectrum products most of the ones i've tested in the past have had very few cannabinoids if any extra cannabinoids at all usually they're just cbd some of them have even had trace amounts of thc in them is medterra going to change my mind we're going to go over the lab test the cost breakdown the strength breakdown my taste test and what i think about this product starting right about now my name is jeremy roscoe and i spent a decade as a professional firefighter with a baby face but my real dream was to grow a beard and become the greatest cbd reviewer the world has ever seen now i have a beard and review more cbd products than anyone ever no more baby face i send every cbd product to two independent labs to see what's real disclaimer this is not medical advice visit cbdxamen.com for official lab tests and more please like share and subscribe to support these free lab tests and cbd videos enjoy medterra claims for sixty dollars you get one thousand milligrams of total cannabinoids but let's see what the labs say all right 1 000 milligrams claimed in lab a found about 13 more b score lab b found about 23 more c score but this is for total cannabinoids labs tests for different cannabinoids they have different testing methodologies and minimums so a b and c score is actually okay here official lab tests are here let's see the cannabinoids and is it a real broad spectrum over a thousand milligrams of cbd and shocker oh my goodness we have cbc and cbg here we're gonna break that down in a second and most importantly the entire bottle has zero thc and if medterra would have specified 1 000 milligrams of cbd instead of total cannabinoids total cannabinoids are harder to measure they would have been right on the money here a score with just what 9.2 percent more here all right let's see the cost breakdown per milligram 5.5 cents per milligram of cbd that's an excellent value for broad spectrums which are usually about 10 cents per milligram according to my 2020 analysis but can you really put a price on broad spectrums when most of the broad spectrums that i've tested have had almost no rare cannabinoids either no rare cannabinoids or amounts so low that this rare cannabinoid cost skyrockets the taste the taste is strawberry mint it's good yeah this this tastes great just tastes like strawberry mint gum or something uh it has other cannabinoids and terpenes but you don't taste the hemp taste at all which is fantastic the ingredients are just the broad spectrum hemp extract the mct oil from coconut oil and natural flavors their new update on their website for the ultra broad spectrum says it's all organic which is nice and i have no complaints about the oil it's got a light viscosity it's clear goes down really easy doesn't leave much residue in your mouth it and it tastes good so that's a plus the bottle super nice the milliliter dropper is labeled so you can take less or more the label on the bottle looks super nice it's got a little made in america non-gmo organically grown they got a us hemp authority uh certificate on the front and if you move the uh bottle in the light there you can see a little shiny broad spectrum white on white text it's uh really nice the box is really nice as well okay let's see the milliliter breakdown now medterra claims to have 33 milligrams of total cannabinoids per milliliter serving here lab a found 37.59 milligrams of total cannabinoids and that includes over 36 milligrams of cbd that's great if you thought you were getting 33 milligrams of cbd most importantly zero milligrams of thc and about 0.4 milligrams of cbc and cbg both labs show and also over 0.2 milligrams 0.20 milligrams of cbn now this this right here the other cannabinoids most other broads but all the other broad spectrums that i've tested either have had no other cannabinoids or trace levels so low like .04 milligrams like the cbl here just a trace level that basically adds nothing lab b doesn't even show that there this has 10 times that amount with about 0.40 milligrams of the cbc and cbg which is which is great now don't get me wrong some of the full spectrums are several times stronger than this they'll have instead of .40 milligrams of cbc and cbg they'll have like 1.2 milligrams the really strong ones but this may still add some medicinal value to the cbd this is actually more cbc in cbg than a lot of the full spectrums that i test i can't tell you if this is actually going to add to the medicinal benefits of cbd having .40 milligrams of cbc and cbg i mean it might i've had full spectrums with seemingly low amounts of other cannabinoids and they seem to be a lot stronger than just the cbd alone but everybody's different everyone's in the cannabinoid system and absorption rates are different so that's gonna depend on you now the 36 milligrams of cbd is a large dose up to 40 milligrams of cbd a lot of products start off at 5 milligrams they go up to 50 milligrams some of them go up way higher research uses a lot more you're just going gonna need to try cbd out and see how it affects you and how these other cannabinoids affect you personally okay that's it that's my review i'm still super impressed this broad spectrum is actually a real broad spectrum the first real good broad spectrum that i've tested it tasted super good it's from a reliable company that's it i will see you next time you wonderful person you thanks for watching please subscribe and like this video if you want to support these free lab tests

sit here and smoke my vape pen and there's like one of the handlers they have a thing where they have a velociraptors I get person into costume but it's again i'ma try to cost ya and they're pretending to be like a velociraptor and the the trainers like trying to calm him down it's a whole display with the kids and everyone's really excited so I'm just like how I watching it like getting stone zoning out and at one point the girls got like one of those you know microphone face pieces on she just goes she goes sir not here and that was it I went up and then I just sir not here fade it off yeah I know I wonder if they're cooler about it now now this is a year ago oh there's not that long ago Wow I was very surprised I was like this is California well not only that would it would if it was a vape pen with tobacco or CBD or are you allowed to do that probably not I think they're smoking areas that are designated but she knew what it was she saw my face my mouth was a gape watching real velociraptors walking around I was losing my mind it was all dude like get out of here stoner yeah that was listening to the radio in Utah and they were talking about how they have to re they have to figure out what to do with their drug sniffing dogs now cuz there's no reason it must be some is there a change in Utah as Utah changing their their drug policy because it was funny that's listening to this old dude on just for the for the [ __ ] of it I was listening the AM radio rock radio and this old dude was talking about how they they're gonna decommission some of these drug sniffing dogs because they'd use him on like traffic stops there we go medical marijuana in Utah could mean retirement for generation of drug canines just [ __ ] putting these dogs down well they also were worried about the police officers themselves losing jobs you when you hear about pot that's making its way into a place like Utah you know first of all you realize goddamn pot is really you can't stop it's here the genies out of the bottle it's here the revenues and Grandma feels better ya know the alzheimer the people that have all these serious issues that CBD is fixing brightest patients people with like real problems that are not finding any other solution that works the way cannabis does they just give it in and then they're making all this money but then you see these old folks that are from a different time and they're talking about it and they they look at it in terms of like how many police jobs are gonna go away bright how many dogs are gonna be one of them smoke weed so they're like it's not really my problem and interesting to watch them look at it as an economic issue the problem is you have pot heads that are leading the charge so it's it for a long time it was difficult to take him serious yeah you needed straight-laced guys to come in and you know there's a lot of money there there's so much money in it that you're getting that but when you have [ __ ] hippies playing hacky sack and you know you know weren't puka-shell necklace is is sort of hard to take them seriously when the reality is they kind of want to be legalized for recreational purposes and you know yeah I don't like for I don't I don't use we SS doesn't try to I do take CBD I did literally during that fight I was using topical CBD the whole time so I guess you take whirl - I do I take CBD excellent daily but I don't know infinite CBD sponsors are our podcast and great festivals well they're also I'll get you a bunch of products is there a really great company that supports comedy they sponsored my tour when I was prepare for my special they're [ __ ] dope but I take it daily I take the the oil just because you know apparently all of the the benefits that it has with getting your body back into homeostasis and making you feel better and getting back in line I don't know the [ __ ] effects I smoke weed every day as well so I'm sure i'm getting CBD effects as well but in my mind I'm going to I have a bunch of this stuff I know that since I started taking it i weirdly feel better but i can't really connect you said before you take CBD and you go into another realm well I was taking one and one it's like one gram of CBD - one gram of THC like it's it's one part well so whatever milligrams you have it's Bo like it's ten milligrams CBD it's ten milligrams we as well its Pope yeah I take regular CBD too though I take oil I feel like it's it's very beneficial and much more potent in terms of its anti-inflammatory benefits then just smoking it smoking it does something for you definitely reduces inflammation makes you feel better I was taking sore joints a topical I was using topical is good too but I think the real combination is topical plus the oil you don't have to say but people a lot of people find that they have better pain relief from one versus one plus one like one part THC one part so it's like edible like you know marijuana mixed with CBD a lot of people find great benefit in that for some reason yeah I had a trick my aunt because my aunt so anti drugs and if I told her that CBD was derived from hemp shoot she wouldn't take it was just bad arthritis and I gave it to her for for that and she loves it and I told her after the fact but it's grabbing dude it's just a plant folks and if you just get straight CBD it has no psychoactive properties there's no it's not gonna the only thing it's gonna do is for some folks and it works a little bit left wave with me it alleviates some anxiety just relaxes you yeah yeah that's uh that's why I smoke weed - yeah I smile and I've been arrested probably ten times in my life and every time was for smoking a joint in the street every single time dude the arrested they take you in yeah New York Turkey [ __ ] cell it's crazy still there still do the last time I was put into a cell for smoking weed was a year and a half ago me and Dave Smith two years ago maybe me and you tell me you were Lewis J Gomez guy told me Louis calm eyes that's when I start using the middle in - I was like you know what it's problems election [ __ ] Lewis Gomez's must have rap sheets doggy every time I come back into the country I'm pulled into a room and they [ __ ] they look like they're about to fist [ __ ] me with a rubber glove every time have you been to Panama honey ton recently sir yes come right this way every single any time Bolivia sir but yet dude when in New York City the way it works is you its dude it sucks it's happened so many times it's the worst because it's just a major inconvenience you know pay me ask to get into Canada I can do it now cuz they changed the laws but I didn't go to Canada for like three years because of weed for being arrested for a joint we're not talking about like I have an ounce that I just bought from my dealer and they found a large amount on me a joint smoking on the street what they do is they they at first they they take the weed and they go all right we're gonna give you a ticket just hang tight relax we're gonna put cuffs on you this is just keep you calm and just to [ __ ] get you in the paddy wagon this is all a process then they put you in a paddy wagon they used to have sweet nights in New York where all it was was they would go and try to find kids smoking weed kid drunk kids college kids pissing in public public intoxication and the entire night they would just pick up everybody and fill up paddy wagons and create criminals just create criminals out of teenagers you know kitten they were targeted that's why the stop and frisk law has happened in New York they changed it because they were just targeting black and Hispanic kids", "pRQQqKUyIro": "[Music] hello my name is Jennifer Dixon with the green valley nation and today I want to give you a really quick review on the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD this is a highly concentrated product that claims to be great for sports recovery folks suffering from anxiety issues and insomnia and sleep related issues Charlotte's Web grows and processes all of their hemp in Colorado they use organic non-gmo and vegan friendly products to make a full spectrum CBD using co2 extraction methods the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD comes in chocolate mint flavor it has 60 milligrams of CBD per each suggested serving size of one milliliter there are two current sizes which are 30 milliliter and 100 milliliter which gives you at least in this bottle eighteen hundred milligrams and then in the 100 milliliter bottle it gives you 6,000 milligrams of CBD because this is a full-spectrum product there is a little bit of THC in it but it's less than 0.3 percent and so it won't get you high let's talk about the packaging on the outside of both the box and the bottle is a picture of the Rocky Mountains a kind of tribute to where they are located and on the outside of the box is a QR code it's on the bottom right hand side that you can scan and get the analysis and the information about the particular product you'll find that each bottle inside of the box is individually wrapped with cellophane so that you know that it's new and that it has the ingredients and it has the suggested serving size of one milliliter because this is a full spectrum oil you'll notice that it is a little bit darker and greener in color than an ISIL it might be that also means that the flavor is going to be a little stronger now Charlotte's Web does use a chocolate mint flavor in this product but that doesn't necessarily mean it covers up all of the flavors let's try it you're gonna put it underneath your tongue and you want to hold it for at least 30 to 60 seconds the first thing that you're gonna notice after taking this product is that even though it is supposed to be chocolate mint flavored it doesn't taste super chocolaty just a little bit minty you're gonna still taste the plant it's a it's a full spectrum product so it definitely has that plant flavor to it however within 15 minutes you're gonna notice that you're calmer that you can focus a little better and that if you have any residual pain because it's so concentrated this stuff knocks it out pretty well now for me I'm very sensitive and I react very very quickly and strongly to CBD so I don't need very much I use like a few drops maybe a quarter of a dropper full and that will last me all day for you if you are a little less sensitive to it or you are dealing with a higher amount of anxiety or pain you might have to use the full suggested serving size of one milliliter and it may not last you all day you might have to take this every four to six hours it really just depends on how your body reacts and responds to it and then how quickly it metabolizes the CBD you can also find that when you take this before bed it'll help you to relax and go to sleep I find that when I take it before sleeping it puts me to bed like that and then I can sleep the whole night which is glorious let's talk value here this is considered a premium product so it is definitely on the higher end of the price spectrum if this is not something that you're generally as concerned about then it's a perfect product for you however if you live on a pretty tight budget this could be a difficult addition to your daily routine if flavor is also a big thing for you this might not be the best option because it definitely does still have a strong earthy plant flavor there is a hint of but if you're very sensitive to taste in flavors then I would definitely not recommend this product for you overall I really do like the the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD oil it does what it says it's supposed to do help you to relax it definitely helps me to sleep and it definitely does help to manage my aches and pains I can't recommend it if you are looking for something that is on a budget because this is a little bit more on the higher end of the spectrum but it is a great product high quality every single time I take it it's the exact same and if you're not as sensitive to flavors it's going to get the job done pretty quickly because it's so concentrated so you might not need as much thank you so much for taking the time to watch this review once again my name is Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation and if you liked it make sure you subscribe to this channel for the most comprehensive library of hemp products thanks again see you soon bye bye [Music]", "G6SEKfH2H7M": "okay so I'm with my boyfriend Paul and we both just started taking CBD oil so Paul is starting a channel with the channel gonna be called smarter than your doctor well originally I started taking CBD oil a little over a year ago and mmm when I started taking it I really didn't know anything about it and the dosage I was taking was what was on the bottle I was getting like three point three milligrams of CBD per dose and it literally was doing nothing well I've had numerous years of like long-term chronic illness things several different things and one of those things was hyperparathyroidism and that's a huge issue all in itself so I don't want to go into the details of that but basically the things that I'm dealing with currently our body aches and pains headaches really bad headaches long-term headaches and massive fatigue and somehow about a month or so ago I stumbled across I was I was looking at YouTube videos and I stumbled across a YouTube video that was talking about headaches and CBD oil so I started you know diving into that real hard and I go okay headaches how do I know how much CBD oil I should be taking for a headache well I found one particular site that gave a listing of several different illnesses conditions whatever you want to call them and headaches was in the list and they say for headaches you really need at least two point five milligrams to twenty milligrams I'm sorry micrograms of CBD oil I got a look again in milligrams yeah okay its milligrams anyhow so I said oh no I'm yeah we have to make sure we have all our information straight so I I said okay up to 20 milligrams I said okay and I had already looked at some other videos about how much people were taking for certain other types of things and they were taking like 50 milligrams or 100 milligrams I'm going man that seems like a lot compared to about 3.3 whoa I remembered something I learned a long time ago about people who deal in supplements and so on and they they just cut their dosages down so dramatically to keep from ever having a legal issue well so then you go out have to go out on your own to find out what you really need to be taking it may be the products good enough but you're just not taking enough of the product so the first time I had a reasonably good effect from CBD oil I had to take six doses of the oil that I had and that was something my dad bought for me over a year ago and I took 20 milligrams and I'm telling you in about five minutes I became so much more relaxed and my headaches started going away and I was literally amazed at how I was feeling and that made we dive into a whole lot more study about CBD oil and that's why I started taking it I mean I'm taking it for several other reasons you know for the fatigue for the body aches and pains but it's been a good couple of weeks now that I've been on a regimen of approximately 50 milligrams in the morning and fifty milligrams in the evening and I'm starting to you know show very significant the signs of feeling them tons better not just kind of better like way better I'm not expecting it to be a miracle because I realized my endocannabinoid system has been very neglected for many many years and so that that's another thing that if you're seriously interested in CBD oil is you really need to learn about what the endocannabinoid system is in your body so endo stands for endogenous which means it's inside of you already this is a system that God gave you and cannabinoid is the chemical which operates between different areas of your body and this is it's as pretty new medicine like they didn't really start learning about this until the 1990s they knew about it before but not really how it worked because we have so much more medical technology now you know okay I'm probably going further than you wanted me to go but like what Brandon okay what I'm taking is Lazarus Naturals you can go there Lazarus Naturals calm I'm not doing a commercial for them I don't get paid by them at all the reason I'm telling you as the millions of people looking on YouTube is I did the research on exactly what you should be getting from a from a CBD oil and Lazarus Naturals happens to be one of the companies that makes the CBD oil actually they grow their own plants too which is a big deal so they see the process from beginning to end and there are other far more expensive quality I mean they are top quality of CBD oils but they're cost prohibitive I mean you'll start to learn that very quickly if you're you know needing this saying you know you really want to use this well mmm it's not like going and buying a high high priced medication but it is like you need to shop and I can tell ya I mean if somebody else has another place to go that has quality CBD oil for a really reasonable price another thing actually Lazarus Naturals has a discount program for people who are veterans what are the other two things veterans low income and yeah there was one more thing anyhow that's that was another reason that I mean literally I was paying less than half of what some other companies were charging for the same thing and if you start doing your research the thing you have to be careful of is everybody who sells something tends to get into the hype of their own product and the things that really matter in this case are the CBD oil itself and I can't say that you shouldn't try others because maybe there's certain things that work will work better with your system I'm just telling you this is the one that I I came to that I said okay this is the one I'm gonna start with I can afford it and I probably will try some others down the road I just think you know for most people medicine should be affordable and we're not even really at this point for most people even in the medical community they're not calling it a medicine they're really thinking of it as a supplement and there are groups who consider it food which if you think about it it is a food but it happens to be a food with a great supplement to it you're taking the high potency 50 milligrams one milliliter you've got the biggest bottle right how many the bottle that I got is a hundred and twenty milliliters six thousand milligrams in the entire bottle so that turns out when you divide out you know per milliliter that puts fifty milligrams per milliliter so a milliliters a thousand milligrams so you want 50 million yep 50 50 mil milligrams of CBD oil is in 1,000 milligrams of the oil that's in you know 1000 milligram is a milliliter I hope I'm not confusing you you know so 50 milligrams for an adult is a very reasonable dose but people should really start slow because of what happened to me I did it too high I wasn't expecting if I had been at work and taking such a huge dose you know right yeah it's a much smarter to start with a low wind dose maybe you know 0.25 milliliters which would get you 12 and 1/2 milligrams of CBD oil I think that's a really good way to start you might not notice anything on a dose that's small and the bottom line is your body needs this like really bad because we're not getting food that has the CBD oil that chemical manat getting the food that has that for our endocannabinoid system to be working functioning it at top you know top level so oh go ahead oh okay I wouldn't have to say as far as taste goes I mean because I actually smoked pot before it tastes the way pot smells at least that person at that particular product yeah this product that I'm using right now and you know it's it's not a bothersome flavor at all you know you get used to it your full spectrum I'm definitely on the full spectrum which basically means that you're getting like the per that there there are laws for how how CBD oil is made and CBD oil it has to have less than okay so CBD oil is is made under legal restrictions so the the allowed amount of THC in the CBD oil has to be less than 3 or 0.3 percent so if you basically 0.3% is three milligrams was that what we ended up with three milligrams per yeah three milligrams per thousand I think I'm know I'm getting confused I gotta go look up my you might have to redo this part because I got it I gotta get that the math straight in my head so people have to be careful of they're taking the full spectrum because some because some places they'll say oh you won't fill a drug test but there's plenty of videos where people say they were shocked because they fail to work drug test you know random drug test for work base because they were taking the full spectrum right right yeah to two issues here one is drug testing you may and you may not pass a drug tests taking this they the people that I trust the most say that if you've got to take a drug test then you need to be off it for like 10 days and then you won't have a trace I mean that's that really tells you a story right there is it's really low THC content if it only takes ten days for it to be out of your system the other issue is how THC affects you personally and that that's a really big deal to pay attention to and then one of the reasons I suggest people start low because my girlfriend Joanne sweetest lady on the planet is sensitive to the THC and got baked on a couple of normal doses they were 250 those those are normal dose like but it was really so it kind of was the equivalent of a hundred milligrams right typical right so so hundred milligrams for Joanne really gave her enough CBD oil which really relaxes you and THC which has the psychotropic effect mmm so she was feeling pretty darn good and there's a reason the reason it happened is cuz she didn't she didn't feel like she was getting anything from the first dose well we actually learned later that it takes about an hour to two hours to really feel the full effects of the CBD oil and that's something you really need to pay attention to just don't just dive into this you know take it you know be mindful of what you're doing and maybe even take notes of how much you took what you're what you felt and so on and so forth because most people nowadays most of the companies that I look at are saying forty to fifty milligrams for an adult is a good normal sized dose and then there are you know serious step ups for for people that really need more they say okay if you weighed 200 pounds then you cut your weight in half and you want so that would be a hundred then a dose for somebody who's really needing a lot more should be a hundred milligrams so in my case with what I'm taking it would be 2 milliliters to get a hundred milligrams I haven't no I did I went to that level one time but basically it was like oh the other thing is like if you know if you only wait like 20 minutes and think oh it's not doing anything that's that was the little issue that we had Joanne if she didn't feel anything because you know if you ever smoked marijuana before you get hit with that pretty quick like within just a couple of minutes you start feeling a pretty good buzz smoking marijuana well this is not the same you know system okay because when you when you inhale and stuff gets into your lungs it's getting into your bloodstream very very quickly if you're taking stuff sublingual wooly and then swallowing it you know some of that's going through your stomach so no that's going through your mouth and it takes that much longer for it takes that much longer for the chemicals to get into your your system so in in conclusion to this video I want YouTube viewers to know where they can find your channel what is your channel gonna be called you we're gonna create it for you today so what do you think we're probably gonna name okay so we're gonna name the channel smarter than your doctor and I know that sounds terribly arrogant but here's here's what it's really about okay your doctor is a doctor right and probably trying to help you with certain issues that you're dealing with well your doctor might not be the specialist in that area so the people that we are and the research that we're going after is just so far beyond what it's even possible for your doctor to do as a regular doctor he just you know he she whomever it is just doesn't have the time to dive that deeply into all these issues so smarter than your doctor really is just getting to the information that is available to help people with a multitude of different and we're talking barely major medical issues that they haven't been able to get a better understanding of from their doctor a better direction better medication and and we will tell you this here the majority of what we are helping people with is using things that are on the natural end if somebody has to have a regular prescribed medication then yeah they have to have that we're not seeing that and we're also not seeing that there is a cure we're saying what their what this is is what other people have had success with what these what this major yeah what these major research groups have done and found and you know I've actually done a lot of this on my own and shared stuff with my doctor who happened to be very open to hearing because her her specialty is anti-aging and what I've told her certain things about what I was doing you know one of them being natto which is a Japanese food and I told her how it was helping me dramatically for my blood pressure she had actually already studied that a little bit and said wow I have actually thought about prescribing natto for my clients well anti-aging that would be huge because Japanese women have the best skin in the world and this is the you know this is the this is the natural food that they eat every day for breakfast so any of them okay I think I think I hammered that right there no I'm just I'm really excited to get some feedback from people and you know let's let's keep this all on the on the high level here you know and help each other out if you've got something that you feel is you know definitely been working for you then let's share it you know let's help people get well there's there's just an amazingly huge number of people who have you know issues and it could be cancer it could be fatigue what's that thing called the muscle no well no yeah but that's in there but a lot of people are getting diagnosed with fibromyalgia which is a really difficult one because it's the doctors saying basically well you've got all these symptoms we don't know what they are we don't know what's causing it one of the things we're starting to realize though is the endocannabinoid system probably has a lot to do with how people are not getting like what they need in excuse me in order to take care of their fibromyalgia symptoms so anyhow thank you so check it out Paul's channel and thanks for watching", "NtFSeWNJCHg": "so our full spectrum that CBD and hemp tincture is the baseline for everything I use I use this in the morning and in the evening I personally do the thousand milligrams so one dropper full is about 33 like what does that even mean half in the morning is somewhere around 16 milligrams and in the evening why because I like to start my day and ease into it knowing that I'm giving my body what it needs to be stress-free and in the evening of course that's part of my relaxing and going to bed regimen but this hemp in here started on our farm again with our family of farmers and it's full spectrum it's the whole thing in here so this is just what I do like a little half drop like that under the tongue hold it there over there for like 15 20 seconds and then swallow what's left over and baseline yeah I use it as a baseline every single day I wouldn't travel without it and I just add lots of other things to it", "6eBAMdTeuIY": "let's talk about CBD but this time I got the high doses you gotta check these out I got the 300 and I got the 500s let's go what's up guys that your boy big J coming back at you again from Vaiko TV where you watched aside and vape and like I said earlier I've got the big boy doses now I've got CBD FX but I've got it in 300 milligrams and they're brand new 500 milligrams all right this this right here rashia is for those of you that may be a little further along as far as you know you got some other issues that the 60 milligram and the 120 milligram and the gummy bears and the pills don't work for all right boom we got you covered all right we didn't forget about you we didn't forget about we got you covered with these all right so without further ado let's go ahead check out the box then we'll check out the bottle then we'll go over why it's all legal and good and all that stuff and then we're gonna taste test it and then we'll go from there we'll see what happens see what happens all right maybe I give me a little testimonial um Oh so it's chair of the box so here it is hashtag feel the difference CBD FX 300 milligram 10 mil bottle made in the USA produced in FDA registered facility two pharmaceutical standards very important that you buy stuff that is made in a pharmaceutical lab okay or an FDA approved pharmaceutical lab this is going into your body alright the better it is you might as well put the best stuff you possibly can in all right registered facility to pharmaceutical standards pretty and it's approved by the FDA I'm in alright we all know what kind of pricks the FDA can be so boom I'm in let's roll it around and again it's so important that they put it on here a couple times producing an FDA register facility to pharmaceutical standards okay I listen if that's what I did I'd be I'd be loud and proud about it to see dfx hashtag feel the difference trademark boom ingredients proprietary blend of CBD propylene glycol vegetable glycerin it's just like your vape juice except instead of flavoring it's got CBD so it's basically the same stuff these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA are not intended to diagnose treat or cure any disease always consult with your physician before use underage sale prohibited now that little phrase right there again we're gonna go over that because that's what I got the fact sheet for CBD and CBD FX is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant that is legally imported and produced again very important if you've heard oh I heard CBD is illegal I'm about to smash that for you with the little fact sheet but we'll get to that CBD FX does not sell or distribute any products they're in violation of the u.s. Controlled Substances Act the UC or the US CSA got that covered too in the fact sheet and then there's some trademark stuff here made in Los Angeles flip it over shake before each use for best results you do want to do that any time you get CBD in a liquid form you want to shake it because some separation will occur during shipping or just leaving it sit some residue is natural which is true if you use a tank you will get some residue in the tank again not a big deal suggested use for a tank one to two droppers pool for a dripper one and a half to one droppers pool for a tank rich in the central omega-3 fatty acids and amino acids hashtag feel the difference and boom we're back around to the front now that being said here is the 500 alright you'll see it's a little bit different but as far as the box goes other than the colors this is 500 milligrams per 10 mil versus 300 milligrams for 10 mil but other than that you know it's just kind of flip-flop and both it's basically the same so I won't go through the same you know go through the box again with you I just wanted to show it to you so we'll set it off to the side and pop a bottle out alright so here is your bottle CBD FX 300 milligram 10 ml bottle as you can see this liquid is a little bit darker if you want to go back and check the 60 and 120 milligrams bottles you'll see this has a little more obviously a higher concentrate of CBD in it so it is going to be a little bit darker roll it around ingredients obviously there's CBD propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin and it is manufactured in Los Angeles California roll it around shake before you choose for best results we already covered that and again don't forget some residue is natural and it is made in the USA and we're back around to the front now let's go ahead and try so here's the bottle basically what you're gonna do is gonna come child say if you wrap in plastic just go around the top here until you find the perforation which it is double perforated so I gotta do click it boom strip comes off and then everything comes out grab ahold of it shake it like they say alright the reason you want to do that again is to get everything mixed back up like it's supposed to be bone alright so your as you can see instead of being kind of see-through now it's kind of like cloudy milky a little bit push down on the bottle and spin and there you go all right kind of almost reminds me of like orange juice in that consistency so let's try I just put a little bit under my tongue you know that's CBD if you've never experienced CBD before it does have a bit of an earthy flavor too it's the best way I can describe it I don't really know how else to describe it unless you've actually tried it if you have a better word for it dropping in the comments below I don't know how else to describe if flavor is a big thing for you check out the website check out my other videos they do have gummy bears which tastes just like cherry or like a cherry fruit punch to me and they've got sugar in it which is nice to check out the chill shots lemonade awesome and then they also have some hemp capsules which have absolutely no taste to them at all so if taste is gonna be one of those things where you're like oh god I don't like the taste that's fine there's other products CBD FX makes other products that you can try with still you know still has CBD in it so you're good you're good we got your family we got you now as promised thanks chief alright so you may have heard that CBD is illegal well it's not and here's why non-psychoactive hemp was deemed illegal by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 ok there's number one there hemp biomass which is basically the hemp crop that they derive the CBD from comes with an import certificate signed off on by Homeland Security so if Homeland Security said it's cool cool they only use CBD derived from the stalks of European grown hemp plants very important and we'll get to that in a minute product meet this the CBD FX products that contains CBD meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it has to have less than 0.3 percent THC in it okay now because all of the stuff I've already mentioned their products are exempt from the CSA and DEA drug scheduling practices which classify whole hep extracts as schedule one drugs why because extracts from the stocks of EU European okay European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice so boom legal nothing to worry about alright plans simple they figured out how CBD FX figured out how to get you a legal CBD awesome right that's what I'm saying now you're probably a nice thing does it work it's probably why you're even watching the video does it work doesn't work does work I can't say whether it were it will work for you I'm not allowed to because the FDA says I'm not allowed to alright but what I can tell you is my own personal experiences but I use CBD for the following reasons when I go to bed my head doesn't shut off alright I am up for hours afterwards thinking about this that the other thing flipping through a social media looking at my phone etc if you are one of those people there's a strong chance that might work for you because it helps me that way I am NOT a YouTube millionaire so therefore I do have to have a day job at my day job I work in a factory I do a lot of walking across concrete floors I do a lot of climbing the ladders and all that other fun stuff so therefore when I come home my feet hurt my knees hurt my ankles hurt my back hurts everything hurts alright you reach a certain age when you go out into the real world get a job and everything's not provided for you and then you realize what those jobs come aches and pains boom enter CBD alright takes the edge off the aches and pains for me it's right up there with an ibuprofen and I don't even like taking that because that'll screw with your liver it works for me I don't go to the doctor I hate the doctor I don't like Big Pharma's pills and agendas being shoved down my throat and all that other crap so I prefer natural type stuff all right smell as natural as you get you may see on some other videos out in YouTube land or on the internet of people saying well it didn't work for me okay it might not have okay it doesn't work for everybody okay there is nothing that's 100% in this world other than death and taxes but keep in mind those may also be the people that well I'm gonna try some took some oh well it didn't work immediately or it didn't work exactly the way I thought it was going to so therefore it doesn't work and I'm gonna tell everybody it doesn't work well that's not necessarily true okay if you go to the doctor they give you a prescription tell you to take one pill you take one pill it doesn't work do you automatically stop taking it or do you call the doctor and say hey the one pill is not working if you do say that what's he gonna say well then take two all right take it you know they're or they'll figure it out until you get to a point where whatever they prescribe you works okay the right dosage same thing with this play with it okay you got to figure out what dosage works for you the suggested one dropper might not work for you you might need to one dropper and you might be like wow I feel amazing let me try a half dropper and a half dropper full might work for you okay play with it all right it's all about you okay it's all about what works for you give it a chance if you don't give it a chance then you'll probably one of the haters that's putting comments you know on the internet so if you want some and I don't suggest you try something like I said this is the more high-powered stuff if you've got bigger issues going on and again unfortunately I can't necessarily say what it will work for with the FDA but do your own research okay look at other people's testimonials about it okay and if you have some of the symptoms that they have and the 60 and 120 didn't really work for you try the 300 of the 500 all right yeah boom there's the 500 so just remember look for either the gold box or the purple box all right try it just get do yourself a favor and try it alright that's all I ask for you if you're worried about you know I said it helps me shut my mind off notice I didn't say it

you think i'm gonna survive this podcast i think it's definitely gonna get us through", "Aa2NwPvyInc": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan HOF key operating officer of honey stick as well as Gold Line CBD and in today's tutorial episode we are gonna be calling it CBD gummies for dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available in the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies were the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD DEET is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure a beedi and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is 0.3% for hemp according to the US farm bill now that 0.3% is even below 1% so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plants so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like CBN CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBDs so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs so our CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the isolates because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting and you are still getting the good effects the supplemental effects of CBD we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's

medicine in the last thirty years now that's a big statement and the reason I say that is because of its ability to harmonize the endocannabinoid system and what that yields is what I call neuro endo immune poise it balances neurotransmitters in the brain it balances the immune system and it even balances hormones in the body now that sounds awesome but one of the things that we have a problem with is bioavailability with CBD when you take normal CBD you only get six to ten percent of it into the body now our nano emulsified full-spectrum CBD has set the benchmark for bioavailability giving five to six fold increases in bioavailability and addition to that it's giving you a very rapid onset in fact in these deliveries we can measure these compounds in your blood in as little as two minutes and they peak in the blood between 15 and 25 minutes now in our full spectrum extract we use the full spectrum all the cannabinoids including a farm bill compliant amount of THC and we blend into that our proprietary 11 terpene blend into our delivery system to rapidly give you all the benefits of CBD [Music]", "wafzUuCkK8Q": "[Music] hi my name is Kevin and thanks for coming back to the CBD store at hello MD today we're going to be looking at a raw full spectrum hemp oil extract from cured I'm really excited to talk about this because it is a full plant extract so unlike a CBD isolate which will work on its own this product contains all of the other cannabinoids that naturally occur in the plant they work together synergistically to give you the most benefit from the CBD there's 30 milliliters and 500 milligrams of total cannabinoids in each bottle all cured products are made with Colorado grown organic hemp the ingredients are full spectrum hemp extract and MCT oil MCT oil is a very healthy fat that metabolizes quickly it's hard to see but on the other ingredients it lists may contain CBD CBD a CBG cbc cbn and THC all in less than 0.3 percent these are other cannabinoids similar to CBD that allow this product to be most effective by using the whole plant it's very easy to use you simply unscrew the cap take a dropper full which is about 17 milligrams of CBD and squirt it directly under your tongue now you want to keep the oil there for about 30 to 60 seconds to allow it to absorb sublingually it means it'll feel the effects a lot faster than if you simply swallow it I personally tried some of this oil to treat some pain in my shoulder and felt the effects in about five minutes but I also noticed a general sense of centeredness and commet then typically feel when I use the CBD product so in my opinion it's an extremely effective product that works very quickly you can check out the cure or other hemp CBD products at hello MD com thank you and we'll see you next time you", "f-f9s6EYGRg": "listen I'm limited on time so this is gonna be a quickie we sent coin naturals to a lab to see if it's real plus I've got a review the good and the bad you're gonna want to see that part as much as the lab results let's get to it okay they claim two hundred and fifty they don't even say milligrams or what that is our independent lab found a hundred and eighty-seven milligrams of cannabinoids including a hundred and eighty four ish milligrams of CBD not two fifty they're missing like a quarter yeah jaw drop let's continue this is a broad spectrum extract meaning no THC but should have other cannabinoids but this is solo it might as well just be CBD as always here's the official lab test links below this is just one lab tests there are knowing guarantees that all products will test this way and things change price price is pricey twenty-two cents per milligram it's pricey go look at my other tests and you will say oh that's pricey ingredients it's just CBD oil and coconut oil that's good I usually don't mention subjective things like taste but since this review is so harsh I'll give it to them it tastes really good okay Noli your breakdown they claim it has eight point five milligrams of CBD per one milliliter dose we found six point one milligrams their serving size also adds up to two hundred and fifty milligrams it's a 250 milligrams bottle get your math straight coy of course we only found 184 milligrams of CBD Quin Naturals is a California company we tested it before it came up 19.3% short on our last test news for san antonio also tested it they found it was 22% short our last test was 25% short they are consistently a bit short a couple lawsuits some woman claims she lost her job because of the THC in their product but she had no proof of that and we also didn't find THC so I couldn't tell you for sure and they have accusations for false medical claims like many CBD companies do you say anything

much for spending a few minutes with me see you next time", "K8HFvJuWSuk": "I am certified nutrition consult Katherine with foods that heal you and foods that feeling a CBD and in this video I'm going to answer the question does CBD oil have THC in it the short answer is CBD by itself does not have THC in it the reason for that is because CBD and THC are separate cannabinoids in the plant so if you look at my infamous infamous cannabinoid wielding holed up in all these videos you see CBD here and you see th see over here they're separate from each other so CBD doesn't have THC in it but if you have a full spectrum CBD hemp oil product is probably going to have trace amounts of THC in it now it's going to be below 0.3% which is legal if it is hemp derived now if it's a full spectrum from the marijuana plant it's a whole different ballgame I'm talking about hemp derived CBD oil so a full spectrum is going to have all of these cannabinoids all the vitamins minerals plant terpenes naturally-occurring plant parts whatever it's gonna have all of it in there and an Israeli study in 2015 showed that full spectrum is actually going as a bit superior to an isolate I'm not going to explain why and I'm going to explain what you can do to help make up for that alright so full spectrum and I have a couple examples of full spectrums that we carry we have our this is our gold in our green label we have a blue label also that looks just like this but these are full-spectrum they have all the plant parts all the vitamins minerals nutrients in them are at including trace amount of THC now the THC is not even enough for you to feel it but there are people who are looking for something with no THC and then our tasty drops again they are full-spectrum let me see forget that right there full spectrum this is the 300 we have a 1000 they're going to have all the plant parts all of the cannabinoids in fact the tasty drops are raw so they're also going to have CBD a which may have a no benefit so I'm not gonna go too far into that because I have a separate blog post on that but those are examples of full Specter right then you've been half isolate now a CVD isolate it looks like a powder it's basically if you look at this wheel again you take just the CBD out so there's not going to be any THC so if you're looking for something with no THC then an isolate is going to be a good choice but what you have to keep in mind about isolates is that they aren't going to be as effective unless you add back in plant terpenes with it and and or omega-3 fatty acids cuz those will help increase the effectiveness of that isolate alright so like for example in our vague products our alternate vape and our vape shot all of our vape liquids there it's the CBD isolate so it has no THC but it has the plant terpenes in it which helped create that entourage or full-spectrum effect so that's why they work so well for people because they do have the plant terpenes add it back in gummy bears edibles brownies stuff like that they usually use isolates and without the plant terpenes and without the omega-3 fats the the isolates are they're not gonna be as effective they're just not and we sell actually the isolate powder for those of you who might be allergic to certain plant parts but that definitely these others are definitely going to be superior that's kind of a last resort for those of you who can't have any of the other products alright then the third option which would be I call other because you're there's broad spectrum and broad spectrum is pretty expensive and it's not really out there much yet but broad specter was where they pick and choose they want THC CBD CBN CBT they pick and choose maybe 10 cannabinoids it's really expensive to do and it's highly processed okay but what we have is a product that is full spectrum with only the THC filtered out and that's our head boil pair and you'll see these I have and you'll know when you look at the label to like this says zero th see our vape says no THC so that's one thing that you want to look look for is make sure that it says no THC and like we even have the lab test results on each product page so you can look at the lab test and see that it doesn't have any THC in it so if you're looking for THC free you definitely want to make sure that you are getting what you're you know what you're buying what you think you're buying but the nice thing about the hemp oil care spray is that it still has all the plant parts all the perturbing all of the cannabinoids all of the vitamins minerals the only thing not in there is the THC okay so that's going to be the difference there and there are no other products on the market like that so if you're looking for full spectrum without the THC the CBD spray the hemp oil Kerr spray is a really good option now what I'm gonna do is post below I'll probably create a blog post you can give me more than a day to get that written but below this video so that you have this written out if you're on YouTube or if you're on Vimeo you can see that you can also check us out at foods that heal you CBD calm I'll have a THC free section I've already got that on there so it's all categorized for you and then if you have questions please join us on our Facebook community page ask questions we've got testimonials on there it's really a great group I'll have that link below this video as well alright guys thanks for watching have a great day", "OUXC-oNTPfo": "[Music] alright thanks for stopping in with down the road show here today to talk about CBD and more what's the more for ringa the Moringa tree everything on the Moringa tree is edible and good for you good for your immune system good for your stomach good for your skin helps with edema and then on top of that it's got the CBD why am I talking specifically about this brand because I'm having a really rough day with my nerves and my my neck it pinched something about half an hour ago and my I couldn't stop the shaking in my head which was minor and you wouldn't be able to see I have two bottles of CBD and more one is 1000 milligrams now there's lots of companies out there that make 1000 milligrams - guess what sometimes a thousand milligrams isn't enough to stop your pain or the nerve damage or the shaking that's going on even in my hands kind of currently right now so but that is the life I have to deal with and what I have to deal with now so when a thousand milligrams isn't enough five thousand milligrams is what I have to turn to is once again this is CBD so I'm not getting stoned I'm not getting high I can still function like a normal human being and go about my day but if it wasn't for the 5,000 milligrams my CBD and more I wouldn't even meet in my truck right now riding along with my sister to go run errands I'd be stuck in the house in a ton and ton and ton of pain so I I love backing lots of different CD CBD products and telling you all about them and whatnot but as far as I'm concerned this is one of the better ones out there the top of the line if you have a CBD product and you think it's better than this well prove me wrong send it to me let's talk because right now CBD and more 5,000 milligrams that's that's it that's that's the stuff that's the ticket and so when when I'm having my worst days and the things are just beyond my control and no other CBD product on the market can touch what's going on with me or my pain nerve damage this is where I turn to CBD and more so go check them out and tell them down the road show since you thanks for stopping in", "7Sz0Ns1XiAw": "this CBD oil is very different from all the other CBD arts so different that it's actually not even in oil and I tested the Ohio energetics full-spectrum hemp alexia for two months and here's what happened hi my name is Max and I recently interviewed work leading the founder of Ohio energetics and I also tested his full-spectrum hemp products here for the last two months the reason why I tested it first it was super hot in the summer and I didn't sleep well at night and second I just wanted to see if I take it regularly if I feel any overall health benefits so my first impressions of the products were that yeah has a nice packaging the CBD oil which is not an oil but it's very thick compared to normal CBD ODS it's yeah really like honey worse yeah CBD odds are more like oil what's interesting also the ingredients so besides hemp oil and CBD it contains also Moringa and acerola cherry the very special thing about this is that it's water-soluble it's a full spectrum and has a twenty times higher bioavailability compared to your standard CBD oil there are other water-soluble CBD products out there but this one from my knowledge so far the only full-spectrum one that is also a 100% natural one so other water-soluble products of gnu's synthetic or semi synthetic encapsulation but this one's yeah they use their own patented process and Ohio energetics to make it a fully in natural it with normal CBD oil you get the experience that just the more you take kind of the more effect you get but actually turns out that CBD works on a bell curve which means you take a little bit more you hit a peak a sweet spot and you had have a greater effect and you take more and actually you feel less effect until you take even more and get too second peak to a second sweet spot with the oh hi it's pretty interesting pretty crazy actually because you get a feedback in your mouth if you hit the sweet spot so the way you take it you put it under your tongue and you get a taste and beginning the taste is sour you take a little bit more and it starts getting sweeter and at one point it's just sweet so if you have the point where it's just sweet you either pick a sweet spot on the back row event I think it's just so cool that it's kind of a feedback mechanism inside this hemp alexia the way I take it personally and my own personal dosage is the following I took it in the morning was just a quarter of a dropper under the tongue and for me that really increases awareness and wake up feeling so what's totally new for me actually to take it in the morning cuz I always thought you know you just take it an evening to sleep but turns out you can also take it in the morning or during the day to just feel certain overall benefits from it so for me a quarter of droppers enough so I feel the first sweet spot quite fast and we'll set that that's a sign for a healthy endocannabinoid system and someone if you don't have to take that much to get to the first sweet spot in the evening and for sleep I also just take a quarter of a dropper to it the first sweet spot and it takes an evening it takes maybe 20 to 30 minutes to feel the effect in the morning it's actually different in the morning I feel it quite immediately but in the evening for sleep it takes yeah it takes longer for me to feel it I also took more to hit the second and third bell curve once in a while as an experiment at the second bell curve I often have to cough I don't know why that is it's quite weird and then the third I can't really tell what's the factors so I just stick to going to the first bugger off I don't have to take I don't have to use a lot of it just a quarter of a dropper for me and that's how I use it we'll also mentioned in our interview that you can actually take some of this hand Ballack's here under your tongue and then you sync it up with smelling at an essential oil so because you have terpenes in essential oils and every essential oil has its own terpenes or different terpenes and the cool thing is that if you sink those up in your brain through taking the CBD or under your time and then smelling at the essential oil you get different kinds of effect which is quite interesting so you can either get like a more sharpened alertness effect or more relaxed effect depending on which essential oil you smell with the CBD you will find more emphasis on that in the for interview with the world my girlfriend also trial tried it out a couple of times the fact that I could notice was that it really relaxed my muscles after a short while they stood her menstruation of cramps which I get regularly or once a month and I used it for that too usually I took a painkiller I just once once per month and this time I used CBD oil and step because I was curious what it could do yes it did I didn't take opinion the price for this at the moment is 75 dollars in the official energetics shop which might seem yeah it costs more than your standard CBD oil but I think you have to to really think about the effect cuz this has 250 milligrams of CBD inside and with the 20 times bioavailability you would have to buy 10 of your average 5% CBD hemp oils to get the same effect as you have with one bottle of these so I think the price is quite fair and you can actually save 60% on it if you use my coupon code Mac sack you can use it in the official low energetics shop which is linked down below so yeah you save some money on it and get some comma points for helping me because I'm affiliated with oh I and they pay me a small commission when you use the coupon code Mac sack and you also say 16 percent on it if you want to see the full interview with the founder of our energetics will Clayton check it out here on my YouTube and you can also find other bio hacking experiments and reviews on my youtube if you watch that for give it a thumbs up and thank you for watching", "8PdIkJMaez4": "by now you have heard of CBD oil in

with sleep problems my whole life pretty much and about a year ago I decided to become committed to making sure that everything I was doing related to my sleeping was actually natural I was introduced to CBD and I started trying different brands I do a couple different things so number one I do the sleep blend it's non-gmo lab tested you can actually go on their website and see the actual components of the product which makes me feel really great about it and then through just chatting with the CBD team I was also introduced to just one of their full-spectrum CBD oils it's 1500 milligrams of CBD right within this bottle and I take about a half a dropper that as well as a half a dropper of the CBD sleep line at night what I've learned about the CBD products versus other products in the market is that they incorporate other items like terpenes within their products which help aid with relaxation and sleep and anxiety and love this DVD camis these are the neon gummy bears these when I'm going stressed and then the other thing that I recently fall in love with are these bath balls so something that I've always done in terms of you know creating good sleep habits is taking magnesium baths to say that it has worked phenomenally would be a complete understatement so I highly recommend these products the company they can definitely help point you in the right direction and begin to tackle you know a more relaxed healthy lifestyle", "pJAu3xO0IzQ": "hello viewers alright so today I want to talk about one of my favorite CBD companies met Tara and present a

CBD today we're gonna bring you an episode that's gonna talk about our CBD tincture line that we have on the Gold Line website now if you're just getting into CBD and are not sure which Avenue you should take in terms of how you should consume the CBD there's different types there's vapor bowls there's edibles there's sublinguals there's topicals you know there's also things in pill form that you know you willyou and swallow so you have two major types of differences between the CBD that you can either ingest which means that it goes through your digestive system or the ones that you can vape so that's one of the real primary differences when you're trying to pick out a CBD regimen what's really cool and convenient about our CBD Gold Line tinctures is that when you pick one of these up you can actually do both with them these can be ingested sublingually and they can actually also fill up a cartridge and are vey pible and they both deliver really good taste either if you ingest them or if you vape them now let's get into what these really are so what we offer is we have these 30 milliliter capacity tinctures we have four different flavors that we've put together for your tasting pleasure and also you know if there's a flavor that you would like please do let us know so they come in little dropper bottles like this which is a 30 milliliter and it has a tincture these are child resistant can have four flavors we have mango tropical strawberry and then we have a natural as well these come in three different strengths which means the potent see which is the CVD concentration which means how much it's going to activate at the bottom of the spectrum represented by the white label here you have a hundred milligram concentration of CBD in the red bottle which is your middle level you have a 300 milligram concentration of CBD and in the black bottle which is the strongest one you have a 500 milligram concentration of CBD so when you get these you know what are the benefits of it well if you don't know exactly what regimen you want to go if you want to do a vapor bowl or a consumable you can try them both to see if you like these products and kind of what Avenue you might want to explore into these are pharmaceutical grade very well-put-together CBDs that have really delicious flavors we're constantly using them here on the channel for different vape comparisons and things like that they vape very well they have good clouds they roll off of the vaporizer smooth and they do give you a flavorful experience as you are inhaling them and kind of lingers the taste will kind of linger on your palate - which is really good and they're very smooth so and the versatility of having the different strengths allows you to really hone in on your strengths and potency so how do you use these well first of all when you get it our instructions are written on the back of the bottle right here you can read them but since you're watching this video we'll run through them very simply to get it make sure that you shake the bottle up because if it's been stored or it's been shipped you shake it up you make sure you get a really good consistency and the stuff in there is flowing because CBD liquid is thicker than regular you know e liquids or little tinctures like that so after you've give it a good shake this is a child-resistant cap so you're gonna push down on the top and as you twist this is for the safety now when you pull the cap out you might notice that there is already some CBD inside the dropper so you're gonna want to do first and foremost is purge that because you didn't shake it first make sure you don't have any CBD left into the dropper there we go and then you're going to place it down deeply into the bottle and screw it on and then push and release and that should give you a good fill of CBD now you can either take this and ingest it sublingually which will go into shortly or you can fill up your tank and we have several videos on how to fill up your tank and we will make some more of them if you're taking it sublingually what you do is you take the drops usually you know having the having the dropper halfway filled up is one serving of the CBD so basically that would be about eight to twelve small drops you would take this and you would place it under your tongue release the drop or under your tongue and then let it linger for a little bit and then continue by swallowing it so that is a sublingual ingestion and like I said you have four different flavors to choose from and three different strengths to really hone in on what you would like these are pharmaceutically created here using very high quality CBD isolates everything is manufactured here in the United States all of these do have lab reports for their strengths a very good way to get started if you're trying to figure out which route to take let it go vapor out or the edible route very cost-effective make sure that if you're on the market

you another kind of like healthy you know supplement style thing we got going on here this obviously per the title is what it is and I'm sure somebody that watches this channel is going to be opposed to it just because usually you know the gun guys and gals and stuff like that and you know patriotic Americans conservatives Republicans whoever you are out there or against the weed in the disc that no thing this isn't weed this has no weed in it has no THC in it but it is CBD oil okay and it's koi brand five hundred milligram there is a bunch a bunch a bunch of reasons to take this stuff a couple years back I hurt my back pretty bad at work I was out of work for you know seven eight nine months and I still feel pain every day for the most part some days it's better some days it's worse you know it all depends and sometimes it keeps me up at night and I can't sleep because of it I can't get comfortable and it just sucks it really just sucks and I've been researching you know CBD and stuff like that for a while now and you know I came across koi you guys know I do the vape thing you know so I'm in and out of vape shops a lot and they've been carrying all this stuff as of late at least the one that I go to and they've got a wide variety of brands and different types of ingestion for your CBD you know they've got oils like this which this is like a tincture little dropper for one you're supposed to shake it up but you shake it up real good and then you take a dropper put it under your tongue hold it under there for like ten seconds and then swallow it this is the pink lemonade flavor from koi it tastes like cough syrup really but it's not that bad it's bad it's just one swallow and giggity and you could also vape this too I feel like it's definitely more efficient to do the tincture it absorbs quicker you're not wasting juice well you guys could do whatever you want here's a look zero THC made-in-america gotta love that here's the ingredients you know and so CBD itself you guys do your own research you know don't believe me do your own research especially if you're opposed to it but look into it because there's a lot of benefits to using CBD and it's totally legal it's a hundred percent legal in all 50 states there's no drugs in it there's no THC there's no nuttin you don't get high when you take it you know there's no euphoric feeling there's nothing but there's a lot of added health benefits to it it helps with inflammation it can help with pain it helps you sleep better at night there's it helps with anxiety and stress and depression and all types of different things if you're if you don't have an appetite it helps you gain an appetite you know if you're sick you have cancer stuff like that that's the other thing too is it may help you know with cancer or cancer like symptoms different things like that there's a wide variety of different studies on CBD and all the benefits that it has and there's a lot of people that take it anywhere from young to old I assume you got to be 18 at least to buy this I don't know if it says or not but it's definitely gaining in popularity and it's definitely helped a lot of people to the point where there's even been like major news stories on CBD and the people that take it you do have to be careful because some brands there's like a legal amount of THC that is allowed to be in the CBD and still be legal I think it's like point zero three percent or 0.1 three percent or something like that along those lines and if you do take enough of it and on a regular basis there is a possibility that you could fail a drug test even though you're not getting high you're not smoking weed you're not doing the pots you know so that is something to be concerned about but from all the research that I've done koi does have zero like completely zero THC in it and you will not fail test using this I don't know I've only been taking it for about a week maybe a little bit more than a week everyday couple tinctures of it a day you know one when I wake up maybe one in the middle of the day one before I go to sleep and so after this bottle is done I'm gonna go to Walgreens or wherever and get one of those at home drug tests for weed and I'm gonna piss in it and I'm going to see if the tests positive and if it does then I'll probably stop taking it unfortunately even though I've already felt benefits from it but I'm not going to risk you know a job or my rights or any of that stuff for this the main reason I've been looking into it and trying to take it is because the regular medicine you know advil Aleve vicodin whatever it is like the actual medicine the pills you know you go to Walgreens or your doctor gives it to you it might help but it's not natural and you can get addicted to that stuff and it's it all the side effects are usually worse than just dealing with the pain from you know whatever it may be your injury or or whatever it is so this is natural you know it's you don't have you can get it any time you want you don't have to wait for a prescription you know you could buy as much as you want different dosages like I said before this is a 500 milligram there's thousand milligram and I believe even 2500 milligram obviously the higher the dose the stronger it'll be the more effective it will be there's also ones lower than this but for me I have noticed an improvement I felt less pain my back hasn't been bothering me as much you know any type of stress related to work or just life in general seems to be not affecting me as much and then on top of it the best part of this is I'm getting better sleep you know I usually you know I'll get home from work later at night whatever it is and you know I've been at work all day so I want to I want to do something or I got work to do doing YouTube videos or whatever and you know sometimes I don't go to bed till 11:00 12:00 1:00 in the morning sometimes and but with this you know I I go right to sleep and I sleep soundly and I wake up and I feel refreshed where normally before I started taking this you know I'd be I'd be tossing and turning I couldn't follow this fall asleep and then when I did sleep I'd be waking up it felt like you know every hour on the hour trying to get comfortable again you know on the back was hurt and the neck was hurting whatever it is that all while taking this for the past week 10 days whatever it's been I've definitely noticed an improvement I've felt better I've slept better and that means a lot that means a lot because you sleep at night you wake up for the next day you got to go to work you got to do this you got to do that you're going to the gym you're hanging out with friends or going hiking going to the range you want to be the best that you can be you want to be as well-rested as you can be and this has definitely helped that's one of the things I can say it has definitely helped me rejuvenate during sleep and feel better and wake up refreshed and like I said you know calming down the stress not that I'm like totally stressed out and tweaking out man but everybody's got stress in life and this kind of you know I felt like it hasn't affected me as much without taking it I don't know if it's a placebo it's just in my head whatever maybe but I think it works I think it works and there's really no negative consequences to this whatsoever as far as health-wise there's only health benefits from all the research that I've done the only downside is that you might possibly fail a drug test but if you don't have to worry about that or if you know it's accepted by your employer or whoever you know they know you're taking it and you know it's legal there's nothing wrong with it plus there's a lot of companies that are even changing their policies and their drug testing to allow for this because this stuff is gaining in popularity you know not just koi in general but CBD and it really has there's a lot of stories out there if it really helping people and it's helping me so Pharr so like i said guys if you're into it if you're interested check it out do your own research don't believe anything I tell you and I will come back with an update in a week or two a couple weeks whenever this bottle is done it's a 30ml bottle so you know whenever I got a little bit left in there but uh I'll come back I'm not gonna do the drug test on camera obviously but I'll let you guys know the results and hopefully it stands true to what it says absolutely zero percent THC and I would pass the drug test and then that way there I would have no qualms or issues with taking this continually whatsoever and that's the thing too if you're going to buy this stuff you have to realize that it's not gonna work overnight you're supposed to take it for a little while get it into your system and then you will see the you know the the benefits and the effects of it a little bit down the road so that's something to throw out there it's something new for the channel something different and I wanted to share that with you because I know that when my back is hurting me it's killing me I know that if I don't get good sleep you know I wake up and I don't want to do this I don't want to do that you know I feel like crap you know then you're in pain you're you know you're upset you're frustrated if this can help with something just as simple as that let alone all the other better stuff that it can do why not you know so that's the video guys thank you so much for watching please leave any comments in the comment

spectrum CBD oil relate to the party this is me basically finishing up my experience with the unque on a full spectrum CBD oil this being my second bottle start this journey probably a good two months ago so why did I start it one looking into things like CBD oil with respect to you both kind of stress anxiety trying to limit that in my life as well as something to maybe help me sleep better to the end for me personally I've just been a better father for my boys that were being rested as well as not having as much stress that in turn honestly I think leads to me being a better father for my boys and that more patience for them and stuff like when you're well rested things are easier to deal with or just with less stress so to that end that has kind of been the premise of me getting into full spectrum CBD oil with on canna how has it worked for me kind of over the last two months I will say something changed it up between my last video part two and now in that as far as dosage wise the first like month basically for the first bottle I was taking about half of a dropper which come to find out since it's not marked is about half a milliliter well per the directions like recommended serving one milliliter is one serving so it's basically taking about half a serving in the morning for that first month or so for the first bottle and for this bottle I'm like you know what the second video I'm like I'm gonna go ahead and take one serving in the morning one serving in the evening which equates to basically one like recommended serving unbeknownst to me at the time I will say about three days into that for whatever reason again sample size of one but taking that second half a dropper full at night before bed those next three mornings actually woke up like kind of groggy previously I'd been getting to the point where I was actually getting really good sleep and then for whatever reason when I started taking that second dose in the evening for me personally I was waking up kind of groggy and that was leading right into me actually heading back east to go do some filming with kalashnikov USA and then immediately following that going to compete in the tackle games and I'm like nope not gonna do that maybe this will you've been itself out and it'll be a non-issue but I'm not gonna go compete like waking up feeling groggy so I was like we're going back to one in the morning and call it good so basically for the duration of my experience aside from those three days I've been taking half of this which is about half a milliliter I will say moving forward with respect to the company they had since Mark these so it actually shows you like gradations on here so you know exactly how much you're taking which i think is awesome I'm really glad that they did that with all that said what is this done for me as best I can looking back over my experience again there was kind of that first two-week period where I don't know if it was a matter of getting this into my body to a certain level like a threshold where I started to see beneficial effects but I will say this is absolutely helped with respect to getting restful sleep at night and also kind of I think lowering kind of stress and anxiety mind you there's always going to be stress in people's lives from sources outside of our control and same with sleep like there are nights I've slept in an airport like there's no fixing that like it sucks to sleep in an airport like on an uncomfortable bench but traveling shoestring budget like making it happen and yeah like you can't get away from experiences like that that will end up affecting your life and the other thing quick side is I think there's a some really good benefits with this mind you try and find the solution so there's certain things that are chronic for people whether it's like chronic like issues with sleep or some other thing but then there's also hey why am i having trouble sleeping is it because of my lifestyle because of diet like whatever it may be same was stress like in my stress because of these external factors in my life did I actually probably have a little control over because from like a wellness standpoint it's way better to actually address the cause but having said that you also need a just a stopgap measure like you need to be able to come over here get some rest have reduced stress levels so that you can maybe figure out a way to achieve that in your life as far as lifestyle design whatever it may be so don't necessarily want to use something that's a crutch but if you have chronic whatever it may be and this is a solution like yeah but gets chronic it's going to be there forever find a good solution for it or on the other side maybe find something create some breathing room so you can actually deal with the root cause but I will say this has absolutely helped one with respect to getting restful sleep in addition to that kind of reducing those stress levels overall for me one of the things brought up in the comments of one of my videos was hey have you heard anything with respect to CBD oil and tinnitus and I said I haven't heard anything but now that you mention it I can't remember the last time that I had experienced tinnitus and I do have tinnitus so if you're unfamiliar that ringing of the ears and so I'm like okay like when was the last time started thinking about it I couldn't think about it like period I'm not sure when the last time was so I was like okay I will make a concerted effort and to that end I did went ahead kept a log in so probably around I don't probably less than a week after I started the second bottle and started keeping the log I first experienced it on the 16th of March when I was down tactical games I noticed some of it then I also noticed it on March 30th again on April 14th and on April 19th I will say all of those times to the best of my recollection in my notes it was all pretty pretty dim pretty mild it wasn't I don't know that I've ever had it like really severe but it absolutely was like I had to stop and like okay yeah a little bit of tinnitus right there it wasn't it wasn't pronounced at all and how often did I usually experience terrible test subject I don't know so I do feel like there may be some credit to that again over that span of probably about a month and a half had four instances that I could actually like notice and moving forward as I stopped taking this which I will revisit in about a month or so and let you know where I am with stress as well as sleep in tinnitus I'll continue to log that stuff revisit it now that I ran out of my two bottles and see where I'm at in about a month from now but to the end of tinnitus don't have a solid answer I will try and get you wanting something else I did probably about three days ago as of filming this as I was winding down on this very last bottle is I went and took a drug test went in I was like give me that Cup I got a pee I've been drinking a ton of water and I ended up getting the results back keep in mind sample size of one taking this full spectrum CBD oil from on kanna which has 0.3 percent THC mind you only taking about half a serving once a day for the past like two and a half three months now I guess two bottles of it came back negative then show up then showing up for marijuana or anything like that THC and in my saying you're gonna get those same results absolutely not if you have a job where you have the potential to pop probably I don't know you're a big kid like you make that yourself that was my experience though with respect to taking a drug test after taking about half a serving a day for the past two plus months so should you take this I don't know ma'am you do you I will say definitely helped with my sleep definitely helped on a certain level with just kind of stress anxiety for me and it's been it's been said to help with a lot of other things again not a doctor that's just kind of my experience after the next month I will check back as far as where I am with sleep stress levels to include tinnitus and let you know but yeah I definitely have found value in this is this expensive yes no I don't know on the one hand when you start looking at things like CBD oil it's not apples to apples so yeah something off CBD oil but one where is it sourced is it verified by a third-party all these different things I think uncanny really solid company one they do actually like third-party verify all their stuff additionally their stuff it's pure ie it's not like doused with pesticides and stuff like that which is important especially when you condense something down and the other thing is these bottles of their was it full-spectrum aller twenty five hundred milligrams of CBD in this entire bottle so each serving full serving one milliliter I guess it is has eighty three point three milligrams of CBD well why is that important well you might have mind you this bottle right here cost about one hundred and forty bucks you liked 140 bucks you're like I'm gonna get this other see video it's only 20 bucks it's like alright cool and so that other bottle of like CBD oil for 20 bucks has like 50 milligrams of CBD oil in that entire bottle you know what I mean so when you look at it actually try and make apples-to-apples if you're actually looking at getting some in that what is the price per milligram of actual CBE pretty good metric actually look at it at that point this starts to become a lot more cost-effective versus a lot of other different brands of CBD oil out there as far as the actual volume the CBD oil you are getting for the price that you're paying the other thing with price to keep in mind is it's like damn 140 bucks when you wake up from a bad night's sleep like how much would a good night's sleep be worth for you at that point or the other way is like you'll balk at spending like 140 bucks on potentially a good night's sleep for let's say a month but like no issue paying for that five dollar latte every day for a month like 150 bucks right thirty days I don't know it's kind of matter how you look at it you decided to pick some up there's discount code for you to use save a little bit of money on it and let me know it treats you I'm curious on your experience with it if you choose to go ahead and use some if you guys appreciate

stomach might be a little bit sensitive to the material especially at higher dosages so if you find that you have any dysbiosis or you have any loose stools back off on your dose again we always suggest starting with a lower dosage if you've never taken CBD before start with somewhere between 5 and 10 milligrams per day and slowly increase your dosage every 3 to 5 days until you start to feel the change let us know if you've got questions or go ahead and purchase here online thanks so much you", "KckgGcPKG5k": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today it is my pleasure and honored to introduce to you the launch of our new CBD product line that is available online for sale called W W CBD Gold Line comm we're gonna make sure to put the description the link into the description below and Gold Line CBD is our new CBD line that is a comprehensive and full line now I just want to make today's video a real quick introduction about our CBD Gold Line I'm sure you guys have seen it in several of our vaporizer tests and demos as we've been putting the line together and getting the website ready for commerce and now it is finally live and ready so let me just go through the different categories and what we have and I'm sure we're gonna do more videos of in-depth product tutorials about the products its uses and all the different facts that we can talk about and again if I forget something or there's something that you guys want to see in our CBD product line make sure to drop it down into the comments below you'll see me interacting there with you guys so let's jump right into it first part of our CBD Gold Line is our CBD liquids so these are really flavorful they use a really high quality CBD isolate and we have them in four different flavors for you guys here to start and that's we have a natural we have which is very natural just meant to taste like the CBDs extracts very very pure earthy not really has much of the no real infused flavor just the way they would taste off of a natural extract that's our natural taste we also have our strawberry which the the flavor is pretty self descriptive we have a tropical which is kind of a tropical blend of flavors kind of like you would have like a like a tropical punch and then you have which is probably in our office the most popular you have the mango flavor now all of these flavors are infused in there to have a really nice flavorful experience but not to become overbearing so we have that liquid broken down into three different strengths which you can tell by the color of the label and here I have it from low to high so you have your low medium and high your low contains a hundred milligrams of CBD per bottle and each bottle is sized at a thirty milliliters size so our low-end you have the hundred milligram which is a very light infused bottle you have your red label which is 300 milligrams in the 30 mil bottle of CBD and then at the very top which is our high strength you have the 500 milligram infused bottle we wanted to color-coordinated to make it really easy for you guys to differentiate what the strength levels are and also within this line you're gonna have four flavors as you see if we split here on our display now this liquid can be used as a sublingual tinted tincture so it can be ingested and it is also actually vey pible now so if you want to vape the item you can do so what is the cream of the crop kit that we recommend for vaping these liquids and truly feeling the flavors well I don't think anything tops right now what we have available is our subohm sport especially if you pair it with the bubbler now you guys can see in depth reviews on this product and all of our other oil products if you want something more concealable for your CBD oil vaping to fill your tincture you can always roll with one of our rippers we've just posted the in-depth product review for that as you can see that's our concealable sub-ohm vaporizer if you want something smaller then you can always pick up one of our cloud tanks and pair it with one of our lovely batteries so for vaporizers if you want to vape it you know on vape honey stay calm we got lots of really cool vaporizers for vaping these CBD oils we're also gonna throw some of these vaporizers onto the the CBD goldline website now let's keep rolling with that liquid so those are liquid tinctures that you have however if you want to do liquids and try it and not really go the bottle or tincture route we sell a really high end prefilled cartridge which comes in boxes like this which will indicate the flavor which you can see you have natural these are prefilled one milliliter cartridges that contained within this cartridge contain a hundred milligrams of CBD this is again available in the four flavors natural tropical strawberry as well as mango each one is filled into our cloud tank which you can buy empty on our website really high quality premium tank we also do an in-depth review on this alone here on the channel let's jump into it that's the bottom cap that I just pushed off there it's a 5-10 thread so it'll screw right into your batteries it has adjustable air flow control so you could really dial in on your hit this thing has really good seals so it's not gonna go leaking on you and be a really good reliable tank that you can actually refill when you're done vaping it here so you can refill this a lot of people can get 8 to 10 uses off of it easily if you're looking for a good battery to pair this with we have our B master battery that's the multi color we're gonna be posting the video for that one real shortly it will probably be on the web on the YouTube channel by the time this video airs or you have our Gold Line variable voltage battery which is our oil vape pen all design button made by honey sticks so you know that it's got that high quality high power like Ronix these batteries are both available they work fantastic with these cloud tanks so check those out those are available again in the four flavors that we talked about if you just want to get into trying CBD and you possibly don't know if you want to go the rich article route we also have CBD disposables also available in the four flavors as you can see those are the four flavors for the disposable pens and each one's disposable pens already comes prefilled it makes it really simple you just open this package up and you can start inhaling what we used for the power plant here is our honey stick disposable flavor Maxx oil pen so it is a little disposable all-in-one oil pen as you can see we did a separate review on this on the channel as well it is also available on the website separately for sale this is a good little vape pen it's disposable it comes prefilled it has a ceramic heater so it's gonna give you fantastic flavor notes real easy to carry around very small light unit you just simply draw on it the LED light will come on and your vape II and then when it runs out then this batteries ready to go and you can pick up another one or you can step into buying tinctures or going the prefilled cartridge and rechargeable route but these are really easy convenient if you're on the go if you're traveling or you're going out for the evening you don't want to worry about your big box of a pen you can pick one of these up it's a really easy way to get started so that pretty much covers our standard liquid vaping if you want to really go for the purist kind of experience then we would recommend to go into the crumble which is the dabs and we've done several of those as those reviews as well on our channel to where we've tested and used the gold line CBD crumble now just one last thing about these disposables this is a half mil capacity and it comes with a hundred milligrams of CBD infused in there so out of the liquids this is probably the strongest concentration per milliliter that you can get so it's a small tank with half a mil but there's a hundred milligrams of CBD in each one of these cartridges which one serving is the full cartridge so it's a hundred milligrams within the whole cartridge okay that doesn't mean you have to vape it all at once but that just means that's what the CBD content is so we have the crumble which is a solid which is a very pure full-spectrum CBD which we get from one of our partner farmers in Colorado it does not have THC in it that is within the legal confines for shipping we made sure that we have lab reports on our website for all of our things none of our CBD liquids have any THC in them so they are legal for us to sell and to ship you can check the lab reports so these will be done like a wax and dab and we have these available here in a 250 as you can see which is our lower strength and then right here we have our higher strength which is indicated in the black with the black which is a 500 milligram concentration crumble now these are little grab-and-go packs which is mainly for travelers and people on the go or people who just want to try it you can jump on you get one of these packs whether you want a lower or a higher strength now both these strengths I would consider as high in full spectrum relative to a lot of other forms of CBD in terms of vapor bowls they have a very pure CBD taste very similar to other crumbles that you might have sampled these are paired with a disposable rippen ditch which is a sampler very inexpensive but very good wax pen you can check out the full review for that on the channel and if you try one of these things and you're like hey I want to start using this crumble more regularly we sell just strictly the crumble by itself in both the 250 milligrams concentration and the 500 milligrams then you could start buying those and get into possibly a more permanent pen like our plasma wax pen which is just an amazing flavorful pen that we have a full review on or even our stinger which is our ceramic doughnut rechargeable kit or you want to jump into a hybrid tank and usable or mod there is not a shortage of amazing wax and dab pens that you can use so anyways now that we covered basically our vapor bowls let's go into the last category of our CBD Gold Line which is our edibles so we have two different forms of edibles here we have a full spectrum Gold Line honey stick which which has 20 milligrams of CBD per honey stick now when you pick one of these up comes with instructions benefits and uses right here you just open up you get five of these honey sticks each one of these honey sticks compared to a lot of the honey sticks on the market these aren't isolated and use these are a full-spectrum honey stick CBD oil infused so they are more powerful better activation you get 20 milligrams of CBD per stick these are meant to be orally ingested you can use it as you would use any other honey a lot of people put it in their tea put it on their toes whatever you want sore throats things like that people say it does the same job of honey with the added benefit of CBD how do you use it just simply either cut the top or bite the top or start pushing and just like a regular honey straw you would then ingest this honey straw and get all the useful benefits of a CBD these come in five packs are available 20 milligrams per stick check those out then for people if you think honey sticks aren't for you but you're more of a chewables person we have our CBD gummies which are 25 milligrams of CBD per gummy we have that available actually in two sizes a large and a small bottle we have an 8 ounce jar and a 12 ounce Schorr the quantities on these the large albeit these get filled by weight and by size of the jar so you will have a variance of one or two gummies but in general so you have a good idea you get about 60 or so gummies in the small 8 ounce bottle and you get just about close to a hundred and the Big Daddy 12 ounce jar here of these delicious little CBD gummies they are 25 milligrams per gummy so they are relatively strong strong potency in terms of CBD so that covers your edibles on that side so that in a very quick and brief way is our CBD Gold Line which like I said you can find at CBD gold line.com and Gold Line CBD calm it goes to the same place or team here at honey stick kind of take the best CBDs to pair we made and provided all the equipment we've worked a lot of our customers and contacts that we make vaporizers for to make a perfect CBD line which we're making available to you guys now now I'm a vape designer and a

partnering up to do a giveaway in which we will pick two winners the giveaway is going to be hosted on Instagram so if you're not already following make sure you head over there right after this video go ahead and follow me so you know the moment it goes live [Music] hey guys and welcome back to my channel thanks so much for joining me again if you are new here then my name is Mariah and on this channel I share my fertility churning product reviews as well as lifestyle vlogs so in today's video I'm gonna be sharing with you guys about how I incorporate CBD into my fertility protocol this video is actually sponsored by calm by wellness I have done a sponsor review with them before as you guys know when I review things I only give you my honest opinion in my personal opinion and this is just an assessment of how well a product does or does not work for me as always with wellness products I also have to put out the disclaimer that I am NOT a medical professional so you should consult with a medical professional before trying anything especially if you are taking other medications in other words you are research so what I really like about using calm is that they are an all-natural product they're organically grown right here in the United States right in Colorado and they're also processed there as well you guys know one of the biggest things for me is that they are THC free so they do not have that psychoactive component of the cannabinoid plant contained in any of their products which is awesome in my opinion it's nice to be able to get the benefits of CBD without having that other component in there especially as it pertains to fertility so CBD can actually reduce stress reduce inflammation it can reduce any of your pain it can also increase your mood by blocking your stress hormones and as it pertains to fertility it can boost your anandamaya levels so what CBD basically does is it gives your endocannabinoid system a small push or a small nudge of sorts it kind of wakes it up and says hey this is what you need to be doing once the endocannabinoid system is more active it actually increases the Anand amide levels which stimulates the ovaries to produce more estrogen as we know during the follicular phase of our cycle estrogen plays a key role in a production of follicles as well as during up for ovulation and hyerim on denied levels occur at ovulation and are very widely associated with successful pregnancy so by taking CBD during the follicular phase of your cycle you can actually help to boost and Krystal's Amanda Knight levels hopefully therefore increasing your estrogen levels now this in turn may give you a healthier and stronger ovulation but if you are already having issues with your ovulation it doesn't guarantee that this one thing is going to make you ovulate if you have things that are already inhibiting your ability to ovulate CBD may not necessarily help you fix that so similar to how you use supplements to help with your fertility your ovulation your egg quality all those things CBD is just like another form of a supplement it is not a medication and it is not a quick fix either now if you're gonna be using CBD specifically while trying to conceive you only want to take it during your follicular phase so you only want to take it from about cycle day one routes you about two days before you ovulate the reason I'm telling you this is because after ovulation you're anandamaya levels begin to decrease so that your progesterone levels can begin to increase so remember higher Ananda might level zequals higher estrogen levels and after ovulation you obviously want those to start coming down so that it doesn't inhibit your progesterone from increasing if you continue to take it during your luteal phase that is post ovulation it can and very well may interfere with implantation of an embryo it may not affect fertilization rates but it can and does have the potential to interfere with implantation because it once again it is increasing your estrogen levels instead of your progesterone levels so my personal recommendation and how I use CBD while trying to conceive and to help aid in trying to conceive is I take it the day before or the day of my cycle starting so if I am 99% sure that I am NOT pregnant in a particular cycle on the very last day of that current cycle for me that's day 28 on day 28 I will start taking the CBD because I already know that a I'm not pregnant and B my menstrual cycles about to start and then I will continue taking it every single day until up to 2 days before my ovulation the reason I start taking it the day before my cycle starts is because it can actually help juice cramping I've noticed that over the last few cycles I've used it if I take it the day before my cycle my cramps on like cycle day 1 or cycle day 2 are significantly less than they are without taking it for me personally I don't like taking medicines like leave advil ibuprofen Tylenol I don't like taking any of those and I much rather try a holistic or more natural method to reduce those things this CBD really definitely does help with that it doesn't get rid of everything for me but my period pains are usually at their most intense on the first day or so I'm usually in my bed hugging a heating pad for majority of the day and just trying to make it through the day however since I've started taking this a bit proactively that pain has been significantly reduced it also helps my mood because when I'm cramping and everything like that and feeling overall icky I'm obviously not gonna be in a good mood because I physically don't feel well I feel like crap oftentimes so when I'm able to take this and it's able to alleviate a lot of those symptoms yeah I'm not gonna be as cranky as I normally am and it also helps me function a little bit better throughout my day because I'm not then focusing on trying to get rid of the pain so I do truly believe that CBD can be a great help in that first half of your cycle in the follicular phase I can help reduce your pain boost your estrogen levels and it also reduces your inflammation so similar to taking things like baby aspirin CBD has the same kind of effect and reducing that inflammation as well as reducing the pain now as a disclaimer if you are taking any medications even if they are fertility medications I urge you to consult with your doctor before taking this product and the only reason I'm telling you that is because similar to how grapefruit juice affects the absorption of certain medications CBD can have a similar effect not necessarily on all medications but there are some medications that it can interact with so you definitely want to make sure that you're not inhibiting any of your medications from properly working or having any negative side effects I personally have had no negative side effects with taking the column CBD the only complaint I have about it really is the stopper on it and I'll show you guys you pinch the stopper it doesn't always go up to there there's a little number on there and I'm not sure if you guys can see that but there's a little number on there and when you pinch the stopper doesn't go all the way up to the full milliliter that you take with we were one dose so if I had a complaint it would be that their dropper is a little bit not the greatest so what I tend to do is I will measure up to about the 0.5 milliliter mark and I'll take that underneath my tongue sublingually and then I will do that again a second time so it's not that I'm taking it twice or taking two doses I'm just splitting my dose up just so that I can make sure that I'm getting a single full dose as far as the taste is concerned this flavor is peppermint and it tastes just like that peppermint it's not really even a taste to be honest with you guys because your nose is connected to your taste buds you feel like it's a taste but it's really more of a smell this doesn't really have a overall like flavor to it per say it's more so that you're smelling it when it's in your mouth and you are tasting it it's not pungent it's not thick and I typically hold it underneath my tongue for about two minutes and then it takes about another 8 to 10 minutes for me to start to feel the effects of it CBD also helps with decreasing your anxiety and it was a cortisol blocker so it also can decrease your stress which we all know is very helpful when you're trying to conceive or really just in general life no one needs to be stressed out it's really not good for our health at all so it does that as well as improves your sleep as I've said before I've tried their sleep one out first and this one has lavender in it and I did a totally separate review on that but the general gist of it is that I love this when it comes to my sleep but I just wanted another different tension that I can use during the day so whether it was nighttime or daytime I wanted something that I could take without it making me feel almost too relaxed so just as an overall recap CBD can boost the anandam eye therefore increasing estrogen levels there for supporting ovulation it can also reduce menstrual cramping reduce other forms of pain and reduce inflammation also is very well known to help with anxiety depression insomnia any form of sleep issues so CVD all-around has an array of benefits and kind of has something for everybody like I said if you are specifically trying to conceive you want to take it only during your follicular phase only pretty much from cycle day one through two days before ovulation if you're not trying to conceive then you can take it every single day of the month in fact some people have used CBD as a more mild form of birth control it is not an official form of birth control but they've used it all throughout their entire cycle if they're trying to prevent getting pregnant because it does keep those estrogen levels at a much higher level so that's all I have to share with you guys about how I'm using CBD as it relates to my fertility protocol I really hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope that you learned something if you did make

CBD is the same as marijuana. [Rachel} That's Correct.\nIt's false, Yes. Cannabis is the genus of a plant it's the category of plant. Under cannabis you have marijuana and hemp plants. Okay? The difference, they look the same by the way they smell the same. Right. But the difference between these two plants is the amount of THC, tetrahydrocannabinol now this is the active ingredient in marijuana that's what is the psychoactive ingredient. But you typically know when you think of marijuana you think that people are getting high that's the psychoactive ingredient. The difference is that if a plant has 0.3% or less by dry weight, it is considered to be hemp plant. Correct. If it has more than 0.3% by dry weight it is considered to be marijuana. So that's, right away, the definition. CBD is a cannabinoid. There are lots of cannabinoids that have a lot of active properties in our body. Our body produces endo-cannabinoids which are naturally occurring. Here on the screen you see two different things. To the left is THC. These have the same number of atoms. The same type of atoms, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. But, the reason why we highlighted this structure is different. And this is what makes the big difference between THC which is psychoactive and CBD, which is not psychoactive. When the chemical binds to the receptor that structural difference will make something happen different in the body. Right. So that is the difference between THC and CBD. And CBD. Very important, okay? CBD, if it is taken exclusively solely from the hemp plant, it is legal. It is allowed in all 50 states. However, if the CBD is taken from the marijuana plant or it's partially taken from the marijuana plant it depends on the state. As to whether or not they allow it to be legal. As to whether or not it's legal, right. CBD comes in all types of products. When you go to the store, you're gonna see it in all different ways. And I want to kind of guide you through how to choose what you want. Here are some examples of things that you might find. And there are more than this, by the way. But this is a bath powder. So people put these into their bath they dissolve it into their bath.\nI've actually never seen it in bath powder. But I think that that makes sense.\nYeah. Because people soak to relieve pain and inflammation as well.\n100% Right. So it gets into your skin and it give you that soft tissue relief that you're looking for. Lots of lotions out there. So you go to a lot of these beauty stores and cosmetic stores, they have it in the lotions or some of the pharmacies.\nI use a balm. It's like a very thick.\nRight. Dense balm. That's right, so it's thick sometimes, like a salve or it's like a nice thin lotions so they're all different types depending on what you want to get out of it. There are capsules that you can take. Yup. Then you mentioned earlier for Isabu they're tinctures. You have the little dropper and it tells you how much to take and you put on your tongue, boom that's it. And then, this is what I wanted to talk to you about. A pain rub. So this is a freeze right here. This is not about the CBD, by the way that is a primary ingredient but it's about other components. So, the question is, you need to be able to get the CBD and the pain relief chemical into your skin. Right. So it depends on else the manufacturer puts in there to help it seep into the skin. The first thing, is you want to be very clear that it actually says CBD. CBD.\nPeriod. Because, that's right. CBD, it's gotta say that, number one. Number two. So you want to look to see what it says about THC. THC free.\nThis is THC free, very good. The other thing is, you want to make sure it tells you what type of CBD it is. This is very important, pay attention. So here, it says pure isolate. What that means is that the product is 99.9% CBD. It's as pure as you can get it. So it doesn't have any THC. But there's also something called broad spectrum. Broad spectrum means that not only does it have CBD, it has the other cannabinoids I mentioned before. Right. Other good chemicals for you. It's broad spectrum. And lastly, there's something that's called full spectrum. This is where you have to pay attention. Full spectrum means it actually has THC. Okay? So, when you see isolate, that's pure CBD. When you see broad spectrum it's other cannabinoids but still no THC. When you see full spectrum It includes the THC.\nIt includes the THC. Please look at the ingredient list. Because you want to know actually what's in there. So make sure you do that. And lastly, make sure it tells you how many milligrams are on here. Right?\nAnd that's where you get that huge price discrepancy. Ah, there you go.\nThat's right. There you go. So, if the price looks too good to be true. It is.\nIt is. (laughs)\nIt ain't true. Because CBD cost money and so if you want high quality I'm not saying you have to break the bank on it. And it's buyer beware. Yes.\nLike, you really do have to study up on this. You can't just dive in. Please. And the last thing I want to say. (crowd claps) The last thing I want to say is this. A lot of these products have a QR code on it. And you can take your phone and put it up and look at the certificate of analysis. Make sure that the product has been third party tested. Which means they've sent it out to a third party lab to test to make sure it has what is says it has and doesn't have, which you don't want. That's so true of every supplement and vitamin.

and this right here is Zion medicinals full spectrum hemp oil what I've done is I have been reviewing it for a month and I've put a bunch of clips up to show me using it my experience with it so you're gonna see a bunch of different clips of me using it for naps and using it for anxiety and stuff like that and you'll get the general idea and also I have an article about it if you'd like to read it on my site just go to WWI told you I was sick calm and you can read the full article there okay so without further ado let's check out my clips which are a little bit awkward I apologize and I'll see you in the next video okay this is Jamie from I told you I was sick calm and this is my very first time trying syan medicinals full spectrum hemp oil I'm gonna be recording my process and I will let you know how I like it and how it goes so it's about two and a half hours later since I tried the hemp oil for the first time and I just woke up from a really lovely calming beautiful blissful nap so so far I am really liking this stuff well I'm awake I'm much calmer and even my sinuses are cleared up so I'm thinking this stuff is kind of magical so I have been reviewing this full-spectrum hemp oil from Zion medicinals so far I have tried it before I take a nap because my anxiety can get really bad today I'm just going to try it I have a little bit of back pain but other than that I'm actually doing really well so I'm gonna give it a little bit of a try and I want to see how it affects me just during daily life and not just napping so here goes it's got a little dropper in it and I usually take very very little because it's very strong like very little that's probably see what I mean little little okay it's really strong so I'm in the car getting ready to drive I work with Dan on Tuesdays and Thursdays so so far so good with the the oil obviously it's not helping my memory um the hemp oil the full-spectrum hemp oil is doing pretty good I may have felt a little bit I don't want to say hi but I may have felt a little bit like calm and peaceful and comfortable and maybe that's hi um but I don't feel like I can't drive I feel totally sober and everything feels fine and I actually feel more calm and relaxed so I just wanted to give you that update and if anything changes I will update you again so the last time I tried this I think I took a little bit too much so I'm going to reduce the dosage just a little bit and I'm gonna try to relax and take a nap because it is really hot and I am exhausted for some reason I feel like I didn't sleep right last night so here we go trying this again well I think I feel a lot better after this nap versus the last one I tried to take with the CBD oil I think that honestly the problem that I'm having is that I'm drinking too much caffeine and my sleep issues are having nothing to do with the CBD oil which I didn't think it was but I just wanted to see if maybe I had taken too much or what was going on but I think it's the caffeine so I'm gonna have to cut back but the hemp oil is definitely helping okay so to give you an idea what I mean about the dosage of this I think that I'm safe doing about this much and that's it I don't think I need any more than that I think just right here seems to work for me just wanted to make sure that I clarified that because there's no technically there's no actual dosing instructions on here so I have had unfortunately neck pain all day long and nothing is seeming to touch it so I'm going to give this a shot I actually have not tried this for physical pain yet so this is gonna be interesting I hope it does work I don't know if it will but I will let you know so let me see here there's a little dosing can't take that much of it you're supposed to keep it under your tongue for 60 seconds and then swallow and the ingredients in this is it's a full spectrum hemp fractionated coconut oil and okay it says I'm sorry seven can avoids cannabinoids I can't even say that that's pretty sad seven cannabinoids including CBC and THC the THC is less than 0.3% I'm going to mention that in the actual article that I write about this but I wanted to make sure that that was really clear that this does contain THC not every CBD product does so I will let you know if it helps with my neck pain because so far ibuprofen and I used like a pain unit on here it's not a TENS unit it's called a Ben APOD and I also use some muscle rub and nothing is working so let's hope this does okay Alan so unfortunately my neck pain is being incredibly stubborn today which means the CBD oil really didn't help I felt like I got some relief for a little while but the spasms are starting again so I am going to start using my tens unit [Music] you", "wlsHmRvRZ0A": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is Christopher a little bit about myself I've been involved in the cannabis industry in every facet from horticulture to agribusiness and advocacy for like I said just under under 20 years so I've been approached by the good people at popular scene brands calm you can find them on Instagram populist leading brands and pop the CV so what they do is they bring here as much information on cannabis business everywhere from water cannabinoids terpene profiles the difference in ham industrial ham and all the new things as far as products and information and legislation that are coming around on a daily basis so they really are leaders in the industry of providing free information and discount coupons and codes you some of the most familiar if you will CVD products that are on the market currently so I've been approached by them to start a project where we're going to be reviewing some of the most popular brands that you see in the retail shelves across America from different tinctures edibles health and beauty products pet products and stuff like that so today our first product that we are doing a review on together its pinnacle house six hundred milligram tincture so let's touch on everything from the marketing this bottle is probably one of the coolest bottles that I've ever seen it's kind of like winning winning an Oscar for your help with this with a gold bottle the other thing I like to take a look at some to this considered supplement and you are taking it to hopefully improve your overall quality or health there's the dropper and you could see here that this one is labeled in quarter milliliter doses all the way up to a full yellow in there that is cool very responsible of these guys everybody should be doing it should be your requirement it's also in the child safe bottle topper which it which is great because you don't want anybody that's not in need of this to take more than what they what they would do fortunately it's not a pharmaceutical so it won't kill them and then just ride make them poop their brains out but you know that's not bungee so I will tell you that I've been taking this product for a little under two weeks about 10 or 11 days I've been taking it suggested use by the company and I will say that it's helped with my inflammation my knees my joints on stuff that's taking a beating from being in the you know forming industry for as long as I have it definitely has helped with a lot of like that my mental clarity issues it's helped me fall asleep a lot accident typically I lay in bed for sometimes in excess of 3 or 4 hours before I fall asleep and you know I wake up not feeling as rested probably should and I keep in very close watch up my blood pressure my heart rate things of that nature while I'm asleep and it's been showing that my blood pressure has gone down which in turn are testing the lecture-room of lecture just lower when I wake up and the amount of deep sleep I'm kidding and almost twice as long as what I was getting before I started taking your breath product so I'm definitely a believer I definitely think that 600 milligrams is a great place to start for the average adult and then you can either work up and work down eventually the value will be over build a tolerance it'll bioaccumulate in your system if you're not sweating it out or stuff like that but I will say that that's being a diabetic having the vegetable glycerin flavor kind of cut some my my little sugar cravings that I have throughout the day and I think it's a lot safer to take a little dropper of a vegetable glycerin CBD tincture and I did so many reasons people to cook me or something like that so you do taste the plant in the back because it is a cool spectrum product they're not just an isolate there's a little bit different method of how they put these together so you will get a kick back up like a biomass or plant flavor instead of just like a pure isolate which they just put my coconut err and boil so overall I think the marketing wins I think the products great I'll continue to use it I'm definitely gonna get a higher dose and see how what that does to me and how that makes me feel but as a lifelong cannabis easier that's one that really watches my guy watches everything that I pretty much system on a daily basis I will say that the effects from this one I definitely feel that if I were to get a third-party independent test that it would be what it says it is and I will be purchasing this purchasing this product regularly and including it in my any supplement regimen and I hope you need to so go check out popular CBD brands top the CBD on Instagram so you can get some discount code so you can try this stuff out you can leave us a review and tell us what you think have a good evening", "D5EDCvg4w8I": "hey there my name is Jennifer Dixon with thrive yoga and wellness and today I want to talk to you about a brand new product that we've recently started carrying here in the studio I'm super pumped about it because it is a CBD product that is an isolate so for those of you that are drug tested or maybe on pain management and you're not allowed to take a full-spectrum product this is a great option for you so before I get too much further let me talk to you a little bit about this this word isolate when you are taking an industrial hemp product like CBD if you take the full spectrum there is as much as 0.3 percent THC inside that dose inside each dose inside that bottle if you will this may or may not show up on your drug test in it is that because a hundred percent dependent on your body's mcdonough metabolism so for instance I could take a full spectrum and somebody else right beside me could and it might show up in a drug test for me because my body metabolizes the THC a little bit slower so here's the thing there's not enough THC in a full spectrum product to get you high it's not going to get you high but it is possible that it shows up on a drug test so for those of you that absolutely cannot have any THC you have have to go the isolate route this is a really great option because it's got zero THC they actually claim to be 99 percent THC for of THC free so such a small small small amount of THC that it shouldn't show up on your drug test now this is called even to herbals it's actually made out of New Hampshire it's made in New Hampshire and it's a really cool product I love it because it is super affordable inside this bottle there's 30 milliliters of product 30 milliliters of oil pink shirt that would give you thirty one milliliter doses and each dose would give you 33 milligrams of CBD ha tongue-twister right so let me talk to you about that again so inside this whole bottle is a thousand milligrams of CBD so let's go back to I think it was in third grade that we started learning fractions right so if we have 1000 milligrams and 1000 milligrams and 30 milliliters if we were to divide that by 30 we'd get about 33 milligrams of CBD in each dose and that's if you take a dose that is a full dropper full so when you order it it's going to come in a bottle it doesn't have any special packaging of its own I know that's kind of an industry trend that's happening is individual boxes for each one I kind of like it because why waste the paper so you get exactly what you get exactly what you see when you order this it's gonna come and bubble wrap and all that kind of stuff and then you're just gonna open it and you can I it's kind of like childproof you gotta have to push down on it to open but it's not a huge deal and when you're doing it make sure that you push it while you're screw unscrewing it because you want to be able to and otherwise you'll just be stuck there screaming and screaming and nothing ever happens okay so if you notice something this is a pretty clear liquid that's because it's an isolate and so usually when it's an isolated it's with a carrier oil in this case it's an MC t there's there's not a lot there to cover to color excuse me so it's a pretty clear fluid one of the things that I absolutely love about this particular product is that it is so mild flavor there's not a really strong earthy flavor if you catch my drift a lot of times TVD products you're not taking it because it tastes good right you're taking and because you want it to make you feel better you want it to help you sleep you want it to you know make you not want to yell at everything so the anxiety goes away so this is a really great really great way to get into it because it's so mild flavor like I said it is almost clear I'm not sure if you can see that I hope you can and on on the dropper there are a little delineation so I'm going to set my my bottle full and see if you can see that it shows like 0.5 0.2 5 0.75 and so then you can kind of back out your own mass so if you know one milliliter is thirty three milligrams of CBD and you don't want to take that much you could take a half of the one of those droppers 0.5 milliliters and then you know you're going to get about 1617 milligrams of CBD and that's about what I'm gonna take if I take too much more than I kind of I don't want to say I don't you don't get high but I just don't care about anything else and so I usually stay between 10 and 15 or so milligrams of CBD because that that takes away any sort of residual pain and anxiety that I might have it helps me sleep but I still can otherwise if I take too much then I just don't care and I want to sleep all day and that's not an ideal situation because I'm a mom of two really little ones so I need to care a little bit right so we've gone ahead and gotten myself point five milliliters inside the straw / super clear and this is amazing in terms of very very mild and what you're gonna do is you're gonna put it underneath your tongue and you want to sit there and let it wait about thirty to sixty seconds the longer it goes underneath your tongue the faster it's going to absorb yes if you swallow it you're gonna still get the benefits of it of the CBD but it's got to go through your entire digestive tract before you get those benefits so it's best to let it hang out there underneath your tongue if you've ever done oil pooling you know just channel your oil pooling pretend you're cleaning your teeth or whatever and just let it stay underneath your tongue because you're gonna start to feel it almost immediately when you can do that underneath your tongue and it's in it's really easy you've got your half a milliliter or I do right here and then you just open it up and you put it under and then you wait for the interest of this video I'm not gonna let it wait for the full thirty seconds because that would be pretty boring to sit there and watch because you just be sitting there watching me let it be underneath my tongue again you'll still get the benefits of the product even if you swallow it it's just gonna take a little bit longer and so for those of you that really can't fan you know the taste of oil or anything like that even if you swallow it or if you chase it with juice or whatever you're still gonna get the benefit it's just gonna take you a little bit longer because your body has to it's just like when you take an Aleve it's gonna take you like 3045 minutes to get the benefit again today this was Eden's herbals let me show you this bottle there was a thousand milligrams inside of this this particular product it is manufactured in New Hampshire it is 34 third party tested and I haven't even told you the best part price point of this is absolutely awesome if you consider what other market rates are for a thousand milligrams this is $42 that's it forty two dollars for thirty milliliters of a of a third party tested product is amazing I think my next my next cheapest price for the same size is like $70 so if you're new and you don't need the full spectrum and you are just a little bit nervous about spending that much money this Eaton's herbals might be a really good option for you to try because it's super smooth really easy to get to take and it's very affordable and again it is third-party tested so you know exactly what you're getting that's you you know you're gonna get thirty three milligrams in each milliliter the one thing that I will say that I should have said probably earlier is you own if you want to always mix it in when you are using an MCG like an all-natural coconut oil the it can said it can create a sediment it can separate so make sure you you shake these up I did that before the video started thank you so much for watching again my name is Jennifer Dixon with drive yoga and wellness and I can't wait to hear what you have to say if you give this Eden's", "XoFIshpwjU8": "hi and thank you for your interest in our full spectrum hemp therapeutics this product is our Durban poison 100 milligram full spectrum hemp oil this

company based in Brooklyn New York and they make these very high potency sublingual tinctures and that means it's going to be a tincture of liquid that you're going to be putting under your tongue in small amounts over long periods of time these are full-spectrum extract tinctures so it has CBD and other components from the hemp plant and the idea of a full-spectrum tincture is you're going to get all of the benefits that a CBD product can provide the anti-inflammatory the analgesic and pain relief the anti-anxiety and the antioxidant benefits of CBD extracts these products though the lock and key is not just making a tincture that has full spectrum extract they also put a whole lot other things in it some essential oils and plant terpenes I'm going to go over that right now now these extracts contain not just hem but also aid essential oil blend that includes sweet orange turmeric black pepper whole wood and wintergreen and a whole lot of terpenes as well and terpenes are flavorings from plants and in this case from the hemp plant the two bottles are both 30 milliliter bottles and they have graduated droppers for accurate accurate dosing so you know how much you're taking and certainly with tinctures of this elevated level of concentration you do want to use small amounts over long periods of time these are not meant for instant immediate you know effects you you want to slowly use tinctures of this type of high level of potency the the 1500 milligram so that's 1500 milligrams of CBD each one milliliter a dropper so a one dropper in a bottle of this size and a thirty milliliter bottle is roughly one milliliter each dropper has 50 milligrams of CBD the four thousand milligrams CBD or the extreme level what they call it is each drop or each one milliliter is one hundred and thirty-four milligrams of CBD so that's a lot so you do want to use it like I said in small amounts I can't stress that enough the effects of the terpenes are pretty interesting this these products have limonene and terrifi lean meer seen and these are highly fragrant compounds with citrusy and spicy and musky hints so you'll definitely taste them when you're using the tincture the effects of the terpenes may range from some pain relief to send some inflammation reduction but you know terpenes are definitely we're at the fringes of the science of terpenes and knowing how they really affect us but certainly in extracts like this when you compare you combined the terpenes with the hemp and the CBD you can get an overall very very good product that gives you a lot of wellness benefits the products also have an essential oil blend that makes them very unique the essential oils you know like central oils like terpenes are found in many plants and the ones they have in these are the sweet orange the turmeric black pepper oregano eucalyptus whole wood and wintergreen oils and they add a lot of sweet woodsy floral and minty sense to the tincture and they give the tincture or some very very very strong therapeutic benefits we get really really good feedback on these tinctures when people start using them they really report that it works great for them for a lot of the things that we're using it for and one of the things that we like about lock-and-key remedies and it really matches our business goals here at have headquarters is to really be concerned with quality making sure that you're making a good professional clean product and and we only stock products that are like that and lock and key remedies is one of the best that we found you know I've talked to the owner of many times and he is very very very concerned with making extremely good high quality products and only bringing to market stuff that they nose is going to be really really good and clean and really benefit people so if you're looking for something that's a very high dosage certainly a 1500 or a 4000 milligram tincture you know lock-and-key remedies tinctures are definitely one to consider and like I said before you do want to use these in very small amounts and then slowly over time hopefully you'll experience the benefits", "InB9xx41tkU": "hi y'all Becky page diamond ambassador I wanted to come and talk to you today really briefly about CBD and hemp as you've heard plexus is getting ready to launch into yet another new market and it's one that we're so excited about now here's the deal you might if you're like me you've probably started to see CBD sold in other places whether it's a shop on the corner depending on which which state you live in or whether it's through another company network marketing company perhaps sharing it and maybe some other places as well maybe even your integrative doctor has started to sell it and there's a reason why it's because CED has some pretty incredible effects on the body whether it comes to dealing with discomfort or mood disturbances or wanting a better sleep cycle there's a lot of different ways that CBD can be used and part of that is because of our awesome endocannabinoid system which affects every cell in your body so what I wanted to do is just to tell you that I was able to get a sample of the full spectrum hemp oil and I started using it on Friday night and here's what I've been noticing so first of all I slept terribly in Vegas it's probably due to the stress of having to get on stage in front of 12,000 people but I was grinding my teeth and I just wasn't in a familiar place and probably a lot of you had this experience as well you're over stimulated you've got some stress oxidative stress in your life and so you're not sleeping that great so when I took that full-spectrum hemp oil on Friday night left it under my tongue for 30 seconds to get that absorption started get the blood absorbing it and then swallowed it by the way it tasted amazing very mild flavor um I slept like the queen of the Dead like a zombie I don't think I moved literally think I was just out like a light and I thought to myself well this is probably you know just the effects of convention I was really stressed out I hadn't slept in multiple days I've had an exciting time but like a lot of you are learning excitement and stress your body can't always tell the difference so I thought okay I'll type I tried again the next night because it's pretty blown away tried it again the next night same thing Sunday night same thing last night same thing that's something that makes me so excited guys plexus has massively changed how I sleep in fact sleep was one of the biggest reasons why I got excited about plexus what if we can do an even better job right how could this help so many people so I hope that as many of you guys as possible are going after your three new ambassadors so that you can be a part of trying this product we need your experiences we are excited to know what other people are discovering as they put CBD and hemp oil to the test and I am so pumped to be a part of this

soothe to be very very helpful unlike ssris that can actually just really numb all of your senses and all of your feelings our soothed product really brings kind of that heightened sense of urgency that you feel um down to kind of a low whisper of urgency so it's makes everything much easier to deal with it kind of smooths everything out soothe has additives in it like 5-htp which is a natural amino acid that your body produces that helps in serotonin production so really it just kind of levels out those feelings of urgency and really does a much better job in my opinion than an ssri will [Music] you", "lxrhXWVQT_g": "what's going on guys my name's rich can see and I am a 6-time cancer survivor and founder of 5-time foundation and today we're going to talk about a really hot topic cannabis oil and dosing aka I don't like using this term nobody should use it he was the founding father yes but it's not called Rick Simpson oil it is called eco full extract cannabis oil and before we start this is gonna be a video about dosing because there's a whole misconception about it but first I would like to give a shout out to a very special woman who was almost like a mentor and she is my mentor Robin Swan Firebird touch therapy I love you very much and thank you for changing my life for the better so we're dumped we're gonna jump right into dosing okay and there's a misconception and it's you know it's 60 grams in 90 days or a gram a day and you know what I'm sure it works yes it does work but you're gonna you're gonna you're not gonna function Dara Daley okay I don't care if you smoked for 20 years if you wait 100 brownies you're not functioning okay it's tough and this is just a more effective way to have your body saturate in it okay I look really time with the white t-shirt and the chain but let's get into it okay well we like to call it what she started was a thing called micro dosing and this is a really great way to start and this is the way to do it and it allows your body to saturate in this and and it really absorbs it and you're still able to function throughout the day and do your thing okay if you're taking a gram a day you're gonna be tripping balls somewhere in a bush or they're gonna just be sleeping a lot like you know mommy likes her valium like one it always you know you don't want to do that okay my crack jokes in this video once in a while they might not be appropriate but I hope you still share it so I had this little card here that they made I kind of memorized it but if I look down at it you know don't frown upon I still know what I'm talking about okay so like it says here you know first of all I want to say make sure you know you're getting there there are people out there who mean well and they want to make this oil and they're making they're freaking backyard okay good stuff ain't cheap and cheap stuff ain't good remember that know what you're getting you want that golden color you know that golden tint to it you want to you know if you can get the lab certificate you know that'd be great tells you the percentages you want that eighty percent mark it's it's gonna work okay um and like they said you know you want to work up to 150 to 300 milligrams a day you could do the math you know five grams syringe obviously if there's 800 gram 800 milligrams in here per you know the deal will get into a to another time that'll be another video okay so this is called micro dosing okay and instead of starting instead of starting in the morning we're gonna start at night and we're gonna work our way backwards and we'll get into that so pretty much it's gonna it's called micro dosing I know if I said that already we're gonna you're gonna unscrew this top you're gonna take a toothpick you're gonna slide that just a tip just a tip like in high school you take the tip the cannabis oil eat it whatever your bedtime is an hour before bed I'll take it 10 p.m. by 11:00 I'm feeling nice it goes off you're good to go do this for two three days if you feel like it didn't affect you then you could skip the two to three day thing you're gonna go for hours prior which would be if you took it at 10:00 p.m. it would be 6 p.m. so now after that third day take that toothpick again do it at 6 p.m. then again I 10:00 p.m. go to bed guess what do that for 3 days another 3 days you're gonna jump another 4 hours prior that would be 2 p.m. I had to look down I'm bad at math ok so you're gonna start at 2 p.m. with the toothpick 6 p.m. with the toothpick 10 p.m. with the toothpick your fourth dose for fourth dose will be at 10:00 a.m. okay after another 3 days your body should be getting accustomed to that toothpick dose and guess what you can either decide to continue this way start it backwards or the scheduled start at 10:00 a.m. and work your way down to 10 p.m. and see how you feel and increase the dose every week you know I think I go I just go just go with it you know if you feel like oh I really didn't feel that drop at 6:00 p.m. take a little bit bigger drop at 2:00 p.m. but remember you can always eat more you can never eat less okay so be cautious what you're dosing cuz this stuff is strong okay and it is you shouldn't have any crazy side effects except rip balls and you know if you get really that hot you can end up like panicking I don't know or sleeping too long forget the picky kiddo from school I don't know whatever you got going on with yourself okay but this is called micro dosing okay it's 2019 no disrespect to the founding father and all this stuff that's 60 grams and 90 days is just a whole new thing you know and and don't forget this is the this is the basic way of taking it there's other ways to use cannabis oil dabbing it smoking it guess what for lung cancer yeah people vape this stuff and it's healthy for you okay and for cancers like I've seen like in the lower back or like cervical : you know prostate suppositories okay look into this stuff do your research me and Robin are gonna go on Facebook live and do our own videos and we're gonna get deeper into this stuff but this was on my head and there's a lot of you know you know they people don't know they're not educated on it you know and this stuff is medicine and it helps people and it helped me and I'm excited about taking it this way because the other way I could not do I was getting too high I couldn't function throughout the day I got fat it's not a bad thing some people need to gain weight and eat I'm back on track now ready to go so I hope this was an interesting video and I hope this helped you

if you want to check out that article with regards to what cbd is and where it comes from it's genesis and all that then click on the link below for the article that i wrote without further ado let's get to the review [Music] i'm going to be reviewing [Music] this which is cbd armor 10 percent cbd oil i said bumper i've been using this one for about two weeks and i'm really happy with it to be fair especially with regards to the price i mean some cbd oils i've purchased you're talking around 80 pounds for ones that has got like 1600 milligrams of cbd and to be fair this i think is an absolute bargain and a steal for the price for what you get for what's in it i would rig i would recommend this to anyone that's thinking about getting cbd be very reasonably reasonably priced and it's going to last you i'll say it's going to at least last you depending on your use obviously if you're battering it it's going to not last you as long but at the same time if you're using just four drops a night as i do it's going to last you about a month and after two months as you can see i've got a little dropper here oil consistency is quite good it's a lot more i would say a lot more but it's it's it's a little bit more watery than some cbds have had and some cbd's has been a little bit sludgier and with regards to the color as well the color is i'd say middle of the range i've had some cbd that's like black a little bit tar-like and i've had other ones that have been a little bit more crystal clear this one is pretty much middle of the road it's not too thick it's not too thin [Music] also taste now this is another big thing with cbd products because a lot of them they have they don't have any flavor easy as that for me it tastes it's it's more of a subtle taste than some cbd's and it tastes kind of almost wheaty but i know that's you know that's just my random taste buds but it's a subtle flavor it's not strong and doesn't have a bite i've had other cvds that have like a bit of a bite on your throat as you swallow them and can be a little bit off-putting to be fair and that's expensive ones as well but this one it's got a subtle taste it's got sort of like wheaty earthy taste not earthy earthy but it's got like a hint of earth in there but more wheat but it's not wheaty but it has that kind of a distinctive flavor to it um and as i say yeah i'm more than happy with it to be fair um but with regards to the benefits of cbd for those of you that are not familiar um [Music] it has benefits for sleep anxiety pain inflammation recovery helps with your appetite helps for relaxation i know there's also side effects of cbd things like stomach aches headaches things like that i know everyone's different but those are just the things that you should be aware of pros reasonably priced it's a good strength tastes okay it it's gonna last you a decent amount of time if you're looking for a cbd oil for any of the reasons i've mentioned before you're new to cbd as well a 10 ml bottle is more than enough and to be fair as well if you're trying this you're going to have to give it the full bottle to sort of see the effects i'm not going to say you tr you have a couple of drops of this and it's like yeah i feel great i'm not making that claim i'm saying try it give it a go might help increase your performance might help you sleep might help you at work there's a lot of things it might help for it's a good all-rounder but if i was to give my mark out of 10 for this product i would definitely give it nine the only reason it doesn't get more is probably because of the flavor but that something that i can live with i've not got a problem with at all and maybe it could be a little bit stronger but if it's a bit stronger it's gonna cost a little bit more and he's probably gonna put a lot of people off but for the price strength life of the bottle you can't go wrong with this so if you're interested in cbd give this a go also if you use my discount which is cbd 10 the letters cbd with 1 0 10 you'll also receive 10 discount on your order which makes the product even cheaper for me [Music] so there you have it that's my cbd review for

look at the CBD PM Sleep Aid from cbdMD. Packed with all-natural CBD oil and melatonin,\nthis product is designed to lull even the most restless sleeper straight off to dreamland,\nbut does it actually work? To find out, I tested the oil myself and let\nme tell you, I was genuinely surprised with the way it affected my slumber. Was it good, bad, awful, magical? I guess you'll just have to watch this video\nto see. Since launching in 2015, cbdMD has been on\na mission to produce the highest quality CBD oil in the industry. Though that's quite the lofty aim, the brand\nis endeavored to pulling off with the rigorous third-party testing and to focus on domestic\nhemp production here in the United States. In addition to it's more straightforward oil\ntinctures, the brand also sells CBD capsules, gummies, sleep aids, topical creams, vape\noils, bath bombs, and CBD oil for pets. The kind folks over at cbdMD were nice enough\nto send a ton of these herb products for us to try, many of which I was able to test out\non my own. We are going to be focusing almost exclusively\non the CBD PM oil on this review. I will say though that of the other products,\nI really loved these CBD gummies. You take one or two a day and you get this\nreally nice, strong, relaxing vibe that made me feel totally zen as I was going about my\nday. Out of these other products, I would definitely\nrecommend checking out the gummies. Back to the CBD PM tincture. To start, we're going to talk about all the\ningredients in this oil. The CBD PM Sleep Aid from cbdMD is both primarily\nwith CBD oil and melatonin. A lot of you out there may already be familiar\nwith melatonin, but the term CBD may be a bit of a head scratcher. Let me break it down for you. CBD, or cannabidiol, is one of more than a\nhundred different phytocannabinoids contained within the flower of the cannabis plant. The most popular, which is the psychoactive\ntetrahydracannabinol or THC. However, unlike THC, CBD is not psychoactive. I repeat, CBD does not trigger hallucinations\nor intoxication and is most commonly incorporated into creams and oils to treat everything from\njoint pain to anxiety, loss of appetite, and yes, even poor sleep. I should also add that it's totally legal\nto buy, purchase, and sell hemp-derived CBD in all 50 states. While the Internet has been buzzing about\nCBD's positive health benefits for years, there hasn't been that much research done\ninto its side effects. However, a 2011 survey, which aggregated data\nfrom numerous studies, did find CBD to be totally safe up to doses of up to 1,500 milligrams\nper day. In a 2017 study, which sought to add data\nto that survey, further found that not only was CBD safe for long-term chronic use, it\nalso had a better side effect profile when treating certain medical conditions like epilepsy\nand psychotic disorders. CBD is not the only thing that's going on\nin this oil. As I mentioned up top, there's also a lot\nof melatonin. Melatonin is the body's sleepy hormone. The idea here is that when you take an outside\nsource of melatonin and add it to your body's own natural supply, you're essentially increasing\nits overall effectiveness. We've got the CBD oil, we've got the melatonin,\nso what else is in this tincture? We've got a bit of what cbdMD is calling their\nproprietary blend. That's a blend of all-natural ingredients\nmeant to help induce, calm, and reduce anxiety. This blend is made up of Valerian root, chamomile,\nCascade hops, and lemon balm. To finish everything off, there is just a\nbit of mint flavoring, which helps to get rid of some of CBD's grassy taste. Now that we've gone over the ingredients,\nlet's get into my experience with the CBD PM Sleep Aid. The CBD PM Sleep Aid comes in a 30-serving\nbottle and retails for $45. If you're taking the oil for restlessness,\nthe brand recommends taking a full dropper of this stuff every night about 15 to 30 minutes\nbefore bed. A full dropper contains 16 milligrams of CBD\nand about 5 milligrams of melatonin. For reference, that's a pretty low to mild\ndosage of CBD and a really high one of melatonin. You may want to play around with the dosage\nto find the one that's going to be right for you. They recommend taking a full dropper but they\nalso say that maybe a half dropper could work for you, a quarter of a dropper. I would suggest playing around with the dosage\na little bit. I'm about six feet tall, 165 pounds, and already\nfamiliar with CBD and melatonin so I decided to take a full dropper every night before\nbed. When I talk about my experience, I'm going\nto break it down into falling asleep, staying asleep, and the morning after. Before I do any of that, I've got to let you\nin on a little secret. Though I would look fabulous in a white lab\ncoat, I'm not a doctor so everything I'm about to share with you is based solely on my personal\nexperience. If you're looking to change your sleep regime\nor looking to try CBD or melatonin for the first time, I highly recommend that you consult\nwith a medical professional before doing so. All right, now let's jump into my experience,\nstarting with falling asleep. One of my biggest nighttime problems is falling\nasleep. As soon as my head hits the pillow, it feels\nlike my mind is swirling with dozens of thoughts and ideas, which make it so difficult to slip\ninto the syrupy half-consciousness of slumber. When I'm looking at a new supplement, I really\nneed to know that it's going to be able to relax my body and quiet those thoughts so\nI can get to sleep. I've got to say the CBD PM Sleep Aid was a\nreal winner in that department. About 15 minutes after taking the supplement,\nI could feel this really intense wave of calm washing over my body. My shoulders felt relaxed. Even my knee caps were relaxed. I just felt totally zen. My thoughts were quieted as well so it was\nreally easy for me to get to sleep. If falling asleep is my number one problem,\nstaying asleep is a very close number two. For me, most nights I wake up in the middle\nof the night around 2:00 or 3:00 AM, either from a stray thought or a bad dream or simply\nbecause my body is so tired of trying to fall asleep that it's desperately hoping that it's\nmorning. When a take a new supplement, I need to know\nthat it's not only going to knock me out, but it's going to keep me dreaming all the\nway until morning. Unfortunately, the CBD PM Sleep Aid didn't\nreally do that for me. It was really easy for me to fall asleep when\nI took it, but it didn't keep me sleeping throughout the night. I found that I woke up most nights around\n2:00 or 3:00 AM. Finally, the morning after. Typically when I take melatonin supplements,\nI notice a deep sense of a grogginess the next day. My limbs are really heavy, my mind is foggy,\nso much so that it makes me wonder if it was even worth taking the sleep aid in the first\nplace. The morning after is a really important factor\nfor me to consider when thinking about sleep supplements. I'm happy to report that the CBD PM sleep\nsupplement didn't leave me feeling groggy at all. I felt clearheaded and ready to go in my day. [background music] Cody: All right, now that we've gone over\nthe ingredients and dug into my experience, it's time to wrap up this sucker with some\npros and cons. Let's start with the pros. First and foremost, I loved how well the sleep\nsupplement was able to get me to sleep. I found that as soon as I took it, about 15\nto 30 minutes afterwards I was feeling calm, relaxed, and ready to drift off to dreamland. Number two, it tasted great. CBD usually has this grassy, mossy taste to\nit, but the mint flavoring that they put into this sleep aid really made it taste super\nyummy. If you've stayed away from CBD because of\nthe taste, I think that this could be a real winner for you. Finally, price. At $45, that's a pretty affordable price for\nCBD, which usually goes for around $100 and $140. I think price-wise, it's a nice budget buy. Now to the cons. First and foremost, the CBD PM Sleep Aid didn't\nreally help me to stay asleep. Though I got to bed super easily, I found\nthat I woke up most nights around 2:00 or 3:00 AM. Secondly, it was kind of hard to open. Most of these oils that have the dropper,\nyou know, you push down and twist off and it's really easy, but for some reason I had\ntrouble opening this one. If you're someone who has difficulty opening\npill bottles or other oral tincture things, you may want to watch out for that here. All right folks, that about does it for this\nreview of the CBD PM Sleep Aid from cbdMD.

nation and today I have for you review of Piper's UK CBD oil 5% if you're new here welcome on Green Valley nation channel will publish reviews of CBD products from all over the world and if you would like to read the full detailed review of this product you will have to visit our website and of course link you can find down below before I talk specifically about this product I would like to give you some background information about a company that made it so biopore UK is a subsidiary company of biopore Slovakia and they offer a wide range of organic organic vegetable oils cosmetic oils and also essential oils all of the hemp products from bio pores are certified organic unfortunately the CBD is not really the main focus of the company and so they offer only five different varieties of CBD oils but you can still be sure that those orioles are the highest quality this ten milliliter bottle contains 500 milligrams of CBD and because it's a whole plant extract it contains not only CBD but also other cannabinoids Terrapins and flavonoids and all of those ingredients give you a nice intosh effect before I start sharing with you my personal experience with bio first five percent CBD oil I would like to talk about certificate of analysis so it is very important that when you buy CBD product you should ask a retailer or you should ask a producer for the lab test results or this product because you want to be sure that the product you're buying that it contains advertised amount of CBD so for this product I found certificate of analysis on the website unfortunately it wasn't updated so I wrote an email to the retailer and also to a producer asking to send me a current luck test results from this year and of course they did that unfortunately this product you cannot find the batch number of on any on the label so it's really hard to say whether they the lab test results which they send me whether they are actually for my product happily I was informed that from 2020 bio pores will start putting batch number on the label so that's a very good information certificate of analysis that I received that presumably belongs to that oil said that the tested sample contained four point six percent of CBD and as you can see on a bottle it's a it says five percent that's why it's very important to get the lab test results again it's a small difference but you should know that in this case you are getting slightly less oil and then it is advertised on the label from the certificate of Anneliese I also found out that these the tested sample contained 0.18 percent of THC and let me remind you that in you in European Union the allowed limit is 0.2 so again the tested sample contained of course it's contained legal amount of Steel C but it was very close to the limit right now let's take a closer look at bio-ports 5% CBD oil as you can see this 10 milliliter bottle has built-in dropper it is in a dark bottle so that's good because it prevents fat oxidation and CBD extract is diluted in hemp oil and on an organic hemp oil and on the label you can find information about the storage so you should store the oil in dark and cool place and also dry place such as the dose is to 3 drops 2 to 3 times a day and you should allow you should put it under your tongue and allow it to dissolve for like 3 minutes I think that 3 minutes is pretty long but ok the producer put that information on a label so we have to believe that mmm we also have here a label that this product is certified organic and I really like and I'm really happy to see that also we have here a QR code that directs us to the website right now I will unscrew the cap and let me tell you that of course yeah this product smells a little bit like hemp but it's not anything unpleasant so that's very good and right now I will take a little bit of the oil as and as you can see it has really nice yellow color and it has inside some particles I must say that it looks like it's not really very well filtrated and right now I would like to show you how to take this CBD oil so you take a little bit and as the producer recommends you should take up at the beginning you should take 2-3 drops and you should put them under your tongue and allow it to dissolve in my opinion taking this product is really pleasant experience I know with other CBD oil sometimes they taste bitter but it's not the case with this product however I have to mention that when my first time took it I took our free 3 drops if I remember call it correctly unfortunately it didn't give me any strong effect but again with severely oils sometimes you have to wait a few days or even weeks to really feel the effect so in my opinion after after taking it for longer time and slightly increasing the dose I could really feel the calming effect of bio pores for 5% CBD oil this product helped me specifically before Christmas so you may probably experience that as well that December is very busy month we have a lot of projects that we have to close before a New Year's there are also many Christmas parties you have to prepare Christmas you have to prepare Christmas decoration by proud buy presents so this is very busy month and I had few stressful situations when I where I had anxiety then I decided to increase the dose of CBD I'm taking and I think I could handle the situations much better than I would otherwise also I think that it really helped me to sleep because at night a few times I forgot to take to take CBD oil and then I find myself you know overthinking having troubles falling asleep but when I took that this DVD this bio porous CBD 5% oil I was able to fall asleep much easier so I think that is a really good product if you are looking for CBD oil that helps to ease your anxiety helps you fall asleep that would be all what I have prepared for you today if you have any questions about this product please write a comment down below of course I strongly encourage

guys this is your boy Krusty pickles we're gonna start a new segment on this channel covering mental health some of you might know that I struggled from depression and anxiety a lot of you can probably hear it in my voice and my tone that I'm kind of monotone most of the time and I'm not very excited yeah so what we're gonna do today is I've kind of become an affiliate of a company called thought cloud they sell CBD products and today I'm going to review this full-spectrum CBD vape juice see if we can get you I've got the flavor orange creamsicle let's see it is it I'm not sure if that's coming in good enough but it's 600 milligrams of CBD per bottle this is a 30ml bottle take you to the website here in a second and show you what it is but this segment is going to be all about finding natural remedies to treat anxiety and depression I should be going over stuff that I got to do as far as diet and stuff is concerned as well that'll come through blogs and everything but for now we're going to review this CBD vape juice from thought flag so let's go ahead and go over to the website alright as you can see this is the full spectrum vape CBD it's six iron milligrams for a 30ml bottle that is the price right now I did get it on sale so I paid a little bit less than that but as you can see it's about 46 bucks which actually when it comes to CBD oil 600 milligrams that's a pretty strong dose and that's not a bad price considering how strong of a dose it is but anyways it contains well listen let's go on down here it says it's non psychoactive the flavours you got to choose from it they got a good amount of flavors like they got banana cake banana split birthday cake bubble gum cheesecake I'm gonna try that cherry cola got to try that chocolate cherry got to try that eggnog French toasts horchata mojito orange creamsicle which I have here pina colada strawberry lime made and waffles I never thought I'd see waffles as a flavor for a CBB vape juice or any vape juice really but here we got says the world's first and only non PG based full spectrum CBD vape juice now that's that's what is a good thing it's non PG based which PG is a propylene glycol and it's what's associated with what they're calling popcorn lung it's a the thing you always hear about when they're trying to discredit vaping and say that it's not that healthy for you it's because of the PG and actually PG if you're one of them cloud chasers anyways you're not gonna want PG in your in your stuff anyways because it's not as good for clouds alright so it contains medium-chain triglycerides CBD I don't even know how to pronounce the actual word for it it is sugar-free gluten-free vegan friendly fruit and salt based flavor so it's pretty well all-natural it's non psychoactive non toxic non toxic and ingestible now I want to go over something real quick it might even say here in a second with the full spectrum CBD that means it's got a little bit of everything in it it's so even though it says right here not psychoactive it does have a slight bit of THC in it because from what I was reading online the full spectrum deep CBD oils they have about 0.3 th point percent THC so just know that it does have a little bit in it made from a hundred percent organic raw non-gmo hemp-based grown hemp plants grown on select farms and Colorado's USA so that's my hometown no herbicides pesticides or chemical fertilizer used so it's grown in a positive way really cool the way they they grow on it approximately six hundred drops in a total you know of the 30 mil bottle lab tested for purity per batch and it says fill your vaporizer with reservoir with juice and use 12 to 25 puffs per day that's going to be actually quite a bit for me because I don't vape that much but I'm probably going to be vaping it on the house now here's a as kind of like a disclaimer I just want to say don't buy this stuff and then decide you want to puff on it on your way to work because this stuff is pretty potent even though it's not psychoactive you will fill effects it can make you it can make you feel a little sluggish especially if you haven't done it that much one thing I noticed after I started using this was I suffer from a lot of pain as well because I used to ride motorcycles these direct bicycles play basketball plays football my youth has taken a toll on my body so it's pretty much everything on my body hurts to the point of sometimes I can't even stand or walk so I'm used to this day-to-day chronic pain well I started puffing on this and I noticed that I didn't feel any pain it was almost I hope I had almost like a full body euphoria because I'm so used to feeling pain constantly that when I didn't feel it it was just I felt like a full body high if that makes any sense so that was a I was an interesting experience so III definitely recommend this if you're trying to relax if you're trying to temporarily relieve pain because it will do that and I have noticed a little bit of a pick me up on the mood I haven't quite had as many bad thoughts I have been suicidal in the past and since I've started doing this vague Jews here that mean up past two days I haven't had any thoughts like that so that's a good thing it does say please note that the MCT oil base will burn if overheated the vapor should not be used in the pin it has a voltage above eight point five watts now I'm not sure what power this is I think the battery is 3.7 volts and I think this is a point five ohm coil in here I do have the other tank which actually come with this mod and it has a point 3 ohm in it and it vapes quite a bit heavier shot but that has a burnt-up coil I got to replace it and this one's on its way out as well so I don't know if this is overkill or not this is the eleaf I just do and I definitely recommend it if you're gonna just be starting to get into vaping it's not something you'd want if you're an extreme cloud chaser because I mean it does good I mean it's high but this is just a beginners type of deal and it's cheap so they do have a vape pen made for this available on the website I might review it here in the future sometime but we'll see about that later this place has a lot of reviews this uh this particular full-spectrum oil I just go over a couple brighter quick yeah this person gave it a 5 star first time purchasing CBD and staff was super helpful to answer all my questions over the phone I had done research and had a lot of questions out of the full-spectrum a peep CB CBD my favorite flavor is the mojito of course it's all a matter of preference next I like the unique orange flavor of orange creamsicle which is what I have and I gotta agree you definitely get a heavy flavor on this it's probably one of the most flavorful they've juices I've ever tasted followed by the more sweeter strawberry limeade those are the only flavors up tried I don't have anything negative to say about the product itself I tend to take some drops at night to help fall asleep and vape during the day for general health so I mean you've got all these positive reviews so it's definitely a good product and obviously I'm giving it a positive review myself obviously I'm making this video it's a good good product I definitely recommend it alright so what I really think about this product it vapes really good got a good strong flavor a lot stronger flavor through the vape then I've tasted out of any other vape juice that I've tried it does work very good to the point of since it was my first try I don't recommend taking it before work that's all I could say you're in for a long day if you're if your first time taking it before work maybe if you have a high tolerance but I can't recommend it at work at all ever this is definitely something you want to do after a long day's work and you're trying to relax or if you're on an off day and you're worried about bills or whatever have an anxiety take some puffs off this half hour later hour later you're good to go because it's definitely definitely definitely good product the price CBD is expensive to begin with so it's definitely going to be a little bit more than regular vape juice but this is one of the cheaper prices I've seen for CBD oil at this level this our milligrams that's insane price for 600 milligrams because I've I think my first one that I ever bought was like 250 milligrams and it was like a fifty bucks for a bottle of it was like 15 milliliters so half this size for 50 bucks and it was only like 250 milligrams and then I used to buy some that was only 5 milligrams for 15 bucks a pop for a 10 mil bottle so it's it's definitely worth the money if you are struggling with anxiety or pain we'll see how it works with depression as far as sleeping I almost forgot this bit I slept like a rock yesterday I hadn't been sleeping that good lately I just been toss and turn and toss and turn and wake up Pete wake up Pete you know just seemed like every hour on the hour I was waking up well I hit this stuff for the first time last night or yesterday and I just knocked out like I was out cold the whole night so it definitely helps you sleep

than answers then I hope you'll find this video helpful today we're going to talk about our 500 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil tincture which comes in a thirty millimeter or one ounce bottle in this video I'll be explaining what full-spectrum means for you how to read a lab tests for CBD potency and legal TAC amounts and how to take the CBD oil how to get the most out of the CBD tincture and then explain how to calculate dosages full-spectrum CBD or cannabinoids is a hemp extract that contains a hundred and thirteen known cannabinoids found naturally occurring in the hemp plant including terpenes essential oils and other cannabinoids these work together to magnify the therapeutic benefits of each individual cannabinoid this is commonly referred to as the entourage effect full-spectrum CBD also contains 0.3 percent THC or less or at least it should in order to determine if a product is under legal THC limit reputable CBD companies like ours test their products with a certified third-party lab test a lab test is what we call in the business a co a certificate of analysis there's two questions you should always ask yourself one does my product have the amount of CBD as advertised on the label and two does my product meet the required federal limit of no more than 0.3% THC so let's take a look at our coa to see if the amount of CBD matches with what's advertised on our label look at the CBD on the left and then all the way over to the right you'll see 17 point to 9 milligrams per milliliters 17 point to 9 milligrams times 30 milliliters equals 519 milligrams of CBD in our hey we went over the amount good for us our bottle indicates that it has 500 milligrams so you know you're getting the potency you pay for okay and - does my product meet the required federal limit of no more than 0.3% THC so let's look at the very top line where it says d9 - THC and then go to weight percentage so anything below zero point three zero weight percentage is legal according to the 2018 farm bill okay let's talk about dosage so I can't tell you what dosage is right for you you know that's something that you're gonna have to figure out on your own I'll give you some tips but the only thing I would recommend is starting out with a low dose first and then working up from there if needed I mean that's what I did the truth is dosage varies drastically between individuals due to inconsistent potency and then of course the instructions from the manufacturers as well as the desired strength of the individual some CBD research has reported doses ranging from 5 milligrams to over a thousand milligrams generally a product with less than 15 milligrams per milliliter is considered low potency a product with 15 to 50 milligrams per milliliter is regarded as standard potency and then a product with more than 50 milligrams per milliliter or more is considered high potency for more information on dosages go to the education stabbed and then dosages a word of caution here though it is still possible that you could test positive for THC even though the THC level is very low but even if you're taking what is considered high potency then naturally you're more at risk so your job or profession requires a drug test let's say you're a driver or something don't risk it you could always take our THC free isolate CBD gummies okay so I suffer from lower back pain I've had lower chronic back pain for some time now and I'm an insomniac so I take two droppers in the morning when I wake up and to droppers before i go to bed now when i say a dropper full it's more like two-thirds of a dropper let me just show you alright as you can see here the dropper is not full but it's hard to get a full dropper full if you could it would be one milliliter I get a consistent dropper full by first squeezing the dropper bulb fully like this and then I submerge the dropper and then I let go quickly when I pull that up you can see that I have about the same amount every time I do that which is about 2/3 of a dropper I calculated that I could get 49 droppers out of a 30 in a liter bottle so I divided my 500 milligrams that's in the bottle divided by 49 droppers and this equals 10.2 milligrams per dropper let's just say this is rounded off to 10 you could use the same math of course if you have a lower or higher content I started off slower I started off doing just 1 mil 1 drop or fall or 10 milligrams and I really wasn't feeling the benefit but once I upped it to twice that amount to 20 milligrams and yes I felt the difference and during the day not only does my back feel better but I'm also less anxious and at night before I go to bed I noticed that I feel much more relaxed and it calms my racing mind I constantly thinking way too much before I go to bed again not everyone is the same so figure out what dosage works for you we have great educational section a great educational section on our website under the education tab for more information on dosages most experts agree that taken CBD tincture sublingually has the most vile availability bioavailability refers to the degree and rate at which an administered drug or other substance is introduced into the body in order to have an active effect you can lose the effectiveness of CBD if it has to pass through the digestive system sublingual glands absorb the CBD oil into your bloodstream quicker and more effectively so what I do is I'll take my my dropper I go under the tongue and then I'll hold it for like 60 seconds before swallowing I actually don't time myself but I walk around with it under my tongue for at least two minutes before I swallow it this concludes the video I hope this video was educational for you if you want to know more about CBD please visit our website at herbie CBD calm thank you", "mY20TICyT8g": "what's going on everyone my name is chris here at CBD review lab and today i'm reviewing the savage CBDs 1000 milligram full spectrum CBD oil specifically their peach and pear flavor so savage CBD is based in California and they've been in the CBD game since 2015 and they carry a massive selection of products all of which are a third-party tested by SC labs so you know you're getting products that you can trust when I was looking at the certificate of analysis for this specific product the lab results showed that there's actually over 42 milligrams of CBD per milliliter in this product so while they market it had 1000 milligrams it's actually close four to twelve hundred and sixty milligrams of CBD which I'm totally cool with so the oil itself has a clear appearance to it and it has a nice fruity smell and taste with absolutely no bitterness where cannabis taste at all it is hands-down the best tasting CBD oil I've tried so far and I've tried quite a few CBD oils so my dosage for this product has been two milliliters which according to the certificate of analysis is over 80 milligrams of CBD and I've been very pleased with the results I find that it doesn't relax my body as much as other CBD oils but it does seem to relax my mind and it makes me very sleepy I don't know if the CBD strain that they use to make their products is a sativa but I seem to feel it more in my head than in my body which I'm actually a big fan of I love getting that body high from CBD but this is been quite enjoyable as well so as far as price goes this Teamster runs $85 if you use the discount code CBD review lab and if we go off the lab results which say there's 1260 milligrams of CBD in this product the price comes out to under seven cents per milligram of CBD and I consider 10 cents to be average so it's below average so to summarize I think savage CBD offers a solid CBD oil it works well and it's under ten cents per milligram so I've got a link to their website in the description below and don't forget to use the discount code to save some money if you end up trying them out so thank you so much for watching I hope this video was helpful if you have any questions please leave them down below I hope everyone has a great day peace", "Ru1pvQTaOdM": "hey guys Justin and Jennifer here with Rob yoga him store hey guys she's gonna bring you a quick review of a new product we just got it's called our I believe is how I pronounce it I like a pirate like a party anyway it's a European product and I'm gonna bring you I'm gonna show you the six hundred milligram bottle today so the good thing I like about art is it comes well packaged it's very easy to see what's in here and they take quite good care of how they package each product isn't that pretty like that's a really cool packaging yeah that's good so in that way because it chips from Europe you have to worry about a bottle getting messed up or anything like that so I'm gonna be reviewing number six today we've already reviewed number three well I reviewed it so make sure you subscribe to our channel to see it so the great thing about this product is it comes in a nice I call it a new color with black accents nude marking and it's really easy to read the other great thing about this is you can look on the side of the label and you can see everything that's in it and how they process it so it's co2 extracted it's non-gmo it's organic it's 100% vegan which really makes a difference on how the quality of the product another really great thing about this particular company is they grow everything in Europe they have headquarters in both the US and in Europe but everything is grown in Southeast Europe they don't tell you exactly where but as a result of that the amount of THC in each of their products that they only carry full-spectrum at this point is 0.2 percent or below so if the amount of THC in your product is something that you're concerned about European standards require a lower amount in the US we can have 0.3% but in Europe you can only have point two so in all of the ire health products its 0.2 percent or lower the other awesome thing about IR in general European standards can be mmm a little bit more stringent yeah different than the u.s. there are a little more stringent and so our health action they on their website they're really proud once you click on the information about each product you're gonna be able to see once it pops up here it is on the iPad that they are European Food Safety Authority certified which is awesome and so you know what you're getting is exactly going to be the same thing every single time because they're also GMP certified as well that's interesting it's good to know because you know that with so many new products coming onto the market and people say they're being tested and all that sort of stuff you know that this company is is legit because they're following such strict manufacturing protocols so the great thing too is when you open the box it has a nice solid black bottle so you know that oils were protected in there the other thing about this is the oil is a nice dark green color and I'm about to drip it yeah I can it's yes that's right precious commodity here yeah so this has a to me it has a strong plant flavor I don't really taste the medium-chain oil that they use or coconut oil so it but it doesn't taste bad it's a if plant flavor if you don't mind it then you're gonna love this product if flavor is a issue for you then you know what get it anyway because it works great and it's a great value and you're not taking it because it's desert you're taking it because it can help relieve anxiety it can help you to sleep it can help reduce inflammation and because it's a full-spectrum product you know you're gonna get the benefits of the entourage effect and that's where all those chemicals are working together in your in your favor so to speak chemicals meaning cannabinoids inside this cannabis product that's right so they recommend a full dose or a full dropper one to two full droppers a day based on you as as you need I take two because I need about twenty milligrams and hour 20 milligrams or more depending on the day because I have back issues and knee pain we're working on him practicing more yoga yes so that's a good thing about it is I can do one dropper in the morning and probably by mid-afternoon three or four o'clock and probably do another one so that I feel better the fact that is sativa brandt sativa blend it doesn't really keep me awake as long as I don't take it I'm like Jennifer I can't take it right before bed because it will keep me awake a little bit or just doesn't really keep me awake it just slows me from falling asleep as quickly as I normally do when I take the indica Brent the indica blends or whatever I really like this product it's a great value for this 30ml bottle it's less than 50 bucks and the other great thing about our is they're very transparent they show you everything there third-party tested and everything that shows up on the third-party test they offer on their website which I'm going to show you they break it down in a nice graph if you'd like to read graphs or they break it down by each individual line item product which is really nice because not everybody in the industry does that now and that's really really annoying it's mostly the newer folks to the market that are being so transparent our health was created it was um formed in 2018 so it's a newer company so I believe that the newer companies are just being more open and honest and transparent about what's in them and let me show you what this so you're gonna see the potency test so you know exactly how much the Delta 9 THC and the THC a is in there and the CBD in this product there's six hundred and ten milligrams of CBD in it which is actually a little bit more right than higher than what they sell what they say on the outside would you light most people will go lower so you're getting a benefit of a higher quality product in this one oh yeah slightly more potent concentrated product but the other here here it is you're gonna list out every single cannabinoid that's in the product which i think is awesome I know that research is still in its infancy in terms of what the different cannabinoids can do for your system but the early research suggests that each of them contribute in a different way slightly to your overall health and so it's really awesome so for example the CBD just plain CBD in the CBD a total to be about a little over 600 milligrams so CBD a is 450 milligrams a unit CBD is 215 so it's just showing you that you're getting a lot of that CBD that you want which is that what we need to have a what more healthy life that's right since we're not daughters and we want to thrive good placement yeah alright guys so that's it for today there again check out

and why it's by far the best brand that I've ever dealt with or tried okay welcome to the channel if you're new here and like what you see consider subscribing and before we get any further I do want to say a huge thank you to Nirvana for sponsoring this video the only reason I accepted this and went through with the sponsorship is because I absolutely love these products and I will break down why the first time I ever tried CBD I was at a vapor expo in California and a friend of mine Louis when I was down there with hometown hero he and I both tried it and we got rocked like three sheets to the wind completely high there's no other way to explain it we were high I used to smoke weed a lot so I know what that feels like and we were high and then so from there I was very reluctant and hesitant understandably to to try CBD again there was a reason I quit smoking weed and stopped getting high and I did not like feeling like that in that setting and you know it was a big surprise and it was just really terrible I did not like it that's forward I've been getting a lot of a lot of emails from a lot of different CBD companies asking if I will review their products and because of that experience I had and then because of the lack of regulation in the industry and some of the shadiness that I see I'm very skeptical about CBD it's a supplement right and like other supplements even the ones that like health stores like GNC like I don't know I don't know if what they're saying is in the bottle is actually in the bottle and at what amounts and dosing was always kind of weird to me because I always saw like you know tinters and and all kinds of stuff and it was never really clear on like how to dose and and for me here's what I'm dealing with I get migraines frequently I've got neck issues knee issues and I'm just getting older you know I'm just getting older so I've got kind of you know aches and pains and and some other things and I eat ibuprofen by the handful all day long and so I've been really looking for something to help take that pain away and not to mention just deal with my general anxiety that I have a really bad anxiety keeps me up at night and Nirvana has come in and really just kind of blown my mind CBD in general and if you guys would like me to cover CBD and kind of break it down what is it where does it come from the different types in a separate video let me know in the comments I've been doing a little bit of research I think I want to tackle that topic so if you're interested in that please let me know but CBD comes in a lot of different forms and some varieties so there's isolate broad spectrum and full spectrum all of Nirvana's products are broad spectrum and in my opinion that's the good stuff like that's where it's at now unfortunately because of the way YouTube is I'm not going to show you using this product because I think that might be against their Terms of Service I don't really know I really do not want to get a strike on my channel but what I can say is that I've been using these products for about a month now and I love them let me show you some of the varieties they offer and then I'll talk more about about the different products CBD isn't like a cure-all there's definitely a lot of research that needs to be done and all I can talk about is my personal experience and anecdotal evidence and experience that I've I've seen from other people CBD comes in a variety of different forms and the form you choose will really depend on what your end goal is so for me personally for like topical stuff like my knees for some reason I'm having pain in my hand kind of feels like arthritis I'll use something like the CBD roll-on which is awesome so this is like an oil that you roll on and then rub in or one of the lotions and I love these on mine on my back on my neck and they have a muscle recovery lotion which is great for like after the gym for me personally it helps with soreness and any kind of aches and pains for anxiety things like that you're probably going to want something more internal and same with sleep so for sleep they have the excellent melatonin one right here and this has melatonin in it and the CBD alone so even if you just did the natural one the CBD by itself helps me sleep and helps me stay asleep which is key and so I like the capsules for that they also have gummies and twenty gummies at 500 milligrams so what I love about Nirvana CBD products as you can see right here 20 gummies by 25 milligrams per gummy equals 500 milligrams of CBD other gummies aren't as detailed as far as what's in what you're getting and this just makes dosing a lot easier dosage recommendation was big for me too because I didn't know where to start and I didn't want to feel like I was getting getting any kind of head change which most people say you won't but I definitely get a little bit of a head change if I take too much of really good CBD this has zero THC in it some CBDs will so make sure you you check the label and if you don't want any THC like me I don't want any THC at all broad-spectrum is the way to go for me because of the zero THC CBD legally can have up to like point zero 3 or 0.3% of it I think something like that but there's a very trace amount in some CBD allowed by loft make sure you check the label and know what you're getting into if you don't want CBD or if you don't want THC as you can see here we Jess and I really like these gummies she's primarily been been going to town and these gummies she'll take one before bed helps her stay asleep a note about the gummies they are delicious without like any kind of weird flavor they're just really edible you can see yeah they're definitely like a little they have some residue in there but one thing I've noticed about these gummies is that they're just quality they're built well they don't have a bunch of extra sugar and stuff on them and yet they still taste delicious and they're still really effective one of the big reasons that I stay away from most brands is because of the dosing and with with Nirvana it makes it extremely easy to dose even if you're gonna do at inter right you because the bottles have this really fantastic dropper that outlines the milliliters so you can figure it out and dose exactly what you want and at that point for me like this is more this is definitely like a medication I treat it like a medication and I want to be precise with that and this brand allows me to do that which I love so not only is it extremely high quality stuff they have amazing flavors for the Tincher peppermint vanilla strawberry grapefruit and all of these are extremely high quality you know what you're getting you know it's good stuff that's why I'm such a huge fan of this brand now premium brands are going to be more expensive and Nirvana is no exception in my opinion I'd much rather spend more for quality stuff that has in it what it says is in it so if it says 500 milligrams that's what I'm getting rather than paying you know cheap prices for some cheap cheap CBD that could be god-knows-what or maybe not have as much as it says it does and I just don't want to have to worry for me this is one of those things that paying the extra money really pays off this Nirvana CBD has helped me sleep better have less anxiety it's helped me stop taking as much ibuprofen as I do really awesome because I don't know what God knows what that's doing to my stomach and it just works it just works roll-on oil is fantastic for my hand that started hurting all of a sudden I just roll it on both sides and rub it in a one word of caution like I have small kittens small children so I don't use any of the lotions or the oil roll ons and then go play with them because I don't want it to contact them and get on them so if it's going to be during the day I'll just take a capsule know exactly what I'm getting the exact dose its repeatable its precise I can't say enough good things about this brand I love the product and I'm a believer in CBD if you haven't tried it yet I would highly recommend trying it and if you don't want any kind of head change like I didn't start at a low dose starts small and work your way up I started with 0.25 milliliter dose for the first couple couple nights and then worked my way up to the recommended dose overall I highly recommend nirvana if you're in the market for CBD I will have them linked in the description if you'd like some more information if you have any questions or concerns definitely drop them in

in the mail from a CBD oil\ncompany called Pure Hemp Botanicals down twist open we have a seal brand new\nmint try it for the first time again pure hemp botanicals all right so we're\nbreak the seal there's 25 mints I guess I'm going to try two mints here pop in\nthe mouth it's a hard mint so it's gonna last little all flavor is on point\nstrawberry mango it is okay so after about 45 seconds of this mint in my mouth\nit starts to dissolve and then you can nice and easily and it tastes\nactually got better as it fell apart and put it in my mouth and I'm doing a\nlittle bit more I LOVE THE MINT I could say I absolutely love this mint has a good strawberry mango after taste to it it so I think I'm gonna pop another one\nbecause I want a little bit more than 10 milligrams the CBD.  So, I want about 20\nmilligrams I'm here at home just got done work\nkick it make some dinner popping the second mint I'll get back to you guys\nabout 30 or 45 minutes...to tell you what happend Alright y'all so I'm back\nhere it's about 30-45 minutes later and I want to say I'm definitely a lot more\nchill out right now I was anxious I was able to really focus and make some\ndinner here tonight for myself a little bit of meal prep and things like that so\nI would say these mints tasted good they worked well\ndefinitely definitely reduce my stress levels and they taste it well and I\nthink people that are gonna be around me if I do it at work or somewhere\nelse are  going  to love the fact that I\nhave these mints Pure Hemp Botanicals legit stuff, great tasting strawberry mango Here we go Tim McComsey I have with me the CBD oil\nthis time I have pure hemp botanicals 300mg oil tincture - booyah so I just got done a workout supposed to help with anti-inflammatory and recovery purposes\nso we are gonna test it out we're gonna see how it works and once you guys know\nwhat I think about it so maybe you can incorporate it in your pre or post\nworkout routines wherever that might be strength training endurance cardio\nkickboxing swimming all that good stuff so here we go with the 300 milligrams basically unseal it's nice to see a\nbrand new container here I'm gonna do a whole dropper full right underneath my\ntongue and we'll swish it around you guys swish it around for one minute like it says just the sipara dissolved\nthe reason being because it gets absorbed into your bloodstream a little\nbit easier hasn't really taste to it which not too bad driver which I did is about ten\nmilligrams of your CPD their natural hemp oil contains high grade CBD made\nfor 100% industrial non-gmo hemp so once you open this container you must or your\nrefrigerator so stay fresh longer also good news is it's vegan and gluten free\nso that is perfect so again this is pure had botanicals I'll have the results of\nhow I feel a little bit later so I'm back to about 33 34 minutes as I have\ntaken this pure hemp the tentacles CBD oil 10 milligrams not quite sure what\nhappened I sure got tired in the last half hour a lot more mellow right now a\nlot more chill which I believe is a good thing I'm actually gonna light this\nafter my workouts I can kind of go down for the evening as it's going on about\n7:30 8 o'clock p.m. so I would say this is this is some good stuff it's a\ndefinitely made me more mellow more chill but I think it's gonna be good for\nmy post recovery my guess is I'm probably not to be as\nsore as I really would be tomorrow so yeah it seems like the 10 miligrams\nkind of worked so I'm pretty excited about this one I've nothing to use this\nagain and also probably keep this one for more of my nighttime use welcome\nback y'all so a couple days ago I got in the mail\ndelivered tea licious basically have tea in the tea bag form so there you go have\ntea delicious one tea bag is a serving so what I'm going to do is when I hit up\nin a microwave for 90 seconds some water make a vegetable and then we'll see a\ntea bag from heck delicious in there for about two to four minutes running about\ntwo ice cubes right afterwards and when test this tea out and now we just take\none of these bags make sure it's covered in water completely alright guys so I'm\nreporting back from Behati delicious tea again I took one tea bag last night and\non microwave for about 90 seconds and then I drank it about 10 minutes later\nwith one or two ice cubes in it so the tea itself it does taste good\nthere's a peppermint flavor to it however I had a little bit more stevia\nto excite like my teas and coffees and things like that a little more sweet so\nagain I had a little bit of stevia to my mix to make it taste a little bit\nsweeter it's got the good peppermint flavor and my sleep last night was I\nwould say mediocre and dude two bags tonight to see how that goes so I taste\ngood by itself I made a little bit sweeter personal preference she'll I can\ndo what you want to do", "UGmTGWFlsRs": "so we're back again with another CD radar I'm showing you new products that's been sent to me by bio poorest called hemp oil CBD 5% 500 milligrams it is a full spectrum products it all has a chlorophyll it's got every part of the plant in it I'll try and show you the color now so you can actually see this is what we're dealing with look look it it's so like thick and gooey is everything of that natural hemp source so I'm going to try a little bit of and now the solution as you can see it's really really fixed so this is how much I was normally taking about this level and yeah the effectiveness of this product was really good and like the results how I felt throughout the day yeah I was like yeah this is really working I feel good I feel bit more relaxed so yeah I'm gonna try this now and I'm gonna chill outside in the Sun and yeah it's a winter's day and I'm in Manchester and I'm sitting on the Sun it get a bit bit windy [Music] so yeah that's a minute and so it says up to three minutes you can have the CBD oil under your tongue I've heard a lot of different points from different brands like one minute 30 seconds 60 seconds it's just really about you know persevering with your mouth longer you have it more capillaries more like veins and more access to get into your bloodstream through your mouth the longer you keep it there I've also heard about swelling it in your mouth can really help like doing that you can get back to your molars and your molars have a lot of veins and pillories and the cell walls easy to absorb and the CBD a bit better so yeah I think just try out different methods see what works for you and some people can't stand the taste all they really like the taste it really depends on you but if longer you hold in your mouth the best absorption rate so yeah three minutes they advised to describe the taste there's a lot more earthy enriched and other products a lot thicker and more viscous under the tongue but it was nice tasting I've taken me a while to adjust to the taste compared to the other ones which have a sweet terpene profile but yeah it's full spectrum of the products and it's just going to help a Bennett for that entourage effect got the bio purest product here and then we leave a description under below where you can buy it yeah so a reasonable price of $34.99 and what's great about it you are getting a full spectrum products not filtered ours got the chlorophyll they've got you got the THC you got the CBD it is full spectrum I've seen a lot of products advertised online saying hey I've got a full spectrum CBD product here however the chlorophyll is filtered out and really that is not the full spectrum you kind of getting some broad spectrum CBD here but this one yet full spectrum it it says what it does on the tin and yeah I really really enjoy it with it being a full spectrum products do was a little bit I do feel it I feel it a lot quicker and I think eyes orbit a bit better and it lasts a bit longer throughout my day at 3499 yeah like the bottle it's not all flashy or ever however the content inside this bottle is good so overall what am I going to give this product I think yeah $34.99 really reasonable it's not going to break your bank being it full spectrum it's going to last longer and you'll be able to yeah apply less for out the day so if you last you longer yeah I'm gonna have to give this a five star product really really happy with it so thanks guys for sending it yeah I've enjoyed taking it and yeah $34.99 I think it's reasonable for other people in their price points it's not the most flashy bottle but does it need to be it's about the contents inside and yeah so it's a CBD radar and have a good day enjoy", "SPInomoJDmA": "good morning from the liquor corporation these are our teachers you have 1500 2000

lovers welcome to I love CBD today I will be reviewing hemp lucid bait and drip oil which is 500 milligrams now I just want to say right off the back this stuff is the real deal this stuff is official hemp lucid this right here is meant for dripping and vaping however when I bought it I couldn't help but to taste it and to drip a little bit under my tongue to try it out so right off the back the taste was official it had it give me this warmness as just started warming up under my tongue it had the earthiness and sweetness of cannabis if you know what I'm talking about this vape drip oil over here is so pure and only world contains whole plant CBD which means they don't separate the CP in the CBD and isolate it they pretty much get it and give you the whole plant let's see what they say about that so they're saying the difference between isolate CBD and whole plant CVD is the isolate most CBD products remove many potential benefit beneficial compounds including fetal cannabis fetal vital cannabinoids so how a tricky word vital cannabinoids to isolate the CBD molecule narrowing its therapeutic availability while decreasing its beneficial impact so they don't do that this is full-spectrum CBD which means help loosen does not isolate the CBD molecule but utilizes the whole plan so our products have hundreds of different plant based compounds like vital cannabinoids tur pinions and other phytonutrients these compounds work in combination with CBD creating what is called the entourage effect providing the therapeutic efficacy of typically associated with the whole plant CBD all right so it also says high CBD it does have trace of THC level which is less than 0.3 percent it is non psychoactive it has superior genetics what it says nothing artificial multi-step bonding so after I did drop some on my tongue I also used it in my vape I put some in the tank and the taste was also amazing the effects were noticeable much faster than the effects of whatever I actually consumed orally very calming stress relief like no other CBD that I have tried relaxation I didn't feel any body pains or muscle soreness or anything and the awesome thing is with all these good effects I was not like extremely sleepy so I wasn't like dozing off or tired or ah man I can't wait to go to bed no I was feeling great I had all these reliefs and all these benefits and not sleepy and when it came time to sleep I didn't have any problem sleeping and dreams like no other it was very very deep sleep that I enjoyed a lot of dreams and I was wonderful I want to show you the bottle because the bottle you could tell the difference right away from the contents how thick it is you know most CBD oils will be very clear it doesn't have this thickness you can't see like the substance and like different colors inside the bottle so this stuff is definitely official I love this stuff have absolutely nothing bad to say about it the ingredients are CBD hemp extract organic vegetable glycerin and holy sorbate I don't know what that last one is so the way to use it our separation is natural is what they say and they say gently warm and shake well before using so if you're gonna put in your vape you want to shake it up a little bit and then drip it in your vape if you wanna do like a tin and use it orally you can shake it a little bit and then just let it sit under your tongue and that's gonna warm it up and then swallow it so this stuff is great this is by far the best CD CBD I have tried yet I got this for 60 bucks from a store I believe makes it sells for eighty four fifty on their website and that's it I have lucid 500 milligrams highly recommend great product and I don't usually say this but I always have something bad to say but but this one right here got me silent but great product I have no choice but to give me five stars out of 5 stars for however you're gonna use it whether you're gonna use it orally or in your vape this is great stuff a my rating for it is 5 stars alright I hope you find this video useful and if you like it give it a like and if you want to stay updated with crazy reviews about any kind of CBD that I come across and subscribe

naturals they do a great strawberry mmm strawberry MCT oil CBD tincture strawberry very delicious koi does a broad spectrum where they go in there and extract the THC out of there so you got the other photo camera noise cbn CBG etc and then the terpenes and the natural flavorings to give it that nice strawberry taste well we got here wizard the koi natural 30ml bottle so we got the 250s 500-1000 and then they're 2,000 milligram bottles that's the total content per bottle now each dropper from the bottle 1 ml dropper is going to be from a 250 milligram a 8 milligram dosing the 500 milligram bottle you're in get about 1617 milligrams per dropper the thousand milligram now you're going to get 33 milligrams per eyedropper and then the 2,000 milligram is at sixty six point seven milligrams

"WTZMjPyScQA": "Khoi natural CBD teacher review what's up guys my name is Eden and I'm the owner of well let's see calm and today I'm going to be reviewing the entire line of the all-natural koi natural CBD tinctures this is an all-natural full spectrum CBD tincture line from koi and it includes six all-natural flavors and they're available in two fifty five hundred a thousand and then two thousand milligrams for those of you that really need those higher levels of CBD so alright let's first well walk through the six flavor profiles that we're going to be reviewing from the koi Naturals so the first one is going to be the strawberry I'm very excited about this then there is the peppermint which I mean a nice minty refreshing taste in your mouth I'm not gonna complain about that then we got an orange which I mean I would like to mix with some orange juice or an orange smoothie first thing in the morning then for those of you that prefer a all-natural flavor there's a natural flavor then there is a spearmint flavour right and then last but not least is going to be the delicious lemon lime alright so actually all six of those flavors sound incredible incredible especially I mean the natural although I mean those some people don't enjoy the all natural hemp taste I actually really do enjoy it so let's go ahead and jump right in into the strawberry koi Naturals alright and for in this in this video on today I'm going to be using a 250 milligrams version so alright and like I said guys these are tinctures they are not meant to be vaped they they're based with coconut oil so I do not recommend that you would vape this is this strictly a sublingually you drop under your tongue so shake it up guys alright and give it a nice the smell ooh smells just like some strawberry hard candy all right all right and then you know the serving size for the coy Naturals is about one to three droppers per day and you know one dropper full is about a milliliter so if you want to calculate your daily dose of CBD or your dose of CBD per dropper full all is you would do is you would just do the milligrams strength of the bottle which in this case is 250 divided by the size of the bottle which is a 30ml bottle so you know 250 divided by 30 is approximately 8.33 milligrams of CBD per dropper full all right so lift your tongue drop it under there and normally you want to let it sit under your tongue for about 30 to 60 seconds to really let it absorb but I'm kind of going to expedite the process just for others review video especially since I'll be taking a lot of CBD today so I'll definitely be able to judge it off the effects mmm it doesn't taste artificially sweetened or anything they definitely use an all-natural strawberry extract flavoring mmm which is really really good mmm with the coconut oil um you know you can definitely like it just really Caetano 'test when a product contains coconut oil it really kind of like lubricates my mouth but I can definitely you know it kind of coats that I can tell the MCT oils in there the coconut oil that's not bad at all in my opinion that strawberry flavors really really good it it does taste like an all-natural strawberry it but it does kind of have a little bit of a sweetness to it where it does remind me of some strawberry hard candy love it I really really like that flavor the koi natural strawberry is really good on the flavor scale guys I'm gonna have to give that one a a 7 out of 10 which is an overall pretty solid score so now I'm really excited to move on to the next one which is going to be the peppermint flavor guys this one also is going to be 250 milligrams like the strawberry so let's pop this one open let's give it a go shake it up alright now let's give it a whiff and see what this peppermint flavor is all about ooh I mean it does smell just like like some peppermint gum like the extra gum or some Big Five gum it really does remind me of that profile mmm and I really do like peppermint I mean peppermint gum is one of my favorites I mean it's just it's refreshing so um let's go ahead and give this a go lift your tongue guys as always drop it on there and let's enter in there fair you know 30 to 60 seconds hmm definitely peppermint I can absolutely taste that mmm but it's not overpowering you know it's not like too minty where it's just like or we're kind of like Listerine it doesn't like make your mouth burn but that mmm that peppermints really really good it's it's not overpowering but it's not too subtle I think it's just a perfect peppermint flavor honestly so for the flavor scale 1 to 10 on the flavor scale for the occur naturally Burman you know I'd have to give that a 6.5 I did I mean I would personally use the strawberry over the the peppermint but I mean especially I mean if you're the benefit of using the peppermint is it also freshens your breath at the same time where you're also getting the benefits of CBD so I think it's a win-win I mean 6.5 it's solid that peppermint is still lingering in my mouth it does it it really does just remind me of some peppermint hard candy like those ones that you get at the restaurant they're everywhere that is a spot-on replication of that flavor so nicely done coy on the peppermint flavor so now the next flavor that we're going to be reviewing is the orange koi naturals so look at this I do I'm a big fan of quois branding and their overall packaging it's just beautiful you know and what's really cool is um everything is traceable from seed to sale koi does batch testing on all of their products so that's very very important especially in this industry where not everybody is honest so third-party test results are a way to really ensure honesty and what koi is telling you is in the bottle is actually in the bottle and verified by a third party now one additional thing I wanted to point out about the entire koi Naturals line like I said the beginning of the video it's designed to only be only used sublingually you're not supposed to vape these products however you can also add any of these the coin a chiral flavours on to your food or your beverages you know so now I'm gonna be trying the orange flavor for example I could really envision myself you know poured myself a nice glass of orange juice first thing in the morning and you know dropping a full dropper full of the orange flavored Cori Naturals right in there to you know get the you know the benefits of some orange juice you know that vitamin C and then really take it to the next level by enhancing it with the benefits of a full spectrum CBD oil from koi you know and another thing about the koi Naturals is the active cannabinoid profile you know their CBD their CBD v and then there you know c VG and then plus there's a full terpene profile so you know you can really experience you know what's known as the entourage effect which is basically where cannabinoids and terpenoids two of one another and basically work synergistically to really enhance your overall experience from the CBD oil so now let's give the orange flavor try first off let's give it a nice little smell ooh it smells just honestly like oranges I mean it's an all-natural orange extract so it makes sense it it Tate air it smells just like when you peel some oranges it smells exactly like that but another thing about the coy Naturals is they do not contain THC so I mean they say it's a full spectrum CBD but I mean for me I look at that as a broad spectrum profile um but you know I'm just going off of what koi is giving me so they're they're saying that this is a full spectrum CBD profile that that scent that immediately hits you in the face when you peel it that's exactly what you get the second you open this bottle and I mean it makes sense because it's they use all natural ingredients so it's an orange extract so really makes sense why it smells just like oranges it smells great all right now let's give it a go mmm it's not overpoweringly orange it's not like a candy or anything it does it tastes just like oranges like if you were to bite into some cuties or you know your favorite orange the juice the orange juice that's squeezed into your mouth that's exactly what the koi Naturals orange tastes like mmm you can definitely tell it they're using a flavoring that's extracted from an all-natural method which is from oranges wow that is really really good I could see um you know mixing that strawberry and the orange I would be a huge fan of that I think I like the orange a little bit more than the strawberry so I mean the the orange flavor from the koi Naturals that is really really good you know I was excited to try it because I wasn't sure if I was gonna like the strawberry or the orange better because those are some of my you know favorite flavors and even my favorite fruits but you know I think I like the orange slightly more than the strawberry which I gave us seven rating for the strawberry but for the orange you know I'm gonna have to give it a 7.5 I did really enjoy that and you know like I said at the beginning I could definitely see myself mixing this koi naturals orange with my orange juice first thing in the morning you know even if you're eating some oranges drop this under your tongue and then it'll really enhance the overall orange flavor and even the health benefits that are associated with it so alright so that about wraps up for the the orange flavor now the the next flavor that we're going to well it's not really a flavor it's the all-natural the natural flavor from koi Naturals so it's just gonna be a natural hemp taste you know there's definitely a portion of the CBD community that really does just enjoy the all-natural kind of flavor profile associated with the hemp plant and I'm one of them I really do enjoy it but I do know there's also a portion of the market that cannot stand the natural taste which is why you know there's five other flavored options for you so shake it up now let's give the natural flavor from koi the sniff test smells just like you know it's it's not overpowering though you know it does you know you can smell the hemp scent in there but and you know the natural terpene profile and everything but it's not overpowering like it's not gross and you know just like all the other coin a chiral zum it's a clear formulation so let's go ahead and drop this under my tongue mmm it doesn't honestly I was expecting more of an happy taste and it's really not there but that's not a bad thing especially for those of you that can't stand it I mean when I swallowed it absolutely my mouth is coated with you know the all-natural taste of the plant but it's not overpowering whatsoever it's lingering there you can taste it but you know if you can't stand the taste and even if you're for some reason just stuck with the natural flavor if you can't stand that flavor then just drink some coffee and then it'll quickly go away or some water but it's not bad at all you know obviously I do like the the strawberry peppermint and the orange a lot better than the natural just because I mean I like the natural profile but I mean I'm not gonna be opposed to experiencing a wonderful flavor profile so you know on the flavor scale I'm still gonna give this a six point five out of ten not horrible all right so now we're going to review the spearmint from the core Naturals line beautiful packaging we tried the the peppermint now this one is going to be spearmint a little bit different all right there we go look at that beautiful bottle I love it all right crack it open ooh ooh it smells just like spearmint gum guys you know so I guess if if you really want to kind of differentiate the two you know the peppermint like peppermint gums normally blue whereas spearmint gum is normally the green gum now let's give it the the true test of the the flavor all right hmm definitely tastes just like spearmint wood as you would expect but it's not just like the peppermint which I love that COI was able to do this with the flavor um it's not overpowering whatsoever it's not too too spear minty too minty or anything but you can definitely taste that it's there hmm so when you swallow it you know you're left with just spearmint with spearmint you know you don't taste any of the hemp extract so I applaud coy because they use it's an all-natural ingredients that are in the koi Naturals and they were still able to you know really reduce the and basically eliminate the overall kind of hem pea aftertaste that's associated with a extract tincture like many of those that are on the market so very very good you know on the flavor scale but I loved that so I mean I'm gonna have to give that a seven seven out of ten no doubt about it great you know it does it didn't I don't think it really freshened my breath quite as much as the peppermint but the spearmint still lingering around but I mean if you're looking for something that'll really freshen your breath in addition to getting your CBD I would recommend that you go at the peppermint but I love both the peppermint and the spearmint all right so now last but absolutely not least from the coin Naturals CBD tincture line is going to be lemon lime so lemon lime I love it I'm excited to try some of this you know I could see you know smoothies you know you're drinking a drink at the pool whatever you're doing you know you drop it directly under your tongue but um I could definitely see myself enjoying this lemon lime flavor in some fun beverages this summer so I'm excited to give this one a try alright and let me actually point this out after trying those five other flavors you know I am cuz you know I've done about close to 45 milligrams of CBD now and being as that I consumed it sublingually you know it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for me to start to kick in and I was experiencing some incredible back pain before this and now like the relief in my back you know I had this really big knot and it's still there obviously but the the inflammation and the relief that I'm experiencing in regards to the inflammation is absolutely incredible I feel so much better my energy levels my focus in my concentration you know the words are kind of just flowing out of my mouth and that's all thanks to the coin naturals that their full spectrum line so let's now try the the lemon-lime alright let's see ooo just like lemon-lime not overpowering whatsoever not artificial at all it smells just like lemons and limes do if you were to come but if you were to squeeze some lemon juice and some lime juice and put it into a cup and then smell that this is exactly what this lemon lime flavor from koi smells like ooh all right let's now give it a flavor test hmm okay so I get I get the lime and then the lemon definitely comes in mmm and then they really blend together and you know I always like to switch the CBD around in my mouth because CBD does have some dental health benefits so um you know let's I'll let my gums and my teeth enjoy some of the benefits of the CBD - mmm the lemon in the length ooh when you swallow it a perfect combination I get both the lemon and the lime the second I swallow that in some in mouth it's still left with the lemon and the lime flavoring that you would expect to taste um I do not get any hemp taste whatsoever the only actual flavor that I got some sort of hemp taste from was the natural flavor which that's to be expected that's what coy design of that to be like because it's just an all-natural flavor but all five other flavors there's I absolutely got zero hemp tastes so in regards to hemp taste you know I give coy a 10 out of 10 for being able to completely eliminate that the lemon line it's still lingering in my mouth just like all the flavors guys but it's not over powering which I love it's not artificial whatsoever but for the flavor scale of the lemon lime ooh I'm gonna have to give that that one's gonna come in at a six point eight not horrible I was kind of expecting a little more of just because lemon and lime are kind of strong especially when you you know bite a lemon or a lime and the juice goes right in your mouth and makes you pucker I'm wasn't obviously expecting that I did kind of want a little more of the lemon lime flavor but it was still there I'm six point eight is a very solid score overall but at the end of the day guys yes flavors are nice but you should be buying a CBD product for the overall effects the overall effects that I am already experiencing from the koi Naturals line I have to give that a 10 out of 10 it's high-quality CBD oil not only CBD there's you know CBD CBD v CB c BG and then there's also a terpene profile in there so I'm really starting to experience that entourage effect and like I said at the beginning of this video it's available in 250 milligrams 500 milligrams a thousand milligrams and two thousand milligrams of CBD per 30 mil bottle and use it only as a tincture or infuse it into your favorite foods well guys that about wraps it up for the koi natural CBD teacher review thank you all

fantastic so they do a 30 milliliter bottle size milligram increments of two fifty five hundred a thousand and a two thousand milligram now that's the total content of the bottle size now each dropper out of the bottle is about 1 ml so 1 ml dropper out of a 250 milligrams you're gonna get about 8 milligrams bird per dose the 500 now you're going to get 16 to 17 milligrams per dose per dropper a

today we're chatting about cbd i want you to walk away from today's video knowing what cbd oil to say yes to and what cbd oil to say no thanks i do not want that in my life i am not wasting my money there are so many influencers talking about cbd and so today i wanted to share with you a list of things to look for in your cbd so that you are not deceived when it comes to cbd now if you do not know what cbd is or how it works i'm going to include a link down below where you can read an article that i wrote all about cbd oil my husband is on it for general health i'm on it for anxiety so it's good stuff and so i wanted to share with you because so many women okay we spend hundreds of dollars on the cbd product we're really excited we try it for a week it doesn't work what's going on you probably got bamboozled sorry so we're gonna go through a list of things that i look for in a cbd oil and then i'm gonna introduce you to a couple products that i use how i use them and all the things so let's get started okay here's what to look for in a cbd product full spectrum unfiltered so you want a full dropper if you're using the tinctures to have one like one serving should be at minimum 15 milligrams of cbd the website should provide third party lab results and ideally the website should also have a 1 800 number a phone number that you can call to ask them questions customer service is a must it's also great if the cbd is raw or unfiltered now the forms that i find at the quickest are going to be your tinctures salves and lotions the gummies i would just personally avoid they're not going to have enough cbd in there last but certainly not least we want to look for a usda certified organic product and this is really to just confirm that that organic label is actually true a lot of brands unfortunately will say it's organic when it's not actually actually so that's a list that you can use you know go grab your c video i'll pause this video go grab your ceo rewind a little bit and see how many of those boxes did your cbd oil check and if not very many then chances are you're not the problem your cbd oil is and it's time for an upgrade so if you are looking for a different type of product i'm going to show you the three that i well technically it's four that i use how i use them and how you can use them too if you're looking for another brand now if you're looking for another brand and you decide to go with the one that i recommend because it's awesome um you can find no details down below on how you can get some savings on it okay so i'm going to show you first the extra strength tincture okay so this is a dropper and let's see if i can get a full this is one milliliter of cbd okay and in the extra strength that's 50 milligrams of cbd that's a lot generally speaking for sleep anxiety i'll usually start off my clients on 25 milligrams and stay on there for a couple weeks and we might increase it but we usually don't so half a dropper full is more than enough you put it under your tongue you just let it sit for about 30 seconds now there is this lower dose which is what our dog coconut takes and this is a regular strength one full dropper is going to be 17 milligrams so for our dogs how i calculated out doing the research that i did is that um five milligrams of cbd is good for 20 pounds of the dog weighs so coconut or doberman is a 70 pound beast although she thinks she's five pounds um so one full dropper of the 17 milligram is enough so those are the tinctures then we get into the super fun stuff which i'm really excited about the first one is this cbd salve so i like to keep this in my gym bag or like close to where i work out or right before bed i'll put this on targeted areas you can see that it's like it's like a lipstick it's like a lip balm it's like a beeswax type type of um self okay so this product has organic hemp extract infused with arnica birch bark and peppermint essential oil the full spectrum cbd and their super salve works in harmony with natural pain and inflammation reducers such as arnica and birch bark to achieve maximum results third party lab results are displayed online products ingredients include organic coconut oil organic beeswax organic birch bark and arnica infused mct oil organic peppermint essential oil it's great on spot inflammation joint pain arthritis bruising and muscle soreness the great thing about topical cbd oil is that it goes directly to the source when you take it orally it has to bypass through the gi tract before being absorbed then it gets distributed to the areas that need it that are needed in your body when you apply topical cbd directly to where you're feeling discomfort it can be absorbed right through the skin and find the source of the problem quickly think of it like a lasered approach this is best for spot issues and great for anyone living a sporty active lifestyle a powerful topical recovery tool so that is your cbd self then we get into the newest the greatest the ultimate cbd lotion so we have um unscented i was about to say unflavored do you not eat this and then we have the lavender arnica you guys know arnica is really great for pain relief so how you use these cbd oil lotions is different than how you use the cell the cell is more spot treatment the lotions are more for like all over your body usage while the arnica specifically is helpful for pain so how i use these is when i'm getting out of the shower or bath at night i'll just put a little lotion on the places that need hydration but here's the texture so you can kind of see it's lotion you know you just rub it in it's nice and like it's not sticky it absorbs really really quickly it's really nice so the eaton hemp lotion is specifically formulated with ingredients that keep your skin glowing healthy and hydrated use every day for optimal skin hydration it can be used for spot treatment for bruising or soreness it's packed with six times the amount of cbd as the leading competitors their cbe lotion provides a feel-good way to reduce inflammation and aid in muscle recovery on the spot packed with powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents cbd is said to be one of the most powerful nutrients for skin health not only does this product aid in reducing inflammation and providing pain relief in your muscles but daily use will result in visually healthier looking skin that's a little bit about cbd how i use it again cbd oil under the mouth i don't recommend the pills because they take forever to absorb and if you have an issue with digestion you're never going to feel the effects for the self you're going to use it in those spot areas and then for the lotion just everyday hydration for your skin and again remember that list at the beginning of looking for those various things that you want to look for in a cbd oil and do not be deceived there are so many products out there they're very expensive and it's really important that you get the good quality kind so that you can figure out if cbd oil works for you so i hope you've enjoyed this video you can find out more with savings codes and such if you want to grab eaton hemp i'll include all those details down below and and don't forget to subscribe to my channel i come up with videos like every week sort of depends i'm not on a calendar i just make things that inspire me as they come along so i hope you enjoyed today's video and i will see you soonish okay bye", "vlafMXIizn0": "what is going on guys Fallon go nootropics calm here was something a little new to the channel little something outside the nootropics space but something I think a lot of you guys will be interested in if you're into alternative medicine if you're into kind of these alternative type solutions to solve unique problems anxiety depression apathy inflammation you know these things we take nootropics for if you'd like to venture outside of that zone this is something new to the table this is 500 milligrams full-spectrum CBD tincture from CBD distillery and that won't focus for [ __ ] will it I'll put some b-roll in the video CBD for those of you new derived from the cannabis plant it's one of over 100 identified cannabinoids within the plant itself you might be familiar with THC THC is the big-daddy cannabinoid of cannabis it's the cannabinoid that popularized the psychotropic effects of the cannabis plant when you smoke weed you get stones that psychoactive effects maybe you get a little paranoid maybe you get the munchies all these kind of that mental effect you get from cannabis can be as can be attributed to THC but if you dig into the literature when you hear about cannabis being anti-inflammatory you hear about it reducing anxiety you hear about it you know alleviating a lot of these symptoms you might deal with on a day-to-day basis all of that good medicinal value is associated with the CBD this cannabidiol come and something like a strong powerful CBD tincture can be very helpful in getting the medicine into your body and getting the medicine into your system so this is something I've been using recently to great effect CBD for me is very calming very and zai oolitic extremely calming sedating and higher doses it kind of just if you have an overactive mind it kind of settles the thoughts in your mind allows the thoughts to kind of settle into the bottom so you're not your mind is not racing a thousand miles a minute you're not thinking too far into the future you just kind of drop into the present moment with this nice little you get this nice little little buzzing in your body you feel good and when you take this stuff it feels like it's natural medicine whereas you know a lot of the nootropics that I talk about on this channel there's a very real synthetic component to nootropics like piracetam fennel piracetam Fenna butte aniracetam no pepped when you take these types of substances there's a very real synthetic feeling like what you're taking is not natural now let's not to say there's nothing good there's no value that can be derived out of nootropics but when you're taking something like CBD you do feel that what you're taking into your system is natural what you're taking into your system came from the herbs was not you know produced in a lab so for that reason I really enjoy things like CBD I've talked about ashwagandha in the past since oral KSM 66 all these natural type compounds Kimmi can go a long way in supplementing a lot of this synthetic stuff like you know something like phenol piracetam so a few things I noticed about this and we're gonna crack right into the review of this product right now is any good oil that you take any good oil that you buy when you open it up you want to give it the sniff test and when you smell it it should smell like cannabis it should smell like marijuana it should smell like you just opened up a fat bag of weed and when you give this oil the sniff test that's exactly what it smells like it smells like cannabis so that's very good sign that the product you're getting is good that's a very good sign that the product is going to be therapeutic what you don't want is something that smells fruity or something that smells like it's been cut with something like syrup or if it smells fruity at all you want to stay away from that stuff you want to get the the real cannabidiol oil the real hemp oil that's been derived from you know the hemp plant the cannabis plant etc etc or else you're not going to really get that therapeutic effect from the medicine and doing the research on this into the droplets into the kind of like how much you're supposed to take how long does a bottle like this last why is it so expensive etc etc I thought I found out that these companies legally aren't allowed to tell you how much to take there is no recommended dosage for CBD oil so when you're hunting around the internet you're looking for you know how how much to take how many drops you're not gonna find a lot of information about that but because these companies can be held liable for making false claims about dosage on the back of the label however it does say take 3 two four drops sublingually which means under the tongue and if you do the calculations that equates to about like three milligrams a drop per per drop with the little dropper that you get here so three drops is about nine milligrams of CBD a lot of the literature that you see the medicinal literature they're using much higher doses than that so there is this argument that in order to get the therapy the truth Arup utak value out of the CBD oil you need something like you know 100 200 milligrams of of CBD per dose and if you look at this bottle this is only a 500 milligram bottle of CBD oil if you're taking 100 to 200 milligram dosage you're gonna be running out of that bottle very quick and the bottle is expensive I think I paid about 34 35 bucks for the bottle which is very very expensive so common sense tells you to not use that much or else you're gonna be spending a lot of money on the oils but I found that you really don't need that much to fill an effect at least if you're trying to attack anxiety or something like that 3 to 4 to 5 drops is perfect I feel totally calm after taking you know a few drops of the oil just under the tongue leave it there for about you know a minute 30 seconds to 60 seconds tops swallow it and within a few minutes you really do feel a sense of calm wash over you so I don't think you need that much CBD oil to really get the therapeutic effects now it could be different if you're say you're fighting chronic inflammation you might need more you might need to push it to that 100 - 200 milligram range but if you're just looking for kind of a nice way to wind down the day or you're feeling anxious in the afternoon in the morning a few drops under the tongue is absolutely fabulous stuff and I found to be a perfect dose so I do recommend this stuff this stuff is absolutely great from what I have experienced so far it's a great addition to piracetam it's a great addition to a lot of the other nootropics I talk about great stuff for pain fabulous fantastic stuff for anxiety calming you down you're in a high stress job your cortisol is constantly spiked you know CBD oil combined with something like aniracetam very very potent very very ends i oolitic I would argue almost as close as you can get to therapeutic grade pharmaceutical grade anti-anxiety medication but without any of those negative side effects you get from benzos kind of as a buyers tip for you guys when you're looking at oils online you're generally gonna come across two different types one is called CBD isolate and the other is called CBD full-spectrum CBD isolate is CBD that's been isolated from the other compounds found in the cannabis plant so the other cannabinoids CBD isolate is just raw THC you're literally getting nothing else in that tincture than the CBD chemical compound the full-spectrum on the other hand is you're getting the CBD but you're also getting the full spectrum of the other cannabinoids found in cannabis so you're not just getting CBD you're getting little amounts of THC along with the other you know over 100 other cannabinoids and turpentine the cannabis plant and so if you kind of dig into the research on this one there's proponents for CBD isolate and there's proponents for the full spectrum doing my personal research I came to the conclusion that the full spectrum is better there's a lot of evidence to suggest that CBD can only work when it's used in conjunction with all of these other cannabinoids in other words CBD is much more powerful when the other cannabinoids like THC are present within the tincture so for that reason I like to keep or I like to use the the full spectrum versions of cannabis or CBD but that's not to say there isn't you know room or medicinal value and just taking the raw CBD either at the end of the day it's up to you there's no reason why you can't get both but in my opinion if you're a first-time buyer I would opt for the full spectrum first and see how that affects you I recommend you guys pick up a bottle of this stuff and see how it works for you this stuff is legal in all 50 states the oil is actually derived from the hemp plant the hemp plant is actually the cannabis plant but it's been grown in such a way that the plant itself produces less than 0.3 percent THC so the plant itself is a non psychoactive plant it's mostly CBD along with the other cannabinoids very very high CBD content very very little THC content which puts it in the the federal limit for you know you can sell it you can consume it you can have it in all 50 states so this is something you can go on online and purchase right now and they'll ship it to you like this little bottle came in the mail and there it was check

hemp and I'm going to give you a really simplified explanation initially and then I'm going to go to in a little bit more detail for those of you who want more detail if you're new to my channel I'm Katherine certified nutrition consultant founder of foods that heal you and foods that heal you CBD and below in the description below this video I will have links to my websites and where you can buy CBD oil and all that good stuff alright so let's go ahead and get started with the basic explanation between the difference between hemp and CBD so the hemp plant has CBD in it so they're not really separate they are actually the same thing because the hemp has CBD in it it's like the Apple has vitamin C in it right so you can't really compare an apple to vitamin C because the vitamin C's in the Apple well CBD is actually in the hemp plant Solo's let's go ahead and break this down a little bit farther so you've got the hemp plant which is a cannabis so the umbrella is a cannabis alright and the cannabis plant has the hemp species and the marijuana species what we're going to talk about is the hemp species from the hip species plant you've got hemp seeds and so I'm going to show you what hemp seeds are these are hemp seeds they don't have any CBD in them so the seeds don't have any CBD in them what they do have are a ton of nutrients they're a great source of plant protein for those of you who don't want to have to eat a lot of animal foods you rather get your protein from the plant this is a terrific source there's B vitamins iron there's a ton of nutrients omega-3 fats that are really essential for health so Hennessey's are really healthy but they don't have CBD in them alright but what they do have in them is all those nutrients and that's where you get hemp oil so this is actually avocados I don't have any but health oil is typically going to come in a bottle like this you can get it at grocery stores you can get health food stores Amazon whatever but it's typically going to come in a normal bottle be like ten dollars or something all right so that's that's the seed part of the plant and then you know the flowers in the stock and the rest of the plant and that's where you're going to find the cannabinoids which have the CBD so for example you've got the flower and the stalk in the flower and the stock you're going to cannabinoids and if you've been on my channel for a while you've probably seen me hold up this chart here or wheel and this is the CBD wheel that shows you several cannabinoids CBD is one of them CVCC BG THC there's over a hundred cannabinoids alright so in the flowering spec you have cannabinoids you also have naturally-occurring plant terpenes and other plant parts one of those cannabinoids like we mentioned in this wheel is CBD so you can see the Cascade here where the CBD is coming from if you get a full spectrum CBD hemp oil product you're going to have all of if it's true full spectrum now there's a lot on the market that are broad-spectrum those have some of these but not all of them it's not true full spectrum alright true full spectrum is going to all of them including trace amounts of THC now the amount of th she's not going to be enough to to feel or experience any effects from it and it's legal if it's below 0.3% which all of our products are going to be legal on below point 3 percent so you're not gonna feel anything but a true full spectrum will have that THC in there and some examples of true full-spectrum would be our tasty jobs here's the berry and the spearmint so these are full-spectrum and they're actually raw so you're gonna see like on our label CBD CBD a because CBD a is only in the raw version but it is a cam annoyed that gets converted to CBD when it's decarboxylated or heated so decarboxylated just a fancy term for heated alright so that's sample of full spectrum so it's gonna have the plant terpenes the plant parts all these fatty acids that are naturally occurring all of the cannabinoids everything okay so if I were to pick up a bottle like this and see hemp oil on the label which ours actually we use MCT oil but if it said hemp oil that's actually not what the CBDs coming from it's coming from the flowers of the stock so you want to make sure your labels gonna say on there CBD or phyto cannabinoids or hemp extract hemp extract is not hemp oil and extract is going to have the CBD in it so it can get really convoluted and confusing I do have a video training series you can check out my website sign up for that I have like eight videos and one of them explains how to read the labels because it can be so confusing alright another example would be our gold label this is a pure oil hemp oil oops sorry pure an oil extract it's gonna say final cannabinoids on here it's gonna say hemp extract and has the hemp CBD it has that cannabinoid and all of the cannabinoids it is full-spectrum it's gonna have trace amounts of the THC so if you don't want THC if you are for example you're worried about drug testing there are other options we have a broad spectrum we have our fav so there are other options that can be very effective but if you're looking for full spectrum and you want all those plant turkeys and you want all of the phyto cannabinoids and you want CB g and CB c or whatever you want a true full spectrum in fact our tasty drops do have people asking about CB g and CB c if you look at our lab results we there are trace amounts of those candids in there too which brings up another topic which i want to go too far into but people are starting to ask me what about CB g or CB c those are going to be isolates and some come from aged THC comforts into certain cannabinoids or the raw version has certain cannabinoids what I usually recommend to start out with a full spectrum and if you want more of one of those the CBC or the CB g or cbn for good then add that to it because you're going to want that entourage effect your one gonna want that effect we're in synergistic everything in nature nutrients all work together you want the whole Apple not just the vitamin C when you eat the whole Apple and then take maybe extra vitamin C you're getting way more health benefits it's going to be much more effective so if you want maximum results I recommend a full spectrum first and then adding in these other specific handle rights that you are looking for now CVD a is a different kind of different because it's naturally occurring in the raw fall spectrum so at full spectrum so you don't need to supplement with just CBD a you just want to get our tasty drops or our blue label is pretty high in CBD a also so if you're looking for that okay so I think that covers it I'm going to make this pretty simple and kind of sure because I know for me when I'm watching YouTube I like just get to the point I don't hear all this other stuff so hopefully that gave you a really good overview and a little bit of detail in there and if there's videos specifically that you would like me to do videos on make a comment below below in the comment section please be nice usually people are pretty nice but anyway so thanks for watching

my personal favorite CBD tincture that we have at the shop right now I have tried so many and I picked this one this is miracle 500 milligram full spectrum CBD tincture now let us get into the positives of the CBD tincture let's talk about miracles for a little bit okay miracle is one of the largest and most trusted CBD manufacturers in the world and up until recently their products were only available to wholesalers and health professionals now we can all just pick it up of course they are available at a low CBD you can even try them if you are around our shop in Brooklyn now miracle products all have a CoA a certificate of authenticity if you didn't know what a CoA was don't worry I had to google it it's important to have these though you can see a complete breakdown of exactly what these bottles contain these COAS are updated with each batch now the most important thing to me bruh is the price this is Philly Dallas the price is one of my favorite things about this tincture a $50 bottle if used once a day can last thirty days so that's like $50 a month now the ingredients of the CBD tincture are 500 milligrams of pharma grade hemp oil blend with natural occurring cannabinoids including CBD CBG cbn and CBD a I took that from the website because guess what that is another thing I really like about this tincture their website miracle nutritional products is website has a ton of information about all their products okay there's just a little tidbit about the miracle brand the cannabis CBD oil cannabidiol we use to produce miracle brand is from the industrial hemp plant and significantly different from regular hempseed oil found in your health food store marijuana has been cultivated for many years to have high THC levels THC is a chemical that gets you high or has the psychoactive effect the cannabis that is used to produce the CBD for miracle brand has been bred to have high CBD content and low THC content so you see miracles 500 milligrams CBD tincture delivers Pharma grade CBD now miracle CBD tincture can be taken as an oral supplement and I just learned this today ok some customers have found other uses such as an additive to e-liquid or as a cooking ingredient out of all the CBD tinctures I have tried and I've tried a lot man miracle has given me the best natural sleep I've ever had I don't know if this is from their proprietary blend or not but from my anecdotal experience miracles the best for sleep now let's get into the negatives real quick there's only one there's only one guys the taste ok that is the only downside of this tincture for me it has a bit of a bitter aftertaste however it's minimal alright it's nothing like taking cough medication you actually forget about it after a while especially if you just take it immediately with water and don't like swish it around your mouth or anything what you shouldn't do anyway CBD oil is meant to be taken underneath the tongue you hold it there for 30 seconds to a minute then swallow it with water I usually tell people to swallow it like a shot with the water that way it alleviates the taste much more do I recommend this absolutely miracle 500 milligram full-spectrum CBD tincture is my personal favorite I always have this in my CBD rotation if you require relief from daily stress and anxiety aches and pains migraines and insomnia I highly suggest that you give miracle CBD tinctures a try this is your boy in the NYC it's me ray and this is the a list CBD channel saying peace yo if you guys want to see hemp and CBD content presented in a

"hey I wanted to give a quick update on hemp work CBD oil I wanted to keep this short sweet and to the point I've been taking half works now for a few months and I currently take 500 milligrams in the I'm using the 500 milligram bottle I take a half a dropper morning and night sometimes midday if I need it and I take it in natural flavor although I prefer our bull peppermint flavor-wise I think they're both grape flavors but my flavor of choice is peppermint so I have known about CBD oil for quite some time however I have not wanted to jump on the bandwagon or try any of them as I wasn't sure where it was sourced from if it was truly organic non-gmo if it was legal all those questions a lot of you probably have as well when I found hemp works I saw that it met the entire criteria that I was looking for it was like the unicorn of CBD oils its third-party tested it's organic non-gmo it's full spectrum which was really important to me co2 extracted grown in the USA in Kentucky so high quality again all the things that I've been looking for so I suffer from migraines frequently or used to I should say passed sense and I am holistic by Nature I have a holistic mentality I do not take pharmaceuticals not over-the-counter not prescribed unless it was an absolute you know necessity so when I get a migraine you know people would say well just take a Tylenol or take an ibuprofen or there's something for that but that's just not that easy for me so I would have to sleep off my migraines typically if they're in the evening time I would just go to bed for the night that was it drink a bunch of water go to bed since discovery and CBD oil I took it as preventative measure and I have not had am I since taking it I mean I've each day I'm like okay I'm waiting for it but truly I have not had a migraine or sign of an impending headache since I started taking it so I take it again morning and night 500 milligrams I only need a half a dropper if I feel a little off midday I might take another half a dropper so I have a dropper in the morning a half a dropper in the evening or half a dropper midday and then a half a dropper in the evening again I have not had a migraine since taking this I have several customers who are also taking it for the same thing and they also have had the same results it's pretty incredible so if you have any questions feel free to reach out to me again I wanted to keep this short sweet and to the point I feel free to comment below reply below or just shout out give me a message I'm happy to answer any questions or chat with you about it

reviewing the entire line of the CBD effects disposable CBD vape pens which come in four wonderful flavors now don't get these confused with the CBD effects terpene CBD vape pens which we I filmed a previous review video on this but this line of the CBD effects disposable CV vape pens is their very first line it's their oh gee and it comes in four delectable flavors so let's go ahead and walk through those four flavors before getting into today's review video so the first one we're going to be reviewing is going to be the fresh mint nice little minty sort of CBD delivery system okay I like that next up we got the strawberry lemonade and I'll tell you guys the strawberry lemonade is one of CBD effects is top sellers it's also one of the top sellers on well etsy.com next up on the line is going to be the classic flavor of the blue raspberry and I mean let's be honest guys who doesn't love a good old-fashioned blue raspberry flavor then last but not least we have the tropic mango or the tropic breeze excuse me which is basically I already gave it away is a mango flavored a liquid that's in there and then all four of these flavors they are disposable for one two they come in 30 milligrams of CBD per pen and you know the price point I think is very very nice its $14.99 per pen so you know even if you want to purchase all four of the flavors you're not really gonna be breaking the budget so I really love that $14.99 price point whereas the terpene pens from CBD effects which 50 milligrams in it those are 1999 and of course all of those you can find right now at WWE LSE comm so let's jump right in and do the the fresh mint CBD effects disposable CBD vape pen beautiful packaging as always you know it's got the full ingredients on the backside it even has a QR code right here on the box that you can scan with your camera that'll show that'll take you right to the third-party test results now the ingredients for all four of the CBD effects CBD vape pens are it's a false be made with a full spectrum hemp oil although I have gotten word that CBD effects is in the process of remaking these with a broad spectrum hemp oil but for right now they are made with a full spectrum hemp oil there's propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin which for those of you that have been vaping those two ingredients will sound very very familiar as those are the base ingredients in vape juice and like I said there's 30 milligrams of CBD in the entire pen you know I like to say you'll get about a hundred puffs out of these of course it'll vary from person to person based on you know the length of your draw and so on and so forth but at the end of the day it's great little disposable little compact device you can keep in your pocket and since its vaping you know it has those near immediate effects that many people love which is why they choose to vape the product and you know it's a it's a nice all the Pens look the exact same that's a nice gold pen it just it looks high quality you know so let's go ahead and pull this off because it does come with a rubber mouthpiece you could put that back on after each use but that's totally up to you and as you'll notice when I take in when I draw the pen because they are draw activated you'll actually see at the bottom that a little light will illuminate that'll indicate that you are actually firing the device definitely a minty flavor once I started inhaling it you know I get that rush of a that fresh mint in there but that's I'm good not gonna lie it doesn't completely mute the hemp oil but for me that's not really a bad thing but it's not an overpowering the flavor of hemp oil that you would get with you know if you were using like an all-natural tincture a full spectrum tincture but you know there's fresh mint flavors actually very very nice it's really cool there's no buttons nothing you know you you literally pull it out of the box take the mouthpiece off and you just start vaping and you're on your way um that fresh mint flavor is very very good but you know you can definitely taste the hemp oil in the aftertaste but it really blends nicely I think with the fresh mint flavor you know on the flavor scale of one to ten I'm gonna have to give that one a five point five not terrible but not the best but those of you that are like enjoy sort of minty vapes and just a refreshing mint flavor in your mouth you definitely could not go wrong with the fresh mint CBD effects disposable CBD vape pen so I'm gonna put this back then next up what we have is going to be the strawberry lemonade which I'm very excited about this because like I said guys this is one of the top sellers on Wallasey calm as well as CBD effects the second most popular flavor that I've seen is the CBD effects blue raspberry disposable CBD vape pen which we'll review next don't worry guys all right so take another box beautiful packaging as always a nice pink you know strawberry lemonade themed color profile so very nicely done CBD effects on that you know if I was to rate the CBD effects packaging for just overall design and ease of information that's on there I would give it a ten out of ten because honestly everything you need to know about this CBD product from CBD effects is right on the box so nicely done on that CBD effects alright so go ahead and do strawberry lemon-aid take the rubber mouthpiece off see just just like the fresh mint it's a gold device they all look the same so you know if you have multiple flavors if you want to keep track I would recommend putting it back in the box after use but you know for me I don't care I'll just vape any of them because I'm more so looking for the effects that CBD deliver rather than the flavor so strawberry lemonade from CBD effects it's definitely um you know I got a lot more flavor from the fresh mint but I mean I guess that's to be expected because mint is a very powerful sort of flavor but let me give this a couple polls to see I can definitely you know I can taste that the strawberry lemonade is in there but you know I do really get a hemp oil taste on the aftertaste um but it's just like the fresh mint I don't want you guys to think we're you're just gonna vape this and get all hemp oil flavor because that's not the case it's it's very it's a very very minimal hemp taste but I can definitely tell that it's there and you know guys I like to be 110 percent honest with all of you guys because I don't get paid to do these reviews I'm doing this to help all of you guys at the end of the day so let's give it another poll before I give it the flavor rating okay yeah see when I did that longer pull as you could see with a larger sort of vapor production I did get that strawberry lemonade a little bit more um but you know I was expecting more of a strawberry lemonade flavor because I love strawberry lemonade you know the drink or even vape juice flavors they're phenomenal so I'm a little underwhelmed by the strawberry lemonade flavor but that's not to say it's not horrible you know I don't expect a massive flavor delivery out of a tiny little device like this such as you would get with a larger vape device you know on the flavor scale I do like that one more than the fresh mint I gave the freshman a 5.5 so the strawberry lemonade I got to put that in right at a six point zero out of ten so it's it's a decent score but like I said guys I would personally I was underwhelmed by the strawberry lemonade flavoring that was in there alright so next up we have the probably the most popular I mean you know strawberry lemonade and this blue raspberry are the best-selling flavors so I'm definitely excited about this and plus that blue on the packaging really catches your eye and I mean blues my favorite color so I definitely have some high high high expectations for CBD effects on this blue raspberry flavor alright so go ahead take off the rubber mouthpiece looks the exact same as all the other ones pay attention guys at the bottom of this device there'll be a white illuminated light that will occur when I'm pulling on the device to indicate that I'm actually hitting it and that it is working so blue raspberry CBD effects disposable pen okay I do get that blue raspberry it's a little bit more prominent than I guess the strawberry lemonade but it is still um muted I mean you know guys don't go in expecting if you're vaping out of like a smoke nord device or a sub ohm tank or even an AR where you're dripping actual CBD e-liquid on there don't go into these disposable vape pens expecting one you'll get the same vape production and to that you'll get the same flavor production because those larger devices you know they are phenomenal for flavor and vapor production whereas these little ones um the flavor is more muted but also in sits a smaller device of course the vapor production is going to be smaller but that's probably one of the biggest drawing factors for a lot of you is it's one convenient but - it won't pull a bunch of attention to you when you're out and about I mean even if you're at work or wherever you are and you need to you're experiencing some anxiety or some pain that really needs to go away quickly if you keep one of these CVD effects pens in your pocket they would be very very good for that because you know you could just pull on it and then you can even ghost it where you don't even exhale the vapor that you can definitely do that with the CBD effects disposable CBD vape pens alright blue raspberry let's see so like I said it the blue raspberry is there I actually don't really get let me see so the blue raspberry definitely and then like the other two flavors I I can still taste the hemp oil but that's not a deterring factor for me because I'm one my number one priority when I'm using CBD products is I'm looking for the effects guys flavors secondary when in regards to that but you know the hemp oil it is it is muted I think that blue raspberry does a nice job of kind of covering it up but like I said it's still there one more pole before I give it the flavors rating okay um you know just like the strawberry lemonade I was underwhelmed by the blue raspberry flavor that I was expecting but you know just get it on your head guys it will not taste like a large vaping device like if you're dropping the juice on there you know on the so it does kinda flavor rating is it's bringing that down because I'm expecting a little bit more flavor but you know I I do see why the strawberry lemonade in the blue raspberry are the two top sellers of the four flavors of the CBD effects disposable CVD vape pens you know I gave the fresh mint 5.5 strawberry lemonade a six for the blue raspberry I'm going to have to also give that one a six out of ten not horrible not too shabby I it's it's a good solid flavor absolutely especially for those of you that really enjoy those fruity sort of vapes alright guys so the very last CBD effects CBD vape pen flavor that we'll be trying today is going to be the tropic breeze and you know the tropic breeze flavor profile it is a mango flavored vape juice that's in there so let's go ahead and pull this bad boy out of the the wonderful box you know it's just it looks beautiful I love the colors that CBD effects chose and you know honestly my favorite part of their packaging is all the information that they make readily available to you as the consumer which is the most important thing because you're using a CBD product you should be very very educated about it and know exactly what's in it exactly where the CBD came from you know it just needs a full traceability at the end of the day guys so tropic breeze CBD effects disposable CBD vape pen oh I definitely get that mango and you know I'm surprised as a little hesitant about the tropic breeze just because I'm not a mate I don't enjoy mango like eating the mango fruit and you know mango vape juices aren't really for me but I think because like it's such a small device like I've been saying that the flavor is sort of muted especially compared to other vape devices I think that is like I think that's a benefit in my opinion for me not liking mango where it's just enough mango flavor where I actually enjoyed this I would use it I would vape this the tropic breeze flavor regularly actually so let's give it a couple more puffs so yeah that mangos there and then once I start exhaling I really do get that hemp oil taste as well you know so one more and then I'll tell you the my rating of one to ten on the flavor okay you know I honestly like out of all these flavors they're very very good but like honestly my ratings are very very close for all of them for the Tropic breeze on a flavor scale of one to ten I got to give that a five point eight so you know from favorite to least favorite for me for the CBD effects disposable CBD vape pens we got the blue raspberry and the strawberry lemonade tied for first which I gave a six out of ten then second place will be the tropic breeze at five point eight and then third place at a five point five is the fresh mint flavor from CBD effects honestly at the end of the day guys I would use these regularly I mean I wouldn't for me I would not look at this as my main delivery system of CBD I mean of course you unless you need a very low dose of CBD to keep you going because like I said guys in each these pens in the full pen there's 30 milligrams of full spectrum hemp oil so you know you for those of you that are kind of power users and do require more these pens maybe I'd recommend them as a secondary option where you take an oil a capsular and edible however you like to take it regularly and then just in case you're ever out and about and you experience symptoms that you're trying to eliminate you could definitely pull this out of your pocket and you could just start vaping on it until you start to feel relief because that's the best part about vaping guys is it does have the quickest onset of delivery of CBD where it's a near immediate effect so that's why if you're really if you're a vapor I recommend trying to vape CBD because it's it's cool because since it's near immediate you can honestly just puff on that wait a few minutes puff on it again and then you just wait a couple of minutes and then eventually you you could honestly just keep a mental note in your mind of how many puffs it took for you to feel relief and then you kind of just remember that going forward because it is very difficult to precisely tell you how much CBD you are getting in each pull because everybody does vape differently you know it's specifically the main factor is the overall length of your vape you know vaping like this or vaping for five seconds that second one I got more CBD and as you can see by the larger vapor production so it's definitely something to keep in mind but yes so those of you that are just starting CBD to use CBD these CBD effects disposables see me vape pens would be great for you to really kind of see how CBD works for you but few power users I would recommend the CBD effects disposable vape pen as a secondary option that you keep on you just in case of emergencies before we wrap up I do want to touch on sort of the effects that I am feeling you know the effects that I am experiencing yes I can tell the CBD is going to work but for me I do take a large your dose of CBD you know I take more than 30 milligrams of CBD per day myself so the the kind of the effects I'm experiencing they are there but they are they're very gradual right now so for me I would have to sit here and you know if I sit here in vape on this five 10 15 more times I could definitely see sort of my focus levels increasing my concentration verbal fluency you know it is it's slightly improving but you know especially compared to like some of our other reviews where I've done tinctures and stuff by the end of the video like I'm honed in on you guys and I might the words are flowing out and they're starting to do that now but for me since it is only thirty milligrams in the whole pen I I would need to vape on it a little bit more to experience the full effects but like I said the effects are definitely there so I would recommend the CBD effects CBD vape pens to you especially if you are a brand new user to CBD this is a very convenient way to get into it and it's not scary it requires there's no buttons there's no charging you just take another box and you're good to go and you know the best part is once this is done the battery will last the entire life of the oil so you just puff on it and then once it's dead you toss it away and then you just move you order some more move on to the next one so overall great effects that I am beginning to experience I could see especially for the CBD newbies um that it would it could definitely help but for me I would I will have to keep vaping on this to really enjoy the full effects that I'm used to from CBD and of course guys the full line of the CBD effects disposable CBD vape pens can be found right now at ww-well se comm

does not feel any sort of hi she comes in with her bottle and she says open your open your mouth and she puts a dropper full of this stuff she's like lift up your tongue just take this under your tongue okay fine so I do that within just five minutes she says her nausea faded away I just didn't feel nauseous anymore after a week of using it when was at my family's house or my husband's family's house I just felt like me again like I was able to smile and hang out with people and I didn't feel like I needed to go lay down high praise for CBD also shared by dr. James Taylor an anesthesiologist currently treating more than 1,000 patients with CBD I'm very excited for the future of this and how it's going to impact medicine dr. Taylor studied CBD with 100 of his patients last year and three things rose to the surface number one was sleep our patients slept so much better the second thing we noticed was a decrease in anxiety the third thing we saw was hope I know that's a little harder for a physician to kind of put a number on on a scale from zero to ten how hopeful are you but what we realized is that patients we're getting kind of a mild antidepressant effect medical research on CBD is still in the early phases one reason the Drug Enforcement Agency only eased restrictions on clinical research in 2015 a scientific review published in 2015 of 49 other studies found CBD has major potential as a treatment for multiple anxiety disorders but longer-term studies are needed other research studies have found potential for treating PTSD social anxiety frequent nightmares insomnia and chronic pain its God Alcoholics Anonymous my family and see the CBD oil that's my life 48 year old Chris Livingston swears by CBD oil for help with his depression anxiety PTSD and ADHD the CVD comes along and has completely changed my life Livingston stresses he's seven years sober and is cautious about taking anything but CBD passes his test and I took it in about five ten minutes later we're talking and we're looking at each other we just stopped talking and I said it's gone and she said what and I said it's gone I feel completely normal it was like the best way I can describe it is a piece just a piece calm today both Livingston and Thomas say they take one dropper of CBD every morning and night at least for these two a dropper a day really does keep the doctor away and dr. Taylor points to a study in 2017 that showed up to 70% of CVD products do not contain what the bottle says he says it's sort of the Wild West and recommends looking for products with third-party testing and of course always talk with your doctor before adding any new supplement or your routine", "UdTA3AX7Blw": "full-spectrum hemp oil [Music] you I'm Erin Reed Superleague pro world's tallest bodybuilder I want to talk to you guys a little bit about full spectrum hemp oil like what that means you know there's a lot of talk nowadays about CBD and cannabinoids and all these different things it can be confusing but I'm gonna particularly talk about full spectrum hemp oil right now okay alright now full spectrum hand boil is basically you take the implant which is still in the marijuana family they just call it him because that's point zero three milligrams of THC or less when it's tested and whatnot so doesn't bit really have any THC it's not not a hemp isn't used to get you high doesn't have psychoactive properties but because it's a plant we all know that fruits and vegetables are full of amazing qualities that do things for you like cranberry is good for your kidneys garlic is good for your heart saw palmetto for your prostate it's all kind of stuff like that right well there's a lot of naturally occurring things in plants they're called phytonutrients or phytochemicals that do these things well when it comes to marijuana it kind of has its own thing going ok so marijuana obviously is cannabis that's another word for you know marijuana that includes everything can't in in in cannabis is more directly related to cannabinoids now cannabinoids are the individual chemicals the different ones that they're starting to pin down and realize have different qualities okay one of those cannabinoids is CBD one of those cannabinoids is THC THC is what gets you high that causes psychoactive properties the the CBD is has all the healing properties so having said that you can start to understand that okay we're talking about - well it turns out that there is actually something like over a hundred different cannabinoids and okay in hemp marijuana cannabis or want to call it there's over a hundred different ones but they've pinned it down to learn that CBD has all these amazing qualities right CBD so THC you know is really good for different things believe it or not it's why it's being prescribed for pain and stuff like that but CBD is also good for pain well I get to I'll check I'll get to that but I'm not gonna kind of go into it and I just gonna talk about hemp oil while like hemp oil versus something else so when we're talking about CBD it's real popular right now and if you take you to hemp oil if you take him Boyle and use a few more processes like you take the plant him and then you you do a single process there's a couple different ways you can do it to get you know hemp oil full-spectrum hemp oil has everything in it you just pull it right out of the plant okay if you go from there and now you can start to isolate the different chemicals so you can isolate CBD CBD isolate that's why it's called CBD isolate now it takes more processes more chemicals and some of these chemicals are poisonous okay that's that's kind of what turns me off about CBD by itself because of the process to get there the great thing about CBD it's so popular is it turns into like a white powder because it's completely iced so that it looks it's basically they get it down to a single like almost almost a drug form and then you can put anything you can put it in you know different foods you put in drinks you can put it in oils or lotions or whatever you want to do so there's there's that benefit to it but you know in and it has like oh not much not much flavor to it it might taste a little a little weird but it doesn't taste like marijuana okay full spectrum hemp oil tastes like marijuana okay you know and it smells like it's very strong very pungent because there's things like turbines that are in there that have they cause different aromas they also cause different things but see full spectrum hemp oil is kind of like are you gonna take vitamin C CBD or are you gonna take all your vitamins like a multivitamin okay the difference is this is not a man-made multivitamin you know with with hemp oil it basically is you know this amazing plant that has so much going on to there that all these different chemicals work well together in very small amounts they grew that way so it's natural so they work well together in those amounts and so you absorb all of this your body actually has a whole cannabinoid system that has receptors that can receive you know the different cannabinoids and they do different things now to be honest with you after doing tons of research it's it's pretty clear that they don't know everything that these cannibals can do they know a lot about CBD and a lot about THC but they don't know the rest over in Israel they're kind of like the people that are responsible for the most research on CBD I think they found it you know thirty forty years ago or something for the first time but what they figured out is if you take CBD by itself you almost have to do it in higher milligrams to get the effect that you want because it's isolated that means it doesn't work as well by itself it doesn't mean that it's bad it just doesn't work as well by itself you have to take much more of it so that's why you guys see like a lot of bottles say you know CBD 1000 or 1500 you know or whatever even 750 or 600 you see all that because it takes more because it's one thing all right now what these researchers and chemists have figured out is with all the cannaboids working together in the hemp oil extract all right it's a simpler process that requires only alcohol in the process or sometimes even pressing with heat you know alcohol we've been drinking alcohol for years it's not a poisonous thing to us you know what I mean least not in a small amount it's not like it's not like a heavy chemical but basically they're saying that all these cannabinoids working like they do together create the entourage effect you can you can look that up the entourage effect and so they're not really sure how synergistically it all works together to work so well but now we find that you don't need that much CBD you can get away with a lot less CBD because all these other cabin oils are magnifying the properties of each one make sense so when it comes to CBD I'm all healing I want the CBD for recovery for for mood like stress it's really good for me chilling out you know I'm a bodybuilder sometimes get fired up you know house [ __ ] goes you little testy I mean you know where I'm going with this my people you know okay so you know there's that but there's also other stuff going I'm gonna do a whole video on it I have like a little sunspot on my shoulder that apparently was precancerous according to the dermatologist she looked at it and was like yeah it looks like potentially precancerous they're talking about cutting it out you know I won't do that and it's been almost like a scab on its own for like a year and a half and then I started taking CBD pretty regularly about a month ago and now I'm watching it heal up and start to go away it's almost gone I'm gonna do a whole video on that just to show you I can't say that it cures anything I can't say that it's you know this this drug for this or that you can't do that the FDA won't let you so I'm not gonna say that but I'm just going to show you my experience with it so I start thinking this if I'm if I'm taking this substance this hemp oil okay and this is happening to my shoulder and I noticed that it relaxes me with my mood and eliminates stress I sleep really well if I take it before bed if it's doing all these things like it's helping me but like I think to myself what else is it doing inside of me you know if it's doing this I can see it on my shoulder and you can see it my mood I feel what else is it doing inside of me so when you guys see me promoting the products that I have it's full-spectrum hemp oil okay because I prefer the entourage effect I'm not trying to get high with CBD there's THC for that you know it's legal now in all different states everywhere and is what it is so if I want to get higher I'm gonna smoke I'm somebody with a blood THC and trust me I like my weed okay but when it comes to healing I'm literally looking at this is like one of the most beneficial things I can do for my body and so that's what I'm doing and I'm just I'm just relaying this to you because there's people in my family that need it there's friends of mine that need it and if I'm taking and I need it why not so so there it is this is a little bit longer video than I wanted it to be but I felt like I had to break it down so just know when you look at you know my product and you're gonna look at the milligram since that's what we do we're a bigger stronger faster Chris Bell okay so that that's what we're about here in the United States but you know at the end of the day like understand sometimes you know it's not always the best is just more it's not always the best all right so that that's what I was trying to explain with this video so anyways you heard it first thanks for your attention I would love to hear your feedback in comments like to answer questions you know and we're gonna rock and roll eat right train hard stay focused gotta make them gain Sun [Music] okay so here it is this is this is what I'm rocking with right now I really like it post-workout and I like it before bed or when I'm feeling really testy yeah we talked about that earlier you can check this out on my website

today we've got a first on the channel i've never actually done an oil review and today we're going to be looking at the 20 percent 2 000 milligram cbd oil from red eyes we're going to start off this video by telling you guys what is in this oil i'm going to read off some of the information that is on this box to give you a little overview of wasp in the actual bottle so the usage they say between one and three drops i'll talk more about my personal usage as the videos go on they say on here one to three drops about twice a day for someone that's probably new to cbd or definitely new to oil i've actually got a little story time in this video and i probably should have followed this advice when i gave this to someone to try [Music] we'll explain more as the video goes on so now let's look at the ingredients for this oil and it is just mct coconut oil and hemp extract that is all that's in this oil so mct oil is a fast actin oil it's got fats in there that are very fast absorbing which is great for an oil like this because if you're putting on your tongue you don't want to wait for two three hours like an edible or something like that so having an oil mixed into this bottle that's a fast acting oil that your body is going to absorb because basically that oil is going to carry those cannabinoids through your system and that is what the cannabinoids attach to the cannabinoids attach to those fats and then push those fats through your system and having a fast-acting fat oil means that those fats are going to shoot through your system really quick giving you that cbd really quick which i think is a huge benefit and i've got to say those fast acting fats that's in the mct oil in this bottle definitely are fast acting as well i've tried a lot of oils in the past and i will say this oil is pretty fast acting red eyes also say that this is a full spectrum oil which means that from the plants that they used they used all the cannabinoids that were included in this plant they didn't take the thc out they didn't take the cbda out they didn't take anything out they basically processed all of the cannabinoids in the plant and included them in this oil and i'm not going to go into it a huge amount here but you really want to look for oils that are full spectrum because there's something called the entourage effect when it comes to using cbd so basically you want to use cbd with as many other cannabinoids as possible to get even better effects and the fact that this is full spectrum definitely helps it also says that he uses a supercritical co2 extraction and it's lab tested for safety and quality which are also two really good points about this oil so guys just as a quick little plug i have just recently started a twitch streaming channel i'm streaming a few days a week at the minute i'll put my link in the description for anyone that's interested in watching me go live while i play some games and here is a little close-up that i wanted to show you guys of the oil in the bottle so this is the sort of color that you can expect from this oil if you do look to purchase it so let's get back to this oil it is twenty percent two thousand milligrams and red eyes and doing it like a lot of cbd companies i've seen make cbd oil a lot of companies will use cbd isolate which is a lot cheaper of a product and mix that into their oils to inflate the price and call it a really high cbd percentage but it actually is really cheap they use full spectrum oil and all the bottles are the same size the price increases on how much cbd is in the bottle so whether you're interested in a 1 000 milligram oil a 1 500 milligram oil or a 2 000 milligram oil the bottle size stays the same but the strength of the oil inside the bottle increases so i'm just going to show you guys how i've actually been using this oil i'm pretty much at the end i'm probably going to get this use in this session right now and i think that is going to be this bottle done red eyes have allowed me a lot of time with this oil which i really appreciate so i've been using this oil for between five and six weeks i would say and i've been using this probably about four or five times a week as well my dosage from what i've been using i've been using probably about half of one of these and that has been giving me the perfect dose that i need but now i'm gonna get into the story time because now we're talking about dosages there is a little story behind this oil that i had with one of my friends that was a little bit too much when it comes to the dosage so i had a friend come to me in work and say that he was just feeling really groggy he wasn't feeling good at all aches and pains the normal stuff the cold weather's coming in now and he just wasn't feeling good so i said to him i'm actually reviewing some oil right now are you interested in trying some i'm reviewing it i'd love to see your opinion on it and see if it works for you so he picked the bottle up and because i've been using about half of one of these he used probably just a little more than what's in there and because i'd been using half i thought you know a cbd there's not really any thc in it it's not going to hit him too hard and that was at about quarter to 10 in the morning so lunchtime came around he said he was feeling a little better but he didn't feel as though he'd whacked him so then the end of the day come around and i get a text from him that's about half past two and the text says i've been feeling quite stoned for the last hour without the paranoia so i actually got a little worried because if anything the last thing i want people to do when they're using this cbd oil is guest owned especially a lot of people who have messaged me have been saying they want to try cbd to get away from thc so this worried me when he said this so when i questioned him about the fact that he told me that he felt a little stoned he said maybe stoned was a heavy word to use for how he was feeling and then he said he just felt fluffy so after about 30 minutes he actually showed up and i met up with him and you could see that this oil had hit him he didn't look stoned he had a slight bit of a glassy eye but he looked super relaxed super relaxed super sat back in his seat and you could just see that he was really really chilled out which was actually surprising because through all my time using this oil i didn't actually feel as though it hit me hard in fact i felt as though this oil really cleared my head put me in a really positive mood but the one thing i love about this oil is the pain relief so before we say any more i think we've got to talk about taking this oil i haven't got much of it left this is probably the last of the oil but i'm just going to show you how i take it so just get the oil and i put it under my tongue and now you're not really gonna understand what i'm saying but i leave the oil under my tongue as long as i possibly can and now we're gonna get on to the next point which is the flavor of this oil i've tried a lot of oils in my time using cbd and this stuff doesn't really taste much different i really didn't like the flavor of this oil is very natural very hempy and it's got a very very earthy taste to it if you guys have used cbd oil this one when it comes to the taste isn't much different this one is very piney very earthy and very very hempy this is a strong tasting oil but i will say after using pretty much the whole bottle it does get easier to use this oil and the last few times really hasn't been an issue for me and i went to the next little test that i did because i wanted to see if food was gonna affect this oil for about two or three weeks of using this oil i was just pruning my mouth letting it sit for a few minutes and then just kind of getting on with my day and i did feel the effect i felt the clear head i feel the felt the positivity i felt the incredible pain relief that this oil gives but i was wondering if food was gonna impact it at all so for the last three or so weeks i've been using this oil with a mix of peanut butter and high fat foods to see if the effects would kick in anymore and i've gotta say i didn't really notice much of a difference i think that is because of the mct oil that they do use in this you don't really need any other fatty foods to help absorb this oil which i think is amazing i think the fact that you can just take this oil you can chuck it in your bag and you don't have to eat you with food it's a very very big plus and i think just the ease of use with this oil yeah it doesn't taste great but i've had this in my bag for about five or six weeks now it sits in the box when i need it i can take a few drops it's fast acting and i really have been getting some amazing pain relief from this and now let's get on to that let's get on to the pain relief for this because i think that is the highlight when it comes to this oil it doesn't taste great it doesn't smell great the oil looks good but the effect for me is definitely where this comes into play and the different effects to what i'm used to when it comes to using flour and stuff like that i didn't get any sort of tire dyes off this or glassy eyes or i didn't feel couch locked at all if anything this oil was perfect for taking in the morning and getting rid of that tired morning grogginess that we all seem to get this oil picked me up got me nice and alert cleared my head and put me in a very positive mood but the one thing i love about this oil more than anything you've heard me talk about a few times already is the pain relief i'm used to cbd pain relief lasting for a few hours and the pain seems to come back i've been struggling really bad with my chest and my shoulder over the last few weeks and honestly this stuff has been a lifesaver and especially today my shoulder my chest has been super sore and i just couldn't take it anymore so i took about half of a pipette of this oil and within about 30 minutes my pain completely disappeared on a scale of zero being no pain relief and be in complete pain relief this is up there i would say the pain relief is better than flour i would say this is on par with the pain relief for extract it seems to just melt it away and not only just melt the pain relief away but it keeps that pain away for about five or six hours i've noticed that the pain relief sticks around which is the reason why it's been in my bag for the last six weeks because there's definitely been times in the last five or six weeks throughout the day when i've just needed some oil to be that quick acting pain relief and this has done it this video was a little different for me i'm used to vaping flower and having sessions on camera but really all i could do was tell you guys about the oil tell you my experience show you how i use it and also throw a little story time in there as well but i've really enjoyed using this 2000 milligram oil from red eyes if you guys enjoyed the video remember to leave a thumbs up put some comments in the comment section hit that subscribe button and if you want to come and watch me

getting ready to go to sleep but I wanted to update you guys on my last video on some of the news that I've had and since I've been absent on making videos I thought it was we importante to make some videos for you guys so I just wanted to make this last one right before I went to bed um so as you guys know I'm avid user of my Ananda hemp oil my spectrum drops right so this is now my fourth video about reviewing this product I absolutely love this all right you guys already know that if you guys follow me you know that so not only do I want to talk about this product I want to talk about this company alright I absolutely love an and a hint a because I want you guys to comment in the section below if you guys have ever purchased something consistently for about six months that that company has then sent you a handwritten letter look at this hi Tim we recommend starting out with a low dosage so one gel cap is good a good starting point take one after-dinner not too late for one day or two and if you feel okay you can increase to one more gel cap in the morning after breakfast please let us know if you have any questions love Amanda hemp alright so this this letter that they sent me is because I've made a few review proud of you a few review videos about the and they sent me some samples to try all right so I can't believe I can't believe a company after six months of purchasing one product pretty consistently writes me a handwritten letter handwritten all right with sample products I've never had that happen before guys not only do I love the product that they do but now I feel like the company not only just I mean obviously if you're a company and you're in business you're a sole proprietorship you're an LLC your your whatever your conglomerate your your a large conglomerate you're you're in it to make money you're anything to make profit but now I feel like this company cares about the people so if you guys want to try this spectrum drops that I use I will be reviewing these I'm gonna start taking them like they suggested in the letter I'll be reviewing those I'll leave the video right here okay but if you guys want this stuff I'll leave the links in the description so you guys can purchase your own at their website and try it yourself and I can't promise anything but maybe you might get some free samples yourself so let me know what you guys

every video I release when I release them and don't forget I'm going to release the next video about those spectrum gels right here and you can get both this and this and the description below all right good night guys I love you you", "Qofq6bjOlh4": "[Music] hey guys Justin Ross here with green valley Nation I'm gonna give you a quick review of CB distilleries 1000 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil CV distillery uses American grown hemp that is non GMO not certified organic but it is third-party tested in each one milliliter dose of CBD oil you get 33 milligrams of CBD which is printed clearly here on the box see if you're still earning one thousand milligrams CBD oil uses a co2 extraction method they don't add any flavors to the oil itself they do use coconut oil as a carrier so that the product tastes like coconut oil and hemp plant so if the smell or the taste of hemp is not something you enjoy that might be something that you want to consider when purchasing this product see distillery 1,000 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil comes in this individually packaged in this nice bright orange box with CBD really easy to read across the top the other thing about this package is the milligrams of CBD per dose or easy to read right here on the front as well and each box comes with a informative pamphlet kind of gives you a little information about CP distillery itself and the product and how they extract the oil and all that the other thing I like about this is the label on the bottle matches the label on the box so if you lose the box no big deal so I'm taking CV distilleries 1000 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil for about six months now I usually take between 20 and 35 milligrams at one time I started taking it to see how it would help in my chronic back and knee pain and I noticed after about 20 minutes that I had significant reduction in pain and inflammation in my lower back and my knee I also take it in the evenings before bed to help me calm down from the day so that I sleep well all through the night and I don't wake up with any pain that's an added bonus so the things I like about CP distilleries 1000 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil is that it takes away the pain after only 1/2 I can also take it before bed and it'll help me sleep all night soundly and I'll wake up without any pain in the morning the other thing is that it's easy to fit this into my monthly budget the cons are the plant light flavor and the fact that I don't feel like it's quite as strong as some of the others that are in a similar concentration so overall if you're looking for a more economical high concentrated full-spectrum CBD oil and you don't mind a little bit of a plant flavor you can't go wrong with CBS tillery's 1000 milligram full-spectrum or CBD oil my name is Judson Ross and if you liked this review and would like more be sure to follow us at Green Valley nation for your most comprehensive review on hemp products [Music]", "oACmVBbLN7M": "[Music] hi my name is Jennifer Dixon with green valley nation and today i want to talk to you a little bit about the Seabee distillery 2500 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil at this level of concentration it's probably best for folks with more severe symptoms that are looking for natural approaches to helping them manage those symptoms in each one milliliter dose you get 83 milligrams of CBD the Seabee distillery 2500 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil is a co2 extracted non-gmo non certified organic u.s. grown hemp product because it's a full-spectrum product you get to experience all the benefits of the many compounds found within the hip plant sometimes this is known as the entourage effect let's talk a little bit about the packaging and what you get when you order the Seabee distillery 2500 milligram CBD oil they recently revamped everything and the new color scheme is pretty neat coral but what's really cool about the new packaging is that you see the dose right here in front which contrasts pretty well with the coral color so you know exactly what you're going to get each time you take one milliliter which is their suggested serving size another cool thing about that this particular new product is that on the side it actually tells you how to take it because sometimes there is a little bit of confusion on how you administer the supplement when you open up the box you're gonna find your little bottle it's 30 milliliters of the full-spectrum CBD oil and then you'll also find a cute little pamphlet that helps to educate you a little bit on CBD what's in the product how much you get for a couple of drops and things like that you're going to notice that it's a it's a dark amber color and that's because it's a full-spectrum full-spectrum products are usually a little more dark and a little more plant like let's go ahead and try it since this is so concentrated I usually don't take a full dropper that's just too much for me so I'm gonna take a few drops I'm going to put it underneath my tongue and then wait about 30 seconds right off the bat you're going to learn two things one this does not taste awesome unless you really love the earthy plant like taste 2 this is really strong a little bit goes a long way you're gonna find within about 15 to 30 minutes that you're calmer you're able to focus a little bit and any residual pain that you have this stuff will knock it right out I don't take the full dose because it is so strong but my husband does and he loves it one dose will that last him basically all day 8 to 10 hours another really cool thing about this product is it'll help you to go to sleep and stay asleep because it is so strong let's talk about value here this is a very concentrated product that comes in far below other competitive prices for similar concentrations it still is a little bit on the higher end if you're on a tight budget but if you do have severe symptoms this is a really great way to manage those symptoms and not break the bank what I really love about the Seabee distillery 2500 milligrams is that a little bit goes a long way if I had this bottle all to myself it would last me forever because I never take a full dropper however my husband is constantly taking mine so it doesn't last quite as long there are 30 doses if you do one milliliter at a time so that's still a pretty good amount and it lasts you all day and it helps you to go to sleep the thing that is not so awesome about the Seabee distillery 2500 milligram is that it does not taste very good if you are very sensitive to strong earthy flavors this may not be the product for you because it is both strong and very earthy flavored the other problem with the Seabee distillery that even though it is a very good value still is

Hi, I am Matt and welcome to another CuredByNature\nepisode - CBD Frequently Asked Questions. After such a long time of cannabis stigma,\nthe truth is finally out. Cannabis is very good for the human body. Most of the people know about THC - the cannabinoid\nIn the cannabis plant that gets you high, right? One other cannabis component has been massively\nresearched for the past 30+ years, because of its health benefits. And that\u2019s CBD or Cannabidiol. And since CBD does not get you high or in\nother words, it\u2019s not psychoactive the way THC is,.. and because US president Trump signed\nthe new Farm Bill in December 2018, you can buy CBD products almost anywhere these days. From local health shops to different online\nshops. And believe it or not, the majority of the\npeople prefer not to be stoned or high all the time. That makes CBD products ideal cannabis products. You get the benefits of cannabis but without\nthe high. Now back to the subject\u2026 Full Spectrum CBD vs CBD Isolate\nIf you\u2019ve done just a little bit of research you know there\u2019s basically 2 kinds of CBD\nproducts. Products made with Full Spectrum CBD\nand Products made with CBD isolate. First the Full Spectrum CBD\nIt\u2019s also called Full Spectrum CBD Extract,... or Whole-plant CBD extract or FECO that stands\nfor Full Extract Cannabis Oil. It includes all of the cannabinoids found\nin the cannabis plant and also includes all the other components that get extracted out\nof cannabis flowers in the process. These other components are terpenes, waxes,\nhealthy fatty acids and chlorophyll. And you know what,... there are other components\nin the cannabis plant that get extracted in the process that we are not even aware of. But that\u2019s a story for another time. So when we say \u201cfull-spectrum,\u201d we\u2019re\nreferring to a naturally extracted spectrum rather than a constructed spectrum. Now let\u2019s talk about the CBD isolate:\nCBD isolate is just CBD. It\u2019s just cannabidiol molecule isolated\nor separated from other cannabis compounds in the plant. Now to the big question:\nWhat to choose - Full Spectrum CBD or CBD Isolate There are studies that give scientific proof\nthat Full Spectrum CBD that also includes low amounts of THC plus other cannabinoids,\nterpenes, etc. produce what is known as an Entourage Effect. The synergistic relationship between all of\nthe cannabis components has been shown to increase the healing properties of each. But when it comes to CBD isolate,... even\nthough it\u2019s fairly unlikely that you would fail a drug test or experience a form of \u201chigh\u201d\nbecause of the low amounts of the THC in those Full Spectrum CBD products,... some people\nprefer to be on the safe side. So now you have the information you need to\ndecide... CBD Isolate vs Full Spectrum CBD My suggestion is always Full Spectrum CBD. Why? Well, when it comes to health I don\u2019t think\nwe should hold back. This is a natural medicine and it just doesn\u2019t make any sense not to get the full benefit out of it.

Thanks for watching!", "oOv985ZqPxU": "scientists have recently discovered that our bodies produce cannabis light compounds called endocannabinoids but compounds like these are also found in plants like hemp these are called phyto cannabinoids hemp is rich in phytochemicals in addition to other phytonutrients one of hemp primary constituents is CBD or cannabidiol when CBD oil is extracted other plant components come along with it this is what's referred to as a full spectrum hemp extract hemp CBD has a remarkable safety profile is non psycho toxic and has shown great promise for human health because each individual's ECS is unique the path to balance is different from one person to the next just like some days we need one cup of coffee other days we may need to by adding hemp CBD

minted leaf products say that it helps them with general stress anxiety they sleep better if they work out at the gym all the time it helps with inflammation and just provides an overall well-being so when and how do most people use full spectrum hemp the most common form is oil otherwise known as extract or tinctures at minted leaf we use a thirty milliliter dropper bottle which makes it super easy to get the exact same amount every day make sure to give your bottle a little shake before you use and place one full dropper amount underneath your tongue and hold it for sixty seconds and then

to have the amazing benefits so now it's time to get a little personal so a few years ago I underwent a spinal fusion surgery I mean I was dealing with daily pain in my neck my jaw headaches I mean I couldn't sleep it was causing anxiety and stress it was just awful and I tried everything from massage therapy injections physical therapy acupuncture pain pills I mean that he wants to have to take pain pills right so to be honest before I started with minted leaf I hadn't heard of full spectrum hemp or specifically using it to help aid pain so of course when I started I was like live to try this and I'm a bit skeptical and really in full transparency I didn't feel like it works for me the first couple of days because I was using too low of a dose so I upped my dose and I upped it twice a day and now I feel really great I can tell you what it does for me it makes my competing muscles just feel more relaxed so I'm not gonna say that the pain is a hundred percent gone but I just feel better it also helps with things like just focus and clarity throughout the day again I put it in my tea at night it's a great way to just relax before you sleep and like a little hint for my crazy active eight-year-old son I put a little bit in their smoothies they don't even notice so I'm a fan and I recommend it if you just want to feel better you want to try something different definitely

making a CBD alcohol tincture but first if you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please hit that subscribe button and if you've already subscribed thank you very much and if you wouldn't mind give the video a thumbs up it would help our channel out quite a bit so today we're going to be making an alcohol-based CBD tincture this is a simple yet kind of complex recipe only because of the amount of plant material that goes into this recipe normally if you've seen my other videos about making cannabis oil or CBD oil if we're talking grams to cup of oil so you know a certain amount of grams per cup of oil and that's usually the recipe it can be fluctuated but today we're going to be talking Elsa's 2 cup so we're going to be using ounces of flour per cup of alcohol and the reason this is is because alcohol can extract plant material the best it's pretty much the best home remedy to get the most out of plant material it grabs onto those cannabinoids and rips them off the plant material and it makes some really potent stuff and you can use it for all kinds of different applications including adding to your wine or drink at night but for today we're just making a base alcohol tincture so I've already measured out 3.3 ounces of CBD by ops flower and this runs at 21.1% CBD we've also used our trim bag recently so you haven't checked that video please do and we're going to be using some Vioxx flower trim and the reason why I have some trim here and flower is because I want to do about one ounce of flower per cup of alcohol so we're going to be making three cups of CBD alcohol tincture today but I want to use the trim to add CBD a to the mix we want this to be a full-spectrum CBD alcohol tincture so we'll be using some of this probably only about an ounce or two of trim along with the three point three ounces of flour so as always we're going to decarbonize de carve our trim because when you dakar you lose the a and cbda and it becomes CBD so we're going to be getting all of our CBD from the flower and we'll be getting a lot of our CBD a from the trend and if you haven't seen my decarboxylated technique run through it really quick today all I do is they preheat my oven to 250 degrees and I put my flower in there for roughly a half an hour you can go a little bit more you can go a little bit less it really depends on what you want your conversion to be but I like to go right about half an hour sometimes 35 minutes or 40 minutes given the amount of material I may go 40 minutes today so I'm gonna preheat the oven on a decarboxylate this and then we're going to get started using our magic butter machine and the recipe to make our CBD alcohol tincture okay so our hemp flour has now decarboxylated I did 250 degrees for 40 minutes just because of the amount of material I wanted to make sure that that was going to be fully d carved then while I was waiting for that to D carb I measured out one ounce of biotics flour trim so now let's get the magic butter machine and start making this alcohol texture okay so now we have our magic butter machine and we have our one ounce of not decarboxylated hemp flour trim and we also have our decarboxylated hemp flour so today the alcohol we'll be using is a fan-favorite for extraction this is Everclear its grain alcohol and it's a hundred and ninety proof now you can't get this here or Virginia and certain states you cannot get it in so you're just going to look for your high prove I know a lot of states is a 151 or something like that whatever the case is but the higher the proof the more extraction and this is going to give us pretty much the best extraction we can buy so all we need to start doing is gonna get our not decarboxylated trim and we're going to start adding our decarboxylated fat flower okay get that in there all right so now we have all of our flower in our magic butter machine as you can see this thing is packed full but that's going to be okay so that is this is four point three ounces of products so this is all biotics flower in here this is four point three ounces of Vioxx hemp flour whether it's trim flower it's just all plant material so now I'm going to be doing three cups of alcohol so we'll measure here now you see why I use three cups just happens to be a coincidence that it's the 750 milliliter Everclear is just about 3 cups so once you've measured that out go ahead and pour that in okay now we're all squared up everything is in we're going to put the top on our magic butter machine as we always do and we're going to plug it in okay so now we've plugged in our magic butter machine all as well so for an alcohol tincture you're gonna go to a hundred and thirty degrees Fahrenheit and I like to do eight hours now you can do four but I want the most out of it so I'm gonna do eight hours so we'll see it eight hours and we'll show you the finished product okay so the magic butter machine is all done and we just got a scoop off all the remaining plant material now remember this was like four point three ounces of plant material so there is quite a bit but you're gonna be really surprised what it looks like in there so it all gets blended down and I'll show you here so what was once a pile of flour is now gone so we're just going to dump it all out into the micron bag try to get everything out of here this is a quite a bit of plant material now at the bottom I'll scoop some out so you can see it just put that right into the white crumb bag but while the plant material in this recipe a lot different than the will recipes so now that that's done put your silicone glove on your dominant hand so you can squeeze it the best clean that up a little bit so the amount of plant material makes it definitely more challenging than the oil recipes because you're squeezing four ounces of plant material dried plant material now it's all wet can be quite the challenge and so what I like to do is put it right back in to the Everclear bottle so you know it's the alcohol tincture so that's what we're going to do here so that's our recipe that's what I have for you today folks I hope you enjoyed this recipe and use it to your advantage I will leave the recipe in the description below on the video go ahead and try it yourself if you have any comments questions leave them below you can also find us on Instagram and Facebook I'll leave those links in the description and I will see you in another video take care", "_-R-Oe1NpYY": "what is hemp flour in this video i'm going to tell you exactly what that is and i'm going to tell you that even though this looks exactly like marijuana it's legal on a federal level and while we're at it i'm going to tell you about cannabinoids which determine the intensity and it determines the physical sensations you're going to feel in your body and i'm going to tell you about terpenes which determine the smell and stinkiness of the flower so when you go shopping for flour online you're going to be able to find the best stinkiest flower that just really smacks so without rambling too much i'm gonna get right into it my name's chris with cbd extract.co i've been in the cannabis industry for 10 years and hemp specifically for three years and what i can tell you from my experience is that the words hemp marijuana and cannabis all mean the same thing technically but thanks to our good old buddy donald trump he now made federal legal definitions for these terms for example marijuana is defined as any cannabis product that has more than 0.3 percent delta 9 thc now we're not talking about thca we're not talking about delta 8 thc and we're not talking about any other form of thc we're only talking about delta nine so if it's above that threshold it's marijuana so and that's really weird because on a federal level that's a controlled substance it's a schedule one controlled substance so it's up there with meth heroin crack cocaine whatever those drugs are i don't know specifically because i don't do those drugs but what i do know is that it's in the same category which is totally bogus and messed up but what's crazy is that hemp is defined as less than 0.3 delta 9 thc so what that means is that all the other cannabinoids like cbg cbn thca delta athc these are all compounds that have free reign to be bought sold and shipped over state borders on a federal level it's completely legal and usps will actually ship this no problem they will not confiscate your product as long as it has a lab test in the package now what this means for you is you can literally go on google right now you can go on google right now and type in hempflower or delta8thc or cbg and you can literally buy products that look like marijuana but are completely legal to be bought and shipped to your house that is literally crazy that's insane so and as a matter of fact if you want to get your hands on some indoor flour you can get an eighth totally for free at cbdxrack.co we actually give a free eighth of our greenhouse or indoor grown flower completely for free all you got to do is hit the link below so definitely check that out um it you got nothing to lose it's totally free we covered the pot all you got to do is cover the postage but anyways to figure out if the product is legal or not so it's actually safe to be shipped because keep in mind marijuana is illegal to be shipped over state borders you don't want to send marijuana over the border or buy it accidentally online and then you get caught and get in trouble so what you need to do is look at the lab test and so i'm going to pop this up on the screen right now but if you look at the lab test you'll see the triangle 9 thc as long as that percentage right there is less than 0.3 you're in the clear and it's considered hemp um if it's over obviously it's marijuana that's considered hot hot hemp as they call it and completely illegal unless you live in a recreational state so um and keep in mind like i said total thc doesn't matter on a federal level um the thca doesn't matter delta a thc cbg cbn none of that matters only the delta nine so keep that in mind i know i'm like a broken record at this point with the delta nine stuff but that's literally just how it works um so if you want to find the best quality this is the we need to look at because we're already looking at the lab test i might as well teach you how to get the best quality hemp flower there's a lot of people there's a lot of crappy dirty ditch wheat out there but basically if you look at the lab test you'll see the total cannabinoid percentage cannabinoid cannabinoid i don't know everyone says it different but basically the higher that percentage is the more you're going to feel so for example if you have a high cbd flower it's going to be relaxing if you have a high cbg flower it's going to be more stimulating because cbg is considered a non-psychoactive stimulant some people react to it differently they don't know too much about it but obviously each cannabinoid has a different effect cbn it's actually slightly psychoactive and it um makes you sleepy all right and then obviously if you have a high thca product when you smoke that thca it turns into delta 9 thc so obviously it gets you high same thing with delta 8 thc okay so basically you can buy these products online okay so if you want to get the products that really smack because a lot of people say oh hemp flour kind of sucks like it doesn't really make me feel like anything you need to get a higher percentage flower okay it's really that simple it works just like the medical industry with marijuana the higher the percentage the more you're going to feel and like i said you have different ratios of the cannabinoids the the percentages of them the next thing you want to look at in terms of the smell is going to be the terpenes now the terpenes are essentially the oils found in the bud that give it that pungent smell so if you're smelling pine you're smelling skunk you're smelling weird marijuana smells or whatever you know it just smells like weed in general that's a result of the terpenes and these terpenes actually indicate whether or not it's indica or sativa so for example uh limonene is considered a sativa uh terpene and mercine is considered a indica so if you look at the lab test you can see which terpenes are dominant that actually determines what effects are going to feel because these terpenes actually indicate um how you're gonna feel right they bind to your receptors in the same way that cannabinoids do so it's really crazy and one more thing to look out for when you're shopping for hemp flour online is don't just go off the pictures because you're gonna see these big dank beautiful buds you're gonna see like all these reviews and stuff but you might get it in the mail if you're going at it blindly and you'll be like man these buds are like dull smelling they don't really do anything they kind of smoke it i got a throat itch and a headache you don't want that so always look at the lab test right because the lab test is like your safeguard to make sure you're getting quality product you don't want to be wasting your money you don't want to smoke dirty ditchweed and also you want to see on the lab test if there's panel testing for pesticides because who knows maybe they're selling pesticide hemp flour you need to protect yourself so always look at the lab test and that's pretty much it so hemp flour yeah it actually can get you high if you buy a certain type of product just have in general you can get high if you buy a certain type of product but really guys it's just so simple if you want to feel good look at the lab test check the cannabinoids and the terpenes and you're going to get good product so that's pretty much it i hope you enjoyed this video and like i said if you want access to indoor and greenhouse grown flower hit the link below we're

River cannabis and today's video I'm going to be doing a very much requested video from all of our subscribers which is how to make extra-strength CBD oil but before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind please consider hitting that subscribe button and supporting our channel also if you already have subscribed thank you very much I appreciate the support and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up to show that support so folks the number one request I've gotten and it's our second most viewed video on our channel is how to make CBD oil but a lot of people want to know how they can get more bang for their buck and how they can get more CBD in that oil and today I'm going to show you how you can do it but before we get into the details of how to make this exercise CBD oil if you guys are interested in hemp flour go ahead and email me I'll leave all that in the description below check out our website we have a new menu all new prices and a lot of our customers make CBD oil at home so we've adjusted a lot of our pricing to accommodate people who make their own CBD oil so go ahead and check that out and you can always email me and we accept most major payments at this point via PayPal folks the ingredients really is just one extra step to make extra strength CBD oil now this is a request for a family member this is not how I make CBD oil here on the farm to distribute so this is just as order for a family friend but I thought I would take this opportunity to share with you how you can do it at home so first thing you're gonna need to do is of course you're gonna want to have your hemp flour now again guys you can always grab this from us and again all that information is in the description below but here is some cherry wine hemp flour that our our family friend requested and we are going to make CBD oil with it now our cherry wine has a great amount of CBD in 19% to be exact so we can get more for our money by adding one simple ingredient and that is lesson 10 now with lesson 10 why does it make so much of a difference well MCT oil has a maximum absorption rate which means even a 100% ratio it really can't absorb all the CBD that these flowers have so to bump up the absorption rate you can add less ATIP and less if it has all the essential things to be able to absorb more cannabinoids so that is why a lot of people adolescent in now there is a ton of different less attends out there there's soy lecithin with granular and liquid you got sunflower lesson 10 grandeur and liquid love about capsules but I just buy liquid now I buy sunflower less attendant that is in the liquid form because I don't like soy I'm not a big fan of eating soy I think it's just in too many foods in the United States today so I went with sunflower lesson you can go with regular if that's what you prefer when you filter it out using our magic butter machine it doesn't really make much of a difference I just prefer the liquid now in order to get this started we're gonna have to decarbonise if allah grants stay the same for our CBD well as it does for this we're going to be doing 28 grams of CBD flour and 2 cups of MCT oil so that's approximately 14 grams of flour per cup now you can range that between seven and fourteen depending on your potency but we're really trying to maximize the absorption rate of the oil and the less intense so we're gonna do the maximum amount and we're going to be adding less aten so I'm going to go D carb our cherry wine flour that we have here I'm going to weigh it to 28 grams we've got our D carboxy R and you can see I've already waited and so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fire up the oven I'm going to put it at 250 degrees and I'm going to be doing it for approximately 30 minutes so I will see you in 30 minutes with some D carb flour okay folks our flour has now been D carb is out of the oven and it is ready to go so obviously the first thing we're gonna do is go ahead and get all this flour into the magic butter machine now you all know that I absolutely love my magic butter machine you can't convert this recipe to work in a crock-pot or anything else but as always I just want my magic butter machine so first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna add our MCT oil now this was purchased online 16 fluid ounces I know a lot of my subscribers always ask me what is my favorite MCT oh oh whoa this has pretty much everything you want to look for it's organic non-gmo and of course it's USDA certified organic which is a big deal so first and foremost we're just going to take the wrapper off of this and go ahead and add it now again like I said 16 fluid ounces equals two cups so there's no need to measure this we can go ahead and add it directly into the machine now here's the change of the recipe folks it really depends on how much less attend you want to add I wouldn't go any more than two tablespoons per cup so a maximum for this recipe would be four tablespoons of less eaten but I'm gonna do right in the middle there I'm gonna probably do about three for this recipe because it's such a high CBD amount that I don't want to overdo it but I also don't want to under do it so go ahead and get your tablespoon measure and you're just going to measure it out now you can see it's very sludgy so it takes a little bit of time it's almost like molasses type texture it's very slow very syrupy so you're gonna have to take your time with it but maybe we'll just do two for this round two for videos sake but you can add whatever you want so as we wait for this to go into the magic butter machine go ahead and cap everything now here's the thing for for you folks at home here's a little trick to the trade keep your MCT oil bottle because a lot of them come with spouts like this one and what I like to do especially for family members isn't the first time I've done this for family members is I usually just refill the bottle with the CBD oil and hand it back to him and you can do that at home and that way you don't have to use a mason jar or anything like that you can just you know even put another label over top of this I use a sharpie so you know that it's cbdo so you don't try cooking with it or anything like that so most of the lesson2 is off but what we're going to do is we're going to use our trusty magic butter spatula and make sure we get it all off of the tablespoon here and you go ahead and see so that's about it best we can now now that we've added the Blessington we're gonna go ahead and fire up our magic butter machine so let me get this plugged in now folks as always same as before we're gonna go up to 160 which is the middle of the road for this so there's your temperature 160 and I do 4 hours for the texture so folks I will see you in four hours to show you the final product all right folks so this has just gone off the magic butter machines timer has gone off so I'm going to do is go ahead and unplug it and you know go ahead and get all the stuff you can off the top of the machine here this one looks pretty good right now actually now the whole lot to get off of there which is good I find that the little spatula that magic butter makes works really well for this now we got their spatula kit from the a couple weeks ago all right so now as always guys you see how it's always on the edge here so you just want to scoop that down in because that has oil in it get all that ends all right and so this process is going to be the same as we've always done with all of our other oils you always put it on the love glove or the the silicone glove you always put it on your dominant hand if your left hand and put it on your left hand it just makes things easier okay so that is the majority of the oil right there now this oil will definitely be darker than a traditional CBD whoa and that is because of the sunflower lecithin note no worries about it it doesn't really have much of a different flavor but it's just something to note if you are using the liquid less inton it will have a darker look to it and I'll show you here so you can see it's a little darker than normal CBD oil not by much but it's definitely noticeable a lot of times when I make it with the by ox you know it comes out a little bit lighter and so typically what I'll do is I'll get all the other stuff there's still plant material that needs to be squeezed but I want to show you guys this trick I go ahead and I put it right back in the bottle okay so what this does to is it frees up this Pyrex measuring cup for me to be able to get all the plant material really not have to worry about splashing any of the oil or wasting any of the oil so you go ahead and you just put it right back in the bottle and then go ahead and put all the plant material in here and get rid of it so now you're not going to get a lot of oil out of the plants but it is worth giving a good squeeze you know making sure it's all out of there get as much as you can again you don't want to waste it it's good stuff takes four hours to make so you want to make sure that you get your money's worth if you're at home looks pretty good one more scoop here all right so that's it get your uh your glove back on and you kind of shake it all down there you're just gonna give it a good squeeze try to get as much of that well as you can out of there now you can refine it a little bit more if you want I have Magic butters other screens the 190th which is what they provide with the magic butter machine works great but if you don't like any type of sediment or plant material in your oil you can't even refine it more but I recommend making sure you do this round first and then go ahead and use a different screen but yeah so we can add that we need to get a lot out of the plant material but it's enough I would say that we got a pretty decent return probably about 13 ounces out of the 16 you're always gonna lose oil so that's just the nature and there's still some in here but that's what I have for you today guys again remember if you need hemp flour my contact information will be in the description below go ahead and check it out we have adjust our prices for people who make their own CBD oil at home to benefit them because a lot of our sales are for that so we're trying to adjust accordingly and I appreciate all the YouTube supporters out there

comment below and you can always find me on Instagram and Facebook that information will always be in the description below so that's all I have for you today guys I hope you take care hope this recipe works for you and I will see you in another video", "YH63Z30fc8w": "hello and thank you for joining us here at the green dad i just wanted to hop on here and say hello hello uh and also to talk about a cbd product that i use earlier today i had posted on my instagram account about my morning routine which includes two two capsules of the host defense mushroom blend for your brain and memory function one five milligram thc bill from tech in pennsylvania and 15 milligrams one milliliter of the lazarus naturals full spectrum cbd oil and after i posted that i had a few people reach out to me about recommendations for cbd cbd oil and products i like and so i figured i'll just hop on here in case anybody else was curious or looking for a really good recommendation for a solid product and i cannot say enough about lazarus naturals their products their customer service the company they are really easy to work with they make a great product small independent form outside of portland oregon if you place your order before one o'clock on the east coast time it ships out that day and it usually ships with free three-day shipping anywhere in the us you can get different sizes you can actually get all different types of blends you can get mint you can get flavors you can get full spectrum you can get isolate you can get broad spectrum they have a whole bunch of great things your stuff your pets their stuff for your kids a lot of good stuff to choose from i've been using uh this blend for about a year now i was diagnosed with arthritis in my knee and the doctor said you can either eat better and add in a anti-inflammatory diet and a regimen of cbd and medical marijuana or we can inject you with silicone in your knees and i said [ __ ] that not gonna happen so i opted for the anti-inflammatory diet route and the cbt and medical marijuana uh route i mean you know that sounds a lot better than getting injected your knee if you ask me um but because of previous existing conditions in my kidney i couldn't take a lot of the painkillers and a lot of ibuprofen that would help with the pain and the swelling so i opted for the diet and the cpt in marijuana route wasn't a tough decision not even close big surprise i know but anyway that is how i got to getting familiar with this product um i was trying i tried the gummies which you know from you know a good company that makes a good product there's nothing wrong with gummies or anything like that i just happened to click with this product it was easy to use it was just a perfect amount well i think a lot of people don't know or have a grasp because you know we'd like to think that bigger bigger better stronger is always the case but um with a lot of like a lot of other um plant nutrients and vitamins you can only take so much of something into your system before it doesn't really do anything um major then you know the certain tolerant amount um so 15 to 25 milligrams twice a day is actually quite enough um to help regulate your endocannabinoid system and help with inflammation in the pain which is why i love this product so much it is a full spectrum product which means it is full plant and all the cannabinoids that are in it mostly well-known part is the cbd the cannabidiol extract and it can have up to three tenths of one percent of thc um and i just for believer that using the whole plant and the whole product the way it was meant to be is the best route you can get it without the teach you know if you need to because of either insurance or drug testing or anything like that but you can get a full spectrum cbd shipped to you in all 50 states it's completely legal you won't get hired from it anything like that i'm not going to go too much into the basics of cbd because i'm guessing if you're watching for recommendations you already are using it or or already have made the decision to use it there's plenty of great resources out there if you want to learn more you can go to thegreendad.net you can uh check out my instagram page at the green dad on instagram or you know thousands literally of other places out there just please don't buy your cbd gas stations seriously don't do it it's yeah anyway but uh usually i will take this sub lingually which means you take off the gap it comes with a measured dropper up into the line is one milliliter of dose [Music] and you can just literally here i'll show you i'll do it right now you take it you can see it's all natural still green just straight up plant extract is mixed with an coconut oil mct uh medium chain triglyceride because uh cannabinoids need to bond with the fatty substance in order to be processed by your body so you you measure it out you just literally just squirt it under your tongue all right let it chip for about 30 seconds um if you really want to absorb into your mouth you want to absorb under your tongue so it can get into your bloodstream it takes about anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours for it to really take effect and i'm going to wash that down another great thing about these tinctures is you can also if you don't want to put them under your tongue because it does have a very strong cannabis plant flavor i happen to like it not everyone does but you know if you want to try you can try a smaller bottle to see if it's a flavor that you like and get into but i said you can get other flavors if that is more of your thing but the other good news is you can also put that full dropper into your morning coffee you can put it into your cereal or your oatmeal blend it up again i prefer it's sublingually i like it to be concentrated to go directly into my bloodstream um if you put it in your coffee just keep in mind that since it is an oil impulse on top it doesn't actually fully mix in unless you have a water soluble type cbd tincture which this is not this is an oil so it will just basically it'll sit on top of the coffee or your tea or whatever beverage you put it in it doesn't really fully blend in so you have to kind of make sure you eat the whole layer on top so you're basically going to get all of it first anyway so you know i prefer to put it with a tincture and wash it down with some tea or some water just personal opinions you know go with what works for you but i really like this product and its flavor so it doesn't it doesn't bother me uh but if you're getting the bigger bottle of this uh this is 120 milliliters so there's 120 doses in this of the you know the 15 milligram doses in the one milliliter uh but me and my fiance usually will use uh takes about two months to go through a bottle of this size uh that is with a dose in the morning with our coffee and then about half hour before bed um you know sometimes if they're having a little bit of rougher time you can take some more so but we can usually get about two months out of a bottle of that size and that is the 15 milligram per dose you can get a higher dose of 50 milligrams per serving but i don't wouldn't recommend that unless of course obviously you have some severe issues you have severe chronic pain you have severe um inflammatory issues that you need to to cope with um or really i mean like extreme anxiety but if you have that type of anxiety you probably you know might be looking at some other alternative treatments for that but you know again like um 15 milligrams in the morning with coffee to get you going 15 before night one thing i will mention i just didn't really want to get into too much of the basics of this but i can't stress this enough one of the biggest misconceptions is that you're gonna take it oh and you're gonna paint it's gonna go away like it's taking a pill or an aspirin or something like that or you're gonna take a whole bunch in like 20 minutes you're going to go to sleep that's not how cbt works in the body what it does is it helps to regulate the system the endocannabinoid system and part of the endocannabinoid system is pain maintenance the part of the brain that controls sleep part of the brain that controls anxiety and processes that or it does it just regulates it keeps it healthy so that you can you know keep a regular schedule when you know when you lay down at night your body has different things that it goes through to prepare you for sleep and you know you're highly anxious or if you have a lot of stress or pain it can take away from your body's ability to regulate that system so what this basically does is just allows you to get better sleep it's the absence of some of the stress cbd has been found to really counteract cortisol which is released when you're stressed as well as you know all the other the things i've mentioned so that is why i'm a huge huge believer in this product and use it for those reasons another thing that you may or may not be aware of if you also smoke cannabis whether it be for adult recreational use or for medicinal if you get some of these strains that are usually sativa or sativa dominant which can kind of get that little racy feeling or a little bit of anxiety from smoking um not really paranoid or bugging out but sometimes you'll just get a little jittery feeling or your brain is kind of still you know because it's like a plant so sometimes for me some tativas are like having a cup of coffee um if you take 15 milligrams you know one stopper full of that oil about 10 to 20 minutes ahead of smoking um a plant or some flowers you'll find that it can take the edge off of some of those other items i mean it is from the cannabis plant thc thca is meant to bond with cbd and you get a thing called the entourage effect but only goes one way the entre effect cbd only enhances and helps thc thc does not have the same effect back towards cbt or cbg those items are helping the thas but again there's plenty of other resources for that one just want to kind of stick to this and get you on your way so uh yeah i will list more information about lazarus naturals in the comments and if there's anything else you have questions about or concerns or topics you want me to talk about or maybe your own personal experiences with cbd you can leave that down in the comments and i'll get back to you on that and you know if you have any other items you'd like to see me review or talk about outside of what i have planned you know that's always welcomed as well i look forward to your feedback and i hope this finds you well uh if you want to keep up to date with all the fun things we're going to talk about you can hit subscribe follow along like i said you can head over to instagram you head over to twitter the greendad.net all those fun places anyway smoke if you got them thanks for listening and i'll talk to you guys soon thanks you", "chBuSIJ2fbQ": "guys it is Sam again and I am back with another video for you regarding CBD and the last video if you didn't watch my last video it was on a vape pen so if you didn't see the vape pen a review on CBD FX I would highly recommend going over there and looking at that but for this I am doing a CBD oil now this CBD oil is called kidney B the company Canady is very reputable I believe I believe they have about four point four to 4.8 stars out of five on several platforms you can go research them yourself but I would highly recommend listening to what I have to say about it I have been taking this for three days only three days but I have been taking CBD for over three years so this is full-spectrum CBD oil what that means is it has THC in it it has less than 0.3 percent THC in it the reason why is because it is the legal dose that you can take in America in all 50 states except for Oregon carrot California Colorado Washington they're all recreationally legal for anything but in other states the point the below 0.3% is 100% legal and safe so the reason why I brought up TC is because I like products with THC in them the compounds of THC and CBD works so well for me together if I just sorry if I just use a CBD isolate I am going to not feel right I'm gonna not feel good at all because it's something that doesn't do anything for me like it does do stuff for me but it makes me feel off it makes me feel weird so this has enough THC in it for me to feel good I just feel good with it and I do feel THC and especially in small amounts I'm very sensitive to THC so if you're sensitive to THC I wouldn't recommend this if you still if you still want to try to each see in your system and you still want to try having it in your CBD oils or your CBD vape pens I would do some more research on the products that can Navy has or if you want to CBD FX or go to pure relief com now I want to talk about what I have in my system right now so right now I have this in my system about 20 to 24 milligrams I have something else in my system which is a CBD joint it's a pre-roll from peer relief and it had point zero three percent to each C in it and I had about 20 milligrams of that this morning this I take throughout the day this I supplement or the smoking I supplement to this this I take every day all day and I think I want to start taking the one dose in the morning and one at night because I feel like it's gonna make me feel a lot better especially with something with THC in it because it can make you a tad drowsy because I have about because I have about forty to forty four milligrams in my system I'm feeling a little bit drowsy but I think it's because of the THC in this that I'm having a little bit of a haze if you will but it's nothing it's nothing bad I don't I don't feel high well I feel slightly buzzed but that's just because my body is what my body is that doesn't have to be your body also I wanted to mention if you are 18 plus continue watching this video if you are not 18 plus if you are below 18 I would not get any of this because you're not allowed that it's still illegal for people under 18 to purchase so I would be careful with that you can't purchase it and I don't condone anyone below 18 to be using this and also I don't condone anyone to be I'm not saying anybody should use this it's actually not for everyone but I do I do strongly recommend looking it up for yourself and researching it because this can be a life changer this can be a very big game changer any CBD product so this product specifically is $69 it is the 750 milligrams but 'el it is 30 milliliters in lemon-lime full-spectrum CBD oil I got it for $69 now you can look up a coupon code for this I used a coupon code it saved me roughly 25% I believe so that'll be super handy if you're you know tight on cash as the pandemic is making you but yeah I would highly recommend looking at this and trying it my consensus on this as it makes me feel hazed it makes me feel groggy if I take too much or if I take it with something else I took this with another CBD product so they're kind of making me feel more groggy than normal but this would make me feel hast not groggy not tired hazed and what I mean by that is a relaxed pace and it's because of the THC like I said but it makes me feel extremely calm extremely clear-headed extremely clear minded and I don't feel like and I feel like I'm in control of my emotions more so and I feel like I'm in control of my daily tasks and things that I can get done during the day another thing about this is it's rated I think I already said that this one is rated at 4.7 out of 5 stars so I also have really good sleeps at night from this I have 8 to 9 hours of sleep per night and I was starting to before I took this I was starting to not get any sleep at night I would take this and I would weirdly or not take this sorry I would take this and not weirdly stay up I would weirdly fall asleep right off the bat as soon as I just like thought about bed and I put my head to the pillow I would just get sleep people with insomnia I should really try this and people with insomnia 25 milligrams is probably not gonna put you to sleep I think 50 milligrams is gonna put you to sleep so literally two servings of this also you have to shake well before you use it and it has directions for that but so yeah insomnia anxiety depression because I had probably problems sleeping I'm not saying or diagnosing this to insomnia patients I'm saying that I had trouble sleeping so this helped me now this is something that I never really talked about but I have digestive issues everyone really has digestive issues at some point in their life but I haven't tried digestive issues that kind of make and manifest my anxiety and depression on a daily level and especially when I eat something that is not good for me so I take CBD to also supplement that it doesn't cover it up like a lot of people say it does like cover up symptom or it covers up symptoms but like in a good way and it's also a natural pain reliever it's not temporary the pain relief is supposed to be there or that the pain is it there anymore when you take this and you're not supposed to just take this to supplement to make yourself feel better you can take this while being healthy because it restores your gut bacteria backed back to its natural flora I'm sorry I'm slurring my words anyway so that's what I take this is what I take for digestive issues because I have IBS borderline Crohn's disease so I take this and this makes me feel ten times better so it doesn't recommend nobody recommends you driving on this I can drive I can drive on this very well I'm actually way more focused than any other time but nobody recommends that you drive on it and that's because of the THC content but also because for some people it makes you drowsy and that's with the CBD and the THC so you can also walk take full walks and exercise very good very well with this I walk every day and this just amplifies it amplifying meaning making it a lot better to walk and a lot better to run or jog or exercise it makes you feel a lot better it doesn't make you dizzy it doesn't give you any weird side effects when you exercise now that that's just for me it doesn't give me any weird I'm saying you because I would think that it doesn't really happen to anyone else but I can't say that as a fact because I only know my body now I also want to tell you that you don't get high off of this that's the one thing that you want to take away you don't get high off of it so you're not gonna get a legal high off of this I get a legal buzz because I'm very sensitive to any form of THC any it doesn't matter how much is in the oil I still get a little bit affected that's not to say that you will but this is still not a high product so anyway if you are not feeling too well if you're not feeling the best right now if you're not if you're feeling more anxious and depressed as opposed to normal as opposed to have how you normally feel I would greatly suggest looking this up don't go off of my word go look it up for yourself online and do some research before you try to try this but I tried it it works for me it makes me feel very good I don't know if I come across high in this video but I'm buzzed to say the least it's just a buzz it's not like it's not like I'm higher placed so it feels it I feel it most oh my god I can't talk I feel it most in my head like right here and it feels good to me it makes me feel comforted and calm and just down-to-earth and relaxed for anyone else if you don't like that head feeling I would recommend getting something again without THC but anyways try to take care of yourself during the pandemic try to take care of yourself during a protest also black lives do matter just so you know they really do and hopefully you will take away that with the message of CBD oil being your relief from any anxiety that you're feeling from any emotions that you can't control from anything that is going on in the real world right now a lot of people have it way worse and they matter so I just wanted to end on a good note I really hope that you guys try this out and you can put in the comments if you did like I said I'll have a link to the website and to this specific tincture in the description below and I hope that you all have a beautiful day night evening wherever you are in the world bye", "4ixxyByF2zE": "hi hi hi today's video is a little different little different best CBD oils my favorite so far of 2020 if you're new to this channel what I do is I buy CD products for full price I send them to a lab to see if they're real well as of 2020 this year I send every product to two labs for blind testing why blind test products can you be so obtuse did you call me obtuse CBD products why can't we just trust blindly trust CBD companies and allow them to send whatever they went to a lab that they pay a lot of money to throw out any bad results and only post the good ones and then sell you crap I tested over 80 products over the course of a year without any sponsorship or affiliation but full disclosure this month for the first time I have added affiliate links to CBD examine calm to help pay for the products and lab tests product in lab tests are super super expensive and that's how we're gonna continue to pay for these lab tests well that's where I see things just a little differently contractor no I will not bow to any sponsor I did feel dirty adding the affiliate links to CBD examine calm though almost all review websites work with affiliate links or sponsorships of some sort but it felt dirty right it's like people only do things because they get paid and that's just really sad nothing will change on my website all new products will be purchased for retail price the CBD companies can't send me anything I need to buy them sent to two different labs for blind testing and the official reports of course will be available on each review the process all documented for your eyeballs and I will still be the same jerk that gives critical reviews but this following list was picked last week when I was still innocent pure and poor so after 80 product reviews here are eight of my favorite and these will probably change because I just sent fifty more products to a lab so hit that subscribe button to see more soon I'm gonna go over these super quick and you can just hit the link below to see all the full reviews the official lab tests or watch the YouTube videos on each one number eight oh Jesus look at that beautiful face okay this one needs an update someone lost their job back when Sun soil was called Green Mountain because they didn't know that full-spectrum products contain THC drug test look for THC when I did my review last year I thought that their their lab results could be a little more clear but they fix that issue since their lab results are now very clear I still think CBD companies should do a little more to warn people about THC and drug tests but that's a whole nother problem because if they put the appropriate warning on them certain government employees will flag them in mistake totally legal hemp for marijuana because the government the government in this tone is excellent and uses your tax dollars efficiently anyway back to us on soil here it's super cheap 30 bucks 600 milligrams of CBD our lab test found it was incredibly accurate on CBD trace levels of THC and lots of other cannabinoids the taste was not bad it's good for all the cannabinoids and the mint chocolate taste helps the natural flavor out a bit but it is a natural taste and it is a good full spectrum so that tastes a little like hemp EMP chocolate so if you don't like the taste of hemp move along just choose a different one if you want the cheapest full-spectrum USDA Organic CBD I think you found it five cents per milligram of CBD is incredibly cheap at only $30 numero seven cheap and trusted and that's not just a CBD company I tested Garden of life's 10 milligram in 20 milligram formulas that's two labs for lab tests dive in links below the $50 30 milligram formula that's 900 milligrams total came in at 5 cents flat cheap he's also taste excellent it's peppermint and orange zest it's really good both are labeled as broad-spectrum so it should have CBD other cannabinoids but no THC nope our labs found that they're basically just a CBD oil which is typical of broad spectrums nothing else most broad spectrum suck I like this as a pure CBD but really if you want other cannabinoids just go with a full spectrum instead of a broad spectrum this one has some essential oils added peppermint frankincense I guess you might be able to say entourage effect I give it to them because almost every broad-spectrum extract I've tasted is pure CBD and other cannabinoids are usually so low that they don't matter in these broad spectrums it's still a great deal for pure CBD and you're getting garden of life they've been around for 20 years and they're a great company I do like that their CBD is formulated by dr. Perlmutter you know grain brain I know it's probably BS he probably just tasted it and was like taste good and they were like okay good because we're gonna say you formulated it on the package and pay you a bunch of money you think that dude is in a lab formulating products probably on some yacht drinking herbal tea or something weird I would think brain maker that was a good book too okay on to number six most trusted brand bar liens our lab tests found this 1125 milligram bottle a full spectrum 70 bucks is a good full spectrum extract you've got CBD THC and good amounts of other cannabinoids like CBC and CBG by the way you guys I know uh people claim a certain CBD oil will be good for specific conditions we don't have enough research to suggest that these cannabinoids change everything I post the cannabinoid profile on every review you might like a lot of THC someone else may have negative effects from tea see you might find that cbc helps you someone else might just like pure CBD you really just got to try a few look at the cannabinoids when you find one you like they affect everyone differently under six cents per milligram great price I really like bar leans they've been around for thirty years and you really can't find anything bad about them well except I did find one thing bad the Center for Food Safety gave them a bad score for CBD testing which was complete [ __ ] that was my December 2019 update and my June 2020 update showed that the Center for Food Safety changed their score to an a stupid government I can say that now that I don't work for the government they were rating CBD companies on testing and transparency without testing anything I know I know and that's why you're here watching a completely insane person sense CBD to labs in California instead of putting your faith in the government yeah I was a government employee but don't don't hold that against me number five most loved CBD company this one is hard to argue with if I wasn't so cheap they would probably be my number one of everything they made the famous strange Charlotte's Web named after Charlotte Figi dr. Sanjay Gupta I don't think I said that right dr. Sanjay Gupta dr. Sanjay had a documentary that featured Charlotte and CBD and that really started the whole CBD movement you can trust dr. Sanjay because cannabis radar ranked him the number one CBD influencer of all time who's that clean-shaven baby face right there that's number two influencer in the world Charlotte's Web played a huge part and the legalization of hemp and I don't know if hemp would be legal today if it wasn't for this company probably not just don't say anything bad about them on the internet their followers really are passionate about them and will email you here's the here's the bad thing I said I really didn't like that the front of their bottle used to say hemp extract that's a [ __ ] term people confuse it with CBD it's not but I always gave him a little bit of slack because they were one of the first maybe the first to navigate the CBD world when you couldn't say CBD for legal reasons on the bottle they started this made CBD products before sea but he was legal then they helped make CBD illegal gangsters only halfway joking about the gangster part what they did was incredible and pretty pretty gangster now their labels are all updated and specific which I like because that's what I look for at CBD examine calm honest labeling our lab testing found that they make a good full spectrum extract even really need me to tell you that they're famous for that they have research on their company the only complaint I have is that they are on the expensive side their $30 bottle that's a new price is about 13 cents per milligram of CBD 15 cents is average but average to me is expensive I'm cheap you know that but if you're willing to buy their more potent formulas you can get a great deal they're 60 milligrams formula goes down to four point six cents per milligram of CBD if you're willing to shell out 275 bucks yeah so I would say go big or don't go at all but you really can't put a price on a specific strain grown by one company that's helped more people than any other CBD company and by more people I mean that they are the largest CBD company with by far the most reviews quantity a positive reviews number for re botanicals this is the first brand to receive a USDA Organic cert it's small but the founder was also the founder of Nu Teva the giant hemp super food brand that people seem to really like our lab tests found that re botanicals makes a well rounded full spectrum extract their new prices are between seven cents and nine cents per milligram of CBD average is 15 cents so good well great value for organic B first USDA Organic I use their role on peppermint CBD oil a lot this one smells so damn good I'm cheap but that smell gets me every time I like it put it on your temples relax a little bit number three best pure CBD med Tara matera is one of the first CBD companies to win a mainstream retail contract you can find them in CVS yeah there's a yeah there's a theme here I like well-respected companies that have pushed the CBD movement forward mainstream in this case by the way they reduce the price of thirty five bucks it seems like all CBD companies are getting cheaper right now I need to update those prices I bought before because they're dropping especially in the last few months in light of a certain shutdown of the economy not sure how that makes CBD cheaper but it has met Tara is nice for people that don't want th see our lab tests found that this is just clean CBD oil nothing else not even CBD V just CBD and they don't make any THC products so this is good for anyone who can't have THC in their system and doesn't want the chance of the product that the product might get mixed up with a THC product or somebody might look at them differently for having a CBD product with THC this doesn't have it this is the one that I recommend to my firefighter friends that can't have THC or shouldn't if I was still a government employee this is what I would pick up and if you have a soul-sucking job where you also get tested for THC met Tara's great I have a full video on CBD and drug testing there's a caveat a bad test is still in use today but for the most part pure CB means that you'll have no problem with drug test that tests for THC their new price brings this down to six cents per milligram of CBD excellent I've tested some that are over thirty cents six cents is great pure CBD has no taste so this has no flavor no weird hemp flavor I like med Terra but if you do want THC look out for Lazarus number two cheapest CBD on earth Lazarus Naturals now in the Bible I didn't read it but I do have Wikipedia Lazarus died and Jesus brought him back to life so when I was deathly ill from a hangover I thought maybe using Lazarus I could come back to life I'm not gonna make medical claims or suggestions for hangovers but miraculously I did come back to life this also happens to be one of the most potent extracts that we've tested for THC so it could have been that by the way always look at the THC levels of the CBD you're getting two milligrams is a lot you will feel that and I cannot confirm that it will bring you back from the dead like it did for me but you may feel it a bit there full-spectrum CBD is so damn cheap I can't believe it when I tested it it was at four cents per milligram of CBD for their $32 bottle and they just updated their prices this month and it's now three cents they're stronger formula is at two cents per milligram it's so cheap it was already the cheapest now it's it's that they beat their own record it's the cheapest cheapest cheapest but please let me know if you found anything cheaper than this because I'd like to test that one out to our testing found that they were extremely accurate and it was one of the most potent full spectrums that we've tested with a lot of CBC and CPG as well now the only downside is that the flavor is also potent it's super earthy but just looking at the candle levels I would expect that they use a natural ethanol extraction process some people don't like that because it does keep the natural flavors ethanol alcohol goes away completely during the evaporation stage but you're also left with one of the most potent extracts possible of kin monoids so if you don't like the natural flavor of hemp this won't be for you but it is such a good deal they make pure sativa tea products as well and I'm testing a bunch of their new products so stay tuned for that number one best CBD company Bluebird botanicals I've been a fan of Bluebird for a long time I wrote about them in my book hemp for migraine best book ever by the way and I'm a very modest person and I wrote about them on CBD examined for a long time where I test products for transparency and accuracy this company pioneered transparency today most companies provide lab tests online a lot of companies provide inaccurate lab reports but that's beside the point Bluebird was one of the first to may be the first to show real lab tests for everything I've tested for of their products now a couple of multiple times I've got more tests on the way also and their lab results have been excellent my only complaint is that they don't make any flavored products no gummies and instead of lowering prices in this time desperation the prices actually went up by a couple dollars still cheap still great still the best company but I might need to rethink this number one spot because everyone else is lowering their prices and I'm super cheap Lazarus load their prices last week Bluebird I'd like to tell everyone you did to in an update next week it's not like my opinion matters it's not like people pay attention to the top video review on Google right now out of 3810 Bluebird review results there are full-spectrum extracts are well rounded and potent I've always compared them to Charlotte's Web but cheaper still cheaper so I can't really complain about the price that prices have always been great and everything about the CBD company is positive too many good things to list and I really like that they give massive discounts to disabled low-income and vets Lazarus does that too if I didn't mention that before bluebirds founder is also the vice-president of the u.s. hemp roundtable which led the political fight for hemp legalization this is just a solid company that has built a reputation over years pioneered CBD transparency and pushed for legalization they really are in a league of their own so there you have it my favorite CBD companies and this list is bound to change because I've already sent 50 more products to the lab subscribe so you don't miss out and I will see you next time", "1iuA5wDv3Jo": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be showing you how to make a CVD teacher [Music] so what exactly is a tincture and how is it different from other CBD edibles well a tincture is a medicine made by dissolving a drug into alcohol in this case we're dissolving the CBD on the hemp buds into the alcohol because of this CBD tincture is sort of the same thing as a CBD infused alcohol although with a tincture we're trying to maximize the amount of CBD then each drop to be used in small doses as opposed to a seaweed infused aloe Hall where each serving is most likely more than a few drops and by using the drops under the tongue the arterial blood supply under your tongue will rapidly absorb the CBD allowing it to take effect much faster than with any edible so first things first we're going to be using a lot of medicinal hemp because we need a pack a lot of CBD into each drop so half an ounce to a full ounce of medicinal hemp is needed second we're more interested in extracting as much as CBD off the hemp buds as possible then we are the taste of the alcohol so we're using the highest percentage of alcohol we can find from a distilled beverage in my case I'm going with a 750 milliliter bottle of Bacardi 151 which has a seventy five point five percent alcohol content and for those thinking why not just use rubbing alcohol event don't do this we're still going to be consuming this and most rubbing alcohol are made with isopropyl alcohol which metabolites is different from consumable alcohol and is very harmful if ingested now we need to decarboxylate the hemp and to do so Wolford grind it up onto a baking sheet decarboxylate in the hem will convert the CBB a in the hemp to CBB and is done so by heating up the hemp buds so after grinding it all up to help it heat evenly we'll place this in the oven which has been preheated to 250 degrees and we'll let it bake for 30 minutes after it's done grounded buds will have a darker baked colour and you'll want let it sit a little to have it cool down before handling it after its cooled will place the decarboxylated hemp in a jar and then pour into alcohol from here if you have the time to spare you can just cover it up and place it somewhere dark for a couple of days to have the CBD infused with the alcohol slowly over time just be sure to give it a good shake once a day if you're going with this method if you're short on time though there's actually another method available they'll infuse the tincture much quicker and that's to give the glass jar a water bath he will expedite the infusion process down to just 20 minutes except instead of beating a jar in boiling water you'll need a lower the heat until the water is down to a low simmer this is because unlike water which has a boiling point of 212 degrees Fahrenheit alcohol has a lower boiling point of just 173 degrees Fahrenheit which means that the most we should heat up the teacher is a hundred and seventy degrees to prevent any of the alcohol from burning off as you can see from the thermometer this is what a low simmer of a hundred and seventy degrees looks like but even if you don't have a cooking thermometer and actually burn off a little alcohol since we're not drinking this for the alcohol content it shouldn't matter much just know that by doing so it'll make the teacher slightly more concentrated which will have a stronger effect you'll need a place something on the bottom of the pot so the jar doesn't have to write contact with the burner make sure the water in cases the alcohol but isn't so high that will accidentally pour into the jar and be sure to take the lid off the jar I also only recommend this if you have an electric burner I don't recommend using this method with a gas stove as it's too risky to play something with this high of an alcohol content near fire alternatively if you have a sous-vide cooker in your kitchen this is much better to use to ensure that the water stays at exactly 170 degrees with a sous-vide cooker all you have to do is clip it to a side of a pot fill it with water and then set the water temperature to 170 degrees before placing the jar in note that water is denser than alcohol so you need to play something on top of the jar to make sure that it doesn't flow I don't recommend using what I'm using but it's why I had nearby so I made it work either way you want to heat the tincture uncovered for 20 minutes after that we can take it out and just leave it out to cool until it's warm to the touch now for both the long method and the quick heating method the final step is to filter out all the plant material from the tincture and here you can either use a cheesecloth or a coffee filter just place out on a funnel and pour it all through making sure to squeeze out any alcohol left on the plant material so nothing goes to waste depending on how you plan on using the tincture you either want to put it in a dropper for easy consumption or in my case a jar to store for future use as a tincture is really useful for a number of recipes just be sure to store this in a dark place if available definitely use a tinted glass jar to further protect the tincture from light and that's it", "ydZRyIeEvaM": "Hey it's Dustin in this video i'm going\nto be doing a cbd review on this PureKana 300 milligram mint cbd\ntincture so stick with me. Alright when it comes to cbd oil\nthere's three criteria that i want to judge it by and review it by and those\nare quality taste and price so obviously if we're\nreviewing a topical there's not going to be any taste so\nwe'll skip over that one so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to tell\nyou about the quality of this product and uh and i'm just going to give you a\nbrief overview we're going to talk about taste and price after that and then\nafter that we're going to go over the computer and i'm going to give you a lot\nmore nitpicky when it comes to quality we're going to look at the coa\nwe're gonna look at uh everything that's in it when it comes\nto the different cannabinoids and i'll let you know if this is a quality cbd\noil more in depth at the end so be sure to\nstick to the end brief overview of quality this is a quality product if\nyou're just like hey has a quality product or isn't it\nyes it is and the reason i say that is because um i've looked they sourced\ntheir hemp from kentucky decent place to do it i think uh oregon\nand central oregon specifically it's better to do that because we're on\nthe 45th parallel and so the light cycle is much more natural to grow hemp\nanyway that's a different story it's a little bit longer story if you're\nlooking for the best hemp i'm going to argue it comes from central\noregon they do it in kentucky and that's just fine they if you look at\nthe color of this product you'll notice that it's almost\nclear it's almost see-through it's a little bit golden\nin color and so that tells me that they're not using crude oil they're\nusing distillate so when you extract hemp the oil out of\nhemp it's going to first of all be a dark almost black very gummy crude oil\nand i i believe since this is so light in color they're not using\ncrude oil they're taking it to the next level through distillation\nso it's a lot more refined and so as a result\nthis product is not going to taste very heavy so i'm going to taste real quick\nand it has a good taste this is mint flavor\nand really it's got a refreshing taste you put put it in there you're not\ntasting very much hemp and you're tasting a mint\nflavor and so as far as taste goes it tastes really great\nin fact our product at green method farms we also have a mint product and\nthese basically taste identical let's go into price real quick\nuh we i have it pulled up right here on my computer this 300 milligram bottle\nwhich i bought you can get for 54. if you want to\nupgrade to the thousand milligram bottle which\nis kind of where people usually are at it's going to cost you 139\nand green method farms our product we offer a thousand milligram\nfor 45 on our website greenmethodfarms.com you can check the\nlink below if you want to look more into that\nanyway so these two products here if you got a thousand milligram purcha or the\nthousand milligram green method farms very similar uh in quality\nand very similar in taste this one's going to cost you 139 bucks this one is\ngoing to cost you 45 bucks so way cheaper and so anyway that's kind of\nthe review when it comes to quality taste in price now let's go to\nthe computer and i'll show you a little bit more in depth\nwhen it comes to quality and i'll be able to show you a little bit more\nuh the nitpicky when it comes to cannabinoids because here's something\nthat you need to understand um when it comes to the cannabinoids\nwhen it comes to cbd oils cbd is great right we know that it helps\nwith inflammation and with many other things but one of\nthe ways that the hemp plant and cbd oil that's extracted from\nthe ham plant works the best is through something called the\nentourage effect that means when your oil contains the minor cannabinoids so\nof course it has the major cannabinoid which is\ncbd when it has other minor cannabinoids in there like\ncbn uh cbc cbg those are the those are the big ones but\nthere's also other ones in there when it when your oil contains those as well it\nall works together better than if it was just a cbd product\ncoming from a cbd isolate or something like that where there's nothing else in\nit but cbd so if you have the choice\nbetween a cbd isolate product which has nothing but cbd in it or a cbd product\nthat also has the minor cannabinoids in it you're going to want the miter\ncannabinoids so let's go to the computer and we'll take a look at the coa the\ncertificate of analysis and we'll dissect that and we'll\nactually do a side by side comparison to green method farms versus\npure canna because this is kind of the benchmark because i'm the one doing the\nvideos and i'm the one that grew the hemp and i'm the one that extracted the\nham from the one that created this product\nso i will do a side by side i'm doing comparisons and i'm gonna be i'm gonna\nbe completely honest about it there are some cbds out there cbd\nproducts that are absolute crap they're scam\ndon't buy them uh purecam is not one of those this is a good product\nit's an expensive product but it's a good product so let's go to the computer\ni'll show you what i'm talking about okay so here we are on purecanna's\nwebsite and this is the page for their 1 000 milligram uh\ncbd tincture as you can see it's 139 dollars\ni'm gonna go over to our website real quick and i'm going to show you that the\n100 000 milligram full spectrum cbd oil tincture basically\nthe same thing 45 so let's go over to um their coa we'll talk a little bit\nmore about quality so this is the pure canna coa on their\nthousand milligram uh cbd tincture and you're gonna be able\nto notice here they have 30 39.4 so um\nyeah 39 milligrams per gram of cbd so you can see here on the graph\nthat's mostly what this bottle contains there is\na little bit .06 milligrams per gram of cbc\nso that's a minor cannabinoid there's point three\non well actually this is part of cbd product so never mind on that\num and then uh cbl point zero eight cbn point zero\neight milligrams per gram so very small amounts\nand then uh thc point seven milligrams per gram so a little bit more\non the thc side i wanted to point out that when it\ncomes to cvg it doesn't even register so there's no\ncbg in this let's go real quick to green method farms and\nwe'll do a side-by-side comparison okay so here's the certificate of\nanalysis for green method farms 1000 milligram cbd tincture again this is 45\ndollars if you want to order it at greenmethodfarms.com\num and we'll just look at the graph here because this points out the major and\nminor cannabinoids so we'll go to the big one first\ncbd it's got nearly 31 milligrams per gram\nso of course that's going to be the highest cannabinoid in the cbd oil but\nlet's look at the minor cannabinoids as well\nif you look at the delta 9 thc it is 1.2 milligrams per gram which is going to be\nhigher but if you look at the percentage it is\n0.12 so the legal limit of thc\nin the united states is 0.3 of a percent so we are\nwell we're almost one-third of uh below the legal limit so um\nit's basically a tenth of a percent of thc in this but thc is actually good\nfor you so i mean it's not a bad thing i'm just letting you know that it's\nbelow the legal limit but there is some thc\nin it and there is some thc in the uh purecanna\nversion as well it says full spectrum oil so going\ndown to let's see here um cbg we have a point two\nmilligrams per gram so um cbg at pure canada didn't even register so you're\ngetting more cbg in this and then um that's cbga just regular cbg\nis going to be one uh milligram per gram so\nway more uh cbg than the pure canna and then cbc\nis also a 1.1 milligram per gram so anyway the minor cannabinoids are\nhigher they're more concentrated in the green method farm so again my\nopinion this is going to go this is going to be because of the\nquality of the genetics the farming and the extraction uh process so let me\ntell you real quick what i mean by that so\npurecanna is sourced by farms in kentucky kentucky is on the 36th\nparallel and that's significant because the closer the 45th parallel\nthe better um in on our farm in central oregon we actually are on the\n45th parallel the reason this makes a difference is because of the light\ncycle the summer solstice around june 20th it's an 18\nhour to six hour light to darkness ratio and so when the days become shorter the\nplant the hemp plant decides hey the day's getting shorter it's time\nfor me to start flowering and that's when they produce the most oil so\nin central oregon you're getting a really dry climate which is great\nbecause you can rake it's got you know lots of sun the light cycle is great you\ncan regulate as much water and nutrients as you want\nthrough the drip line and so that's the reason i'm a little bit biased but i\nreally do believe that central oregon is a superior place\nto grow hemp compared to other places like kentucky\nbecause of the dryness of the climate and it being on the 45th parallel\nthe other thing that i want to mention is that uh\npurecanna uses a co2 extraction method where green method farms uses an ethanol\nextraction method now you probably don't know chances are\nyou probably don't know a ton about extraction this might not\nmake a big difference to you in our experience\nco2 extraction produces a real gummy and not as high quality of a crude oil\nand as a result it takes more through distillation to be able to have\na good product and i think that that might be either the genetics or it's the\ndistillation is the reason that the pure canna\nproduct has less of the minor cannabinoids\nin green method farms we use an ethanol extraction\nand in our experience ethanol extraction is a lot more clean of an extraction\nwe take our uh extraction to crude oil and then we water wash it which removes\na lot of the impurities such as fats and lipids and sugars and those kind of\nthings so that you're actually left with a pretty good\nclean crude oil and since that crude oil is clean to begin with when we take it\nthrough distillation it's just an easier process and i think\nthat you're left with more minor cannabinoids as a result so that\nis in my opinion starting with better genetics but also\nending with a more pure uh product cbd product that goes through\nthe distillation process they don't have to refine and pull out as much of the\nstep the cannabinoids like cbc\ncbn cbg as they do with pure canada so anyway both\nproducts i'm going to say are great um you're not going to have any problems\nwith the pure canada product i'm just saying and i'm a little bit biased\nbecause i'm the one doing it but i have spent\nthe entire process from farming through extraction to bottling\nand formulation so maybe you're wondering why are we selling our product\nfor way less when we could be selling it you\nknow if it's the same product as pure canada we could be selling it for 140\nwe've got two reasons for that one because we can we're a small family farm\nwe have 10 acres and uh and so we extract enough oil to\nbe able to produce enough oil to extract at our extraction\nfacility which i work for so we get a deal on that so\nbasically our overhead is just it's just not\nvery high we could charge 140 bucks for this product\num but we've decided that we don't need to\nand because we really believe in the medicine we want to be able to get that\nout there as to as many people as possible and not you know have to\ncharge the 140 so anyway if uh if you're interested in\nbuying cbd oil cp oil tincture i'm definitely going to say buy it from\nus because you're going to get a great product for a fraction of the\nprice if you want to spend 140 bucks this is a\ngreat product go ahead and do it pure canada\ni highly recommend them i mean this is a great product it's just expensive\nso if you want to get the same thing maybe even a little bit better of a\nproduct because of the extraction methods\nbecause of the genetics that we started with green method farms is the way to go\ngo ahead and click the link below to purchase uh 45\nfor a thousand milligram cbd tincture and charge 75 for the 2000 milligram\ntincture so still you're getting double the cbd and it's still significantly\nless than the thousand milligram here so\neither one that you want it's gonna be a high quality product we\nstand by it there's a 30 day money back guarantee if you're not satisfied with\nit and so if you have any questions about\nanything concerning cbd oil how

and how they're doing and just was trained uh I've had a hard time figuring out since I've had all these issues because at this point I've only been giving these ladies the dr. earth dry amendments and I used the Fox farm ocean forest soil so I gave a 75% of the veg 25% mix of the bloom at 30 days old from sprouting well it's coming up on another 30 days and I don't know whether I should be giving them like a 75% 25% opposite 75 percent bloom 25% veg mix because I don't want this to not produce I mean it's Earth it needs these nutrients to grow buds big and good I mean I know it's not gonna be the full potential what they could have been from the peach issues but like obviously this is the plant that was the worst you can see barely any little bugs whereas this one's stacking up nice but I also I bought some of the sweet magic micro razor plus microbes just because it's a PE tissue if you're gonna buddy killed a lot of them and I also bought this just because at the time I didn't know it was going on with the pH issue and I didn't know whether the dr. earth was the problem because at the time I really couldn't find much information on it so I don't know whether I should give it a 75% bloom 25% veg top dress within the next couple of days or I mean should I just skip the organic and feed them this because I don't want them to die and not grow because I'm not giving them any fertilizer but I know I just don't know how long it's going to take like once you start flowering like this how long it's gonna take before at the harvest like am I gonna have a thirty days so this stuff will get you know it used up or should I just go with this stuff and you know feed it every watering and however it says every other watering and that way I don't have nutrients that are you know a long lasting like this and them so if anybody has any opinions on what I should do I appreciate it very much because it makes me sad to see little baby nodes and that doing anything cuz I'm ninety percent doing this for my wife that's disabled and you know it's hard to find good quality cannabis or it's expensive so I figured I don't maybe I could just grow it for her and help her out with all her pain issues and stuff I don't know just trying to get somebody's opinion that knows a lot more than I do and I'm figuring this plant might be weird so so I know if it doesn't start putting on some flowers but if they may as their opinion on what I should do should I top dress it with some of this with the blue mix or should I just switch over a third give me this stuff I did give it I watered it with a little cal-mag and some of this the other day just to help build up the micro-sim the soil because I'm sure my pH issue frag killed a lot of them I hope everybody's having a good day and you know I hope everybody's gardens were just banging you living that learn hopefully my next round I got both my pH pin so I'll be able to keep my pH goods I'm thinking I should I start my receipt so I have two more seeds on the stand romantic from fast foods thinking I might want to start those pretty soon just so we can get it to jumpstart and that the wheat by harvest is don't have to wait even longer but thanks for everybody for stopping by subscribe I'll be posting videos often on my plants and the garden and while they're doing them issues and I appreciate

"8edqxvy5_4Y": "hey guys myth of a plop here got a review for you these products called just chill they are CBD products they have gummies oil these vape pen cartridges and I think that's it numbers are sure though alright I got the bait pens cartridges and some gummies here to try now these gummies are super cute you get four gummies in a pack they are 10 milligram CBD and it looks like the colors do vary by TAC but that's okay they usually all taste the same price point on these it's 1250 for a single pack or you can pay 125 125 for a 10 pack or 250 for a 20 pack and the directions on these are take one to two gummies every 6 to 12 hours as desired I haven't yet tried these so I'm gonna go ahead and try one they smell pretty fruity where you get little hints of this DVD he's pretty good they don't taste like to earthy or anything it really tastes kind of like an edible like gummy bear like taste very very similar to that pretty chewy but it has very good flavor it's a tropical fruit all right let's go over the vape pen because I was most excited for this I've been using it like as you can see it's not all the way full anymore I've been using this one cartridge for about a week now because I wanted to see what the effects were gonna be before I do this video for you guys so what you get they have this is the battery pack and it comes with the charger you can order through them if you don't already have a pen like this and the price for this is let me see here 1994 or you can get the combo this plus one of the cartridges for 4994 so you can get both of these for that if you're just wanting it just the cartridge you already have a pen or you just want a refill cartridge these go for thirty nine ninety four so I have two different flavors this one right here that I've been vaping on is a tropical and I'm gonna show you guys just screws right in there little 510 connection now you don't get a ton of clouds like you do with most of eight products this is uh you know very tight draw almost like a little stick a light beginner state pen and you want to do like one to two hits you know very easy don't make huge clouds and all that and then do another one to two hits until you get your desired effect and that's about as much vapor as I've been getting all right that is a very good tropical I've actually had lots of CBD juice as I've reviewed well not Lots but I've had at least three or four different companies and I reviewed and the flavours are usually pretty earthy like you can taste the juice like the CBD in the juice these ones are probably one of the better tasting ones I've had they taste more like an actual vape juice and less like the CBD I'm not sure what the milligram of CBD is on this I didn't see it on the package I'm not really sure I find that out I'll leave it down below for you guys but in the pack I want to show you how it is when you open this up it's the one mill so open this up I haven't tried this one this is strawberry and you have an empty cartridge just like this and then you have a little bottle of juice this is a 1 mil bundle of the CBD juice and go ahead and take this out of the pack all right this is a little protection cap for your little 510 connector so nothing gets inside there and affects you know the connection to the actual battery so I mean if you want to keep these in case you throw them in your purse for refills or some like that that'd be a really good idea um I don't really plan on traveling with mine so not a big deal if I throw mine away but you plan on traveling with them throw them in your purse in your car I would suggest keeping this and keep it clean this is the mouthpiece just pops right off and there's a little rubber Reed nipple thing pull that out and you have a tiny hole there now it does say to shake well before use even you know once you've been vaping on this thing for a while so make sure if you're using this you know you let it sit for a couple hours shake it up really good because it settles pop the cap off there how many where's there it is okay and it's a very very tiny little needlepoint thing fill it up right down the middle here so that fills right up now I like to get all the products out that I can so what I did with the first one because as you see it's just like you know ketchup battle like you want to turn it upside down and let it sit for a while so you get more of it to come out so I literally left oh you squirted me in the face I'll early left mine sitting on my counter like this for about an hour to and just sold more of the product would settle down there so I can put more inside the tank and get more use out of it once it's filled up just replace the little plug in there just like so looks like and then the cap goes right back on snap fit now it's kind of hard to see but there is a wick in here it's very hard to see it's a white wick now I'm not sure how many times you can refill these and reuse it before your wick burns out because I haven't tried refilling this anything else but I'd assume that you could refill these again and just by this part not a hundred percent sure on that but like I said I mean the price on this you get the whole combo for the forty nine ninety four or just your bottom battery pack with the charger for the 1994 or you get your refill cartridges for 39.9 four so I mean it's really not a bad deal I've actually been using this quite a lot I'd say well I mean usually found a week now and I'm done at least priced seven to ten hits a day for a week and I'm just now down that far so it's lasting quite a while let's go and try out this strawberry flavor I actually prefer the strawberry flavor over the tropical when I had this it tastes just like strawberry it's a lot it's even more less earthy than the other one really good flavor these both had really great flavor as you can see it when they are filled up they do go all the way to the very top there so but I'd say for a week juice I mean that's lasting quite a while I'd say I will leave the links to their Instagram page down below and where you can order from they're a really nice company him if you have any questions I have tried quite a few CBD products as you guys know and I'd say by far this one is probably my favorite and I get the best effects with it you know CVD is good for a lot of things it's good for headache relief anxiety nausea depression it's great for a lot of stuff and it tastes good it's natural why not try it you know I'd rather vape CBD then take a bunch over-the-counter medications or prescription medications it's just my view on it I really enjoy it if you guys have any questions let me know down below hope you enjoyed the video have a good night bye", "zrfvPsURR60": "[Music]

stress depression epilepsy pain\nand a lot of other things I have tried a lot of supplements to treat my own\nanxiety but found nothing as effective as CBD oil CBD can be taken in different\nways the most common ones are vaping eating and sublingual which means under\nyour tongue each way of usage has its own pros and cons so find out which one\nyou like the most yourself me myself I prefer to use its sibling well since\nit's one of the most purest quickest easiest cheapest and effective ways\nthere are two different types of CBD these are called isolated and\nfull-spectrum the CBD plant contains around 100 cannabinoids isolated means\nit contains only one of them pure CBD with no other components full spectrum\nmeans it contains all of the cannabinoids my advice is to go for a\nfull spectrum full spectrum provides a lot more and way stronger health\nbenefits than just isolated because all the components work together like a\nfootball team creating something like a superpower called the entourage effect\nout of the many cannabinoids the two most famous ones are CBD and THC full\nspectrum also contains a very little bit of THC but you cannot get high from it\nthe amount of THC is less than 0.1% which is way too low to get you high and\nthere is way more CBD in it which works against the effect of getting high so\ndon't be afraid full spectrum will not make you high another very nice thing is\nthat you can't build tolerance to CBD oil\nfor things like THC you can build tolerance but not for CBD because it\ndoesn't bind to your receptors studies even suggest that CBD has the opposite\neffect a reversed tolerance this basically means that you need less from\nit over time instead of more so it works better when it's build up in your system\nalso you cannot overdose on CBD oil it is 100% safe and has no big side effects\nso there is no need to stop using it after a period of time you can keep\nusing it the right dosage is different for everyone and also depends on what\nyou're using it for so it's very hard to give a specific dosage for some things a\nlow dosage works better and for other things a higher dosage works better for\nexample for treating anxiety a low to medium dose will work better than a dose\nthat is too high but for epilepsy a higher dosage is required so it's the\nbest to find a common dosage for your condition and try out for yourself by\nstarting low and upping the dosage till the desired effect is reached for\nanxiety when using the tincture for sublingual use I suggest to start with\naround 7 drops of oil containing 5% CBD when you don't feel any difference you\ncan add a few drops till you found the desired amount for how long the effect\nlasts also differs from person to person and depends on the way of using but when\nusing it sublingual the average time the effect lasts is 4 to 6 hours when using\nsublingually make sure to keep the oil under your\ntongue for at least 2 minutes and after that swirl it around in your mouth\nbefore swallowing this is because you absorb very little when swallowing it\ndirectly it really has to be absorbed under your tongue so it goes directly\ninto the bloodstream there are a lot of good CBD brands but also a lot that are\nbad find out the best rate at CBD brands in\nyour country by looking at reviews these were the basics you need to know about\nCBD if you got any

appearance wise hemp oil is of nutty flavor and has a clear light green color whereas CBD oil is of earthy flavor and has a golden color industrially hemp oil is extracted from cold-pressed seeds of the plant but on the other hand CBD oil is made from Leafs flowers and stalks of the hemp where canopy oil is found although both of them are derived from a common plant they have different properties

"Y87yxZsDQTs": "hello everybody and welcome back your burger canvas and this week's video I'm gonna teach you how we make CBD oil here on the farm but first if you're new here to the channel please hit that subscribe button if you've already subscribed thank you very much so let's get right into how we make our CBD oil here on the farm so obviously first thing you're gonna need is CBD hemp flour now we grew this all year and this is about 3 and 1/2 ounces now they recommend magic butter machine which is what we're going to use they recommend 7 to 14 grams per cup of oil your choice of oil but the oil that I like to use here is MCT oil now this is fractured coconut oil to pretty much just have no coconut flavor and mono saturated fats what's cling on to CBD so those are pretty much the two ingredients in our CBD oil the next thing you're gonna want to do is after you weigh out your flour and you figured out how many cups of oil you want to use now typically I do two cup run and I will use about 12 grams of flour per cup I just like that ratio seems to work really well so you weigh it out on your scale and then you decarboxylate it now magic butter machine has its own decarboxylated flow and I put it in the oven at 250 degrees to 230 degrees really depends on where you want it how fast you want it low and slow I like to go with my D carb and you're gonna want to do it for twenty to thirty minutes so that's what we're gonna start off with so let's get right into how we make our CBD oil okay guys so now we're going to turn on the oven so first thing we're gonna do for our oven here is we're gonna hit the bake button we're gonna bring it down to 230 degrees Fahrenheit then we're just gonna hit start and now while it's preheating I'm gonna weigh out my flour and put it on this aluminum Flo so I'll be right back okay now that we've made our little container for our flour and today we'll be using our by ox flour that we grew this summer the next thing I'm going to do now that this is all good I'm gonna cover it up and more aluminum foil so you want to make sure that it's nice and covered because you want to keep all of those proteins in there and you really don't want to lose a lot of that flavor so to speak from the bud and then once we do that I'll take a knife it's almost like making a pie you know you're gonna want to cut a couple holes in it and that will let out any kind of moisture so now we're going to stick it in the oven for about 25 minutes okay so now we have decarboxylated our CBD hemp flour which is right here so this is pretty much what it looks like it just gets a little bit darker nothing crazy but it activates that CBD a and then what we're gonna do is I'm gonna get all that in here so that was approximately 24 grams of CBD hemp flour now what we're gonna do is we're going to add two cups of her MC tu Oh now the reason why I prefer MCT will is because it's just the best carrier for this CBD you can use coconut oil and you can use olive oil and a bunch of other oils but MCT really holds it the best and it has the most mono saturated fats per serving so there is our two cups of MCT oil we're just going to add it right into the machine get that all in there okay and that's it guys with the magic cutter machine it's a set it and forget it so now we're going to go ahead we're going to walk this thing on we're going to plug it in okay now if you can see the buttons here and I'll try to pull it up a little closer to the camera you're going to be able to see these flashing buttons first you're gonna want to go to a hundred and sixty degrees Fahrenheit and I like to do it for four hours because this is an oil tincture and that's it now it's good to go and you'll see the light starting this is starting the process of making the CBD oil and the great thing is guys there's no food processor there's no mess you can do this a whole bunch of other ways but I really love my magic butter machine because this is a no mess set it and forget it thing so we'll see you in four hours and you'll be able to see the final product alright everybody so the CBD oil is complete now I didn't catch it in time but the whole thing illuminates like blue and red and pink and once it's done it'll start flashing so this thing is ready to take out so now we're going to go through the process of extracting our oil from the material in the magic butter machine so as you can see it is all over the place in here and so what you should have is a spatula of some sort I just have a silicone one which is what a lot of people use I guess for this machine I don't think it's necessary but what you're going to do is you're just going to try to get all this material off the butter machine as best you can you know you can drive yourself crazy trying to get it all off but you want to get the majority of it a lot gets up underneath it so that's pretty good for me then what you're gonna do is you're going to kind of like scoop the sides you're gonna want to get it all in there okay so we are probably going to get less than two cups so I'm gonna get my bigger because you're gonna have to take this now magic butter gives you they call the love glove and the micron bag this is to extract all the plant material so you want to carefully get all that will in there now you use spatula again get as much of it in there as you can you can see down in there there's still quite a bit so that's what I'm trying to get out right now it smells awesome you guys alright that'll be good enough for now so next thing you're gonna do is gonna want to get your your silicone glove on your dominant hand so for me I'm a right-handed person you need to pick it up and you're gonna squeeze that bag this is the best you can you don't want to extract all that oil out of there if you can see it still coming out of there okay and that's it there's your CBD oil and I'll show you the finished product here so that is MC t CBD oil now what I'll do after this is I will put it in a bottle like this food-grade you can buy these at Walmart or Dollar Tree for for less than a dollar and then I will use it to fill these cvd vials so that's it for today's

we're going to break down the categories what they are i'm going to break down the pros and cons of each and give you some insights into all of the lab testing that i do let's get to it my name is jeremy roscoe and i spent a decade as a professional firefighter with a baby face but my real dream was to grow beard and become the greatest cbd reviewer the world has ever seen now i have a beard and review more cbd products than anyone ever no more baby face i send every cbd product to two independent labs to see what's real disclaimer this is not medical advice visit seebiteexamen.com for official lab tests and more please like share and subscribe to support these free lab tests and cbd videos enjoy two things before we start there is no best for everyone there's pros and cons to each category everyone has different reactions to different cannabinoids so i might do well with low amounts of just cbd cd isolate and you might need a really large dose of full spectrum with lots of cannabinoids to fill anything at all the second thing is that many cbd companies lie about what's in their products i test at two independent labs look at my lab results from independent labs versus the lab results these companies provide or whatever is on their label don't blindly trust cbd companies that tell you what's full spectrum or cbd isolate so what are we looking at here we're talking about hemp products with cbd here cbd has a lot of research behind it it's found in cannabis it does not get you high all these categories here have cbd and we're talking about products from hemp hemp is any cannabis strain that has less than 0.3 percent thc thc is the cannabinoid in marijuana that is responsible for getting people high it has a lot of research behind it and can provide relief in low doses it's not supposed to get you high from hemp because hemp has so little thc but more on that later full spectrums have thc and those are for people who don't need to take a drug test more on that later too then we have other cannabinoids thc and cbd have a lot of research behind them but there's also over 100 cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant i test for about a dozen at my two labs for example we test for cvg cbg oils are becoming popular on the consumer market people think that it has anti-inflammatory benefits pain relief it makes me sleep like a rock but the research behind it is still in its infancy and then we have cannabinoids the labs don't test for yet like thcp which one study recently found is 30 times more potent than thc but we don't know if that lab rat research will transfer over to humans if so a full spectrum extract with thcp might have the potential to get you high with very low amounts very very low amounts of cannabinoids a cannabinoid that we don't even test for yet and the same goes for medicinal benefits all these broad spectrums or full spectrum products we don't know what's responsible for their increased benefits over just cbd and that brings us to the entourage effect the entourage effect is what researchers refer to as the synergy of multiple nutrients found within the hemp plant that increases medicinal benefits counter side effects and maintains benefits at high doses sounds like [ __ ] synergy [ __ ] but there's a lot of research behind this it's uh most apparent in caesar research they found that cannabis whole cannabis full spectrum extracts had greater success rates than just cbd isolate they also found that full spectrum extracts were more effective than the same dose and the same ratio of isolated cbd and isolated thc but they don't know what cannabinoids or what other nutrients are responsible it could be the terpenes the essential oils in cannabis could be healthy fats which increase the absorption of both cbd and thc could be some other cannabinoid they don't know this is so profound there's even cases where they give a kid uh one cannabis extract the seizures go away they give the kid a different strain with similar thc ratios and cbd ratios and the seizures come back in full force but they don't know why that is the entourage effect it's adding to or increasing the benefits of cbd without understanding why i say entourage effect i checked the yes for full spectrums but obviously uh we don't know that all of these will have all these products will have the entourage effect because we don't know what's causing it in the first place and there are a lot of different strains in these extracts more on that later broad spectrums don't have thc i say no entourage effect here many marketers uh would disagree with me and that's because they are all liars all right we're gonna go over the pros and cons take a look at my guide for dosing everyone's different and dosing is tricky there's a lot of ways to screw this up this is all on cbdxamen.com by the way we're on the article now and you can go to the what is cbd for a full guide on this under the uh about tab right there so let's start with full spectrum cbd thc other cannabinoids the full entourage effect maybe we talked about the research obviously this category has the most cannabinoids so it can be the most effective a lot of people say that full spectrums are the only thing that is effective and that pure cbd just doesn't work and that might be true for them it's certainly not true for everyone the good thing about full spectrums is that you typically need a fraction of the amount in milligrams that you would need from a broad spectrum or cbd oil from isolate the cons some people are very sensitive to thc research shows that those high effects like you would get from marijuana those can start as low as 2 milligrams of thc but i think the sedation mental slowness may start at much lower doses maybe one milligram of thc there are just too many people who complain about this from certain hemp products with more thc and a lot of hemp products have over one milligram or over two milligrams of thc per dose so some people don't like thc some people have other reasons including drug tests a big downside to full spectrums is that you need to try a few brands because they come with different strains from different strains and one might have the cannabinoid combination that's right for you i show common cannabinoids that my lab tests for on every review and people find it very helpful to find similar products but there's always that level of uncertainty where we don't know which cannabinoid combination is going to help you specifically oh and full spectrums they keep the terpenes now that's a good thing but that's where the flavor is and hemp taste naturally earthy and nasty so most hemp extracts taste accordingly nasty but there are exceptions okay moving on to broad spectrum this is my least favorite category cbd no thc and yes i put on other can modes but i should really say most of the time trace levels that are so low that they make no difference and many times no other cannabinoids at all okay here's an example here's a big brand found in big stores it's labeled broad spectrum you can see that there are no other cannabinoids just cbd maybe a little cbdv very very common so many companies lie about broad spectrums well i'm getting ahead of myself here the pros we'll start with that first it's for people who don't want thc but they want other cannabinoids they are a little cheaper than full spectrums and they usually taste better because they remove a lot of the terpenes that's the pros back to the bad no thc benefits okay we knew that even if you have a real broad spectrum they usually contain so few cannabinoids that it doesn't matter you could compare it to the full spectrums that i've tested but why bother most broad spectrums have trace levels that really won't make a difference you can also look at the price per milligram of other cannabinoids and you'll see that broad spectrums on any given broad spectrum product you're paying so much that it's not worth it for those extra cannabinoids over a cbdi slit again this is the most abused term in the cbd industry so good luck if it has any other cannabinoids at all and here is the worst part a big reason why people obviously take a product a broad spectrum product without thc is so they can pass a drug test that looks for thc but broad spectrums have other cannabinoids that could potentially trigger a false positive on a drug test a recent study found that cbn a common cannabinoid that we test for can trigger a failed drug test what other cannabinoids will also in addition to cbn who knows there's not enough research on any of these cannabinoids and then in addition to those other cannabinoids possibly making you trigger a drug test thc is more likely to slip by in broad spectrum extracts because it's difficult to remove the thc and keep all of those other cannabinoids and nutrients at the same time if you take drug test i wouldn't recommend broad spectrums okay cbd oil from cbd isolate just cbd no thc no other cannabinoids pros there's a lot of positive research on cbd lots of user testimonials you don't need to worry about thc and all of its problems and that might be why so many people love cbd just pure cbds if they don't feel well with thc if thc causes the sedation a pure cbd product can give you some relief while still feeling sharp and good cbd isolate is cheap it's 25 cheaper than full spectrums according to my 2020 cbd oils analysis cbd has no taste so products can taste great some taste horrible for some reason and that still baffles me that they can take something with no flavor at all and make it taste horrible but that's besides the point a lot of them taste good they should taste good okay and cbd isolate removes all of the toxins found in the natural hemp plant the hemp plant absorbs things like lead and pesticides just like any fruit or vegetable my labs have found that cbd oils that test accurately for cannabinoid levels almost never have this issue with the toxins because accurate cannabinoid testing requires a lot of work but there are many products that have inaccurate levels of cannabinoids and they also end up having toxins so cbd isolate is isolated from all of those problems the cons obviously you're not getting all the other cannabinoids and thc the benefits that come with those the entourage effect you typically need higher doses than a full spectrum as well there are still a few risks you should know about as far as drug testing goes there is a faulty drug test that can't tell the difference between thc and cbd hopefully they stopped using that after a big piece in the new york times came out and addressed that issue there's also drug field tests that can't tell the difference between cbd and thc products many people have been arrested and then the labs end up showing it's just cbd and not a marijuana product now that hemp is federally legal that shouldn't be a problem but keep that in mind when you're traveling where marijuana is illegal that cbd products can be mistaken for marijuana so what's the best type of cbd out of the three categories that we mentioned here it's the one whichever one makes you feel best if you can handle a full spectrum a potent full spectrum hemp extract that's great you might need to try a few to get there you might feel best with the pure cbd you might sleep better with a full spectrum and then enjoy a cbd isolate during the day while you work you really get just got to try a few out thanks for watching check out cbdxamen.com to see what's in your favorite cbd products i will see you next time you wonderful person you you", "cy0r4zIdDMs": "[Music] hi friends trent the wizard here with factory six we're diving deep into some factory six factoids going into the forge about the difference between full spectrum broad spectrum and isolate products now the first thing we need to under really understand is where does that come from what is hemp extract well that comes from this delicious little flower here which is produced by the hemp plant now this little guy is where we're really going to pull most of our product from some of the leaves but mostly this is where the concentrated product exists now it's about a three to four month growing period for this to come to full fruition then a couple months for you know harvesting and drying and then at that point we're going to put it through an extraction process most commonly that extraction process is going to be a co2 or an ethanol depending upon you know purity and speed and whatever you're looking for but there's also new processes that are coming out we're working with a company right now that is actually working on a high pressure water extraction right now that is really exciting because it's solventless it's all natural we'll see how that comes out and more as it comes down the line however right now we're going to talk about the full spectrum crude oil that is the first thing that comes off the plant through that extraction process so this dark tar-like substance is exactly what has what we call a full spectrum of the cannabinoids or when we say that we mean all of the cannabinoids that that specific strain or that variety of hemp produced so it doesn't contain all 113 known cannabinoids but it will produce a variety of specific ones depending on the strain that you're growing and from there when you put it through the extraction process those are what's going to be present here along with some plant fats some chlorophyll some other things like that this is a pretty raw material so taste wise it's not super delicious it's kind of rough to the palate however there's things that we can do with this even as it is right now one of those things being we can use it in for example topicals like a cbd balm or a cream that way we're also utilizing as much of the plant as possible because it's as close as to it as we can get it's the first extraction that's something that you can really just use and just rub onto the skin and it's really nice you're gonna get most of the benefit that you can get from the plant in and of itself from this product alone all right friends so the next step in that process that we're going to be talking about today is going to be distillation with distillation we're going to get a distillate from crude oil that distillate is going to look very much like a honey as you can see here it is a very beautiful product in the sense that it's got the fats the chlorophyll everything else is taken out of it it can come in two different forms it can either come in a full spectrum or a broad spectrum the full spectrum is going to have again like i said all of those cannabinoids that plant produced and 0.3 or less thc as per federal regulation whereas a broad spectrum you're taking all of that thc out down to four decimal points so it's a non-detectable amount in that extract for you so the main thing that we're going to use something like this for is we're going to put this into something that's more of like an adjustable product like a tincture but this is really one of the main or most popular products that we use with a distillate among the many various products that we can put distillate into all right friends and as we move along this process we're going to be taking our distillate down to an isolate so in isolate as we go down that refinement process is going to be a powder that is literally a crystallized oil which is actually quite fascinating but one of the benefits of that that gives us is the fact that we can do really targeted things now an isolate is a 99.9 or 99.5 pure concentrate extract so we're talking about really really pure no plant anything but just that singular compound in and of itself so you know this is kind of like a sniper rifle in the sense you can get really targeted you can get really specific on what you're trying to do with it and that's really really nice it's workability it's it blends well it does a lot of things that these other products is a little bit more difficult takes a little bit more time to do so for example like a great product that an isolate would be used for is like a quick tab it's a nice little sublingual tablet that dissolves directly into the mouth but again it's very easy to work with and that's why we like to use an isolate with it all right guys so the last thing we're going to be talking about today in our process is going to be a powdered water soluble extract now this is unique in the sense that we're taking a oil product we're encapsulating it down on a nano size to actually make it dissolvable in water which is really really unique considering the oil and water don't generally mix so from this we can make really really cool products there's a lot of applications you can do especially since this can be a broad spectrum product still retaining all that cannabinoid profile all that entourage beautiful effect that we've talked about earlier but while at the same time getting a very very targeted application it's really unique and really really cool to work with guys thanks

you", "VF26aQ_de84": "I do it guys welcome back to another episode on the I smoke youtube channel my name is Tyler Greene I'm your host and today I'm gonna talk about a another form of CBD oil we do an occasional video about CBD oil I've covered various ranges before but the range that I have today by a company called eql are something a little bit different and that is what I'm going to talk to you about in a bit of detail right here on the ice smoker channel CBD oil has absolutely taken the country and indeed a lot of the world by storm the cannabinoid cannabidiol also known as CBD is a legal component of the cannabis plant this has caused it to surge in popularity as people have realized the benefits of cannabinoids on their endocannabinoids system unfortunately we've seen some marketing practices which have continued to demonize THC which is another beneficial cannabinoid but the CBD market has grown and grown and grown and is looking likely to surpass the entire vitamins market in the next couple of years EQL is a brand sold on the hemp elf website they're also going to be sold in the leafy pop up store at the end of the month alongside the goods and the hemp elf products the reason that I wanted to make a video about this particular oil is the natural terpene infusion that has been done to give it more of a palatable taste if you've ever tried CBD oil you might think to yourself I don't really like to taste that much it's a little bit bitter a little bit planty this is basically using natural hemp derived terpenes to give a nicer flavor for the oil I'm going to show you this and and taste it right now on the channel the range itself they've got a terpene infused one and a non terpene infused one a couple of things to mention about this product one is it is broad-spectrum not full-spectrum this is something you're gonna see more of in the CBD worlds moving forward as regulations tighten but basically it is starting with the CBD and then in other cannabinoids to create a broad spectrum with with benefits of those other cannabinoids and this starts with a base of MCT oil CBD broad-spectrum isolate hemp terpenes minor cannabinoids can include CPG and CBC this is produced at a farm that they own basically so it's from seed to oil extract as well get a taste these now actually I haven't tasted it without the terpene so we're gonna do this while I've got this dropper out it's the perfect time to show you something which is that this has a glass pipette with a measurement on it now it's got no point two five mil all the way up to one mil and this says on the bottle that it is 33 milligrams per mil so if you have one full Pripet of this you can easily dose yourself and with the right amount of CBD basically what I'm going to do is I'm going to do half a mil so that's about what 16 and a half milligrams of CBD and I'm just gonna put this under my tongue like so now immediately it's not as strong or bitter tasting as most of the other words that I've got it is more of a light coconut taste and I think that's because of the MCT oil right that's what I can taste right about now there's no sort of like need to have a drink after it almost leaves like that yeah like coconut milk sort of aftertaste in your mouth do you know I mean it's not like a bad flavor whatsoever moving on to the terpene infused one this is what got me really excited is that they've done the same as this oil but then they've reinterprets from the implants that it's been extracted from - just try and keep some of that more natural hemp flavor now this is coming in a nice knot point 75 mil which is what - which is three quarters of thirty three milligrams 2922 is two thirds about 2627 milligrams I don't actually know I'm not doing maps that quickly so this has got the terpene infusion let's see how this tastes in comparison it's really interesting the terpenes definitely add a kind of hemp taste to it without any of the sort of bitterness it's like a it's very plant e it's almost like a bit grassy that kind of like area of flavor you know I mean it's not got a sweetness but it's also not got like any sour or any kind of like what I perceive to be negative flavors or to actually really cool stuff they changed the bottles they did previously have this in a darker boots or they've moved it into a lighter one I'm not sure what schools that move I did think that it was sort of photosensitive so potentially and bottles were were better for that but they've decided to put it into a clear bottle so if you're storing at home maybe store it in a dark cupboard rather than just in direct sunlight a thousand milligrams in each bottle there's a little bit of a price difference with these the well balanced CBD drops of $59.99 and the terpene infused is 65 99 if you are using the amount of CBD I'm using then you'll probably get through one of these bottles in a month in fact it's actually perfectly dosed for a month's supply I'd say if you have one meal there's 30 mils in that bottle for getting the favoring milligrams per day that's what I am taking personally I think that's a good amount to to consume from my n low cannabinoid system what do you think about infusing terpenes back into the CBD oil is it something that you could see yourself enjoying do leave your comments below and remember to hit

little series here and doing a little education on CBD since it is all the rage right now and you know now just power right so we all know you can go down to the local video store and buy a bottle of CBD oil so there are reasons why we really want to be informed on what to buy where to buy it what to use it for when not to use it so many things that we really need to have a better understanding of so I just wanted to come on for just a few minutes here um hey Linda hey Kelly good to see you on here be sure to ask questions in the comment section because if I can help clarify any of this for you I am so happy to do that so I wanted to come on today and talk a little bit about broad spectrum CBD oil and why you might even care about full spectrum or broad spectrum or CBD isolate we hear all of these terms but often when we find ourselves in the grocery store or the video store there's nobody there to help us understand what really does matter and we are putting this under our tongue so you may not realize this but when you put something under your tongue it's going right into your bloodstream it's not getting the benefit of being filtered by your kidneys and your liver in that process so you really need to think about that you know before you just take something so I just want to help you understand what to look for how to understand these different terms so that when you are getting ready to purchase you have that opportunity to make an educated decision so first of all the ABCs right um a a means all of it the whole plant right the a a plus version of CBD oil in the a plus version of CBD oil this is our 1500 strengths full-spectrum CBD oil um hemp derived so a quick little mini lesson this is we're talking about the cannabis plant that confuses a lot of people that makes you think we're talking about marijuana we actually are not talking about marijuana the cannabis plant has several different species that exist beneath cannabis so the same way that the you know the cat kingdom has lions and domestic cats and tigers right so there is a species up here called cannabis a genus and it has plants underneath it that are cousins like marijuana and hemp so they're not the same plant although they do come from the same parent plant we're talking about hemp so marijuana on the marijuana side of things high-end THC naturally low in CBD hemp on the other hand high in CBD and many other phyto cannabinoids low very low naturally with THC so really important distinction because they have completely different mechanisms of action within the body so to understand now if we're talking about hemp derived CBD which is fully legal federally legal across the entire United States full spectrum is entirely federally legal as long as the THC is below 0.03 percent so that's important that this full-spectrum still has less than that in it in terms of THC but the full spectrum the a of the ABCs a is all of it all over the plant the stems the seeds the everything that's in it the phyto cannabinoids a THC the CBN the CBG the CBD all of the properties of the plant it produces what's called an entourage effect and what that means is at plant simply works better when it's kept in its natural state it's not being pulled apart and made for use in different in different things this is all aspects of the plant all the cannabinoids all the terpenes everything you could possibly want from that plant is here in the bottle so that's full-spectrum if you have health challenges if you want to stay healthy and keep your body from being inflamed and fighting off the toxins in the environment you want to have this in your diet whether you feel you have a health issue or whether you don't inflammation is a powerful thing we want to keep inflammation down in our bodies that's really important because everything out there is making our bodies acidic which is creating inflammation so that's your sugars your toxins or alcohol your cigarette smoke all of those things are creating a toxic environment in our bodies that are making our bodies acidic that acidic nature is creating inflammation and the inflammation is leading to their challenges health challenges so the primary mechanism of action of CBD generally is to lower that inflamed situation in your body that is the major thing that it does on a gnat in a natural way so really really really great lots of benefits whether you're sick or whether you're healthy is something that everybody should have in their diet both spectrum the whole entire plant everything that's good about it is in here it the 1500 is the most powerful strength that we have um you don't always need to start with that sometimes you can find a sweet spot that's less less strong than that we do have everything from the 500 strengths is 750 strength and the 1500 so many different strengths what we do is try to help you find your sweet spot you can figure out what strengths addresses the challenges or brings you into your best way of feeling from one day to the next so full spectrum remember that it is the elite it is the best way to get this plant into your body to do the best work that it can do a challenge with full spectrum is that in that natural plant there is naturally a small amount of THC now that THC does not give you euphoric feeling there's not enough of it in there to give you that high that euphoric feeling that you would get if you were using marijuana so whether you wanted or whether you don't you're not going to get it if you get something other than a full spectrum a full spectrum has everything in it so the challenge is if you're drug tested and your company will test you spontaneously to see if you have THC in your system if you're taking full-spectrum CBD there is a great chance that you will show up testing positive for THC it really depends on how fast your body metabolizes its THC so as you use your CBD oil if you're often men have less some less trouble with this if you're active if you have a low amount of fat on your body it tends to let go of the THC and metabolize it quicker but if you are like me and you have a little extra soft cushion on your body it holds on to that THC a little bit longer so even though it's a small amount it could show up in a drug test so we live I live in South Carolina and THC in your blood on the drug test is not a good thing I'm lots of people could lose their job on that so you cannot should not I would not recommend if your drug tested for you to take a full spectrum CBD oil so the a is out right the all of the plant not an option for you if your drug tested so the next thing your mind that you could have that is really strong and powerful and has all the benefits of CBD is what we call broad spectrum broad spectrum is all of the plant - the THC so it has a turbine terpenes it has the CBG the CB and the cba the CBD and that all those great cannabinoids that you need that will help you with all of those issues that you might may have going on in your system or to prevent those issues no THC so our company has just brought that on board and we now have a broad spectrum option for people who are typically drug tested on your jobs so just to make sure that you get as much of the benefit from this powerful plant as you can without the THC prior to that and another option that you may find in the grocery store that we will no longer be offering but you may see it is what's known as a THC free CBD isolate a CBD isolate is just that it is only CBD so when you pull the CBD out of the planet you're leaving behind the terpenes the fight of other phyto cannabinoids and the THC and you're getting a pure CBD isolate so it has nothing but that and your carrier oil ours is hemp seed oiler was hemp seed or a cold-pressed hemp seed oil so we won't be offering that at hemp works at all anymore because broad-spectrum is such a better and more effective option for people who need to submit to a drug test and pass it so for those of you in South Carolina who would love to try that and your drug tested this is a very safe way to find out the benefits of CBD oil with the broad spectrum so there's all that all of the plant the a is all of the plants full spectrum the B is broad spectrum although the plant except THC and the C is CBD isolate just CBD so you're reducing in potential efficacy as you go down that list staying at the top is going to give you the most powerful version of the plant and its best in its best version moving down is getting you safer and safer from passing a drug test and making sure that you don't have that THC in your system a fuse quick things as I close this out because I don't want to make this long I'm not seeing too many questions I see Alex on here Mary's on here yeah so a few things at the end to close out basics right then you need to know when you're choosing a CBD oil first of all you want to know that it is grown in a US farm you want it to be non-gmo right you want it to have some regulation in there so that we some people aren't just growing it in their backyard really important to have a farm that you know and trust really important that it is third-party tested we do not want the company testing its own product so often the ones you find on the Shelf out there they've tested their own product it would be like me telling you how cute my granddaughter is of course she's cute to me I'm just keeps everybody because she's just cute but if you really want to get an opinion on something you need to get a third party involved so third party testing is crucial with CBD Oreo you need to have access to those labs so that you can in fact see that there are no metals or toxins in there so having some type of a code like we've got a QR code on the back that you can scan so that you can look at your lab work for your lot number that way you can confirm that what you're putting under your tongue is safe and clean and pure and has no THC if in fact that's the one that you that you're wanting to get so really really important that there's a third-party testing going on they're really important for it to be co2 extracted the way they pull that CBD out of the plant and make it available for us is really important and there are some very inexpensive ways to do it and the problem with those inexpensive ways is that it leaves traces of of chemicals in the system the oil that they used in the breaking down process and it also harms the oil makes it less effective so even though co2 extracted is more expensive it is much more effective and safer so that's why we really think that's important there should be minimal ingredients in your bottle when you look at the back of your bottle you should have a nice you know official thing yet we've got our hemp Seal of Approval here we've got a QR code and then you know what you would expect to write the Supplemental facts and information when you look at the ingredients on your bottle it should have no more than three ingredients preferably two really what we've got is cold pressed hemp seed oil CBD rich hemp extract and if you need a flavour we've got like a peppermint extract or a cinnamon extract if you really have a hard time with the taste although it's a really mild taste but minimal ingredients the more ingredients you have in that bottle the bigger risk you're taking and the safety of what you're putting it so minimal ingredients is really important what we offer that we think is really important is a 60-day empty bottle guarantee on our products so you try them it takes some time to titrate to find your sweet spot use it for a couple months you know work with us let us help you find your sweet spot and then after two months if you haven't seen a difference return your empty bottle no problem no questions asked you'll get a full refund so that sometimes it takes time to figure out you know if you've got major challenges going on in your system it takes a little while for that oil to get in there nd to get to the receptors and do the job it needs to do so you've got to give it time it's not always a you know fix it quick kind of situation sometimes it takes a little bit of time to get to something that you've been building up in your system for years for a lifetime really because if we haven't really been exposed to this prior to now in a way where we could get it like this so let's see a lot of questions on here but I know I've dumped a lot of information your way I hope this is helpful let me know if you're interested in trying some of this if you haven't tried it yet let me know I'd love to introduce you to this product I'd love to make sure that you get introduced to a high quality product and I'd like to help coach you in the process of finding the right amount for you and how to address the challenges that you may have or avoid the challenges that you may be wanting to avoid with this important and powerful supplement so I hope that's really helpful I remember full-spectrum has all of the stuff in it full spectrum all of it the entourage effect the a+ version is full spectrum be broad-spectrum all of it except the THC turkey hides all of that great stuff beneficial supplement no problems with passing a drug test which is really important and then CBD isolate nothing in it except CBD and the carrier oil so no THC but also none of the other cannabinoids or terpenes are in there either so min you may find it a little bit less effective than the other than the a or the B alright so I hope that's helpful have a beautiful evening reach out with any questions that you have share this if you think it's helpful for anybody and send them my way if they have questions I'm happy to help you out have a beautiful day love you uh take care bye bye", "pDBaK-Ba9eY": "hey everyone its Josie here with bio MD and here at bio MD we believe that education is key as buyers it's really important for you to understand what it is you're purchasing and what is the right product for you having numerous terms presented in the CBD industry there needs to be some clarification regarding the differences between the different kinds of CBD that are available now there are three main kinds of CBD available there's the broad spectrum CBD the full-spectrum CBD and the isolate CBD and today I'm going to explain to you some of the differences between these different variants of CBD and maybe we'll try and figure out which one's the best one for you now but before all of that let's talk a little bit about what CBD is cannabidiol or CBD is a compound that is found in the cannabis plant there are many different cannabinoids that are found in the cannabis sativa plant the two main ones that most people have heard of are THC and CBD the main difference between THC and CBD is that THC is a psychoactive compound and CBD is a non psychoactive and by psychoactive we mean when you smoke or inhale or ingest THC you feel the effect of being high and you feel a general change in your perception of the world the opposite to THC is CBD and I say it's the opposite in that you don't feel these feelings of high you don't feel any of the psychoactive effects when you take CBD however CBD is known to possess many health benefits and which is why we are more interested in CBD and its uses at bio MD now the sativa plant contains more than just THC and CBD there are other kinds of terpenes and there's other kinds of cannabinoids present in the sativa plant and it is the combination of all these different components that leads to a variance in the different types of CBD that we see so let's start with broad spectrum CBD broad spectrum CBD infuses the various substances apart from THC so it'll include CBD cannabinoids terpenes and other chemicals that are derived from the plant and at the same time it does meet the federal requirement as it has all of the THC removed but even though it has all of the THC removed since it has most of the other components of the plant you still experience the entourage effect now let's talk about full spectrum CBD full spectrum CBD will retain all of the chemical properties of the plant including THC now authentic federally legal CBD is derived from industrial hemp and contains less than 0.3 percent THC now this is very very low amounts of THC and it will not show up on a drug test all CBD products are required by law to meet this percentage and no CBD product that you consume will show up on any drug test that you take similar to the broad spectrum CBD the full spectrum CBD will also encourage the entourage effect to take place but if you take the full spectrum CBD you'll feel it a lot more than you would if you were to take the broad spectrum CBD just because the full spectrum CBD has 0.3% of THC and the broad spectrum has no THC finally let's talk about the third and the last kind of CBD which is the isolate CBD iceless CBD products are labeled as being the purest form of the product depending on how they're processed isolate products have been isolated down to just the CBD molecules so it'll contain nothing else they do not possess any other active ingredient no terpenes or other cannabinoids so this is the purest form of CBD that you can ingest this type of product is generally processed as a white powder and also can be included in oil now again there are many other factors that can affect CBD for example various growing seasons can cause the individual mix of components to vary like one growing season can have a yield that's exceptionally high in CBD whereas the other yield based on temperature weather might have a yield that's a little bit lower in CBD and again the variation of chemicals might be different depending on the state's climate that the CBD is produced in the weather in Kentucky is very different from the weather in California so you will find differences in the CBD that are grown in different states another difference that may impact the product is the extraction process itself ethanol and superficial fluid of co2 both have advantages and disadvantages but do not produce identical product because the extraction itself will impact the chemicals that are resulting from this process I will end on saying that choosing which CBD product that meets your specific needs is a personal choice if you want to assure that there is no THC present in your CBD I would recommend going for the isolate strain however if you want to expect an experience a feeling of calmness that is more tangible maybe like at the end of the night maybe right before you go to bed you want to experience a feeling of calmness in your muscles then I would recommend either the broad spectrum or the full spectrum and there is really no harm in trying out different products and seeing which one works best for you and your personal needs there are many coupon codes available for most of these CBD products and that is one way to save money and still try out different strands and see what works best for you so good luck on this journey you [Music]", "MYdhUBPQrPM": "you guys who got their handful today oh my gosh I'm so excited right now everybody your hemp oil is showing up I know mine just came in the mail today I've had so many people say there showed up today so I want to take a minute and show you how to use it and what to expect because I know so many of you are gonna be having questions so this is the one ounce bottle that you have received today tomorrow sometime this week if you order and I want to show you how I take my hemp oil every single night what I do why I do it and and give you a little bit of what to expect all right so super easy I'm gonna keep this short either you ordered the full spectrum like this or the isolate and in it you are this is the bottle that I've been using for the last couple of weeks in it you're gonna have a dropper and it goes to one milliliter okay so you're just gonna go ahead and if you just give it one full suck it usually fills mine to 0.75 the first month that I used my oil I only used a half of a dropper the reason why is because number one so I use just a half of the dropper the reason why is because number one I didn't know how long it was gonna be before I could get another bottle and so I wanted to like conserve it and make it last and I had also heard that you can have some detox symptoms with it and to start slow so I thought okay that's fine so I messaged my friend who was really really knowledgeable about hemp and I said you know what happens to me if I use the full dropper like what's gonna happen to me and she's like nothing nothing's gonna happen to you use the full dropper so the only reason why I really we used the only the half a drop of the hemp oil to start was because I was trying to conserve it because I didn't know how long it was gonna be and I wanted to make it last for a full month so the benefit though of doing it that way is I did have some detox okay the detox that I had was exhaustion I was completely exhausted for a couple of weeks I remember just like in the afternoon sleeping all night and being so tired and I will link the call that Jamie Foote did for us last week on our leaders retreat team call so that you can hear why that happened why it's a good thing and I just took naps you guys it's your body basically coming back into homeostasis and healing itself so I've been through detox before it was an enjoyable detox it was not uncomfortable it wasn't bad I mean you just drink an active or take them ed a burn or take a nap all those things are gonna work great so I'm gonna show you now you can start off at a half a dropper and after a week if you're feeling great go up to a full dropper I am up to a full dropper now and and you'll you'll be able to just navigate this and it's just something new but it's nothing to be afraid of it's not like normal detox where you're gonna be sick none of that I just had extreme fatigue as part of my detox so I don't want anyone to be nervous or scared like start with the full dropper but I just thought I'd share with you what I did and what I experienced in case you have that too Sean is gonna start his tonight because we've got three fresh bottles he's gonna finally get to try it and then I also got the isolate for Mackenzie so I'm gonna give her I'm probably gonna start her off on a quarter full like a little quarter of a dropper or maybe even half a dropper and I'm hoping that it really helps her with her anxiety so more on that later but I'm gonna show you how to take it so this is just a half dropper because I'm gonna take another Huff dropper again tonight I thought I'd show you what it looks like to just take a half drop right now so what I want you to do is I want you to put up under your tongue and then I want you to hold it there under your tongue for nine seconds why do I want you to do this because that is how it's going to absorb most efficiently into your body its fat soluble so the fat is actually gonna make it so that it's absorbing more efficiently anyway but you want to hold it under the tongue for 90 seconds now I don't sit and count to 90 in my head what I do is after I've brushed my teeth I I'm in my jammies I go to my bedside table I just keep it inside of my little sock drawer and I pull it out I put my chapstick on I put half of it I put a full dropper and I do a full dropper but I put a full dropper under my tongue all right and then I walk around my house I make sure all the lights are off again I'm just holding it under my tongue this whole time I turn off all the lights in my house I set my alarm on my I set my house alarm I go downstairs I check on the kids and then I come upstairs and by the time I get back upstairs and I get in bed I figure that had to have been 90 seconds and then I just swallow it at that point the full spectrum tastes like berry guava I think the isolate is like a mint but I'll let you know because it's coming today still I had that one shipped to my mom's house because I got on her account so I'm gonna show you now what to do and how to do it and I want you to do this at bedtime if you're someone who who wants to use this if you're like CrossFit and like super into exercise and fitness and weightlifting and all of that I want to know what your experience is with the hemp oil if you take it right before your workout because I've heard that the MCT oil inside of this those are multi chain triglycerides I've heard that it can help with workouts so for those of you that are like really inch bodybuilding or CrossFit or things like that I would love to know if you notice the difference but I just take mine at bedtime so just do just tell us all the things and how it goes for you because this is also new for us okay so this is what you do under your tongue but uh uh and uh hum well ninety Saturn's okay Oh it's like who's people under your tongue for like 90 seconds Brennan you're gonna hold it under your tongue for 90 seconds don't talk to anyone like don't do what I'm doing right now again this is why I do it right at bedtime at night who's gonna hold it under your tongue and then after you hold it under your tongue for 90 seconds you're gonna swallow it and then you're gonna go to sleep you're gonna have the best sleep of your whole entire life it's gonna be life-changing like I'm gonna swallow now just because I want to build talk normal to you guys what the the best way that I can describe the sleep that I have with my oil is I feel like I sink down into my mattress halfway and a cocoon closes up over me and I don't move until I wake up the next morning like I thought my sleep was good before this hello it's amazing so super excited for you guys cannot wait for you to drive it out cuz I know everybody's oil is coming today these are my three bottles that I ordered on my account chanson count my reentry account then I ordered one on my mom's account too so and I got the isolate on my mom's account so I'll let you know how that goes I'm gonna just easy not with Mackenzie I want the full spectrum for myself and and I just wanted to buy a nice alit and see how that goes and I'm gonna I'll try it too I want to see what it tastes like but um make sure that whatever results you're having with this post them here in the team page even if you're like oh my gosh can it do that can it work that fast yes it can yes it can and I want to document all of it in our team page so that we have a wide variety things for people to just just showcase everybody's different experiences with it if you remember too when you put your story in

well and that really depends on your potency level also and the same thing goes with trim versus small flowers there's a whole bunch of different potencies if you guys have questions go ahead and email me i'll be absolutely happy to answer any and all questions that you guys have about the hemp flour okay so we're going to need some stuff to make cbd oil with a crock pot unlike using an expensive machine like the magical butter machine you're going to need some other kitchen gadgets in order to make cbd oil correctly at home with a crock pot and so first and foremost we need a carrier oil now this is obviously you use this for a magical butter machine or any other machine we're going to use mct oil today other popular carrier oils are hemp oil and olive oil i really don't like olive oil that's just my personal preference i do love mctl it's the best carrier oil of all of them but if you're looking for a little added flavor hemp oil if you can find it is really good as well but today we're going to be using mct oil and the reason why coconut oil and other oils aren't in this is well coconut oil will be solid at room temperature so that's not good for cbd oil and other ones don't have the necessary fats to be a superior carrier oil and you really need that absorption rate to be high especially for a crock pot okay obviously next you will need a crock pot um these are relatively inexpensive you can get them for like 15 online you don't need a large one uh your batches are going to be anywhere between one to two cups of oil and one to two ounces of flour so really you don't need a large crock pot a three to six quart crock pot is plenty um another thing you will need is something to decarb with now we're going to use our magical butter d card box i love it there's no point in using a pyrex dish if i have this but you can use a pyrex dish with a cover that works as well and this will be one of the first steps we do here as we make our cbd oil the next thing you definitely need is going to be a filter of some sort some people use a cheese cloth um i don't i've never used that i've always used the magical butter filters you can get this pack on their website or you can get any type of micron filter i believe it has to be 150 or more um that's just what we use uh you can go more or less probably depending on the amount of plant material that's going to go through or how many times you actually want to sift through it this package also comes with a silicone glove i really like using that too especially when we're squeezing out the oil but that's going to be later on in the video now this part isn't necessary um to use i'm going to show you how to get around this but a lot of people will use this to cut up or grind up their flower a nutribullet or a magic bullet of anything like this to cut up the flower pre-decarb but i'm going to teach you a trick today on how you can avoid that it takes a little time but there's a trick now if you buy your hem flower from us it's going to come in a package exactly like this this is a pre-packaged um one ounce pre-packaged from us and what we'll do is we're gonna throw this in the freezer for four to six hours and what that does is it makes the hemp fiber very brittle and once it's brittle you can scrunch it all up in the bag and boom you don't have to use a grinder to cut up a flower we've already done that process and here we go here is our scrunched up flower and a ziploc now you don't have to use the bag if you if you're not purchasing from us use a ziploc same exact method in there for four to six hours scrunch it up and we're good to go so we've already done this step i'm not going to time lapse it or anything like that you will need to cut it up one way or another whether it's the bullet or it's through uh freezing it so let's dive into making cb duo with your crock pot here at home and get into the next step okay folks let's get into making cbd oil with our crock pot here we have already measured out a cup of mct oil so we're going to get that in the crock pot now to get it warmed up this process doesn't take very long but this is going to be the first thing you're going to want to do is measure out your oil and get it into the crock pot we're going to put it on low and we're just going to let it sit all right we're going to move this off to the side here for a minute next thing we're going to do is we are going to use our magic butter d card box again you can use a pyrex dish as long as it has a cover or any other baking dish as long as it has a cover now what you're going to be doing is you're going to be de-carving so get your oven preheated to 250 degrees 250 all right so we're going to preheat our oven right now again 250 uh preheat and then once we put this stuff in there it's going to be going in for 30 minutes now again you're either going to this step you're going to be blending your hemp flour which i just don't like making a mess so that's really just not what i want to do but this is an option you can do that get that you take your um your shredded up flour whether you use the magic bullet or you use the freezer method like we did and you're just going to pour it in to your d carb box whether that's the pyrex or this particular box you're gonna make sure that it's nice and even you're gonna cover it and we're gonna throw it into the oven for about a half an hour once it's preheated to 250 degrees so that's what we're going to flash forward to next and then we'll start getting into making the cbd oil okay folks so let me move this out of the way here real quick all right so we have done we are done with the d-carb process again 250 degrees for 30 minutes and there is your nice fresh ground uh cbd hem flower so now we're ready to go um but before we dive into putting it into crop i want to make sure that this isn't the end-all be-all recipe so we used one cup of mct oil for one ounce of hemp flour you can use two cups you can use less flour you can use more flour it really depends on what you want but i'm going to stand by one cup per one ounce if you want to go less you know you can use 14 grams of flour per cup i really don't recommend anything less than that because i don't think you'll get a good experience with cbd i just don't think the potency will be there for you the other thing about the crock pot too it's not nearly as efficient as the magic butter machine so this is going to be a process it is going to be in the crock pot for four to eight hours really depends on when you're ready the longer it has to be in there to cook into the oil the more chance of a higher absorption rate so just remember that as well and again guys you can find all this stuff on our website or feel free to leave a comment or email me and you can find us on facebook and instagram as well if you need to get in touch with me through there okay so let's go ahead and get this going into the crock pot now remember we put this on low already the oil is already nice and warm we have our ounce of ground flour here and we're going to go ahead and dump it right into the crock pot okay so now that that's done we're just gonna move around the flower and we're going to let it cook down [Music] and that's really all we're doing now we're going to let this cook down absorb all into the oil we're gonna cover it again you can use more oil or or i wouldn't use anything less than a cup of oil but you can use more oil like two cups we're just doing a very small batch for the video but as you can see it's already starting to go right into the oil so now we're going to check it about every hour on low so we'll see in another hour and then we're going to repeat that for probably six hours for this particular batch so that is how we get started making our cbd hemp oil in a crock pot okay folks we have let this go for about eight hours i lost kind of track of time and we've been stirring about every hour and this is what it looks like right now very liquidy you know all broken down and that's what you want to look like again you got to go for the longer cook with the crock pot i know with the magic butter machine it's four hours but you're really safe with an eight hour on low cook um of course the setting is low for the crock pot so now what we're going to do is we're going to get our strainer again this is something you're going to have to purchase in order to make cbd oil and then we're going to get some gloves and we're going to slowly pour this into the strainer all right so here we go again it's a balancing act with the strainer just got to take your time get this out of the way here you're just going to let it all go into the strainer there kind of write it up a little bit now again we only did a cup of oil very small batch and what you can do now is get all the plant material in there much as you want because what you're going to do now is once it's in the strainer you can squeeze every last bit of oil out of the flour because the flour does absorb some of the oil okay now one of the things that you get with the magical butter kit uh when it comes to buying these strainers is they give you the silicone glove it's pretty important because it helps you squeeze out all the [Applause] oil all right that's about all you can have with that and then you can put it in your container whatever you desire whether it's a droplet bottle a mason jar but this is the finished product this is your cbd oil and you made it with a crock pot so that's really it for today's video guys if you have any questions feel free to comment in the video uh or you can reach us um via facebook or instagram or email if you guys are interested in the hemp flower that we use today go ahead and check out our website link in the description below but that is all i have for you guys today i hope you enjoyed the video hope you all stay happy healthy and i'll see you in another video", "8qHG4h7fPk8": "hi I'm certified nutrition consultant Catherine with foods that heal you and foods that heal you CBD and in this video in our series I'm going to explaining the difference between four different types of CBD oil full-spectrum broad-spectrum CBD isolate and distal eight all right so I've mentioned in previous videos full-spectrum I've shown you the CBD wheel which I'll show again here but full-spectrum means that it has all of the plant parts it has all of the phyto cannabinoids it has all of the plant terpenes it has vitamins minerals all of the phytonutrients it's it contains everything my analogy that I use is it's like eating an apple if you take a bite of the apple you're getting all of the nutrients in that Apple you're not just extracting certain nutrients you're getting all of the coke the cofactors all of the synergistic nutrients in that Apple alright so if you look at the cannabinoid wheel and this is just an illustration this is not all of the cannabinoids but there's over a hundred but you can see that you have CBD is one cannabinoid and you've got CBN CBT and you even have THC and this is where the confusion can come in so yes full spectrum does have THC in it in trace amount it's still legal because it's below the legal limit of 0.3% so you're not going to experience the effects of THC if you're getting hemp derived CBD hemp oil alright so that's what full spectrum is and one more thing about full spectrum just explain between CBD and THC because this does come up sometimes people ask me does CBD have THC in it so no it doesn't because CBD as you can see is one phyto cannabinoid and THC is a separate can't avoid it would be like saying is there any vitamin B in my vitamin C there is not because there are separate vitamins these are separate cannabinoids okay so one's not in the other but they can be in the same plant all right so that's full spectrum and full spectrum is considered to be really the best option because in nature nutrients works best synergistically together and there was an Israeli study that showed also that the full spectrum was superior to these other types now that doesn't mean that full spectrum is going to be the best for you because everybody's gonna need something different you may be looking for something with zero THC in it so there's other options here as I'm gonna go through now the but the full spectrum I also wanted to give a couple examples of full spectrum so that you understand what it can look like it's a full spectrum the the most pure or whole plant extract is gonna look like our pure oil concentrates this is the green label and this is the gold label these are whole plant hemp extracts so this is the as close to the original plant is you're going to get without just grinding up the leaves all right so this is the hemp extract and then what you can do is you can have a full so that's full spectrum you can have a full spectrum drops like our tasty drops because what you can do is you can take the head backtrack add it in to this bottle with a carrier oil like MCT oil or hemp oil which I explained in other videos but you can add it in with maybe a flavor and shake it up now you have a full spectrum tincture drop alright now here's where the confusion could get in that you really need to know how to read your labels so make sure you watch the other other video in this series so you learn how to read the labels but this can be any of these truly so you want to make sure that if you want full spectrum you know how to read that label and you know that there's full spectrum in that bottle because it's the highest risk for getting anything in here and junk in there that you're not aware is in there alright alright the second type is gonna be broad spectrum so broad spectrum is going to be very similar to full spectrum the biggest difference is it's not gonna have any THC so they filter out the THC our broad spectrum product is our HC CBD spray so this has all the phyto cannabinoids it has plant terpenes phytonutrients it just doesn't have the THC so for example if your concern about drug testing for THC and you want something with zero THC but you want the benefits of full spectrum then the CBD spray would be a really great option broad spectrum would be a option there now what it does is it calls causes something called the entourage effect so full spectrum and broad spectrum you're gonna have that on taraj effect which I explained I I called it the synergistic it's synergistic nutrients working together that's basically the entourage effect when you have all the nutrients working together with all the cofactors the body's gonna be able to absorb and utilize it more effectively okay and then the third option is going to be CBD isolate now CVD isolate is going to be a white powder it's very very pure you don't have any other cannabinoids no THC no cbn CDG none of those no phytonutrients no vitamins no minerals nothing else the only thing that's in the isolate is strictly CBD and if you look on this wheel it would be only this little section right here now obviously there are a lot of potential benefits of the CBD right but if you don't have these synergistic cofactors and that entourage effect this CBD may not work very well for you now there are some things that you can do to help bring back that entourage effect and I'm going to give you a couple examples of the isolates that we have we have our cat drops are a CBD isolate and the reason for that is because cats have sensitive stomachs so we have an isolate in here now as you can see between these two bottles you would never know this is full spectrum and this is isolate that's why you really need to know how to read labels cuz I slit is less expensive so if you're paying for full spectrum and you're getting an isolate you're getting ripped off okay you want to make sure you're getting what you're paid for we have the isolated in here and then what we do is we add in back in a carrier oil that's going to help create that entourage effect all right then the other thing you can do is for example a vape we have our vapeshot our vape liquids we use an isolate but they are they can be very effective for people because we add back in the plant terpenes and plant terpenes definitely helped create that entourage effect and increase the or absorption and utilization of the nutrient and the CBD oil okay so those just a couple examples of the CVD isolate so ISIL it's not bad it just needs to be it needs to be in a formula that's going to create that entourage effect for you and then also isolate another thing that you'll want to know about isolate is that you can get super high milligrams in an isolate like our isolate powders a tiny little container with 50 or 100 milligrams in it and one thing that you can do is that isolate is you can I have a customer who adds it to to hate HC here so adding the powder to this and shaking it up you increase the milligrams of the CBD concentration and you still get that entourage effect because this is a full well it's a broad spectrum so you've got all those other synergistic and code factors to help with that powder so taking the powder straight it's usually not going to be very effective and that's a lot of times what they're using in gummy bears and Edda bear edibles they're just throwing islip powder in there and so it's usually not going to be very effective for most people but again the benefit is you can boost products CBD has no taste and some people may be allergic to for example to plant terpenes well there aren't going to be any plant terpenes in the isolate alright the fourth type is very new its distillate and distillate in a nutshell it's gonna be very similar to CBD isolate what they're doing is are isolating different cannabinoids and it's considered to be very pure just like the CBD ice looks very pure not having any of the other plant parts or terpenes CBD distillate is going to be basically like picking and choosing only these cannabinoids out of a hundred people are you know they might decide well I want CBD I want CBN and CBD but I don't want THC and I don't want CB air or whatever so it's it's kind of picking and choosing and isolating specific nutrients and putting it into the formula so there's pros and cons to that one of the pros to that again is you don't have the plant terpenes for people who might be allergic to plant terpenes the the cons would be that you don't have the plant terpenes which are super beneficial you don't have the plant terpene to are really important and you don't have all of the phytonutrients all of the flavonoids all of the nutrients that come along with the hemp extract alright so those are the four primary different types of CBD hemp oil that you can find make sure you watch my video on how to read the label so that you know what you're buying like I said if you're looking for full spectrum you want to make sure you're you know you're paying for what you get for and then broad spectrum remember that has no THC so it's a great second alternative option if you can't have THC CBD isolate would be lower on the list unless you know how to create a formula like we do in our vape pen or in our cat drops to create that entourage effect and then distillates fairly new i don't even know if there are any dislike products on the market at this point it's really experimental but that should cover everything and thanks for watching this if you have questions we'd love to have you join us on our Facebook group I'll have a link to that and you can also email us at support at foods that Helia calm we'd love to hear from you and

farm show and let me tell you it's made a tremendous difference in our dog we have a large dog he's a Bernese Mountain Dog lab mix we gave him the oil and his hips are just tremendous he doesn't ache when he jumps up he jumps on the couch again because of the stairs like lightning and it's amazing the difference he's a 7 year old dog 7 year old dog so he's not old dog he's not a young dog he's just a big dog it's tough submitted it made a difference this is a real testimonial do", "YGDgsLfiACk": "thank you so much last week I came over here stand here that bell works and I was telling you about my 13 year old shorty she she was very low fee that no energy she's gonna have a lot of trouble going up and down stairs and you told me to try to take charge this morning my wife says to me I really noticed a big difference with Zoey she's like four energies back she's more smart you know she's got wagging her tail and she's going up and down the stairs again so thank you so much", "hS8_a81ApiM": "CBD oil or cannabidiol has become the hottest rage getting a massive shot in the arm when President Trump signed the 2018 farm bill opening the door for hemp to take center stage as a new agricultural commodity in the United States no longer the controlled substance it had been since 1937 hemp is like a sister plant to marijuana without the THC that makes you high and people who use it for everything from epilepsy to depression insomnia and arthritis and other maladies swear by it but doesn't work and are their wrists tonight we dig deeper with the ABCs of CBD Carrie Prue is taking her daily dose of CBD oil for arthritis and her knees she was taking too much ibuprofen and decided to give CBD oil a try facing eye pain right after she takes hers she gives it to ten-year-old Stan Lee good boy come here who has discs and her pain is just put a drop of my finger and wasn't getting relief from his pain meds and muscle relaxers there we go and that's it carries regular vet suggested she contact dr. chris peyton at western veterinary clinic to see if he could bring Stanley more relief how's family doing good dr. Payton specializes in pain treatment through acupuncture laser therapy and CBD oil made from hemp Stanley I think first came to me in 2017 and he's kind of one of my neck dogs that come in they they're hanging their head down they're really painful they move you know just just slightly and they get a pinched nerve dr. Payton who has great faith decided to put Jesus's proverb physician heal thyself into use he decided he himself would be the first guinea pig if you will he wasn't going to give his furry patients anything he wouldn't try himself and as a marathon runner he had a lot of aches and pains he was taking ibuprofen for over-the-counter drugs that have their own side effects with the kidneys and liver I would tell you in the beginning I was a little skeptical just like before I went to animal chiropractic school I was a little skeptical he did his research even bringing in experts who manufacture high quality CBD oyel to speak with his patients and answer all their questions he added CBD oil to his routine and now takes much less ibuprofen I'm just one ml underneath the tongue for 30 seconds and then swallow it once a day and I've maybe taken ibuprofen twice in three months as opposed to taking it every day that's a big deal for me and he says it's a big deal for dogs like Stanley and the 40 other pets he has using it I haven't had any patients that have had any side effects or problems from the CBD oil that I use he admits it's not a magic bullet but says the oil he sells is pure and 85% of patients both two and four legged feel better here's how it works there are things called cannabinoid receptors located throughout the human body in the very simplest terms they affect physiological processes such as appetite perception of pain memory and your mood these cannabinoid receptors are referred to as cb1 and cb2 and they are activated by cannabidiol CBD found in the brain and central nervous system cb2 receptors are mostly in organs and cells associated with the immune system assistant professor at Indiana University School of Medicine South Bend dr. Jessie say ways in it's not marijuana there's a difference between a hemp plant and a marijuana plant why do you think it's getting so popular I think it's getting popular because it works so there's been a lot of studies to see if CBD oil works to help with anxiety sleep and pain and most of them are showing that it does work Kari says she's a believer for both herself and Stanley he just gets a couple drops it's just so you know a couple drops in the morning at breakfast a couple drops in the evening it's really easy he loves it it's just we're believers you know we've we're so glad that it's become popular because it's a great alternative therapy we have a lot of friends who have used it for their animals as well we have seen great results and yeah I would highly recommend it both dr. Payton and Peggy offer agreed with dr. sayz assessment that you need to do your research and make sure the CBD you are getting is pure and does not contain THC and it doesn't just come in a tincture to place drops under your tongue I see it being one of those things that's going to be up and coming for them and I think that's going to change a lot of people's lives I think it already has there are air traffic controllers that take it there are pilots that take it so we always start with the lowest dose no matter what we do whether it's tradition or non-traditional and while not yet ready to endorse it because it's not regulated doctors say believes that too will be changing the government is now beginning to recognize that there is a difference between CBD oil made from hemp and is making that legal as opposed to CBD oil made from marijuana which will have THC in it and hopefully with that they can start regulating it and making it more commonly used with regulation okay to make it safe and to know where it's coming from okay Kari says she's using much less ibuprofen for her arthritis and Stanley is weaning off his pain meds and is a much happier ten-year-old and we have seen wonderful results he has been a different dog for the past year so the next time you're out driving in the country you may be seeing more hemp growing in the fields a new commodity for farmers and perhaps a new treatment for what ails you the World Health Organization's statement on CBD oil is that it has little to no side effects but is with any supplement talk to your doctor before starting CBD oil governor Eric Holcomb signed a measure legalizing cannabis I'll however be sure to check the ingredients if it contains THC it cannot be more than 0.3 percent it's also helped animals and people going through cancer treatment by stimulating the appetite and reducing anxiety as for treatment for epilepsy many are still using CBD oil but the FDA recently approved the first cannabis based drug called epidemics it's not cheap and can run you over $1,000 a month and for those of you who are a drug tested at work as we are CBD will not show up in a drug test because hemp will not get you high for links to the CBD oil we featured and to read more on the ABCs of CBD we also have a link to PubMed which lists many studies", "FfbgsR6Ftrc": "hi what do they feed you Stevie this is a short video on what is full spectrum Syria you have to excuse me I'm wearing some kind of Mexican blanket cvd isn't just for summers it's now cold in our basement that's why we're filming so what it's full spectrum CVD you probably heard it a lot and it's sort of rigged about as the the CBD to go for full spectrum CBD means it's got the entire range of the terpenes and plant matter when you extract from the cannabis plant now there's a number of different ways you get your sous vide one of them is a isolate which is a four pounder format which is produced from a process called to cock-block slice your bobbin got it is that properly from co2 extraction it comes into a super concentrated powder so 99% but in the process of the sort of refining it means you literally have just CBD don't really have any terpenes now CBD as a product is is tapped to be something that's very beneficial so it's not going to hurt you by not having all the other bits and bobs involved but when you look at full spectrum see mini which can be a bit more expensive its producing it's like different matters distilled oil and in the process it doesn't lose all the other additional terpenes and plant matter so when you have a full spectrum CBD it means it's got a tiny amount of THC and that's why when you hear people say I need to have a bit of THC inside of which is the stuff that gets you high but fraction also doesn't really get your high about 0.2 percent is the legal level in the UK if it has that in there as well it means it hasn't been super filtered it means it has tons of other chemicals that can be of and information benefit anticonvulsant benefit matatini you going to depression auntie auntie so I asked many people what C meaning is so there you go that's full-spectrum CBD that means it's not being isolated down so when you get a bucket you're a distillate seat mini distillate but it might be about eighty percent which is generally where the full-spectrum stuff comes from it has a load of other additional potentially therapeutic benefits compounds inside it whereas ice alert is just CBD because that means it's better than CBD ice and that we don't really know CBD is touted to be the thing that we're all looking for so CBD in a high purity format CBD I so that it's probably perfectly adequate but if you do want the entourage effect that means the potential benefit of a extra compound that can have and see fatigue effects you're going to get that with the full spectrum CBD broad spectrum being the CBD that doesn't have THC in it whatsoever it's called non-detect and how they make broad spectrum CBD compared to full spectrum is they just built it out very aggressively really angry they just filter out that takes the THC out of it but it can take out a few other elements as well so it might have a few less compounds than full spectrum there you go full spectrum broad spectrum my Mexican blanket showing them more space tada you", "QH1GEuMw8Dc": "hey this is jeremy orozco and today we are going to go on a magical journey to see if varritus farms is real faritas means truth in latin as all of us remember from latin classes during boarding school or if you didn't go to public school in the united states like me maybe you know some latin well veritas we are gonna see the truth about your cbd farm i sent veritas farms to two independent labs to see if it's real how about the product paid for the lab test you're welcome i do use affiliate links on my website disclosure but if you look at my reviews i give some of the most critical honest cbd reviews on the internet and that's because i'm really bad at business and i would rather give you the truth veritas also known as the roman goddess of truth okay let's see the lab test the price breakdown taste test strength and the good the bad and the ugly on veritas farms subscribe because uh i have more coming and you don't want to miss out on this first problem is they claim 500 milligrams but they only say full spectrum hemp and we don't know if it's milligrams of cannabinoids or cbd who are you for a truth goddess we're off to a rough start what did the labs find both labs found that they are real b scores they give a little bit more cannabinoids than suggested links below to this page to see the official lab test dive into this now they are extremely accurate if you go by cbd 500 milligrams of cbd and they are right on the money within three percent accuracy very accurate and it's full spectrum with a good amount of other cannabinoids i used to berate cbd companies for not claiming cbd amounts specific amounts but now every market place is forcing these companies to be vague and not mention the actual words cbd or cannabinoids so i guess they're okay 10 cents per milligram it's good for a fancy little farm in colorado i should note that there is no discount as you go for the bigger bottles the price per milligram stays the same so there's not much point in that there are a lot of cbd companies charging over 15 cents per milligram so 10 cents is okay you can get cbd for as low as 2 cents per milligram but just pretend i didn't say that if you like this brand the taste was excellent one of the best i've tried and i tried the watermelon it kind of tastes like between a watermelon jolly rancher or maybe a watermelon bubble gum sweet but not too sweet and no harsh taste of hemp it's amazing how far cbd companies have come they also make a peppermint which would appeal to more people and non-flavored i think i'd go for the peppermint because i'm not the candy watermelon guy but it does taste great if you're into that sort of thing i don't judge the strength 17 milligrams is a good starting point 0.6 milligrams of thc won't have side effects for most people i would say but may provide some additional benefits to the cbd see the entourage effect for that i would go as far as to say that you can take this and still jump over a moving vehicle if that's your hobby without delayed reactions from thc but always check with your your doctor first before jumping over moving vehicles while using cbd with thc just remember i said that when you end up in the hospital specifically so you don't sue me i have a disclaimer this is a full spectrum and has good amounts of cbc and cbg it actually has more cbg than the majority of full spectrums that i test that's pretty good i know a lot of people want to know how i feel from cbd from this cbd personally but you should never pay attention too much attention to the experience of just one person and a cbd product the effect of cbd and other cannabinoids is very very individualized on your endocannabinoid system and it can be very misleading to listen to one person so i focus on the actual data the lab test so you can find one you like and actually know what's in it veritas farms is a real farm small farm in colorado they have 140 acres they focus on sustainable farming and avoid pesticides surprisingly this little farm made it into major retailers like kroger and cvs nationwide from what i've seen this adds a lot of credibility to a cbd company and it's much more likely that they'll test well and that's what my lab tests have confirmed i didn't find anything concerning about veritas a plus better business bureau score with no negative reports in my in-depth internet search overall i think this is great for new cbd users occasional users gifs this would be a fantastic gift and i promise you that this is going to taste better than 90 percent of cbd companies out there this looks like something you would get at a spa it has a professional luxury look that still says hey i'm a natural little farm here but i keep my barn clean clean packaging and logo small farms are great because they have full control over their products the consistency the same strain and cannabinoids they're not just buying cheap cbd from thousands of different farms growing with questionable methods and pesticides and whatnot if you met some cannabis farmers you know what i'm talking about they are not however going to compete with the giant companies they can offer super super cheap cbd if you didn't know hemp is becoming very cheap right now so a lot of small farms like this one are struggling so if you want to support a small business and get a luxury cbd product for you or a great gift i think this is great they also make gummies capsules topicals skin care and cbd for pets that is it check the links below for more info i will see you next time", "jpN4L0EVD3k": "over my years

products a lot of people are asking how cbd oil is made and i'm out here in our certified organic hemp field to share this process with you from farm to label so here's what we do these plants that i'm standing in front of and standing behind these are usda certified organic hemp we're going to take the flowers off of this plant separate the flowers from the rest of the plant and we're going to extract the cbd oil out of those flowers with a certified organic sugarcane ethanol we're going to take that that that extract once the ethanol is evaporated out and we're going to blend that with an organic mct coconut oil to make our final product the cornbread hemp certified organic whole flour cbd oil now for our distilled cbd oil we take that another step further after we do the first pass of the extraction with the certified organic sugarcane ethanol we either then do a distillation process that purifies that extract into a honey golden color and makes a much more concentrated product that's also much more pure but still full spectrum to give you the benefits of the full spectrum cannabinoid profile without the earthy hempy taste so that's us at cornbread hemp and that's how you make cbd oil you", "fet6IdXuJH0": "hello and welcome back to another video from the dingo ate my vape the last video you saw me do would have been the CBD gummy review from C with the FX um I reached out to this company see buddy new new leaf Naturals has a large variety of see woody products the product that I'm going to be reviewing today is the 240 milligram kind of cannibal oil it is point 17 and fluid ounces also 5 milliliters as you can see it comes in small L bottle has a dropper like mostly buddy bottles do and has the serving size on the back with the recommended serving which if you can see it says that it's about ten drops and there's ten servings I don't know if that's going to focus in there you go so besides ten drops servings per bottle approximately ten when I did test a full a full squeezed drop dropper has about jobs in it one nice thing about the dropper in this is unlike most shoppers it has the nice little glass almost like a Prince Rupert's drop on it now from first opening it one thing I will say is it definitely smells more fragrant than a lot of the CVD oils I've had smells similar to marijuana but there's you oh the absolute bare minimum oh it's all natural with no additives or preservatives made from non-gmo hemp plants going on slight funds within Colorado where the company is based out of it's a hundred percent organic no herbicides pesticides or chemical fertilizers were used and this this one is legal with in all 50 states of the US and over 40 countries worldwide a the cotton the product is concentrated to approximately 50 milligram cannabinoids per milliliter of oil so one drop of this is about two point four milligrams of CBD and there's roughly a hundred drops within the bottle what a lot of people tend to do with this oil is drop it under the tongue and usually hold it there for anywhere between 30 to 90 seconds I'm going to give it a shot to put a lot of people say that it can happen within 10 minutes other people say they feel the effects within the hour um you could also mix this within lotion and it's you could also use it as an acne treatment it's been known to help with that again if you didn't watch my last video I have a lot of twitches in my shoulder and legs so I've been using see woody products to combat combat that and the CBD gummies worked well I started they lose the they started losing their effects kind of quicker than I was hoping so I decided to reach out to new leaf to see if they want to collaborate with me and they sent me this tester bottle which is one of the ones they sell on the website so I told them I'd give it a try give a review of it and let my viewers know what I think of it so go ahead and give it a try I've not tried this yet so I'm not sure what to expect flavor-wise I know some CD can be very bitter five six seven I saw ya I said a full dropper usually holds anywhere between 25 to 30 drops I took I'm gonna do 15 drops worth so roughly 15 drops so probably about half a dropper I'm gonna say is a anywhere between 10 to 15 drops and I'll see how it goes so it's gonna be quiet for the next 30 seconds so enjoy the background you you all right I kept it there for about 30 seconds again it doesn't have much of a taste to it I want to say it's an earthy flavor but it it tastes like it smells not as potent but there's a little bit of a taste to it has a has an oily texture to it like I can feel it on my lips it's similar to olive oil I would put it at oh yeah the taste is in bed the price for the product isn't terrible either this one retails on the website for this exact bottle retails for thirty eight thousand fifty cents there's over six thousand reviews of it and instead of Fawna half stove four and a half out of 5 star rating so a lot of positive comments on it and yeah I'm hoping that this works a lot better than the gummies did when I weigh I am the dingo ate my vape my twitch name my twitch our TV name is the dingo ate my baby with the number 8 my YouTube is also the dingo ate my baby you could find my gaming videos on there this is the channel it's gonna be dedicated to CBD reviews vapor views I'm looking to do babe juices mods

smoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today I'm going to be looking at this organic hemp paste by holistic Highland hemp this stuff is full spectrum it is grown with organic certified hemp in the EU and we're gonna take a look at it right here on the I smoke channel let's get into it big up to holistic Highland hemp there is a discount code on their website you can use a discount code I smoked 10 for 10% off any of their products on site they have sent me this organic hemp paste to take a look at on the channel this is a 15% CBD 3 gram tube of hemp CBD cannabis extract contains 450 milligrams of CBD it is a product of the EU is a food supplement and on the pack on the syringe here it says recommended use 100 milligrams to 300 milligrams of extract one to three times daily place under your tongue hold then swallow active ingredients CBD cannabidiol per serving 15 to 45 milligrams and ingredients cannabis sativa extract that is the information listed on this product I really liked the branding of the holistic Highland hemp stuff it's got a nice clean look to it the plastic syringe makes it super accessible actually really easy to squeeze the CBD paste out of this they've gone for a standard dose that is about one to three grains of rice because if you squeeze a grain of rice out of this tube not an actual grain of rice a grain of rice size then it will be between 85 and 100 milligrams of the paste at 100 milligrams of the paste which would mean one thirtieth of this total content you will receive 15 milligrams of CBD which for me would be a good standard daily dose so for me taking a grain of rice a day is going to be in enough obviously you're different your body is different your endocannabinoids system is different make sure you do your research on how much CBD you want to be taken all right this stuff is not addictive it's not dangerous it's not psychoactive in the way that THC is but it does certainly make you feel good and therefore there's kind of an exploratory phase for people when they're trying CBD this product is I would argue quite a medicinal product is not marketed as a medicinal product it's a food supplement but the pace that is in here catches the full spectrum from the cannabis plant so legally CBD companies can't advertise medical benefits but that does not mean that there are not medical benefits and in fact they can come from the cannabinoids they can also achieve synergy with the terpene profile as well and that is something I wanted to talk to you about with the CBD paste from holistic Highland hemp here I've got a Turk profile from it their lab report that basically tells me that as well as the korilla Fein oxide which you will see in other CBD extract products this actually has some beta-carotene again you'll see that another CBD products beta pinning and myrrh seen as well and alpha-pinene as well so that is stuff that you may not find in the Turk profiles of other EU hemp you know it's varies but these Terps particularly the mersin has a potential synergy effect with THC we know that mangos can get you more high if you eat mangoes before smoking and that is to do with this energy of the beet immersing so the fact that that is that terpene is in this paste is a really interesting thing indeed it's got a different Turk profile you don't taste it it doesn't taste any more like weed still got a CBD paste taste to it which is a little bit spicy maybe like nutty or kind of funny because I'm allergic to nuts not actually nothing but that kind of like health food esque kind of flavor that feels your mouth is what it tastes like what I want to do is I want to try some of this CBD paste we're gonna get a grain of rice sized amount and put it onto my finger like so and this goes under my tongue and I hold it as the instructions said and then swallow what I like to do when I'm consuming CBD paste is have a hot drink at hand because it allows you to really just just eat it and then be done with the flavor fairly quickly it's not needed it's just not a sweet flavor so some people get on with it better than others I've got my smooth smoker Thanks aren't your mug here let's try this CBD paste just before I do I want to say that this has got a slightly lighter consistency than some of the other CBD pastes that I have seen on the market looks more similar to the RS oh let's see how it treats me geez that's now under my tongue now what am i what am i tasting as that's in my mouth so it's under my tongue so I'm not actually consciously focused on tasting it yet but I can notice a sort of bitterness that is creeping up from the CBD paste it's not overpowering but it is there and if you leave it and swallow it without a drink sometimes you get a bit of a a warmth or a tingle sort of going down for me that hits me about here and it just kind of tastes like CBD paste you know it's no different to the other CBD Payson oils flavor that have been protesting comes straight from there the hemp plant so I'm gonna follow up now with a drink the longer you leave it under your tongue the faster its gonna get into your bloodstream but if you just swallow it with a drink it will still get into your body as well it's just two different consumption methods pure ingestion versus under the tongue which has a specific name which I'm going to flash up on a screen right about now let's have a drink and finish this CBD paste from in my mouth and that is all it typed and in fact I've found that this blame box although bitter on its own works surprisingly well when you consume it along with something sweet so for me that would be like I've digestive biscuit even something like a banana if you have a bit of CBD paste on a banana it's nice it just picks the banana taste a bit like MP we do quite a nice flavour so yeah it's a nice product but flavor is not what its gonna lead on so just don't buy it thinking is gonna taste amazing because it is still CBD paste right if flavour is your crux and you need your CBD products to taste good holistic Highland hemp have got a couple of products that might be of interest they do a honey which is infused with 250 milligrams of CBD and that allows you to get your CBD on a spoon for the honey you could have that on toast they also do a CVD chocolate which has got 25 milligrams of CBD in but if you've just fancied a sweet treat to get your CBD it would work well in fact the synergy between the cocoa or the chocolate and the CBD seems to suggest that it is making helping the CBD be absorbed faster or more efficiently in the body how cool is that if you don't quite want the free gram tube and you just want to try it out it also comes in a 1 gram tube on site that is half the price of the 3 gram tube so maybe worth just getting the free gram tube with free delivery but you can try it in a smaller sample size as well and this tube will cost you 25 pounds on site with free delivery for the 3 gram CBD paste tube now you can use the discount code I smoked 10 that will get you 10% off everything on site including the chocolate including the honey as well son where do I see myself using this paste actually as I mentioned already I see it as quite a medical product so I'm gonna be using this on a preventative basis daily under my tongue I'll also use it with my pets when mainly cannabidiol this is the sort of product that I know is gonna be good for them because it's got that full spectrum it's got nothing else added in it purely comes from cannabis plants and all mammals have an endocannabinoid system it's gonna be it from me and the organic hemp paste big up to holistic Highland hemp once again I'll write something on the ice mote website to go along with this that you can get even more detail about this product and let me know what CVD products you're taking in the comments how do you get your CBD leave them below also please

Lazarus Naturals to a lab to see if it's real now Lazarus isn't the biggest CBD company but if you go online into any CBD a community like go and reddit you would think that this is the most popular brand why well I bought this bottle of 750 milligrams of CBD for only $32 that's extremely cheap but is it too good to be true let's see the lab results they claim 750 milligrams of CBD and we found 794 milligrams of CBD or 5.8 percent no it's an accuracy it's excellent look at all those other cannabinoids 905 milligrams of total cannabinoids Wow we'll break that down THC 30 milligrams of CBC and 37 milligrams of CBG you guys know I'm a fan of Bluebird botanicals this blows them out the water with the CBG it's more than anything I've tested that's so much CBC - right I was really surprised by this one the CBC and CBG those are the cannabinoids and Charlotte's Web they might be the secret sauce to that very popular brand and I think it might have something to do with all the positive research and positive reviews for that strain and the various conditions possibly people like it the official lab test is here it's just one test and I don't claim the law test this way but it's completely independent and I promise you that I have nothing to do with this company or currently any CBD company the price for sense flat per milligram of CBD if you look at all my tests 15 cents is about average 4 cents is the cheapest out of all of them I tested not only that it goes down to 3 point 5 cents per milligram of total cannabinoids not only that you buy the larger bottles of CBD that they offer and the price per milligram of CBD drops to 3 Sen do you know what this mean not only that I sound like a damn commercial right now but you guys can see my industry report I've got the reports for everything I review they offer veterans disabled and low-income individuals up to 60% off who qualifies of course I don't I don't think they give every single person that discount Wow a little hard never but I really do appreciate they do this for people in need and they've got to be losing money doing this but the the regular price is insane - it's just it's it's cheap ingredients just hemp hemp seed oil and coconut oil beautiful I would be a little disappointed if they added sugar whatever other weird ingredients CBD companies tend to put in their oils this is the milliliter breakdown for dose I would caution this is this is potent you don't want a full dose of this your first go around look at the THC two milligrams of THC that's a lot research shows that high effects can start at two milligrams and sensitive individuals is you high and obviously it's enough to risk a failed drug test some people start off at five milligrams of CBD this is a 50 milligram dose just be aware of what you get into Wow welcome to the 700 club kid Lazarus is a company out of Seattle they've been around since 2014 and remember CBD just became legal at the end of 2018 so they're kind of like vets in this industry let me get the bat out of the way I did find one negative investigation by NBC that found Lazarus natural product had a high levels of lead however just looking at the product in this news piece I was like does that look like Lazarus Naturals label not really it looked like the label was printed on a home computer and deteriorating it didn't look like what I bought they bought it off of Groupon never do that Lazarus came out later and said that the product they tested was counterfeit which is actually a big one group on now I report everything that I find to be transparent but I think NBC's report was just negligent why would you buy something on Groupon and then publish those results but it should caution you that there are lots of fake CBD products out there and you need to buy from legitimate retailers I also don't like that they sell on Amazon because you need to be sneaky and say that you're just hemp oil basically to hide the fact that your product has CBD but the biggest companies are now doing this so what are you gonna do the good nbc6 investigators tested Lazarus and found that they were one of the only companies they tested to have accurate amounts of CBD Wow now you have my tests my independent tests and theirs to confirm its accurate which is good it's good to have multiple sources that's it that's the review this is the cheapest it has the most CBD cbc CBG they're good to vets and low-income people hit that subscribe button and i'll see you next time", "__Ixk9CFEcc": "at Q Sciences we're all about using natural

burning questions today in this video and hopefully by the end of watching it you will really have a clear idea what full spectrum cbt oil is and why you should be choosing it and when so my name is nadia and i'm the founder of vicario cbd and i'm a holistic nutritionist specializing in cbd oils first and foremost what is the difference between full spectrum and cbd isolate it's quite self-descriptive but cannabis has over 130 different cannabinoids and by the way hemp is cannabis um it's just a type of cannabis and there's over 130 different cannabinoids cbd and thc being the two most popular and prevalent ones but there's a you know over a hundred different ones so when we talk about cbd cbd is one cannabinoid it's an extra they extract that cbd and it usually looks like powder so cbd is isolate is usually just powder versus cbd full spectrum it's exactly what it means it means it's a bunch of different cannabinoids um so cbd still being the main one 95 percent off full spectrum cbd would be cbt but there's also cannabinoids like cbdn cbg and a little bit of thc so cbd isolate would have 0.00 dhc however cbd full spectrum will have a little bit of thc it is usually a very small amount um less than 0.3 by dry weight um that is kind of like the legal um requirements but sometimes it's even less than like significantly less than that it will depend on your full spectrum cbd so uh if you're really worried about thc uh whether you are just taking cbd for the first time um like myself when i started with cbd i really didn't want to have any thc in it because i'm so afraid to get high so because i take it monday morning and i don't want to have teachers in it then go for cbd i sell it however if you don't mind a little bit of thc if you're like smoked weed a lot of times and you're like i really don't mind i'm not scared of it i'm not afraid of it um then that amount of thc isn't really significant enough to you know to get you high that being said um we still most of our oils at aquarium are cbd isolates um thea with cbd isolate being our most popular one um you can get it by following the link in the bio and using the code youtube um it has no flavor it's made with mct coconut oil and cbt isolate and that's it it has 0.0 thc so there will be nothing to worry about and most of our products still contain just cbt isolate however there are benefits to full spectrum obviously there is a whole concept of full spectrum cbd oil having an entourage effect that cvt isolate doesn't have so what is entourage effect entourage effect is when cannabinoids are working together um and so thc will help will it will make sometimes cbd stronger if it's in a right proportion so in full spectrum it is the case so um when it when we're talking about cbd qualities like anti-inflammatory or analgesic or um that it will help you sleep thc and other cannabinoids can really boost the function of the effectiveness of cbd itself so that is what a rush effect is so is full spectrum cbd oil better than cbd isolate well it really depends everybody is very different so you have to make your own decision there is no better or worse cbd isolate doesn't have thc in it so if you are worried about thc whether it's a drug test or just your own personal reasons then it's just stick to cbd isolate however if you're not worried about the liberty of thc full spectrum might be for you full spectrum because of in entourage effect can be better for pain management because um it will be stronger anti-inflammatory and stronger analgesic so whether it's arthritis whether it's headaches back ache or whatever that is cbd full spectrum can be better might be better and another one is sleeping noise insomnia cbd full spectrum cbdo can be more effective in um in case of insomnia and actually falling asleep and relaxing that being said i have had um some customers um report to me that they feel sleepier from full spectrum cbd than cbd or isolate and in that case you don't want to be taking it monday morning right um so let's say you're taking cbd oil monday morning you're taking it for stress you're taking it making sure that your energy levels are stable throughout the day um you don't have pain or sleep problems um then we i recommend sticking with cbd isolate just because thc can make you a little bit more relaxed um to compare it to just pure cbd as i'm saying all of this i just want you to keep in mind that we're all very different and we will all have a very different effect personally speaking if you ask me i will tell you that i don't feel the difference between full spectrum and isolate but that's just me some people feel huge difference and some people love full spectrum and some people love isolate so i don't think there's a right or wrong reason full spectrum is definitely gaining popularity um and we do have our full spectrum that you can also get in by following the link in the bio we ship in u.s and canada you can use the code youtube to get 10 off however i i will insist on saying that there is no better or worse just because it will depend on your lifestyle if um you feel like you're burnt out and you're really tired and you need you know three coffees to stay awake in the day um cb the full spectrum cbd oil might really like make you even more make might make you more relaxed and in that sense um it's a good thing like cbd will help you get over the adrenal fatigue and like will force you to rest so it's not a bad thing however you probably don't want that effect on monday morning and that being said if you are struggling with pain then i would go for cpg full spectrum another question i could commonly ask is whether they taste differently full spectrum versus isolate and yes they do full spectrum does have a little bit of a more like weed taste versus isolate um in a regular concentration doesn't taste like anything and if it's a high concentration it might taste a little bit better but full spectrum almost always has that tiny bit of a weed taste and smell no matter the concentration is so just keep that in mind so i hope you see how both full spectrum and isolate have a time and a place in our day i do highly recommend you trying both and seeing what which one works for you um comment below with which one worked for you better and if you see the difference and if you don't also let us know make sure to subscribe to our channel and i hope to see you in the next video", "Ju-M1VNL2ME": "a CVD for dogs and cats currently it's all the rage but here are the seven things that you should know before you start giving CBD to your dog or cat [Music] hello welcome back to my channel if you're new welcome I'm having an upcoming webinar called what you need to know about CBD for dogs and cats you can click the link in the box below for more information the CBD II it stands for cannabidiol it is the largest component of the hemp plant and it's the non psychoactive component before you start giving this to your pooch or your kitty cat there's a number of things you should be aware of first you know what's the source do you really know where those plants have come from you know is it a company that had actually growing their own plants are they just you know outsourcing it getting it from the cheapest available seller they may say it's organic but how do you really know so what you want to look for is verified third-party testing and that they're using a thing called green extraction methods you want to make sure that the using co2 to break down you know there's green plant leafy material to then extract that essential oil companies are they're cutting corners will you'd solvent such as acetone and residues of those solvents can then still be in the CBD oil and they themselves can be carcinogenic summer even neurotoxins the point one his third-party testing [Music] a second if you're going to be giving CBD oil to your dog your cat you want to make sure that's a whole plant extract think about it like taking vitamin C and is it more nutritious take a vitamin C tablet or eat an orange clearly is eating the orange of which I will proceed to do now maybe kill the orange summer break there are no native crazy combos this is based on a principle called the entourage effect you've got over a hundred and different separate ingredients within the canvas plant and those can all interact with each other in a very positive way going so much further in terms of promoting health and wellness that in your dog or cat versus the Dyke just singly isolating a single part a single compound and expecting that to do the same thing so if you're not clear just think orange better versus tablet not so good accurate dosing and this is one of my pet peeves I've actually treated a number of animals with cannabidiol also with THC but anytime I'm using one of these liquid tinctures it has been so difficult to get an accurate dose so you want to look for companies which are using like a medical grade tincture bottle where one drop can be carefully measured and is accurate so as you can see here with this think to your bottle my actually CBD tincture bottle one drop is one drop and you can clearly give the exact amount [Music] for what is the carrier oil so what that means is CBD comes are very concentrated from the hemp plant and a thing called the carrier oil is then added in to help with dilution also help to preserve it and make it easier for you to dose it adequately to your dog or cat most people are using this mzt oil there's a couple problems with that first of all many animals as with many people can get stomach upset from MCT oil last thing you want to have is be dosing your dog or can they're having vomiting vomiting and/or diarrhea secondly you're also asking the body to them metabolize it completely different oil from a completely different plant so if you're gonna have the you know the best benefit from using CBD cannabidiol you want it to also come from the hemp plant so in my opinion the ideal carrier oil this is hemp seed oil v can there be any drug interactions it's a great question most the sites you're gonna read on the internet safe on there's zero interaction but that being said cannabidiol is metabolized in the liver by an enzyme called cytochrome p450 and many of the veterinary drugs that your dog or cat may be on are also metabolized by that same enzyme but fortunately most dogs and cats that are on CBD they're on a low enough dose that there should not be any significant interactions so if you're dosing your dog or cat this suggests the dose of about one milligram per 10 pounds of body weight in all likelihood there won't be any significant interactions but there can be so always talk to your veterinarian before you're gonna start on CBD so if your dog or cat is in on any other veterinary medications two most common veterinary drugs that use the same enzyme the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs metagame REM Adele etc along at the corticosteroids you know such as prednisone so if your pet is on either one of those meds and there's other ones just like heart medications etc you can discuss this with your veterinarian what's the best way to be giving CBD cannabidiol to your dogs or cats it edibles you know you just squirt it into the mouth we're on a bitter there food just encourage them to eat it a CBD in an oil form is best absorbed just on your pets comes or just underneath the tongue because ideally what we want to do is bypass the stomach get higher blood levels also make it easy to give to your dog or cat you guys how easy it is to give tutuila her dose is actually one drop twice a day so she's on it support one drop is two point four milligrams I'm gonna put it on my finger and I'm just gonna rub it on your gums good girl cuz then you're gonna absorb more of that and it's gonna get into your bloodstream quicker making you feel a little bit better there okay - laughs you love the hemp seed oil you over the CBD oil you feel like their little Rastafarians nelson dog don't you good girl yes [Music] point number seven does it allow for topical absorption Murray here's a great example many cats are really difficult to get anything into their mouths or orally especially in an ongoing basis there's some research showing that CBD to be beneficial for animals with diabetes Marv he's been getting a drop a day so not only can I just put it orally put a drop of my finger and I can put this Murray you stick around and get a cap and a drop in here either I'll show him how easy it is just to put it in transdermally okay and because this CBD is decarboxylated there Murray I didn't have to put anything into your mouth well thank you guys so much for watching this edition of venery secrets I really encourage you to sign up for my upcoming webinar and cvd for dogs and cats you've yet to do so you can click that link in the box below", "ArovQOERHRA": "hey guys so I'm here to review a newer product to my schedule that I've been doing every single day for a few weeks now and it is the CBD FX CBD oil so I already have it out of the bottle here and we're out of the box I have really have been enjoying this I've been thinking about trying CBD oil for a while now just because of all the amazing benefits that it has for me specifically I wanted to try CBD because I have anxiety so I wanted to try it for the anti anxiety anxiety benefits as well as the pain relief benefits I do have a little bit of lower back pain so I've noticed that I will take this instead of if I feel the need to take like an ibuprofen or something like that I've been taking CBD instead and it has relieved my pain just as much as the over-the-counter stuff would have so I'm really enjoying it for that and other than that I don't suffer from too much chronic pain but I am just a very like tense person my shoulders and my back is always super tense for some reason I don't know it's just my nature and I've honestly noticed the difference when I take this I just feel just more relaxed it doesn't have its antipsychotic so there's no like hallucinations or psychotic effects at all with CBD it is just a compound of cannabis and it's actually one of sixty compounds in cannabis that belonged to the cannabinoid family so it is a cannabinoid and this one specifically I got is the 500 series this is the 500 milligrams and it's a 30 milliliter bottle so every dropper I use a full dropper and every dropper I think has like 16 a little over 6 ten milligrams of CBD in it and for me just starting off I've noticed that that is a good amount I don't know that I would need any more and any less I'm not sure but the 500 was kind of in the middle so that's the one that I got and it's been working for me so I'm really enjoying it other things that CBD is commonly used for is to help with sleep I know some people have a hard time either getting to sleep or staying asleep and I have a couple friends that actually use this for sleep they use it before bedtime to to kind of relax and get to sleep I've just been taking it kind of as needed each day in the middle of the day in the morning whenever I feel like my back or my shoulders really need it or if I have anxiety that's when I take it and I notice the difference for myself other uses or benefits I guess you could say for CBD is to help relieve nausea so it could may help give a little bit of relief with that and then again it has no psychotic effects so it doesn't make you feel high or like I guess I don't know paranoid if you could say because it is a hemp product and that was like one of my I guess you could say hesitations like I new CBD was good I know that it has amazing benefits but since I've never taken it before I just didn't know what to expect and I honestly I don't feel any of that so CBD has been good for me in the past few weeks I've really liked this brand CBD FX I did my research before choosing a brand and this is the one that I decided to get I love their website they have tons of information for new CBD users and other great products as well I've actually used a couple of their other products as well the lotion the CBD lotion is really really great I like using it on my shoulders and then they actually make CBD capsules so you don't have to use the tincture so mine that I have I'll just show you like it's Dropper this is my second model here so it's a dropper and you would just put it under your tongue how it's recommended to take is just dropping it under your tongue and letting it sit there for at least a minute before either swallowing or just going about like normal but they also make capsules so you can take it in a capsule if you prefer it's a little easier I would think so I'm gonna get those next and yeah I've just been really liking it so I wanted to share with you guys I am a new CBD user and it's given me relief at least for my attention my anxiety and my minor pain so if you guys have any questions just let me know I'll link this product and the company below so you guys can find out all the information you need and then again if you have any questions just let me know but here it is again I wanted to share and let me know if you have any questions see you guys", "QXeLtgI0fRw": "I've had about 10 years or more actually worth of anxiety and it sucks it really sucks on my channel I talk a lot about different strategies that I've utilized and that they utilize with my clients on how to naturally reduce and get rid of your anxiety one of them I want to talk about today is simple or CBD and it's something that I've been using for about a year today I'm gonna be sharing my whole experience with CBD / hemp oil over the past year so you know what to expect and you can decide if you want to use it for your anxiety - my name is autumn and I'm a certified clinical nutritionist with a very extensive history of anxiety I say it in a laughing matter right now like I'm smiling while talking about it but it's actually been pretty debilitating over the past more than ten years at this point now and honestly I think I've always suffered from some sort of anxiety and I don't like to say I'm an anxious person because as I've known now I'm able to successfully reduce it and even some days totally get rid of it but rather I have experienced anxiety from a really young age and unfortunately I think it's something that we're dealing with more and more often now which I'm going to be coming out with a video seen on that perfect storm on how it's not just one thing that causes anxiety and how we aren't just born anxious but there are ways to actually reduce it and there are things that are causing it but for right now I'm sharing my whole experience for the past year with just CBD oil period okay so basically what CVD / hemp oil does is it works on decreasing your sympathetic response so in our body we have these two responses it's either parasympathetic which is that rest and restore type of mode and then there's sympathetic and that's like fight-or-flight mode and something that I think people don't realize about fight-or-flight mode is that you don't necessarily have to be emotionally stressed in order to be in that fight-or-flight mode like most people would be like I don't know like I'm good I'm not stressed or I'm not experiencing stress okay but there's still chemical and physical stressors though what about too much exercise or too little sleep or maybe pollution or toxins in your environment there's a lot of things that cause our body to be in a stress State even eating too often which I talked about with this video and most people do - our environment our food choices all of these factors tend to be stuck in the sympathetic state which means up you're in fight or flight mode so what happens when you're in this sympathetic state it makes it so that your body actually shuts off blood flow to your GI tract and your fertility organs and instead shuttle's it to your muscles and your brain in your heart because those are what your body thinks it means to get out of like that fast quick scary situation and that's what results in us feeling anxious so in order to truly heal you need to switch your body from that sympathetic mode and get it into parasympathetic rest and restore mode that'll help to shuttle that blood flow back to your GI tract back to your fertility organs in fact if you do suffer from any issues with your GI tract or even your fertility organs and this is something you definitely need to be listening to so that's why I tried him well I did a lot of things in the past year to really help with decreasing my anxiety not saying this is a cure-all but I do want to share my experience with hemp oil for the past year and if you're interested in the other things I did in addition to hemp oil to help heal my anxiety just let me know in the comments below and I'll make a video about that so I said I made a lot of changes progressively over time one of them being switching from walking to running which talked about in this video and this was just one of the changes I made so first thing you need to know CBD oil or hemp oil is not going to get you high unless you're using one with a THC base you're not going to get high with hemp oil I know that's a concern for a lot of people but don't worry about it with it just make sure that you're getting it from a reputable source this is the brand I use and there are a lot of bad products out there it is a booming industry I believe I just read a stat but it's a billion-dollar industry right now and its projected to be like a twenty five billion dollar industry by 2022 that just shows you how many of us are stressed out the way that you use hemp oil or at least this specific one because there are different types you can use it's a pump so it's like a spray bottle though the serving size is four pumps now I about actually I've been using it yeah for about a year uh no longer than that and about a year and a half actually anyway so about a you're gonna have maybe even two years ago can't really quite remember my anxiety was so bad I was in a bad place I was in a very stressful work environment I was not sleeping I was working out too much there's so many factors going on that just made me an anxious rep my self-esteem was really low my confidence was really low I always was feeling bloated from that lack of blood flow that was going to my GI tract I just wasn't feeling good it was terrible it was awful I needed you something about it that's when I was making all those other changes as well and that's also when I introduced hemp oil so at that time I was using a lot more than they like recommended dosage or hemp oil because I was so stressed I needed something to help bring myself back to that parasite heresy but that I state right then but also know this is not to be used as a crutch in a cure-all is there something that's helpful but any I was using four pumps in the morning and either two or three pumps at night depending on how stressed I was that I which is a lot and then I would even sometimes he's at the middle of the day if I was just like freaking out and it did help and here's here's the thing that I want people to know it's not that it's like xanax or something although I've ever actually taken him so I don't really know what it feels like but from what I understand medications for anxiety make it so that it dulls your responses this doesn't dull your response you're still very sharp mentally what it does is it helps to bring you basically from up here on your sympathetic mode so just a little lower and that makes it so that your body is able to actually handle stressors better instead of like you know you come across something that your boss yells at you about some project that you did wrong or something I don't know and instead of just reacting and responding and freaking out you're able to handle that stress a lot better and that's really beneficial for anxiety so that's what is doing and in the beginning I was using a lot more and it was helping for that time being but I was also working on a lot of other factors helped me to heal my anxiety like I said walking not over exercising changing up my diet all these things that really helped all together to heal my anxiety because there isn't just one thing that heals anxiety you need all of these factors but this really helps the process showed you like the back part they see really helps me process so then as I was working on myself after I had quit running cold turkey for like six months and was doing a lot of walking instead after I made a lot of changes in my life that just made me happier in general my anxiety eventually got a lot lower now a year or a year and a half later I'm only using this at night and I'm only using two pumps at night so my sympathetic state is a lot lower now from all these changes I've made and this is actually something that I worked with a lot of my clients on is having these steps to actually heal your anxiety and you can check out one of my client stories right here about that but it's awesome because now I'm just down to two I feel a lot better I don't have to rely on this really to feel good and I just use it for the positive benefits now that come with CBD oil and there are a lot of benefits from CBDs which mind you there's actually a lot of food that has CBD as well you don't necessarily need to have CBD oil there are a lot of foods too but you can get the oil as well if you want supplement or if you do suffer from anxiety and you're working on yourself in the process there's two things that I've learned from this that I want to make sure that you know first of all don't use this as a crutch like I said you're not going to heal your anxiety with just CBDs will help but you're not going to heal your anxiety unless you do everything else - and number two is if you are looking for the benefits make sure that you're using it daily it's not like you know an aspirin or a medication where you just pop a pill and it has immediate effects this should be seen more as a supplement where you get the benefits from daily usage rather than just using it whenever you feel like it no one question I get is will I ever stop using it I'm not really sure but for right now I'm going to continue using it because it does have a lot of benefits since we do live in such an environment where we are constantly stimulated we're constantly in a spider flight mode I see a lot of benefit of having CBD oil as well as you know along with everything else that helps bring us back to a parasympathetic state like meditation and getting great sleep and being with loved ones all of these things together are really helpful for our help in our mental state - and there's no science to back this up yet but I'm speculating that this also could help some people with fertility issues because remember I mentioned when you're in that sympathetic fight-or-flight mode your body shuts off blood flow from your GI tract and your fertility Oregon so it's not getting the nutrients it needs in order to thrive and in order to support having a child so by switching your body from not sympathetic to parasympathetic so from the fight-or-flight to the rest and repair that could help with fertility issues - no science on that yeah but I'm speculating there guys if you want to check out more about my anti-anxiety morning routine and something I do every day to prevent anxiety recommend you check out this video also if you love the science fact information on how to heal your body naturally make sure you subscribe here come all new videos every Tuesday and Thursday bye later Anna mentoring [Music]", "B75NB2hebQ0": "hello everyone Salima here this is part three of our CBD information videos and I want to introduce you now to tinctures and a tincture is a an oil-based CBD type of delivery system and there's a little bit of coconut oil and it's suspended in an oil that has no taste or flavor so this is the tincture and this is the extra-strength tincture so you have a little bit more of a concentrate in a 30ml bottle is sealed here so this is child safe and it will ship in this way so that you know that you're receiving a product that hasn't been tampered with you simply open up the seal and the instructions here are to take either a half drop a half dropper or a full dropper and you can see that there's markings on the dropper so that you have a good understanding of what your dosage might be I would start small so start with a quarter drop and see how it happens if you feel that you need a little bit more coverage then go with a half dropper three-quarters dropper and then also you have a option for a full dropper the tinctures are great if you have anything from anxiety or depression you're dealing with panic attacks you have information in the body pain or discomfort in the body and you're looking to treat with a natural plant medicine so the good news here is that this is long lasting and then the other thing that you need to know is that it takes a little bit of a while for this to kick in so the way that you take this particular tincture is to figure out your dose so I'm going to start small and I've been taking this for a while so I know what the effects are it helps me relax and I get good a good sound sleep as well as a really more relaxed kind of approach to what's happening in my day so I'm going to go with a quarter drop just to keep things light I'm going to take it underneath the tongue and that's it no flavor no oil and really now I just need to wait for about an hour for this particular dosage to kick in my recommendation is that you start in the morning take your take the dosage start small and then eight hours later start to introduce a little bit more and then eight hours later do that again so this could happen first thing in the morning around one or two o'clock in the afternoon and then again before bed and what you'll have is great coverage and a slow release over a course of a day and whatever recommend if you're trying this for the first time is to really give yourself you know a day or two where you may be on holiday maybe you don't have to do too much outside of the home so that you can kind of check in with yourself am I feeling like how am I feeling am I feeling more relaxed am I feeling a little less nervous and thus anxious and then how are my faculties do I feel like I can drive do I feel like I can make good decisions and of course you will be able to it's just everybody's a little bit different so make sure that you do that try it for your first time without having too much of pressure over the course of your day and then gradually over time as you figure out your dosing remember everyone's different then you'll be able to tell okay I can do this and I can drive just fine I can do this and I can make decisions just fine or maybe I just do this on the weekend where there isn't much more going on okay so that's your option this is a tincture and it's a long-acting and slow to release type of medication this is again non psychoactive active so that means that there's no high feeling effect you have more of a feeling of being grounded relaxed and able to go through your day with a little bit less anxiety and stress if you've got pain in your body this is a great way to heal from the inside out rather than using a topical this is coming from inside to out okay so let me know how how this works for you you can leave comments below happy to answer anything that you have and if you're looking to purchase you can always click the link in the

is Brittany I'm a type 1 diabetic and I also deal with depression and anxiety so today video I'm gonna respond to everyone's question about what CBD I use the last video I received so many responses everybody wants to know what's the VD I used how much do I use how long the supply lasts me and does it really help is there any negative side effects today I want to go through all of that with you so before I get started please hit that subscribe button give me a thumbs up I really do appreciate it so before I actually get into everything I just want to state that this video is not sponsored I am NOT getting paid by this company to tell you that I use this because I actually do and I just want to be very open and honest with everybody so the company I use is lazarre's naturals they're based in Colorado they're third-party tested which is very important you want to make sure that the CBD you use is tested on and it comes from the actual hemp plant what's great about this company and its product it's pesticide free it's vegan and it's gluten free it's natural their shipping is great I get the product in sometimes two to three days which is astonishing I use the full spectrum CBD because it offers the wide range of cannabinoids from the plant so you get the full benefit first is the isolate or broad spectrum they're cheaper but they don't offer all of the different elements of the plan with the CBD however on that and it does not have THC in it however the full spectrum has very maybe 0.3 percentage that's zero the point 3 so very small this bottle is 3,000 milligrams I was doing 750 milligrams and that bottle is a little smaller so this is the 750 milligrams bottle this is a 3,000 now I was using this and this only last me a week and a half to maybe two weeks and who wants to order it that often it's kind of obnoxious so I upgraded to this and hopefully this can last me about a month I hope so the serving size is one milliliter and that is 50 milligrams of the CVD so right up to the line I will have about 1.25 so milliliters so that's up to the line and then about a quarter extra morning afternoon and night and depending on how I feel I might need a little more or sometimes not much at all just it depends on the day now the cost the cost of the 750 milligram is about $30 this 3000 milligram is it's a hundred and ten 110 I think because of the research I've done this brands this company is actually cheaper than other companies like Charlotte's Web Charlotte's Web it's known for helping with seizures and it's great for mental health and all that but because of the cost of the Charlotte's Web I never never went that route I went and I I was recommended this company I tried a few in the past and they didn't really help I tried this I you know it works it works for me and some other flavors I do the classic because I don't mind the taste or smell of CBD some people do you can mix it in your drinks or you know put it obviously put on your tongue hold it for like 30 seconds and then you swallow and I usually just take a drink and chase it down it's not bad and it really helps calm me down and it helps me focus so I feel a little more level down it take away the need for antidepressants I am NOT against aunt Ida presents I think they do work they do work but for me because I was putting on a ton of weight on them and I couldn't figure out the right medication or the right dosage that it was causing more problems than I would have liked this has actually been a year since I've been using CBD and haven't had to go back on the antidepressants I will say that it doesn't help with my PMDD if you don't know what PMDD is it's severe PMS it is irritability mood swings crying spells PMS basically on steroids and the CBD it helps a little bit it'll like calm me down and I can focus clean the house and stuff but I still have that I'll get me out of my skin feeling I hate it but CBD does help that is the only drawback is that it can't tackle those hormones just like the hormones take over my diabetes my chronic illness it also nothing really stands in his way so CBD doesn't have a chance it helps a little bit but it's not the cure-all and I just want you to know that CBD will not fix your problems it won't make your stresses and fears go away it won't change your mood it'll just relax you a little bit you're not panicking so you're not freaking out and everything but it is not the cure-all I love the stuff it helps me helped me stay off antidepressants I'm right there with you if you are contemplating like going a hand-tied presence or you don't want to be on anti you know it's hard nobody wants to be stuck on a medication especially if it's not working talk to your doctor so I can give medical advice I can't say do this or that but if you're able to manage your depression and anxiety with like exercise eating right and you just need a little bit of a boost CBD will help you have to figure out what works for you and how you're able to cope this is just a way to cope basically that's the end of this video I hope it was helpful maybe this company can help you there's a bunch of different CBD companies to choose from this one just happens to be a really good one and I don't want anybody to have to go and search and go through a bunch of duds you know I'll go on their website give them a try who knows it might work again if you liked this video give it a thumbs up hit that subscribe button and I hope to see you next time bye guys", "3l1gdYLZFiY": "what's going on everyone my name is chris here at cbd review lab and today i'm reviewing lazarus naturals 6 000 milligram cbd oil so lazarus naturals is a very popular cbd company they're based in portland oregon and were founded in 2014 with the mission of making high quality cbd products accessible to anyone regardless of financial circumstances they have an assistance program which offers a lifetime 60 discounts to veterans individuals on long-term disability and low-income households which is pretty freaking cool they offer tinctures capsules topicals coconut oil and pet products their hemp is grown in central oregon using organic sustainable farming practices and they use an ethanol extraction method to produce their cbd oil their oil has a dark golden brown appearance to it with an herbal scent and slightly bitter kind of earthy taste price wise this product runs 108 dollars if you use the coupon code cbd review lab which comes out to .018 cents per milligram of cbd which makes this the cheapest cbd oil i've found to date my dosage for this product has been around 50 milligrams and i usually take it when i get home from work and whenever i take cbd oil i hold it under my tongue for a good minute before swallowing it there are blood vessels and capillaries under our tongues that are able to absorb the cbd and other cannabinoids so this allows some of the cbd to bypass our liver and digestive system and go straight into our bloodstream however like most other cbd oils the effects really kick in within a couple of hours and this product is what i come to expect from a full spectrum cbd oil it's both physically and mentally relaxing and it just makes my body feel good and all of my stresses and anxieties that are kind of running around in my head just melt away so overall i am in love with this product it is very effective and very cheap when you look at the price per milligram so they definitely have my recommendation and if you end up purchasing this product don't forget to use the discount code cbd review lab if you want to save some money so that's my review of lazarus naturals i hope that you enjoyed it and i hope it was helpful if you have any questions about lazarus

the products that i'm gonna present to you real quick today will definitely help in that area so what we're gonna talk about today is gold line is putting out three new skus that are called part of the sleep line which are to help you sleep or get to sleep or be more relaxed that is actually one of the most common questions since we started gold line is which cbd products are going to help me get some sleep which products are going to help bring me down which is a good nighttime cbd and which cbd products like for example won't bring me up so this is one of those questions and when i started researching it and speaking to some of our customers it actually turns out that so many people are suffering from sleep problems and i'm surprised that more cbd products haven't been made to help out this group of people so if this is something that you're interested in then let's go ahead tone it down dim the lights grab your snuggies and let's talk some cbd all right so first of all we have our vape which is we like to call our zzz stick which is a full spectrum vape there's a really good blend now we created this whole sleep line partnering with a really high-end boutique extraction lab in colorado i mean we met with these guys and they've been doing cannabis as well as cbd extracts pioneers in the business for a very long time i mean they were into terpenes before they were cool and they have created a really good boutique product everything is very high quality high-end you can taste it you can feel it and it is a real deal and if you guys for example as we're going through some of these specs missed anything we're going to have the full lab reports downloadable on the lab reports tab on cbdgoldline.com so let's jump into the vape now a lot of people when you ask them why they might even smoke i mean vape cannabis they say listen i don't really vape cannabis that much but i like to take a couple of hits before i go to sleep why would they do that well because most of the time it works depending on what cartridge that they have so we wanted to make a stick that was a 50-state legal cbd stick under the hemp farm bill which has below the regulate amount of thc delta 9 but still tastes and has the effects now how did these extractors do this is they used such a nice spectrum of uniquely blended different cannabinoids they have cbd cbn cbv they also have some cbc in here as well that brings you a total of we claim there's 400 milligrams but the lab reports you know you're going to lab out about 430 which comes in a half a milligram cartridge so if you look at the milligrams per gram gram you're at about 800 which once you've basically hit over 900 you're basically at like full distillate style level in terms of purity so it's a very pure full spectrum vape cartridge blend that is going to taste and it is going to hit smoothly and it comes pre-loaded into c-cell cartridges which will work with any of your 510 thread vaporizers so let me show you the the cartridge and then we'll go into kind of what it works with so these are going to come in a standard dupe tube which has the child safety so normally you just press the sides and the top should pop open if it's a little bit stuck then you push on the sides and you can just use your thumb pull it out here you have your cartridge let's get a real nice close-up on it so we can show you that that beautiful honey gold cbd oil preload in there and again that's half half a gram so it's uh it's 0.5 milliliters and this is a ceramic mouthpiece very premium high performance cart very high quality glass chamber and you're going to have your standard 510 thread so what the recommended usages for this is when you're getting ready to lay down and you're a few minutes before you're going to sleep you're doing your wind down you got your tv on we just removed the little standard uh silicona thread protector cap what you do is then you're gonna take your cartridge and then you're gonna grab one of your 510 thread batteries i just grab one of my little elf sticks which we sell on the vape honey stick site you can use the gold line battery that we have on our gold line site the just batteries great uh very great for the price and the elf stick i just you know i love my green uh we have it uh right here simply screw it into the 510 port make sure it's tight don't over tighten it you're gonna feel a little springs connect then you click it five times and generally when you're doing your wind down people say to take one to two uh deep inhales of the stick then put it down you know if you have your pen on you can turn it back off and see how it helps you to fall asleep now this will also it's wide enough now i know all my honey stick people watching this video they will probably ask which concealers is it too wide it'll work perfectly with our elfs uh our beekeeper line our phantom line of concealers for the people who might want to uh have this on the go or have the cartridge protected because they uh they're like me they might be a little clumsy and drop more vapes so you screw on the little magnet whichever adapter it is and then it'll drop right in you'll hear a click and uh this is an auto draw and you will be right inhale this cartridge does have a bottom hole if we could zoom in so it will actually work with all the auto draw batteries that you have which are buttonless which will work on the power your inhale and this should be a good vape stick if you are having trouble sleeping or you are looking for that added relaxation again really high quality that's if you're into vapes but a lot of people might not necessarily be into vapes and they're looking for more of a sublingual so we also have in our sleep line we have the tinctures which i have two different tinctures that we have we have a 600 milligram which is a broad spectrum and i also have a 900 milligram which is a full spectrum now a lot of people ask what's the difference between full and broad spectrum broad spectrum actually has zero thc delta nine full spectrum will have a little bit of thc in it delta nine however it will be below the legal limits within the hemp farm bill which was proposed that regulates the sale of these hemp thrive products so let's jump in and talk first about the 600 milligram broad spectrum one so the way that these have worked out and we'll do a nice little close-up while we talk of the label and i'll scroll around now note that none of these tinctures or vapes have any type of melatonin in them so you are getting the full effects of uh cbd and the different blended cbd to optimize for sleep and tranquility now i'm going to turn it around slowly we're gonna stop here on the back label and again you guys can see this online the way these are optimized so they have a real nice blend of the different cannabinoids however with the tinctures they like to put a one-to-one cbd and cbn formula which they say is optimal for taking you uh into relaxation mode and into sleep mode now the broad spectrum has 600 milligrams located with a 30 milliliter bottle now generally the recommended dosages for these would be one to two tinctures full now for those of you guys who don't know exactly how sublingual should function so when you get it before you use it you want to shake it up not too much just around each one of these things is going to be a heat original sealed at the top you're going to want to break that seal sometimes you could break it by twisting it just unscrewing there we go seal's broken i'm gonna remove that now what you're gonna do is you're then gonna screw a little tincture down you're going to push the squeeze top let the bubbles come up and unlike go then you can unscrew it i did that completely wrong what you're going to do is you are going to screw it in you're going to push we're going to be editing this you're going to put the cbd dropper it's like a standard dropper you place it down to the bottom and you're going to squeeze with your thumb and your pointer finger to get liquid in there and let go and you will have a nice dropper then you are going to take this and you're going to place it underneath your tongue and you're going to push down which will release underneath your tongue you're going to hold it for about 10 seconds and then you're going to go ahead and swallow the formula and that's the way that you would ingest the sublingual formula so you're gonna take it you're gonna fill up your dropper you are going to place it underneath your tongue hold it there for 10 to 15 seconds then you're going to go ahead and swallow it and then you are ready for relaxation now it's going to be the same procedure but we also have our full spectrum blend which is basically the same type of uh compound that's gonna go from one to one cbd and cbn however with the full spectrum you are gonna have a little bit of thc in there now whether you think that helps or whether you don't want to well that's for you to choose which formula is best for you but with the full spectrum formula it also has 900 milligrams in the 30 in the 30 milliliter bottle so each dosage that you take of the full spectrum one is going to be a little bit stronger so you have those two tinctures and again we're gonna have the full lab reports up there for you guys to be able to take a look at see what the cannabinoid breakdown is and all that stuff so guys if this video alone has not already put you to sleep definitely check out these products i've had my team you

daily CBD in order to have great effects on your body what you do is it comes in a bottle that has a little eyedropper and you just squeeze the little top of it and then you administer it under your tongue and here's what happens it gets absorbed into this under your tongue and then it gets absorbed into your carotid artery and the effect starts to take the effects begin to happen within 15 minutes so it's super quick and it's super easy now here is why this is a benefit one it's very powerful some of the most powerful ways to take CBD is with the teacher as a teacher the other thing is it's it's very discreet right sometimes if you're using a vape pen you know you can't use that indoors for example and sometimes you might not want to use that because it might raise questions from other people so the tincture is very easy you can keep carried in your purse from your pocket and then I you can just slip it out whenever you feel the need for it and get your dose of CBD and boom

little tiny bottle has thousand milligrams a very powerful CBD so this will last you depending on your dosage for at least a month and you'll begin to feel the effects from the first dose so click on the link below so that you can get your own bottle of this teacher see how easiest see how effective it is and see how much your body and your mind benefits from the effect of CBD oil tinctures bye bye", "tEGpTToDKmg": "it seems like everyone today is interested in CBD and its health benefits but as someone who has been researching CBD since well before it exploded into popularity I want to warn you that not all CBD oils and supplements are created equal so if you're eager to experience the health benefits that are being associated with CBD don't just rush out and buy the first product you see and don't just settle for the cheapest one either there are two main things to look at when attempting to select a CBD product first is whether the CBD product is broad-spectrum CBD or CBD isolate here's the difference broad-spectrum CBD includes not just CBD but also all the other cannabinoids that are found in a marijuana plant this CBD provides the maximum amount of health benefits CBD isolate on the other hand only contains purified CBD that's been extracted and isolated from the other cannabinoids so you get less potential health benefits so what kind of benefits can you expect from taking a CBD oil or supplement researchers say all of the following is possible pain relief reduction of anxiety and depression alleviation of sub cancer related symptoms and possible reduction of acne also noted were some neuroprotective properties that means it might help with some neurologic disorders there are also potential heart benefits antipsychotic effects it can help with substance abuse treatment and and as possible anti-tumor effects and for those of you who are diabetics it's been shown to have some preventative measures in a recent pain relief study researchers determined that CBD may help reduce chronic pain by impacting endocannabinoid receptor activity reducing inflammation and interacting with neurotransmitters in a study on depression and anxiety researchers determined that a group of social anxiety sufferers who receive CBD had significantly less anxiety cognitive impairment and discomfort before a speech performance than those receiving a placebo now what benefits you actually receive will depend on the second thing that you need to be sure to look for when studying CBD products and that's the quality of the product you should look for a product that contains 100% natural ingredients and that is made using only ingredients that are tested for purity and quality the product should also have no artificial fillers flavoring or colorings just premium ingredients that you can trust one more thing it should also be made in the USA and an FDA approved lab like life renews CBD products life renew has quickly built a reputation for providing the highest quality purest supplements the company supplements can be counted on to contain exactly what they say they contain and to produce the exact benefits they say they produce look I'm very excited about the potential of CBD and the quality of CBD products being produced by life renew personally I feel there's a lot more benefits that are going to be associated by taking CBD do you know that we actually have an endocannabinoid system inside of us well we all do this system has receptors throughout our bodies and it's involved in most of our brain and bodily functions that's incredible news and it means that supplementing with CBD could just be what you need to achieve optimal health we already know that the ECS or the endocannabinoid system plays a big role in how we handle pain as well as stress and anxiety it's also involved in our motility and our muscle health our endocannabinoid system basically keeps us in balance and CBD is the all-natural fuel that helps keep the system operating optimally so if you're ready to potentially boost your health to a whole new click the button below to visit our website now to learn more about life renew and its CBD

Ron Echols and now it's your turn to stack the deck in your favor [Music]", "ToQHYEQe25Q": "everybody look up I know we're a little past 6:30 but I hope you guys have had a chance to meet each other and maybe share some stories that's really kind of the first thing that I want to do just kind of share how I like Tiffany and I got involved with this and it really points back to that one right there miss Wendy's she approached Tiffany in the library of all places in had said I've been waiting to talk to you we can all buy cvd like and for us being in the wellness practice we had to admit we didn't know very much and a little bit embarrassed to admit that patients have been asking about it but we just didn't know too much about it and so when Wendy asked would you be willing to meet with my cousin who's someone you may know Lisa honored respect for Wendy because we love her so much we said okay and so we met with Lisa for about an hour and she came and I presented and hopefully we weren't too standoffish because we knew it was probably gonna lead to like it there exhales kind of thing that really wasn't for us but Lisa says that we were very gracious and listened to her and as soon as we heard the presentation Tiffany's a scientist dr. LeBlanc Tiffany so she dug into the research what is this what have I been missing for the past couple years patients have been asking me about and started learning about CBD and the endocannabinoid system and everything that goes with it and then also why this product might be the best one out there at the time we didn't know but we were just listening to Lisa and you know trying not to be sold on anything but enough research was done to say okay you know will bite but we're still not going to take you for your word we want to see it wanna see doesn't do what you say you do so we signed up and bottom knocked right off the bat to give 50 patients a 30-day try and pretty much what we saw some some of them pretty quickly like like within 15 minutes sorry sighs some of them it took days some of them a couple weeks and generally I'd say we could break up that that study which is now probably close to eight people right there's more than 80 subjects just not necessarily going out there right it's okay I think we can roughly say we can divide it up into thirds we're about a third or the people who have tried it with us entities might see some difference but probably not enough to justify staying on it every month buying it consistently about another third saw an appreciable difference where they want to be a part of it they want they want to buy the product and continue using it and about another third life-changing results they're paying that they've had for 30 years is gone can't sleep now you can sleep anxiety depression on medication being able to come back off of those blood pressure right it's another point and so some of these things aside what it so that just prompted us to say it's working let's get further into it into the science and figure out what why why can it help all of these different things whatever he's going to talk more about science for you she's she's her goal tonight it's to be able to being a doctor being able to talk about the science bring it to a level that we can all understand because it's hard for me to I'm still trying to figure it out before we do that though I just want to talk a little bit about the founder of the company and the industry as a whole Stephen Thompson and his wife are the founders and part of what we enjoy so much about it is the way this company got started the lease a name actually means nutrition multiplied and so this started when mr. Thompson went on a mission trip to Haiti which we had a soft spot for you know us that he does a lot of mission work they were doing time money there are some youngsters too and he saw just the state of human poverty there malnutrition starvation diseases them that we you know things that we take for granted in the medical world just they don't have that luxury and and a touch them and he had been in the direct sales business in the health and wellness industry for almost twenty years and came back after having seen that and wanted to do something to help and the business that we he was in at the time the people at the top they they they didn't want to change their system to do anything so he actually knew that I think he knows the guy know was the guy from Tom's the shoe company right and so we got with him and said how do you make that work how can you do that and came up with his version of direct sales so he's taking everything that he knows and likes about the direct sales industry in the health and wellness field and has applied it here to his own business that just started in 2015 so this company's only barely four years old right and then about a year ago doctor de silver there figured out how to make this product at the top of the industry I'm talking about I'm talking about the hand that CVD industry right so he figured out how to make it water soluble and that's the game changer so we're talking about the industry you know these publications you'll see numbers like that 700 percent projected growth by 2020 I've heard our rolling stone actually sent 22 billion dollar industry by 2022 I've heard trillion dollar industry in five years so all these numbers are going around the lease itself for debt projects itself to be a billion dollar company in five years and the last figure I heard was just either a hundred million as of October is where they are now something like that so from a hundred million to a billion in five years I think it's safe to say we're in the early parts and so you always hear that when we talk about direct sales and again I am talking about direct sales so for those of you that might be put off by that right from the start I'm calling it out now but I don't want this to be to feel like pressure right you vote we've all been to those meetings pampered chef Tupperware right whatever it is where you feel like you go in and they want you to buy something and you're looking for the cheapest thing in the catalog just so you don't feel guilty we believe they want you to sign up that's not this that's not this we're here we swear in a wellness business and we have been waiting for this to help people we just happen to believe because we saw it with our 30-day trial that this product can help people and because of what Stephen Thompson's done not only will it help people with their health but it can help you build a business and help you breath as well it's kind of kind of cheesy I think that they ride but health and wealth we kind of go together so I'm gonna turn it over now to the love of my life the person who without I probably wouldn't be able to do half of the really cool things that I do and she's gonna try to fulfill her goal of bringing the science down to the real world for us very pretty dramatically in their background we have people that are you know physical therapists we have people that are stay-at-home moms you know I want to make sure that I can make this understandable and applicable to everybody in the room so last time I was doing this I got a lot of head nodding and I got this I got this and then I got to this one point and all the head nodding stopped it doesn't move I think I lost them so I'm gonna try very hard to make this understandable for everybody so the first thing I'm going to tell you is your point of being in this room can vary dramatically you can be here because you just want to learn and that's fantastic I am a big big advocate I love teaching so if that's why you're here that's cool if you're here because you're taking the product you want to understand why it's doing what it's doing great if you're here because you want to make a business out of it great it can be anywhere any one of those three things it doesn't matter to me but what I want you to get from me is why and how does it work so the first thing oh I have like two slides and I want to go through but I don't even look at them so you're welcome to read that if you want to but it's completely irrelevant to what I'm going to say really but the first thing I want to do is I want to clarify some terms and I want to help explain the definition of them so first of all I want to talk about the endocannabinoid system so endo means made inside the human body okay so cannabinoid is when you're talking about CBD oil CBD cannabidiol is a cannabinoid so CVD is one type there are many types of them and I won't go into all the details of what they are just know that that is one type so when I talk about this product you know that when you say the word CBD well that's really not fair it's a full spectrum chemical and we'll get to let that mean so back to endocannabinoid so endo means maybe in your body cannabinoid the cannabinoid system so we have a system that already exists within our bodies where we make produce use these substances and I want you to think of them mostly like a hormone but it's a little bit misleading to say that but just think of it sort of like a hormone and so if you have a deficiency in any substance in the human body it could be a vitamin a mineral a type of beauty protein there are symptoms that are associated with those deficits so either so if you if your endocannabinoid system is not functioning or producing what it needs to you will have the symptoms of that so there is actually a recently document in 2004 was the first documented endocannabinoid deficiency syndrome that same study was republished about four years later in 2008 so we actually now known that there are people who have deficiency syndrome but you know as a scientist in life you're high why why that's the bigger question I think you know the answer to that but why do we have deficiencies syndrome but here's the good news if you don't make enough in your body what do we look to in any sort of deficiency we look to what's called phyto system so what plant-based systems of food based systems so a final cannabinoid is a plant based cannabinoid so we're very lucky because hemp is like the perfect plant to help produce phyto cannabinoids that can fill the gap and stimulate the endocannabinoid system does that make sense to all of you I need to see some head nods to make sure that makes sense get some eyes and say yes it's like so if so to take this like the next step further so if you have a deficiency it usually as a result the this the symptoms that result from that is because of a system well ironically and interestingly enough the cannabinoid system the endocannabinoid system is involved in almost every organ system in the human body so when you hear about CBD oil and hemp oil it sounds like a pennis tea it's like it's kind of nice everything in your life that's gonna go in and fix everything and it's you know it sounds crazy but there's something to that because so many organ systems are associated with that and so I have to be clear about something upfront we cannot talk about a supplement as it diagnoses trees or what the knower cures any disease process but what we can talk about is the endocannabinoid system and what that controls in the human body and by supporting that by a supplementation how that results and changes in disease state or symptoms does that make sense to all of you okay because we have to reserve the commentary on treating and curing to medications or drugs that's just the way this is and they're this way and it works so when you're when you're talking about this particular type of product CBD oil the next thing i really want to cover with you is why would you pick one over the other what differentiates one kind from another what makes a good product what makes a bad product and then some of the things that you might run into as far as obstacles and some concerning things that might come up so first of all let's talk about a number of things that there let me be clear there are a lot of companies that do these first few things well and I would never want to discount you know other companies that works but there is one thing that distinguishes this company all the others so first of all if you're looking for any type of CVD product or hemp product you want it to be organic and the reason why and this is more important than people realize is because hemp is extremely efficient and pulling things out of the soil so if you had a toxic waste dump and you want to clean up that soil have been a great way to do that you plant the hemp and it would help clean it up hundreds of years ago farmers had to plant him in order to rejuvenate the soil for crop rotation so it's that's part of its like the wonderful part of it is that is so efficient at that so if it's not organic it's also very efficient at pulling out negative substances such as heavy metals pesticides so that kind of leads into the next thing you want to look for you want to make sure that whatever product you're using is tested for those so if you look in your packet I think it's page three or so this company tests all their products for heavy metals for the pesticides for toxin toxins and they also test 20.0 THC and we'll come back it sleeps PNM okay the next thing that you want to look for things that you want to make sure that it's sio2 extracted the reason why that's important is because methane butane butane etc is used as typical extraction process is extremely cheap and it's a very toxic so it's best if it's co2 extracted which takes more time and more expensive but that's a much safer you know - baby I'm not really looking to drink up some hexane you with me on this movie okay the next part that you really want to look for is you want it to be a full spectrum hemp oil and this so I don't even look at it I just keep talking but yes so a full spectrum hemp oil has in it all of the other the synergy of the entire cell so I'm gonna use some simple analogies for this it's the difference between an apple and pear juice okay so the apple has the fiber and the vitamins and the minerals and has all of the elements of the whole fruit if you take out the apple juice you get some of those elements but not all of them so I'm going to take this a little step further so when it comes to science you know science is always looking for how can I break it down to the isolate so do you rember years ago when they were saying red wine it's really good for heart disease you know if you drink a glass of red wine is supposed to be go to the heart well the industry said well let's figure out what is it in red wine that helps you with your heart disease and we're going to extract that out and we're going to put it in the pill and we're going to make it work and so they said it's reserved at all so we're gonna extract out reserve it salt if you're put it in the pill and everybody's gonna see these benefits to their heart disease well it turns out that didn't work out and it's because oftentimes when you remove things out of the natural environment you lose the synergy of the element so the reservatrol didn't work and the same thing is true with CBD CBD is one cannabinoid it's considered an isolate so when you isolate something down to its individual that's an isolate and the challenge when you ever you make a total product down to an isolate is you generally have to increase the dose and you increase the side-effects does that make sense so on top of that all there's about 17 different cannabinoids that one one of those is THC and I'll segue into that in a second and there's a couple different kinds of THC as well but you also have all of these other elements the terpenes were played in like the minerals the vitamins that you would lose if you isolate it down to just CBD okay so that's the next thing that's very important and then the last thing and this is where you know I actually went to Massachusetts I went to a manufacturer who does all of those things that I just said very very well I had them produced me four bottles of CBD oil specifically for me to my specifications no THC this whole thing and I had them make me four bottles and the thing that you can't compete with is the water solubility so let me talk about that for a second so switching hats I'm becoming a nutritionist now okay so in the world of nutrition it's very difficult for the human body to extract out of fats its nutrients the reason why is because you don't start digesting it until it gets into the small intestines you'll require a vial to start breaking down fat so that comes from your bile duct which is associated to the system file duck gallbladder liver etc okay so if you takes you until your small intestines to start breaking it down it's very difficult for you to remove all of the components so let me um they'll give you an example of that have you guys ever noticed that it's very very difficult to assimilate vitamin D from a supplement so people vitamin D deficiency is just rampant in this country and so people take these humongous mega doses of vitamin D vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin it's very difficult for your body to pull that out of a tablet and make it into something useful so people end up taking these giant doses of vitamin D and then they end up pooping out a tablet and they have very expensive poop so actually we've got this felony on the day we had to have a septic tank pump and he said you wouldn't believe how many tablets just fill septic tanks he said I just pump out buckets and buckets of tablets because you can't use them can't break them down so American that very expensive boot okay so back to the CB Damon so if you have an oil that is not water-soluble here's the challenge so the big conversation right now in the CVD world is dosed they're like what's the dose what's the dose what's the dose is a dose how high enough and that's true but only to the extent that it's absorbable so there's something in that it's called bio availability so bioavailability is the amount that you can take out of a substance and use and assimilate in your body so most CBD oils are about three to ten percent bioavailable and I'm going to call some bluffs on this because all of them have you put it on your tongue which is called the sublingual patien so if it's an oil and it's not water-soluble and you put it on your tongue but there's no bile in your mouth you're not absorbing that until it gets to your small intestine so you can take it just swallow it there's no reason to keep it under your tongue this is no bottle you're in your mouth right so that three to ten percent is that is the typical range that a typical oil-based CBD oil has a bioavailability for it so if we did some math you know because you know all these different companies like we have the highest dose CBD oil that's super but if you only get five percent of it you have to do the math and figure it out so actually one of them and I won't say anything so there's a there's a very good company that has a good product that has a very high dose product and it is very expensive it's like 340 bucks for their highest dose bottle and they talk about their dosage but I did the math and when you have even it all out the the absorbable amount even if I want on the high end of the typical bioavailability still less so let's talk about water solubility for a second so with this particular product and this why I think I've seen so many of my patients where they've taken two or three other kinds of CBD went and they're like it just doesn't work for me that's okay you don't have to do this but consider a try just try for 30 days if it's not helping you you don't have to continue and more often than not they come back and they say for some reason this one works more and the only real argument that I can make is it has to be the water solubility because that's what makes it bioavailable so this study right here and this is something that I I think this company can be really proud of it's very expensive it's very difficult to do studies and now let me be clear there's different hierarchy of kinds of studies this would be considered a case series they've taken you know I think it's 25 subjects with it I can't I think it's 25 subjects and what they did is they they took an a blood draw from these subjects every hour for 12 hours and what they were looking at is we're going to give them a standard dose how long does it take before they absorb it what percentage of it is absorbed into the bloodstream and how long does it last okay so if you look here pretty much everybody within an hour have absorbed nearly the full dose and this is the coolest thing ninety-two percent absorption that that's crazy from anything that's ever from a fat soluble product that's that is I can't think of anything else that would be quite like that honestly we really need to take this technology and apply it to a lot of other stuff lots of other vitamins lots of other minerals this would be so the lease are you listening get on that but the other thing that was very cool about it so they kept taking it and I'm gonna talk about this little blip here for a second because I have a theory but at least we'll probably get mad at me for sharing my theories but it stays it stays elevated they just stopped measuring at 12 hours I don't know why they stopped measuring your 12 hours they should've kept going maybe the subjects were tired and wanted to go to bed no idea but there's no real indication that it's going down after 12 hours but there's a little blip here around 10 hours and I would tell you clinically there seems to be a group of people that they need a third dose they need something in the middle of the day and I cannot tell you exactly any you know data on is it said I don't know the sex the weight that you know the diagnosis that the problems I can't tell you anything consistent consistent about that but I can tell you I have a number of patients I end up breaking the dose up it's in 2/3 because for some reason they may seem like they have this little dip and I see it around 9 to 10 hours but that's just a clinical observation now after having so many so many subjects that have tried it so that is that is the thing that distinguishes this one particular product in my opinion and I did I've actually used the two products the one that I had manufactured I've used it on same subject no go it was no belt like it just didn't work as well and I can't say anything about I actually felt kind of bad that company contacted me today and said you know how's it going and I said I'm just going to become candid with you you know this is what happened and they were really grateful for the feedback actually and I was thinking well it's a patent-pending process so good luck with that you might get in trouble if you try so that's that's the the bioavailability part now what about the process that makes it so bioavailable it's called a micellar process now the women in the room might know what I'm talking about did you ever heard micellar water you clean your face with it kind of a new thing no it it's it's like a toad you know what it is she knows what it is I've never used it I don't know how a you know I I don't know if it's works well oh that's your business oh that's right she's you seeing up here and talk about it but my seller processing it takes and I'm gonna explain this in YouTube ranking if I say anything wrong I use a couple terms so do you guys understand the word hydrophilic and lipophilic no no okay hydrophilic means it likes water lipophilic means it likes oil or fat so what they've done is they've found a process that takes the CBD oil and puts around it a hydrophilic outer and a lipophilic inner so that it's attracted to water on the outside which helps transport Vince your body that pretty good with a decent okay I'm getting approval from like the science at the other scientists in the room she don't even like myself in my seat yeah and I see lol okay so does that sort of explain how they made it water-soluble now I'm sure I can guarantee you they're not going to tell me all the details of the how that works because it's a patented process I might be able to dig it out in a few years I don't know anywhere the prep when the patent runs out really can get the details of it okay so does that make sense to you guys so let me talk about one more subject and then I'm going to turn it back over to Nathan one of the questions that I often get is how does how does this work on you know so many different systems like how does it you know work on helped people with depression and anxiety and you know people with highly high blood glucose and stuff like that like how does that all work so there's two types of memories factors in the human body and I'm going to just simplify this and we're going to call them type 1 and type 2 they have other names like we're going to come one and two one of them is primarily found in the brain and spinal cord and the other one is primarily found in your immune system so there's it's pretty difficult to think of something in your body that is not influenced by your brain spinal cord immune system and there's actually more than that it's involved in one map but I'm simplifying as much as I can so if you can stimulate that system you can therefore stimulate the symptom that's associated with that system so I'm gonna just take a second to talk about some of the cases that I have in the clinic and then we'll move on okay and I'll try and give you a good variety because some of this stuff is just crazy I don't even I don't even know how to explain how bad I feel that I didn't look into this sooner because there's a number of my patients that have been with me for years and they do well I'm gonna give to mine was born again for a second I'm really good for some therapists and they do well but then there's a few of them that they have these underlying pathologies that you know have sort of a big question mark on and think of your fibromyalgia patients you are patients with lupus your patients with these unknown autoimmune disease like you know they have an autoimmune disease but they do the blood we're going to come up with one marker and like now you don't really have it you're like you have something we just don't know what it is those patients I'm amazing so let's talk about five miles per second so fibromyalgia has a whole slew of symptoms and you know there's always this controversy is it real is it not real whatever it's chronic pain a chronic pain of unknown origin an unknown solution for this pain so there's some commonalities about around fibromyalgia I can't sleep they have pain all over their body they have have digestive issues and all of these things when I put on my nutrition is has there's a lot of combinations you know that they work into each other but that's another conversation so with these patients two of the things that really really go well three of those actually but if you can help someone sleep it can help their pain if you can help their pain you can help them sleep I don't know which one is working I have no idea I don't really care honestly all I care about is that they feel better but it's a very fascinating process like what's happening there and that's where I was like delved into the research so I challenge you guys because another thing I hear all the time like if I speak to a physician like well there's not enough research I'm like well you're a [ __ ] because I saved him today just today just to see how many articles would come up on pubmed.gov if I just wrote cannabinoid I want to guess just can he guess how many articles 25,000 plus and I did that search right before I came here so I was curious I was like typing it they wasn't cannabinoid then we put it in and no cannabinoid then we put in Fido cannabinoid and then we put in cannabinoid and Parkinson's cannabinoid and sleep and the least we found on any search was a hundred and fifty four articles now for those of you who are not in the science field I don't think you really get what that means we'd be lucky if we have three articles that support something and we're like yeah there's so much evidence to support that don't fit a question here I'm started in um did you want early research on things like it's a friend bipolar disorder so I I didn't look up those specifically and I ought to be fully transparent I am nowhere near getting through 25,000 articles I am working my way through a lot of articles but I'm I'm like a couple dozen in okay not 25,000 so my answer is and I would never you guys anything that I don't know the answer to I don't know I'm not sure but I encourage you to look it up go take a look let me know I want to know but there there's definitely a plethora of research that you can take a look at and also this is a really early science like if you take a look at the number of years we've known about testosterone or you know any other hormone system hundreds of years we've known about this the vast majority of the research that's been done on this has been done in the last you know 22 years it's really a young science and we have a lot of distance to go so I want to talk about a little bit about why maybe it's such a young science and why in America doesn't have this stigma like you know people always say is it medical marijuana am I gonna get high okay well let's clarify that so first of all in 1937 prior to that cannabinoids or cannabis was the third most prescribed medication in America Eli Lilly Pfizer they all had their own strings that they prescribed in 1937 the bill was passed it's called the marijuana activist actually called a narrow somethin'-somethin app and it look what happened is cannabis and hemp got lumped together was then called marijuana there's a whole conspiracy about why that happened and they were both considered a class 1 drug so all of those pharmaceutical companies had to drop it and it was no longer available to the mass public well 85 years later finally have a bill that separated out those two things cannabis and in him so hemp is actually used in all sorts of things like it's a it's a wonderful thing it's moving in paper and materials and we know someone that's investing in a company that's using it as a lubricant in the military I mean it's using tons and tons of things so it's making a huge agricultural comeback because of this separation and thank goodness because it's you know it's easy to produce and it's it's such a wonderful benign in so many ways product so when the next question is let's talk about the THC for a minute so that's the big question right it's like gonna get me high am I going to get a positive blood test for you know at work etc so THC is the psychotropic properties and there's actually a couple different types of THC in one of them in particular is what everybody thinks of is it's a longer name than THC but so THC is what you think of as the psychotropic properties of marijuana or medical marijuana or recreational marijuana and there's even two strains of that so one of those strains has more CBD and less THC and one of those has more THC than the other so from a therapeutic perspective invisibility is called innocence don't quote me on that I might've said that wrong but it starts a night in this indica indica yeah good job in a guy that's it so indica mat one is the one that has less THC and more of the medicinal properties now if you and I want to clarify for a second THC by itself has its own medical benefits that you know nausea related to chemotherapy or cancer treatments super helpful for that certain types of seizures there's like a list of symptoms that I would I would recommend someone seek out medical marijuana now there's certain other things that don't maybe don't go as well with THC like certain types of anxiety and depression they it can exacerbate those symptoms also if you're not looking to get high but you want the medicinal benefits you you would likely want it's out no let me be clear I have patients are like well why would I bother with that I want to be high and like okay well you're let's send you over here because that's not what I do but it you know as far as the blood tests are concerned I get that question a lot and now this is what I can tell you the company tests the product at zero point zero THD the legal limit is anything below 0.3 th 0.3 on 1% does that make sense so to me it's really important that it's zero point zero because there are some drug tests that are sensitive to that level and I I wouldn't want someone to test positive I can't guarantee you one test positive anyway I don't know if the test goes to the point zero zero zero one I don't know but I tell people it tests to 0.0 0.3 I don't know maybe that would show up on a drug test I don't know it's not gonna get you I'm not gonna get you very high unless you drink a huge quantity of it but the zero point zero even you're not going to have the psychotropic properties and if that's important to you than that's that's it was important to me as a provider and the other one that I had manufactured I had to actually ask for that state you option you want the point three or the zero I'm like I'm with the zero give me the zeros that's wrong with this mmm okay so I'm going to transition out of this did I miss anything important so how did a person who's in direct sales create a product when he doesn't have a scientific background that's what I'm that's what doctor disobeys he is that he's the formulator if I understand correctly doctor the silver is actually the one item on the mission trip to Haiti Mars I understand where'd you go even New Jersey yeah that's right I've been in New Jersey and sang Thompson's out of Texas they grow their own em comes from Colorado in color and the distribution plant is in Indianapolis but it's growing and harvesting Colorado look at know they actually building appears to see if it's Russell you could actually get some snails so really I can't answer that other than I know that it was present in the blood drop but it are intracellular I don't I don't see myself a little throat blood will but it won't rule I don't I don't believe that they've done that study but I won't speak for them as far as I know if it has been done I'm not aware of it it's that ferrets or everybody who knows okay any other questions how do i do did you guys get it they make it pretty understandable I would also in the question she had yeah did we test the cells one of the things that we're seeing is that there is a result okay so we don't look in the cells but the end result of the product the anecdotal would suggest it would just highly suggest especially with a new topical that we're seeing that we put on and people feel relieved ten minutes oh well Union Master right faster for some and so Mike my scientific mind would say or at least my anecdotal mind would say yes okay you first you tell us hold on one second let me into her question and then she has a question then we'll go to you okay so some patient cases um I have more talk about yours yeah I got a 15 year old son that basically is very shy how would you say to start socializing social anxiety and basically he would seem little to other people was kind of big for us we're even talking would tip me he'll go back in he's dictating the conversation instead of the person dictating the conversation we were at a friend went over that friend's house and he was sitting came in in normally we would be sitting up there and the parent was like hey Aaron Zak - I had gone out for in the house he would have never walked in that house on his own he would set out there with us I mean that's just the way it is this past Saturday you know this we're at the lacrosse tournament and Tucker basically went ballistic on his teammates tell him they weren't doing their job and the coach loved it and said he called him all out when he needed to and that's not him not I've known Tucker since he was a little and there's you guys had some really serious concerns about that social isolation and I actually did an interview with him a month after he started he also has ADHD words were in it and he's he's doing extremely well and that's that's one case so that's kind of on the brain health side of things and then I have a patient who is a god 80 patients to talk about going to pick this one so he is a fireman and he has an injury when he young where he hurt his back and he also had a very rare infection in a lung that ever since that and the antibiotics and when I ma know that he has had terrible terrible gastrointestinal problems and he has kind of this systemic weird pain stuff going on and he he was the most rapid responder I've had so within 15 minutes he goes this stuff is weird and he goes I don't hurt and he has one of his symptoms he has epicondylitis so in our world and this test you put your finger out and push on it out of that freaking hurts and then 15 minutes later it was not there and I hadn't treated him yeah I'm done anything and then he ended up being so sensitive to it that he only takes eight drops twice a day and that's all he needs and he was actually just in today and he thought he got another bottle and he's actually going to human resources to make sure that he can continue taking this because of his line of work he's worried about drug testing and he's following through because he wants to share it with all of his other co-workers cuz they all have these problems you know because they're caring they're having ins and the ladders and all that crap so keeps that's a great segue into you okay I'm gonna stop but I will answer your other questions later those of you who had other questions okay alright so that is a really great thing because we can we do have maybe we're in a unique position to have the patient population to try this with so we do have those stories and then I want to get to more of that later because there's some great ones but it's a great segue into what Solis is looking for us to do business challenge right challenge you to try it see if it works because they say up to 80% of people are gonna feel some kind of result than that pretty closely matches that if you remember earlier I said a third a third a third right so you take my two-thirds sixty-six sixty-seven percent that's not far off right so so that's a challenge to try it and I'm just going to talk a little bit about the business now and again before getting into that speaking about Steven Towson again this whole thing that started he's continued that through and so every dollar of volume that gets spent in other words every time you buy a product it's getting matched to go towards prenatal vitamins for a pregnant women or blends of multivitamins for kids and that's just not that's the Sun in Haiti where where all this started and that's not just done a country after but I have a real big problem that's all around the world and in all 50 states so they've actually done the math on their impact so far and have reduced infant mortality by 29% syrup so he's I have not met I've only heard great things about him but it seems like he's doing a really great thing was trying to pass and I was trying to pay for you because of the pay it forward companies and so not just with saving kids around the world but paying it forward to the employers people that have working under him us and and wants us to do well so if you've not taken the challenge challenge you to try it they say seven days really in our experience seven days yeah for some things like Tiffany said you might you might you might get results pretty quickly for some things it might take a few days and we've seen people not see results until the second or third week so I really encourage you to try a 30 day if you can't you know financially if you if you can buy the big box try it if you do want to get involved in Kenya as a consumer you can buy it at retail retail for bottles $50.00 a lot of places sell it 440 can't sell it for less than hundred 20 also starts to degrade the integrity the product you can also sign up as a preferred customer but really quite candidly I don't know why anybody would do that you know they advertise it here as as you can be a preferred customer you can have it shipped to you directly you can save about $30 a bottle when you do that or you can sign up wholesale and you can get an even cheaper just for yourself if you want you don't have to do the direct sales business as a matter of fact think about it logically if they're exhales push you off then treat it like any other retail vendor you might have if you have to if you have an opportunity to sell retail just buy it at the wholesale and sell that retail and forget about their drug sales I have to do all right but if you buy a wholesale or there's just for you or or to sell at retail and at least you have the opportunity you should it arise and trust me it will to share it with somebody else or somebody else again involved in the program Tiffany was at the shoe store last week this winged shoes this is the shoe she boy and didn't have her size and so they were gonna order before and they wanted the email right so they could contact her when they came in and she put her email Tiffany at Lamont wellness leave behind a counter said Oh what kind of wellness do you do said well usually that answer is on a wellness clinic that does physical therapy personal training and nutrition counseling for some reason this time she said that plus and see me anyway and a lady said well I want to learn more about that so she started talking about it and the lady outside ever said I want to learn more about that just happens right and so it'll especially happen when you have a story when you've taken the challenge and it helps you or when somebody you know has taken the challenge and then and that's on the Wellness side or if you've gotten into it you've made a little bit of money and that's on the wealth side you have a story when you have a testimonial when you start telling people and it just comes up because really how many times have you ever talked to somebody that didn't tell you something about their health right back it's killing every every for every conversation it's almost always something about what's going on their help so the opportunity now that was on the consumer side of you if you're thinking about the business side they say there's seven ways to make money I'm gonna I'm gonna bunch this into three so it's easy to remember just retail that we really talked about and if you take two through five that's really commissions commissions and bonuses right based on what kind of volume you and your downline and people under you doing for business okay and then there's benefits program and the benefits program is really and I don't have a lot of experience in direct sales but to me that's that's kind of a big difference is that Stephen Thompson understands that in order to be money at this you have to work you always hear about direct sales and now is the perfect time and get in now markets about to blow up and then you get in and nothing happens right well that made me because the mat market saturated Tupperware pamper chef or maybe because you got sold on this potential and didn't realize that it still takes work you know I heard the other day there's no just statutes for lottery winners right people that get rich by being lucky there's no statutes for those people the people that do well financially doesn't work hard right even athletes you might think about that making twenty million dollars a game we'd only see him on Sunday we don't see the hard work at do the rest of the year and we can talk that's paramount later but the point is they work hard you still have to work hard so again coming back around the benefits if you're going to make this a full-time job and you know maybe leave another job or or you're a single parent you want to make this your job but you know health care how you have that stuff well he addresses that well then I'll get to that in a minute so retail practice again just just one more detail I want to talk about when I talk about retail profits this is not like a vendor in most other situations where at best I've ever seen you make twice what you're buying it for right if you buy a wholesale in bulk you can get this product first cheapest with shipping about fifty five dollars a bottle if you sell it at suggested retail that's 150 so you're making nine to five dollars a bottle yourself ten balls in a week that's almost a grand that's that's that's a big deal that's that's not any other kind of retail opportunity you're gonna find anywhere else if you do let me know the second way you make morning like I said is the combination of commissions and bonuses so really if you sign up and there's there's three levels you could sign up with so you can earn up to 20% of all the volume that you make or is made under you and you do that by enrolling a team okay so the first thing you want to do is enroll somebody on the left and somebody on the right and that makes you even a ship and associate and you can earn up to 20% on that volume up to $250 okay I'll tell you later how you can accelerate that as well and then you keep growing in level as you keep a roll of people they keep enrolling people you this is the direct sales thing right you keep building your tree and you keep going up to the point where there are black diamonds in this company they actually have to create that category people went past the last one to $30,000 a week there are people whose company that make that so this is the part we like yeah you're telling me all about this opportunity it never happens this products only been out for a little more than just over a year yeah so and we can we talk about where the industry is now and where it's projected to be President Obama cleared up the farm bill in 2014 on a provisional period it's up for repo and Mitch McConnell is going to go through it so in the next few months this bill is gonna is gonna pass and it's gonna separate or Tiffany was talking about earlier to marijuana in the head and that's gonna open up this industry there's no reason why Morgan so it's already going state-by-state our donors know there's no real reason to believe anyway that's why magazines forms Bloomberg they're all projecting this giant girl right so again it is early stages right the person that signed us up 13 months she's been in the now as our meeting was three weeks ago and she was a year na at that point so she's been in this for 13 months she's that presidential in October her Commission check was $26,000 so you can do it which means four weeks and we're probably getting a car next month I'm getting it so it can work but I'll tell you what Lisa works at tail up she works at Elle yeah she does record so part of the benefits the first benefit that you that you'll get blessing - and this is so cool once you get four people directly under you you can qualify for a blessing bonus it starts at a hundred dollars right I have a little story about this we were out to dinner Saturday night and I don't even think we were thinking about this no definitely not our server was just a real kind of talkative guy and we were we were in Murphy North Carolina it's a real small town like you can you can see every restaurant in the town from one Street apartment and so we're having a good time talking to him question came around how to end up here and you know he kind of told us his story kind of got a little teary because the family drama that happened and he was a little bit emotional and he went back and did some things and when we were asking for the check and we're talking some more I noticed he had a I am second bracelet on Alpha gadget familiar with that is you can look it up I am second calm but I knew what it was and so I asked him about it and he starts telling the rest of his story now it was a pretty personal story and he's he's been through some hard times and it's got a great attitude and he's looking good we just felt compelled to leave him a good tip right so on a $35 check I'm paying a check and Tiffany pulls out a 50 and she says he he means this right and then it dawns on I bet we're close to this suppose that another 50 so we left the hundred dollar tip and I'm not saying this because we're generous I think we're pretty generous with time and money I'm saying this because the lease allowed us to leave a hundred dollar tip on a $35 check and we left so we paid in cash we'd have to wait for him to take it and come back we just left Nasser crushed I don't know if you did this Basma crossing the street I looked over my shoulder and he's at the table like this right and I'd love to take credit for it but I can't have to give the credit to the lease because we didn't know we got it but when we went home that that that following day and looked in our account we had earned a blessing bonus like a few days ago okay days prior to that so they actually paid for us to do that and and that's when as you get up through the ranks you can get blessing bonuses up to $500 a month and the only stipulation is you have to give it away you have to get away and that's a tremendous feeling to be able to do that or simply so remember that tree we were talking about you qualify for that when you start with 4 under you and they say 4 by 4 because the next level is trying to get two of those people have 200 them so the humanity of 4 and the near 4 right so fittingly the next benefit is a 4 by 4 so they will pay if you're at that rank for you to have a cheat if you don't want the cheap you can get half the benefit in cash at least it would tell you but then you're gonna hang out forget you got to put their stickers on it right they're paying for it and they'll give you at the first level of getting four dollars a month as you climb that can become $1200 a month this are pretty cool she's driving around I don't even know what a $1200 a month she looks like Robyn climb every that probably pretty cool and then here's where it gets to be really cool if you really wanted to make a business out of this and call this your full-time thing it is they're gonna start paying health care you know how great is that if you're a single parent or or quit your job to try and make this work and you're figuring out healthcare anybody it's never pretty cool but that's like anybody's tried to get health care on that one knows how expensive that is they'll start paying health care for you and as you climb up to $1500 beyond that again four by four by four so we'll keep building the key building and you're gonna qualify for two percent share the entire revenue or that kind of thing so and that's divided by your I don't say your profit its prorated based on your contribution to that global revenue center right and then beyond that motorcoach again we're talking about these things that get all these things there are people in this company that are driving those are they for thirty forty feet long 30 34 feet long wants to be 34 feet or more and they'll give you I think it starts at $12,000 a month once you get to that level and then if you get all the way up into the diamond lomi 3000 doesn't they'll give you to have the motorcoach to enjoy there's no stipulation other than you have to have their branding on it they are thinking you're going to travel around the country and talk about the lease right I tell you what if I'm making that kind of money every month right Lisa presidential 26,000 a month right at motorcoach level you're talking about 30,000 a week I don't need to worry about going to work the next day I'll take their coach not drive around the country so you can see I'm starting to get excited because the opportunity it is there is there and again it's direct sales don't you know I don't want you to feel that pressure but I hope you can see the opportunity and when we talk about starting your own business we started we actually have four businesses now if you count this one and every time you start your own business you start thinking well what is retirement and click do I have to work forever well Stephen Thompson's built in this residual program so as you build you can earn generational bonuses all the way down to six gender patience so if you see remember the 4x4 right as you start multiplying if you add up all the numbers in that right column yeah you have a team of over 5,000 people once you get to that level you're looking at 2 percent residual bonus I don't know what that math is but that sounds like a lot it sounds like a lot to me right so again there's tremendous opportunities so how do we do it I'm not a sales guy I'm up here talking and you can't see it but I'm a little jittery in less now than it was when I started this is this is not my thing a lot of sales guy but I saw what the product can do and I've seen because we've gotten a blog blessings bonus and we'll probably qualify for a Jeep within the next 30 days or make it money too it works so I'm sharing that with you that's that point share it share the product share the story the health story the wealth story whatever it is if you share we don't even have to initiate it sometimes it's people are just gonna tell you on my back is killing me today like I said or sometimes it's just a simple question have you heard about CBD oil and then they start Thai and then you're armed about this information you can get a man getting involved you suck you are right now if you don't know the answers to the question this is being filmed right now so if we didn't blow it too badly we'll put that out there there's other ones Stephen Thompson has his video dr. andrew has a video right now for the time being this on YouTube and you know work will always be there to help our upline Lisa's been great she's she's been there to help Wendy's been a great teammate there to help whenever she can so we're all a team this is not like you know I've heard of horror stories from other direct sales where you know they stole my customer and you know now their competition it's not like that you know you brought somebody with you to they're yours I'm not going to try and sign them up for you they're yours and that's that's how this works and and of course share in the product they have their own story and they're going to be just as excited as we are together and and this is this is the slide that shows that that kind of positioning I don't know where as Lisa's on this line what I do know is that that seems pretty true when you take the other example as we talked about when you take the pampered chefs and the Tupperware's Mary Kay's that have been around for 50 years it's really hard to make money because you go anywhere in the country and people know what that is they've been to those parties they they look for the super sting on the catalog they've done it you go down to go down south for Reta one town down ask him if they've ever heard his Elise that's going to remember her ultra so it's brand new we're the first right in in the Atlanta market when it first Indiana's where to start because that's where a distribution that's started for the ultra cell here we're it right now so really here we're gonna start so if any of this interest you again no pressure we're just sharing because we care about you the person met and that invited you care about you or it feel like you can benefit from it either for your health or your welcome both this is where you can get started these are the three packages and this is how I was talking about you can accelerate yourself so if you sign up at gold which of course is the most expensive right 1299 you will get 20% of your binary bonus that we talked about over there so you're down like we care in 20 percent based on their body and potentials 2500 right off the bat instead of that 250 and and it comes with the product that you can share you know you got four big bottles we got 24 little bottles we got a bottle a topical there's other three that you see there was either three bottles you see those have boosters so this ultra training of ultra ice and ultra edge they use the same micelle the processing technology and the dream you know if you have trouble sleeping and the ultra cell bad cells networking the dream boost at so it's things like melatonin and things like that right the electric edge is for cognitive function I know Lisa said she uses it when I'm she has a long drive to help keep her focus and the ultra ice is really for anything chronic in terms of like getting your body back that homeostasis makes very information and things like that so that all comes in that package and all of these packages if you just got it and then turned around and sold it you'd come pretty down close to just get any money back so the risk is pretty low if you're if you are a salesperson you'd like to try and sell stuff bronze might be the one for you can you come in it 199 and you don't have anything to share you got one bottle one big ball in one minute you can only have one topical in one can if you wanted to but you can't share that doesn't give you anything to share right so you better be good at selling stuff and in the middle one is sober you get one big bottle one topical and you get a dozen minis bigger than what you get and what it costs I think in my in my opinion is the commission basis here's the good news if you can only come in in 199 and that's what you come in you get even upgrade alright so once you do start making somebody all you going to do later to upgrade let's just pay the difference and you'll get the difference in product back and then you're up to your 15% binary commission bonus and your weekly potential over that and then you can upgrade again so you just pick what's right for you if any of it just do the retail sales if that's right for you just just just try a challenge so I think that's all I have I would love to hear", "B5B9bnBQVrQ": "hi everyone my name is Tyler welcome back to my laboratory today we're going to be talking about short path distillation the functions the components and the process of it and then we're going to finish up distinguishing between full-spectrum oil broad-spectrum oil and tea free so let's jump right in alright so we're gonna talk a little bit about short path distillation today and what what the purpose of it is so we use short path distillation to extract cannabinoids from the crude oil so basically we're really doing refining operations using the short path distillation system it's very similar to the chemistry that was used in the white film molecular distillation that I talked about in a previous video just on a much smaller scale but you can also be a lot more precise with this equipment so several different components of the equipment of this whole entire system and so we'll start off from the beginning first piece that we have here is a low temperature coolant circulation pump and this is used to keep the condenser which is right here cool and what this does is it takes the vapors that are created by heating up crude oil in this boiling flask and it turns him back into liquids so as mentioned we have a boiling flask here inside of a digital heating and stirring mantle and what's going on in here is do I put crude oil in here we stir it at specific settings as you can see here below we have it at 330 rpm and 237 degrees Celsius what that does is that heats up the cannabinoids to the point of vaporization they turn into vapors they go up the distillation head they hit the cooler temperatures at the condenser right here cooled off by the chiller and once they turn back into a wick they come down into this thing called a cowbell and I can only hear the comments and jokes from here so so get them all out of your system now yes we all need more cowbell so what the cowbell has is you have your head and then you have your three main collection flasks and in each collection flask and you'll be collecting something differently in the first collection flask that you see in the background kind of a like a dark nastier color you're collecting heads and what's in those heads is any ethanol that wasn't recovered during the rotary evaporation process there's a little bit of terpenes some fats and waxes and lipids a little bit of CBD comes through here but really this is junk the second collection flask that we have is our mains this is the good stuff this is where we're collecting a majority of our CBD and as you can see it's pouring in there nice and smooth right now and a nice golden color that's that's what you want to see and the third flask which we haven't started using yet we'll use that at the end we're gonna collect our tails these also contain some cannabinoids but you're starting to get a really dark color which you really don't want in there and you're starting to collect a little bit more of some of the undesirables that are left behind in the crude oil after your cowbell yes we all need more of it you'll see a cold trap and this cold trap is designed to protect our rotary vane vacuum pump that we have down below here in this cold trap is on top has a mixture of ethanol and dry ice as you see is sort of bubbling right now right like it's not boiling that's just really really cold and that's what ethanol does when it gets it's probably below 30 minus 30 Celsius right now and so that cold trap is making sure that any vapors that didn't turn into liquid the cowbell are turning into vapors before they make it to the rotary vane vacuum top if they didn't then it would end up potentially damaging the rotary vane back and thumb so this vacuum what it's doing is it's lowering the atmospheric pressure of the entire system so that the cannabinoids don't have to reach as high of a temperature in order to convert from liquid to vapor and the reason why I want them to convert to a vapor at a lower temperature is because we get to have degradation of those can monoids at a higher temperature and we want to avoid that so that we can have higher quality and we're wrapping up this session by talking about the difference between full-spectrum broad-spectrum and tea free or isolate oils so full spectrum has terpenes CB d minor camera cannabinoids and a small amount of THC what I'm making right now is full-spectrum stuff broad spectrum includes terpenes CBD and minor cannabinoids but no THC an isolate or tea free includes no terpenes no minor cannabinoids no THC and only CBD that wraps up this session thanks for joining me in come back again later on have a great day", "5hbylT2q8Ls": "[Music] hey guys all right today i want to talk to you about a company called joy organics enjoy organics is a cbd company now before i get into my thoughts about the company and what they offer and everything um let me tell you a little bit about myself and where i stand regarding cbd because i think that's kind of important okay so um you may or may not know but i stopped drinking alcohol last year um after a very long struggle with um with it and after i had stopped drinking alcohol i was not on any type of antidepressant or anything like that um i am naturally an anxious person that does i suffer from bounce of anxiety as well um which is actually kind of ridiculous that i used alcohol for so long as a coping mechanism because it does the exact opposite but anyways um so when i stopped drinking i was not on any sort of antidepressant or anti-anxiety medicine now i'm not i'm not against those whatsoever i think they're wonderful i just wanted to see where i stood um regarding my anxiety um because i never really dealt with it um for all those years because i was using alcohol you know and what i concluded is that i'm still just naturally naturally an anxious person um and that's okay however i've been hearing for years that cbd is something that a lot of people use um to manage their anxiety and and depression um but i was i don't want to say i was against it i was just super naive about it because um i didn't know if it kind of like got you high and when i was younger i i smoked out i'm talking about like really young um smoke all right you know i smoked pot once in a while and i did not like how it made me feel whatsoever at all i didn't like it at all so i didn't know and i didn't want also in conjunction with that i didn't want to go from alcohol to you know something else that i might um become addicted to or whatever because that's how i am i just have more of like an addictive personality so i was just very naive about it um and i didn't really think about it um the first few months that i was i was sober however earlier this year i kind of became more um open-minded when it when it came to you know came to it so i started researching companies um and what i realized that there was a lot of companies out there that aren't they're kind of like brainwashing i guess in a way um they make their they they when i would reach out to them asking about their products and everything they couldn't tell me where they were sourced um if they were like locally grown if they used any pesticides if they did any sort of testing um if it was just like straight cbd or if they were using like binders and fillers and stuff like that so um just like how i spent a lot of time researching like supplements and vitamins i did the same thing when it came to cbd um and i did find two companies that i really that i really like joy organics is one of them um i've been using them for the past several months i didn't want to just start using it and then jump on here and give my opinion i really wanted to like wait things out and see what i thought um so that's where i'm at today now i should say that i am affiliated with them and i'm very grateful for this opportunity um but i was before uh i was using them before you know before i had this opportunity um so anyways that's where i stand um i don't want to tell you guys exactly like what i use because i think that's a pretty personal thing and what works for me is not going to work for someone else but i will show you some of the products that i have um anyways so what stood out to me about joy organics is that they were very prompt with their customer service when i asked them my million questions that was probably super annoying so that was that was a mark right there is that you know they were very responsive and they were very courteous about all my annoying questions um they're also a family-owned company and they were established in 2018 so they're pretty they're pretty new um and then they just offered everything that i was looking for um they are made in um in the united states um their products have no binders fillers dyes or unknown substances and that right there is a huge plus because i don't want to put anything in my body that i'm not fully aware of um and then one of the most important things is that they do third party tests they don't just test they test each ingredient and then they test it um they test the final product and i'm all about third party testing you guys probably know that by now now joy organics offers i'm not a scientist i should just let you guys know that probably know that um but uh they offer broad spectrum cd cbd and when i started on this whole you know journey learning about this i did not know anything about this and i i still don't but they offer broad spectrum and i know some people use um full spectrum however they're launching some products that that are full spectrum for those of you guys that are interested but i'm not going to get behind the science of it or everything anyways broad spectrum does not have any any traces of of thc in it whatsoever and that's that's what i wanted um so all the um the hemp is locally grown um in uh in the united states which i really appreciate um let's see what else they're grown and manufactured in the united states they third party tests they have zero thc and then i'll show you some of the products that they do offer so first we'll go with the soft gels and these are them right there um soft gels are just good if like if you would you know take one in the morning um to kind of like get a jump start to your day um and then they also offer the cbd oil that you would just apply directly underneath your tongue and then that's how it's going to absorb and this is obviously going to be a quicker you're going to you're going to feel the effects faster obviously because your body's going to absorb it faster being directly applied underneath your tongue um so those are the two options right there and they do offer different sizes um i should say that i love the bath bombs the bath bombs are great these are excellent obviously for relaxation um these are these are something that i use um i use fairly often and then i also have the gummies and these actually they actually taste pretty good um and you just need one of them and i should also say let's see the sugars are two grams of sugar 15 calories for one and then four grams of carbs um four grams of carbs for one but there's no fillers or anything in these um like a lot of gummies like a lot of gummies have so i don't know i i don't take that i don't take cbd every every day and i should say i like i said i'm a naturally anxious person but i feel like i don't need to and some people might think that's i don't know that's not good or whatever but um i just don't i notice that there's just some days that i'm just more anxious than others and i don't want to take it every day because i don't really need to and i also should point out that i've been really tracking my cycles lately the past few months i mean i've always tracked them but i'm talking about like my moods and my um energy levels and things like that and i've noticed that i'm a lot um more anxious at certain points in my cycles than others so uh but that's that's a topic for another day um but yeah i like i said i'm an affiliate with the company and everything like that so that does mean that you guys will get a percentage off if you use my link in my code i will have that um link directly below if you're watching this on instagram then you can just go to my bio and click on shopjoy organics and um i'll have the code and everything provided there i think i think it's kims15 i should have probably looked that up before i before i recorded this but anyways it'll be linked below but you will get 15 off your order um if you use that that code and um uh it doesn't cost anything extra for you obviously you just get a percentage off and then i get a small commission for it so um they do ship to all 50 states um however they don't ship uh they don't ship internationally and um some people have asked me before when i talked about supplements um if they're vegan now i should say that the oils and the gummies are vegan so these two are gonna be vegan but the um the soft gels which are obviously the little like pill form or whatever and then the balms that you're gonna rub into your hands those are not vegan in case anyone's interested in that and they all have a um shelf life of 18 months so anyways um if anyone has any questions let me know i just wanted to share this company with you because it took me quite a while to find one that i was comfortable with using and um that offered really good customer service so yeah if that if anyone has any questions let me know um otherwise hope you have a great day", "VQo5mZ_0hvA": "what's going on guys it's Christian from access labs here to talk about the age-old question full-spectrum versus isolate we've all either bought both products and one works better than the other whatever it may be but I'm here to talked about full spectrum and why it is proven to be better for most of all of our customers typically whenever you're dealing with a full spectrum product you have a variety of cannabinoids within the implant that you're giving within our oil with an isolate CBD product all you are getting is straight isolate so all the entourage effect does not come into play whenever you're doing with the CBD isolate product so as I'm pulling this poker chip you see every single other cannabinoid that's coming with it that is a full-spectrum product but if you are looking at a isolate product this is what its gonna look like so as you can see only one cannibal is coming coming with it and it is just CBD so that is the easiest way to really describe the differences between CBD full-spectrum and CBD pure isolate products so if you guys ever do have any questions we're always here here at access labs to not for you to give a quick call to and we're always here to help thanks", "n_UjDaIEjxI": "chances are either you or somebody you know is using cbd right now and so here's my ask if you don't use cbd right now i'm not trying to convert you if you do use cbd i want you to buy it from our farm and here's why i'm going to give you two reasons first of all we farmed processed formulated bottled and labeled these bottles right here ourselves we did the whole thing i can tell you exactly what's in this bottle if you're using cbd right now cbd tincture cbd oil whatever chances are you don't know what's inside your bottle is it made from crude oil it's made from distillate it's made from isolate is it is it thc free or is there any cbd in it at all you can buy a bottle just like this it says hemp oil on it and it's actually made from hemp seed oil there's no cbd in it whatsoever you can use it for cooking so you're paying a high premium for something that doesn't even have the medicinal qualities if you want to call it that not making any claims again of cbd so i can tell you exactly what's in this bottle because it hasn't left a 20 mile radius of right where i'm standing right now we've done everything ourselves second reason is because we've done it all ourselves it's just albert and i doing all this we can offer it for about half the price of what other premium cbd brands sell these bottles for and so you can save some money so we offer it in uh two different doses there's a 1000 milligram bottle and a 2 000 milligram bottle both are under the legal limit of 0.3 thc that's less than one third of one percent thc so it's a legal product in all 50 states and you can go to greenmethodfarms.com and purchases there will send it to your doorstep free shipping maybe you don't want to buy cbd

anyway greenmethodfarms.com thanks for watching this video and we'll talk to you my name is soon i have rheumatoid arthritis throughout my body not long ago i developed a lot of pain across both teeth down both legs my nephew told me about bringing that to foreign oil i tried it i'm not here to put down other oils but i will say green method farms cbd oil is far superior i have tried the tincture

it just relaxes you so much so please buy this this is the best i've ever had hi i suffer from severe copd that causes a lot of anxiety and bad sleep habits since trying green method farms tincture i have much better sleep patterns and my anxiety levels are way low i like this product highly recommend it you", "S0NLUr9T-uc": "[Music] foreign [Music] bye", "ocJfMPLz8BA": "hi guys welcome to another episode of ask dr. Patel where I answer your questions about medical marijuana and CBD oil now today I'm going to answer the question what is full spectrum CBD oil so let's keep it super simple nothing complicated and so basically full spectrum CBD oil consists of CBD and all the other cannabinoids plus all the other chemicals made by heme now the amount of THC is going to be less than 0.3% alright guys so I hope you found this information helpful as always give it a thumbs up below if you liked it make sure you subscribe so that you don't miss out on the next video post your questions in the comments section below and as always you can get more information on my website www.irs.gov alright thanks for tuning in", "Ryl-7pRo6o4": "are you looking for an all-natural product that can provide pain relief combat anxiety and fight cancer then you have to try our new care lumen a full spectrum hemp CBD oil care aluminum in CBD oil is vegan gluten free and contains zero THC no pesticides or herbicides in our oil it's delicious and extremely nutritious care illumina CBD oil get illuminated", "QYMOE3Mg_YA": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "-AyeTwrQn_Q": "[Music] hello and welcome back to minute with miles these are your cbd faqs we're doing the part two video since you asked so many questions last time thanks for staying tuned let's get to it the term entourage effect was first used to describe potential interactions between our body's own endocannabinoids at the cannabinoid receptor the term was later used to describe interactions between different plant cannabinoids when combined at the same time in a person so for example cbd because it doesn't really fit into the lock very well might block some of the effects of thc so this is a potential example of an entourage effect from having a full plant extract rich in multiple different cannabinoids so to this point when we're talking about plus cbd oil and i have a little vial over here you can see it's qualitatively dark in color it's a little bit goopy it's a little bit stinky indicating the presence of hundreds of different molecules that may support an entourage effect a full spectrum hemp extract means taking all of the aerial parts of the hemp plant everything that grows above ground seeds stock leaves flowers and when you do that your oil has at least 400 different molecules it's not just about cbd the thc in plus cbd oil products is not just there for fun it's a naturally occurring component of hemp the united states government defines hemp as the plant cannabis sativa that contains less than 0.3 percent thc in it by dry weight our hemp is in accordance with federal law and we also feel that having trace amounts of thc based on the current scientific literature show that it would have a beneficial effect from the perspective of the entourage effect hey guys time skip all that stuff is still true but i filmed that months ago and i've been very busy working on a bunch of different projects including material to support the release of a new product known as happy lane happy lane is a high quality cbd isolate that contains less than 0.00 percent thc it contains less than 50 parts per million thc so if you're worried about the thc content in full spectrum hemp extracts such as what you would find in plus cvd then we think you're gonna love what happy lane has to offer some of us are gonna be wondering about whether or not they can take happy lane if they're likely to be regularly drug tested by their employer and with this we must express some caution the reason being that even though it contains less than 0.00 thc it still does have cbd in there it can still pop a false positive on some of these drug tests so we just can't say either way that being said we know that you've been asking for this and it's going to help some of you feel a lot more comfortable not all cbd isolates take you down the happy lane in fact depending on how you isolate your cbd certain types of solvents or things like this that molecule might bind to the receptors in a different way than naturally occurring cbd does leaving you feeling sick and tired the fact is that happy lane is extracted using supercritical co2 free of any harsh chemical solvents that might cause you to not feel so great the same scientific rigor that cv sciences applies to plus cbd when it comes to published peer-reviewed articles quality assurance and quality standards we have applied to happy lane so yes i know this sounds like a commercial i'm just excited to offer you the market has spoken that you have been asking for a good quality cbd isolate and we have been able to deliver we just took a little bit of time to perfect it so end of this faq video for now i hope that you appreciate this new information give this stuff a try and if you do try happy lane let me know how it feels thank you take care be well until next time", "o8RtMQtluxE": "it's just not bitter you know like the the thing that most cbd oil is this has replaced it with a nice sort of turp in it welcome back to the ismoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host tyler green today i'm going to be taking a look at this cbd oil offered by encasa botanics it has a twist and i'm excited to share it with you right here on the icemoke channel let's get into it big thanks to encasa botanix they sent me over these products after getting in touch to tell me about their range they work with growers out in switzerland who produce some awesome cbd flowers for the swiss market and for the european market these particular oils have been extracted from the white widow cbd hemp plant which is a plant grown by this swiss company and kept in its natural balances for the oil so very different to how a lot of the oil ends up in the bottle before you when you buy cbd oil from a lot of suppliers it will be using various grades of hemp sometimes industrial hemp sometimes specific hemp strains and sometimes other strains that have been grown for their high cbd content and low thc content also defined as hemp but not listed in the eu's official definition of it this is an oil which has been extracted from one strain a name strain that this company are happy with so rather than it being a cannabis oil just extracted from any old hemp it has come from a specific source and i believe you can taste it we're going to try that out and demonstrate a little bit later in the video lab tests are available on the ancasa botanics website for the cbd oil which is good always willing to be seeing lab tests in 2020 when it comes to cbd products inside the box we have this 15 ml bottle here the regular size is probably the 10 mil bottle but they have a 15 ml bottle available on site and looking at the product in a bit more detail the bottle's got a really cool look to it first of all they have opted for see-through transparent glass bottles which enables you to see the color of the oil more clearly it isn't as photo protective of some of the photo synthetic balances so store it in a cool dark place but it is good to be able to see the oil inside the dropper itself i really like this sort of wood effect that they've gone for i really like like wood as a material and the dropper that they've gone for they've got a white sort of rubberized lid and a wooden part to the lid as well and then in here you've got the glass dropper which you can see on the back of the bottle it says full spectrum organic hemp extract infused with mct oil cbd 5 500 milligrams thc 0.2 natural flavor from terpenes shake well before use food grade ethanol extraction that's cool store in a cool dry place away from sunlight can be refrigerated used within one year of opening distributed by encasa botanics a produce of switzerland i believe that this has been infused with mct oil to bring it down to the legal classifications that you can have in cbd oil in the uk the swiss market actually has a thc limit of one percent thc so potentially the white widow cbd plant in its natural form is a little bit stronger than the 0.2 percent thc probably virgin up to the one percent thc mark as a result the resulting oil has been made the correct potency using mct oil this is actually common practice when it comes to cbd extractions because you are playing around with some strict legal sort of definitions and percentages so what often happens is it gets to a certain stage in the extraction process they look at the end result and then they make that the correct potency for the market that it's being sold in we're going to go straight in and taste it because taste test is part of the review right so first of all oh if you give it a smell it has got a weedy smell to it that doesn't smell like other cbd oil it has got like a real unique aroma profile from the terpene balance that it has which you can really smell it's not got like a bitterness instead it's got a sweetness which comes through in the aroma we're going to see how it translates into the taste of the cbd oil so i'm going to put some under my tongue and then swirl it round in my mouth a bit to get the flavour do you know what that has almost got hints of chocolate to the flavor to it it is really terpy you can taste the turps when you put it my guinea pig just tried to jump on top of his home which he's never done before fell off again it's really distracted me you can really taste the terps they are perceivable from when you put the oil in your mouth under your tongue it sort of sort of seeps along your tongue and you sort of start to get that sort of terpy aroma flavor even coming through the flavor itself is sweet rather than bitter it certainly is cbd and i get a kind of cbd taste that sort of comes through after with almost anything that i eat that's a cbd product the cbd gummies that i tried last week on the channel are a good example of that you sort of swallow them eat them everything tastes sugary and sweet and then you get a bit of a cbd taste so i can taste cbd but i can also taste the white widow cbd terpenes and it is completely different to what you'd expect as i mentioned ever so slight sort of chocolatey hint to a turpy weedy kind of flavor right it's more weedy in the in the smell than the flavour but the flavor is also weedy as well so that's a cool thing when it comes to cbd oil so five percent that means there's 500 milligrams of cannabidiol in this bottle this being the 15 mil bottle it means that there are 750 milligrams of cannabidiol in this bottle so if you just take that and work out your dosage from that you'll probably end up using half a syringe or quarter of a syringe under your tongue once or twice a day depending on requirements so i like the cbd oil especially for the flavour which is nice and different to what i was expecting terpe they also sent me over some cbd isolate now this is not something that i've used for a number of years but i just wanted to show you it on the channel in this video because encasabotanic's cbd isolate has got this lovely sort of crystalline look to it it looks like sugar it's very fluffy it's very crystalline pure cannabidiol i've never actually tasted what that tastes like it's pretty much got no flavor pure cannabidiol there's no smell to it when it's this pure it has lost all of its terpenes it's lost all of the other minor cannabinoids any hints of thc that were in there and all that remains is the cannabidiol really cool stuff so that is their cbd isolate available on their website in terms of price points this is coming in at 29 pounds 99 for a bottle of 10 mil or 43 pounds 99 for a bottle of 15 mil and the isolate is coming in at eight pounds for half a gram or 15 pounds for the four gram of the cbd isolate this is good for adding into your own edibles or products or anything that you want to infuse with cbd that makes it a good product for those who are looking to make their own cbd products constructive criticism i think that the box maybe could have a little bit more information on it perhaps what is inside the bottle but it does have a handy tag that says see the inside bottle for ingredients i really like the branding of the bottle itself but as mentioned is not as protected so keep it in a dark place out of direct sunlight otherwise you will notice it's sort of changing in consistency or color or appearance i don't know exactly what it's going to do but you you'll notice something over a period of it being left in sunlight and casa botanics are definitely a small boutique cbd brand on the uk market they are working directly with a swiss producer which is really cool stuff so it's different to what you'll see out there on the market for the most part uh due to it being extracted from the white widow cbd i think that is super interesting i'm gonna have some more yeah it's got a nice kind of um it's a very complex dirt profile that's just not bitter you know like the the thing that most cbd oil is this has replaced it with a nice sort of turp in it so i like that and overall i like being casabotanics products big up to those guys for sending it over remember you can get them on the encasa botanics website there will be a link in the comments and remember to use the code i smoke for 15 percent off if you want a nice little discount on the cbd sold

Instagram post to which I announced I would be embarking on a little 30 day journey to test out the broad spectrum hemp oil tincture for sleep by the brand calm by wellness so I have suffered from intermittent symptoms of anxiety and insomnia throughout my entire life and with that I have tried a variety of treatments and medications to help me with that and I just really haven't found the right option for me I have tried other CBD products in the past that just really haven't kind of worked so when I came across home by wellness after doing a lot of research on the brand itself I really thought it would be a good match because they are super clean transparent in terms of how their plants are grown where they are sourced how the product is produced and even tested so that really made me want to embark on this journey to really see if this CBD helps me with my symptoms of anxiety and insomnia so in today's video I just wanted to sit down and first talk a little bit about what CBD is and how it affects and works with our body to help with a variety of physical ailments I think DVD along with medical marijuana of course it's having a huge moment in the medical and even beauty industry I think we hear CBD all over the place CBDs than this CBDs in that but you might not necessarily know exactly what the heck CBD is and what it does not I would sit down and explain what CBD is and then of course I want to talk about calm by wellness as a brand a little bit more about who they are what they believe in in terms of their products and you a little bit more information about what they offer in terms of broad spectrum CBD products and then lastly I want to talk about how I'm going to be using this product to test whether or not it helps me with my symptoms of anxiety and insomnia over the next month so before I jump into the video I first want to kind of put a little disclaimer out there all of the information that I am providing in today's video I don't want that to serve as a replacement for medical advice from your trusted physician or natural Pathak provider always if you are starting a new supplement you know just like a new exercise routine you always want to just kind of run it by your physician first so make sure you do that again if you are looking into trying CBD products so with that little disclaimer out of the way let's just go ahead and jump right into it I first want to talk a little bit about CBB what it is what it's used for and kind of how it works in our bodies so the CBD actually stands for cannabidiol so it's an acronym for one of the chemical compounds found in the marijuana plant so of course we have THC which I think most people traditionally think of when they hear the marijuana plant right however there's also another chemical compound in the marijuana plant which is cannabidiol or CBD so together THC and CBD together they are called cannabinoids CBD cannabidiol has no psychoactive effects so you're not gonna get high from it THC does carry those psychoactive effects and you will get that high or the traditional high that you think of when smoking marijuana the Hanabi dial is used for a variety of physical ailments and it is known and it has been studied to show that it can help improve symptoms of pain of course anxiety it can help to improve your sleep it helps with inflammation and nausea there are many more symptoms and kind of ailments that CBD can help with but those are kind of the main ones that I wanted to mention the other thing that I wanted to talk about is if you're looking for a CBD product you're going to see broad-spectrum and I'm going to say that a lot too because all of home buy wellness their products are broad-spectrum you're going to see broad-spectrum and isolate CBD product I say full-spectrum CBD products what I mean by that is these products contain all of the cannabinoids outside of THC in that product so there are different cannabinoids which I will kind of list here as a scrolling list because they're mouthfuls but in addition to cannabidiol broad spectrum CBD products contain these other cannabinoids that help to really work with the body's endocannabinoids system so without getting too technical we have naturally-occurring cannabinoids in our brain and when we introduce external cannabinoids such as CBD it helps to enhance the efficiency of our internal cannabinoids to help maintain homeostasis it is a really great compound that works along with our brain it doesn't really bind to receptors it just kind of helps enhance again those internal endocannabinoids that we already have so that it can help improve certain symptoms that we may be experiencing if you really want the best effects from a CBD product you do want to lean towards broad-spectrum products versus I they're kind of only getting one cannabinoid versus all of the cannabinoid proper so in terms of calm by wellness they produce full spectrum CBD products they are based out of our vine California they have a variety of CVD products such as gummies they of course have tinctures for sleep and just general calm they have topicals and they also have CBD products for your pets which i think is really amazing they are super transparent they have locally sourced farmers to which they produce the actual plant out of Oregon Northern California and Colorado their actual production plant is I think within 10 miles from the calm by wellness headquarters so they are super hands-on in terms of the production of their product they are involved in all steps of the process some other CBD brands they outsource their farmers they don't have access to the products being produced and a lot of them don't have any sort of safety testing calmed by wellness has third party safety testing so you can actually review this report on their website it shows you and it just breaks down exactly what they're testing when they are trying to see how safe this product is they look for things like pesticides this does not contain and a lot of other CBD companies they don't test for safety so another thing that I want to mention if you're looking into getting into CBD definitely do your research because not all CBD products are created equal they just aren't call my wellness is organic it is gluten-free it is sweetened with stevia I have the blueberry lavender flavor and it is it is so delicious a lot of CVD products taste like it's very bitter and it tastes like you are essentially eating the marijuana plant it a lot of them the taste just is not palatable however they have I think like a strawberry lemonade flavor and again this is the blueberry lavender and when I did taste this last night it was actually very lovely so I know a lot of people think CBD tastes gross and a lot of it does but this tastes really nice so again call my wellness is super pure they're really dedicated to producing the highest quality and purest form of broad-spectrum CBD products on the market again I do want to mention that this is THC free because it does not contain that specific cannabinoid so you're not going to get any psychoactive effects from these CBD product with that just based on how transparent clean and safe these products are I really thought that this was the right brand to partner with and try out their products for my anxiety and insomnia if I'm going to be ingesting it and trying it over the course of the month I want to be very sure that what i am trying is going to be safe for my body I'm not just going to try anything because I don't want to try something that could be potentially harmful that I definitely thought called by wellness was a really great fit for me personally so with that I decided to try out there as mentioned there broad-spectrum hemp extract oil for sleep it is in there blueberry lavender flavor as I have mentioned and how you're supposed to take this as you take one dropper one hour before bed each night and it is supposed to help improve anxiety and also the quality of your sleep so me personally I experience a lot of my anxiety right before bed or kind of in the evening I am go go go go go all day long so when I get home and I have time to kind of sit and kind of reflect on my day or just you know things calm down a little bit that's usually when my anxiety kind of flares up so that's why I picked the sleep version because I wanted something that would help me with my sleep and my anxiety in the evenings so when I took my first initial dose is to when I'm out under my tongue for faster absorption I really felt a sensation of calm probably 30 minutes after of taking it I didn't feel sedated I didn't feel loopy or anything like that I just felt calm and it definitely helped curb my anxiety so that is a really great sign so far so over the next month I'm going to be tracking my sleep via the sleep watch app I believe it is which is available on my Apple watch and I'll be tracking it on my iPhone as well I really want to see how my sleep quality is affected when using this product I also will be checking in intermittently to let you know how I'm feeling in terms of my symptoms of anxiety I know that's kind of a subjective thing so it's hard to give you you know objective data on that so I will just kind of touch it and let you know how I am feeling so with that definitely be sure to check back over the next month or updates I'll be posting them to my Instagram stories and then at the end of the month I'll sit down and do a full review video of this product which I have very high hopes for and especially after just an initial dose I'm really really optimistic that this can be a really great product for my anxiety and insomnia so a lot of information I just threw at you if you have any questions definitely leave them in the comments down below questions regarding CVD I'd be happy to answer them definitely check out in the meantime be calmed by Wellness website which I am listed at the bottom of my screen if you're interested in learning more about CVD and more about the brand itself so with that being said I just want

extract that is in oil form and comes with a dropper and that's how you consume it into your body or your bloodstream and today I'm going to show you how simple it is to use the Green compass CBD tinctures [Music] if we were meeting for the first time my name is Kristy Nash and I am an attorney turned entrepreneur I practiced commercial litigation for about 15 years and today and no longer practice law I run two businesses from home thanks to technology and social media I love what I do now because I get to help other people like you also build online businesses because you deserve something for you so CVD tinctures you've probably heard the term and maybe got a little confused is it a tincture isn't an oil what's the difference they're pretty much the same thing I think the tincture is just a fancy way of saying CBD oil and a green compost level we have variety of tinctures depending on different strengths we have 500 milligrams all the way up to 2,500 milligrams we also have different flavors with our teachers we have a natural that has no extra flavoring in it whatsoever it's just a natural CBD extract along with the carrier oil and the MCT oil and then we also have a citrus flavor that is flavored with a citrus essential oil we also have a mint flavor and a cinnamon flavor which is by far my favorite all of our flavorings are created with essential oils and people often ask me when do I take my CBD tincture and the answer to that is it's going to vary depending on the person and depending on why we were using CDD so for example if you are taking a CBD teacher because of some anxiety during the day stress during the day to boost your overall mood or energy level during the day then I would recommend you take it in the morning I keep this on my bathroom counter and I take it after I brush my teeth if you are using it maybe for sleep insomnia maybe you have anxiety when you put your head lay your head on the pillow and and it keeps you up at night then I would recommend you take it more in the evening however not right before you go to bed maybe a couple of hours before you go to bed for those issues if you're using it for pain for sore muscles you know that's gonna vary during the day when you might need it most but I do always recommend that you take your CVD teacher on a regular basis it should be a part of your everyday wellness routine because there are so many health and wellness benefits to CVD some of which you probably didn't even know you needed I've heard so many stories of people taking the CVD for maybe some pain in their knee and then they realized that they were suffering from anxiety and major stress during the day and taking the CBD for their knee actually helped them in that area of their life as well so always recommend you take their tincture on a consistent basis so there is simply our tinctures come in a bottle with a dropper and the dropper has measurements so our dropper at its full capacity is 1.0 MLS and then you can drop them down until you get your desired measurement amount right now we're at 0.75 drop a little more out we're about at point five and then here we are at just about 0.25 MLS and you simply just use the dropper find your desired amount and the way you consume the tincture is you drop it under your tongue that is the best and fastest way to get it into your bloodstream you do want to let it sit under your tongue for about 60 seconds and absorb before you swallow but that is how simple it is to use the Green compass local CBD tinctures I love of the dropper have some measurements on there for you and also all of our bottles come with a very clear label on the backside know exactly what is in your bottle you know how many milligrams of the CBD hemp flower extract exactly is in this bottle and then you also can scan the QR code at the bottom of everything kompis global product to show you immediately a lab analysis aport that comes from a third-party lab all of our products are tested by a third-party low so that's it that's how simple it is let me know in the comments if you've tried a CBD tincture yet and if so what for and make sure you check out my other videos about grand combis global CBD in particular and make sure you check out my show notes because I have a freebie there for you that gives you a lot of information on what you should know before you choose your CBD if you found this information helpful don't forget to give me a thumbs up and let me know and I always appreciate when you share my content or subscribe to my channel because that

info you need hemp and CBD", "wAF_M0k6u1w": "in this video i'm going to explain how i've made my own brand of cbd oil and i'll also demonstrate how to use it so i decided to make a full spectrum product and that's because in my personal opinion also the opinion of thousands of my customers and a full spectrum does is the most effective it does work the best a full spectrum means that when the hemp plant is growing it has over 100 cannabinoids in there the two main ones are cbd and thc cbd is non-psychoactive thc is the part that gets people stormed when taken in large amounts so legally here in the uk we are legally allowed to have 0.2 thc in a product because it's such a miniscule amount that it's not going to cause any psychoactive effect but what happens is when we take cbd with a little bit of thc all the other phytocannabinoids from the hemp plant the terpenes the essential oils when we consume them as a whole plant full spectrum and what happens is once they get into the body the working synergy together and so that and the create an entourage effect in the body which means it has a greater impact on the cannabinoid system so a full spectrum is the most effective oil that you can get so with a full spectrum product though i do need to make you aware that if you were drugs tested it could possibly show as a false positive on a drugs test so very similar to if you were to eat poppy seeds they would also show as a false positive now if you are if you have a driving job or if you get drugs tested at work and we do have lab tests for our products and so if it did show us a false positive on a drugs test you could show them the lab test to prove that you are just taking a food supplement and you're not consuming drugs so my oil is a full spectrum oil it's got all of the cannabinoids in there the terpenes the flavonoids the essential oils and it's also been mixed with organic hemp seed oil and it's got a little bit of peppermint flavour in there just to mask the hempy taste because it is a full spectrum it is it is a quite a strong taste in oil and i have had it have it had it developed so that once you do put it into your mouth it does disperse and absorb into mucous membranes very very quickly so within a minute or so it's it's dispersed and got into the bloodstream i've had my oil made here in the uk it's been manufactured in a gmp facility so the hygiene there is is absolutely excellent um we've also had it it was extracted with a co2 extraction now co2 extraction means that it's the cleanest purest form of extraction another type of extraction would be an ethanol extraction and the reason why i didn't choose that is because an ethanol extraction it can leave residual solvents in the oil so i wanted this to be as clean and pure as possible i have had all my products tested at a laboratory so what the lab test proves it's a third party laboratory test as well and what it proves is is that it has got less than 0.2 thc in there so it's 100 legal and safe to use it also proves that if it says it's got 500 milligrams of cbd in the bottle then it's actually got 500 milligrams of cbd in the bottle because when you're buying a product like this that's what you're paying for you're paying for the milligrams so a lab test proves that it has got that amount in it it also shows that it's pesticide and chemical free it's non-gmo it is vegan friendly and it hasn't got any heavy metals or residual solvents left in there as well i chose to put my oil into a 30 ml bottle usually a cbd oil will come in a 10 ml bottle but i chose a 30 ml bottle and because it's mixed with organic hemp seed oil i wanted to get as much essential fatty acids per dose as possible so with it being in a larger bottle it just means that you're going to get more omega-3s six and nines every time you take a serving and it also is in a brown bottle and the reason why i chose that is because this brown bottle it the glass it actually protects protects it from oxidation and it also protects it from uv rays so i do recommend storing it in a cool place you don't have to keep it in the fridge but just don't put it on the radiator or in the sunshine and just keep it somewhere cool this bottle can also be recycled as well so once you've finished with it and just pop it in your recycling bin and you're doing your bit for the environment when i do send out um products through the post i do use biodegradable wrap bubble wrap and the bags that i use are also 100 recycled and they're also bio biodegradable as well so the way that you would use my cbd oil it comes in two strands i've got 500 milligram and a thousand milligram if you're new to cbd it's always best to start on the lowest strength of 500 milligram and i always suggest to start on 10 milligrams a day and that can be taken in two servings so five milligrams in the morning five milligrams in the afternoon after several days if you feel that you're noticing a bit of a difference but you want a bit of a better effect you can increase it to 10 milligrams in the morning 10 milligrams in the afternoon which would give you double the amount 20 milligrams a day but i say to start on 10 milligrams because i'd say a good 50 of my customers find that 10 milligrams a day is sufficient for them so with this bottle it's got 500 milligrams in the bottle it has a one mil per pet and that one mil per pet holds 16 milligrams in total so all you would do is you would just have a third of a pet in the morning and a third of a pet in the afternoon and a third of a paper holds five milligrams so that's five milligrams in the morning five milligrams in the afternoon the one thousand milligram bottle that because it's got double the amount in a third of a pet is 10 milligrams and so if you wanted to have a higher amount per day you could just have you could buy the 1 000 milligram bottle have a third of a pet 10 milligram in the morning and a third of a pet 10 milligram in the afternoon that would give you 20 milligrams a day so if you are new to cbd and this is the first product that you're looking to buy and this product if you were to just take 10 milligrams per day this 500 mg bottle which will last you for 50 days so always remember we always have some great special offers on you can mix and match any of our products on the site uh so if you buy two products you can get 10 off and if you buy if you put four items into your basket the fourth item the cheapest item will be free so buy three get your fourth item for free i hope you like enjoyed watching this video

wellness and all things CBD this is my office this is my temple and this it's all green TV is it a banger what's happening this David it's all green TV now other people worry if taken see buddy is gonna make them grow fail a drug test well we talked about it in other videos I thought proofs in the pudding so what have I done over the last 10 days I've been taking see 20 50 milligrams every single day and here's what happens now I want to show you that I've completely clear system beforehand so I've taken a test in advance we're gonna check back in the overlay so you can see that you can see I'm being completely honest I'm clean as a whistle so we've got on the under cameras on the best angle so this is the multi screen drug test can test for many different things I'm gonna dunk in here for just 15 seconds so I'm just gonna so there you go that's my piss on a jar so two lines means negative so let's find out over the next 10 days if taking CBD we're gonna use sample vial for no fail so it's not branded yet you'll see if broad-spectrum CBD can cause you to have all failed drug tests that's it so that's it this was the benchmark this was me introducing myself as an absolute weirdo let's find out what happens when we take CBD oil we use 500 milligram what do you think 10 days well we found a drug test so I doubt right so day one go ahead I'm branded bottle for a no-fail CBD we're gonna take one full pipette to 10 more bottle 500 milligram in that means 50 mg per day which is generally in good allowance to take per day part of this testing option we're taking these drops to see whether or not will we favor drugs tests of CBD so just so you know we could do 10 days Nora okay Google what's the date today it is Wednesday the 14th of August 2019 there you go so this is day 1 I think I want [Music] [Music] 25 20:19 what [Music] so got this little bad boy here this is a drum turf the actually test for loads more things than just CBD doesn't necessarily test for THC and this is the thing people worry about is see video oil will bring up the THC metabolites that's what shows up on a drugs test and if you work in an engineering industry nursing medical science police force whatever the last thing you wanted to be pulled up for a CDT compulsive drug test to get them in the forces and sharp like that the THC if you haven't ever had a split or haven't been

description below you", "BUeWdf3tv-c": "[Music] let's now take a look at the joy organics line of tinctures our tinctures come in four strengths and in four flavors the flavours are an unflavored natural formula we have mint which is the most popular flavor followed by orange the second most popular flavor followed by lemon the third most popular flavor the strengths are a seven and a half milligram per serving or 225 milligrams per bottle they also come in a 15 milligram per serving or 450 milligrams per bottle 30 milligrams per serving or 900 milligrams per bottle and then our strongest strength is 45 milligrams per serving or thirteen hundred and fifty milligrams per bottle now our tinctures are very clean very simple it begins with our organic hemp extract or CBD oil we then mix it with a carrier oil in the lemon in orange we use a certified organic MCT oil in our mint in natural we use a certified organic extra virgin olive oil and you might say well why did you use two different oils so that customers can choose their oil some people are fans of mct and by the way there's a significant difference between MCT oil that's non-organic and MCT oil that is organic it's not the difference between a spinach that is non-organic and a spinach that is organic there's a significant difference in the way the to our process an organic MCT oil is a far superior oil than a non certified organic MCT oil the only other thing that we add is in our our orange lemon and mint we use a certified organic essential oil flavoring a very minor amount just to give it a little hint of a taste nothing overpowering nothing strong and so again a very clean simple way to consume CBD through your mouth and one of the things just to point out I talked a little you just say is to put this under your tongue and absorb it sublingually so that's why if you read our usage instructions and this is going to be true with any other responsible brand out there it's going to say to put into mouth and swallow so anyhow that's a little bit of a little site educational note into why we do not say on our labels to hold under the tongue and allow it to be absorbed because it's a claim that cannot be made with a CBD product so anyhow you'll love these they taste great there's no other ingredients other than what I've described and it's one of the reasons why teachers are very popular in the marketplace for us it's our second most popular product behind our soft gels and I think when you try our tinctures when you smell them and you taste them you're gonna go wow these are different than anybody else in this store [Music]", "7t7Jkz8Iu7k": "as part my daily routine I always take stevedore I use it before bed and I use it in the mornings when I wake up we've obviously

is to me it's almost like giving my anxiety a volume dial where it kind of dials everything down people say oh does it help for depression I think for depression maybe you need something that's a bit more upper whereas to me CBD oil is a relaxant in a way so I feel like it relaxes me and I have a tendency to sometimes be too hyper and I don't think that's necessarily my natural state I would say I'm pretty calm but the day to day life he's pressuring me and because I'm an overachiever and a perfectionist then my anxiety can go off the roof okay with things I have to do with chores with stuff kids running around and I want to cook and I want to do this don't wonder that I just don't have time so all these thoughts inside my head it's like it dials the volume down and just helps me deal it's a little bit like meditating but without having to meditate so what meditation does it it takes you away from this situation and you're able to see yourself from the outside a bit more because you're very present in the moment so you can choose your reactions you say Oh am i reacting like this right now and and and this all goes through in sort of like the backlog of conversation in your head right um so it's behind the scenes and that's what CBD oil does so I don't think the effect is very upfront it's more like backwards it's almost like something here it's just more relaxed more able to make a decision on how to react so you tend to overreact less and manage your emotions better and I think that's why it's so helpful for me because it gives me that step back when day-to-day life becomes very stressful the difference between meditation is obviously meditation you have to put the time you have to make the effort I think that's really important I don't think it takes away from other you know self healing and self balancing activities but it is definitely a tool that helps so I would recommend CBD for people who are a bit like me I've been using it for I would say just under a year and I actually just started using it on my vajay because people are saying that it relaxes everything there and sometimes I struggle with finding time to be sexual just because of day-to-day life pressure again I'm a workaholic so I would just go and sit at the desk and do my work on my laptop and and I forget to bring attention to other things that are also very important so balancing I would say CBD oil helps me balance and I would let you know about the downstairs Department and whether I recommend using it or not because I literally just started today so if you're considering using CBD oil if you're using it you're not sure about it if you have questions put it in the comments and I would do my best to reply and help you out good luck", "hELge80YTJM": "hi I'm Derek and this is CBD with dB in this segment I'm going to discuss full-spectrum extract or full-spectrum oil from cannabis plants whether they be from marijuana were from hemp essentially full-spectrum is really pretty simple what it means is we distilled down all the very goodness and the best of the plant down into one concentrate now alternatively when we try and make a concentrate and we've reduced it down to just one ingredient that's what we call an isolate might be THC might be CBD might be CVG with full-spectrum we've got all of the cannabinoids that have come out of the plant along with all of the other goodness now a good comparison would be like getting caffeine from tea if we wanted to we could just extract the caffeine directly out of the tea leaves and we'd end up with a caffeine isolate now what makes more sense is we could put the tea leaves directly in water and go ahead and make some tea and then we would get the full spectrum the full essence of the tea itself we get the caffeine we were after plus we would get all the other goodness not only is it much healthier for you but it's much easier for your body to absorb it in this action now our tea where our full spectrum cannabis oil contains more than just the cannabinoids it contains all kinds of other goodness things like terpenes antioxidants vitamins and amino acids all things that are beneficial in their own right now unfortunately we can't just put marijuana in a jar of water and get the same kind of an extract because most of the things we're looking for are also oils which don't want to dissolve in water now there are a variety of methods used to be able to distill a full spectrum oil the one commonality is they all seem to end up with something that's very dark and gooey the clearer and thinner that it is the more it's likely it's been distill to how things removes from it though it may still be good stuff it's not really full spectrum it's more like broad spectrum it's not going to be quite as good at providing what we call the Entourage affect the entourage effect is the combination effect that occurs when all of these ingredients interact together with the body to elevate the effects of the cannabinoids in themselves they'll help provide the cannabinoids with a better access to the body as well as providing beneficial effects on their own this is what we call the entourage effect it's kind of like Frank Sinatra Frank was awesome on his own but magic was created when he was with his entourage an entourage is more than just the sum of the parts it's like an amplification of all those parts together now most people when they think of the entourage fact are thinking about how the cannabinoids help each other out to magnify their own effects but more and more they're finding that the other ingredients are helping to magnify the cannabinoids also almost like a support band being behind the Rat Pack while they're on stage when someone is using cannabis to attempt to control cancer or epilepsy or some other major internal issue there appears to be a much greater likelihood of success when using full-spectrum products now the full-spectrum issue is a lot less important when we're talking about recreational cannabis use it should be noted that most of these other ingredients we're talking about for full-spectrum actually can't survive the high temperatures that go on during smoking or vaping full spectrum products are generally more effective when taken sublingually Whirley rectally or transdermally however those last two methods are rarely discussed I'll be covering those in a future segment hopefully this has been able to help clear up some of the smoke for you around the full spectrum definition and what it really means this has been

Association of America over 40 million adults in the US experience anxiety making it the most common mental health condition studies have shown that low to moderate doses of CBD may have an anxiety reducing effect on the brain CBD interacts with a system in your body called the endocannabinoid system in doing so CBD can regulate the stress response and help reduce feelings of panic and fear one is a case series which came out last year that looked at a full spectrum hemp oil that contained on average 25 milligrams of CBD in a capsule this was a study on 72 people and it was looking at people who had either anxiety or sleep as a chief complaint when they gave 25 milligrams on average there was an 80% reduction in symptoms in the first month of the study if you're interested in taking CBD oil for your anxiety talk to your doctor first to make sure it's safe and won't interfere with any medications you're taking you can take CBD oil straight and tincture form to feel the effects within fifteen to thirty minutes or you can eat CBD edibles for a delayed release start with a low dose like 10 milligrams per day and gradually increase your dosage until you feel the desired effect CBD products aren't regulated so always buy your CBD from a reputable seller and make sure it's been lab tested for purity if CBD oil isn't enough to treat your anxiety on its own consider pairing it with other treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy", "zqRNCSX_uJQ": "hey what's going on everybody hope you have a healthy day and if you see what's going on out there you know CBD is extremely popular there's so many companies so many different options it could make your head spin well it was a couple years ago I actually tried a CBD brand didn't really do anything for me I tried a liquid I tried a cream just it just didn't work and I do see this where people say some it will work some don't and it was just a few weeks ago I connected with a company called calm by wellness and had the opportunity to have a conversation what I really impress or what really impressed me was that the company wanted to spend time to introduce themselves what they do what they stand for and then talk about one of their products which they sent to me to try and review it's called sleep and again I've had the opportunity now for a good couple weeks to try it I really wanted to make sure and see how it worked for me before I shared with you now I'm gonna put a link in the description where you could learn more about the company and if you really dive in and learn about the company I think you're gonna be impressed as was I so they thought we'd try sleep before we try some of the other products this is a 17 milligrams per serving blueberry lavender and as far as the ingredients well a couple other things its THC free which was really important to know and when you go onto their website you'll see they've got lab information lab reporting so you'll be able to get that there as well it's a broad spectrum hemp extract sleep turban blend and it's made in the USA so it's all-natural non-gmo organically grown gluten free and again it's processed and made here in the USA as far as the the different blend that it has in there it's got lavender flower chamomile it's got hops lemongrass hoe wood which is leaf orange and pine and jasmine so it's got a really nice combination it's kind of got a fruity combination and as far as taking it you take it about an hour or where there abouts an hour before going to sleep and the recommended is just to take a drop put it under your tongue and then let it dissolve in under your tongue I let it dissolve there about for a met a minute and then I swallow so as far as the product and how it worked for me I tried it both actually with one full dropper and two full droppers just to see the difference so initially the one dropper I felt like it worked okay for me then it went to two droppers and I felt I was getting a bit groggy when I was getting up so then I went back to one but as I started using it over the several days and over a couple weeks what I found is that it does kick in for me where I start getting more relaxed and I then really start getting very tired when I'm laying on my bed and I used before I go to sleep I use I use an acupressure mat and I and I found that when I started using this I really started getting tired now during the night I'm still waking up I'm going to the bathroom so that's not changing a lot but I do find that it is helping me get a bit more relaxed and definitely feeling more tired to fall asleep quicker so that's the results for me so I will say that I do feel like it is working for me when you are looking at the CBD companies it's so important to really know what's behind the company and when you go to the website and they really have a nice website there's a ton of testimonials as well you'll find that they you know they just talk about that they have an in-house farmers in how scientists they also do third-party testing and also as as far as what they do versus other company so other companies outsource their farmers they outsource their science labs and they're not quality tested and this company does do their testing again you can also scroll down and then here is the certificate of analysis and when I actually was talking to some my friends and sharing on Facebook about it they were asking me do you have that and they do have that there and to me that is impressive so you definitely wanted to check out the website so there you go that's my experience they have a number of other products that you can try as well but if you are in need of sleep you know again it's worked for me it's worked for me some and will definitely continue taking it and look forward to trying other products so I'll try and answer any questions you have but please click on the link where you can get more information greatly appreciated if you find this video helped I definitely appreciate also a thumbs up and hope this will work for you as well if you are taking this product I'd love if you would leave your comments that would be really helpful and you know again if you have any questions I'll try and answer those harde everybody have a very healthy day thanks so much for watching we'll see you on the next video take care", "L-p-oOL2R74": "[background music] Cody: Hey all, it's Cody from Sleepopolis\nand today we're taking a look at the suite of CBD products from Sunsoil. Made from organically farmed ingredients,\nthese oils, pills and capsules, oh my, are designed to embody all the rocks and benefits\nof CBD. But do they actually work? That's what we're here to find out. I tested out all these products and I'm here\nto give you the 411 on how they feel, how strong they are, and whether or not they're\nworth your money. So, ready or not, here we go. Based out of Hardwick, Vermont, Sunsoil uses\na holistic, whole planet approach to produce CBD products that aren't just good for the\ncustomer, but also for Mother Nature. How does the brand accomplish this? By putting a special focus on ethical pricing,\ntransplant operational procedures, and verifiable third party testing. As far as products are concerned, Sunsoil\noffers an array of different CBD goodies from soft gel pills to oil tinctures, hard capsules,\nand CBD-infused coconut oil. Though all these different products take on\ndifferent physical forms, they're all derived from USDA-certified organic hemp that's free\nof pesticides and GMOs. We know all of these products utilize CBD,\nbut what in the world is CBD? CBD, or cannabidiol, is a compound found in\nthe flower of the cannabis plant. It's one of the hundred of these different\nphytocannabinoids, with the most popular being the psychoactive tetrahydracannabinol, or\nTHC. However, unlike THC, CBD is not psychoactive. Yes, you heard that correct. CBD does not trigger hallucinations or intoxication\nand it's mostly used to cause a relaxing effect, to alleviate things like joint pain, anxiety,\nloss of appetite, and yes, poor sleep. I should also mention that it's totally legal\nto consume and buy hemp-derived CBD in all 50 states. Although the Internet has been buzzing about\nCBD's positive health benefits for years now, there hasn't been a lot of research done into\nits side effects. However, the studies that have been done have\nfound it to be a safe and well-tolerated compound. For example, a 2011 study which aggregated\ndata from multiple studies, found CBD to be safe in up to 1500 mg dosages per day. A 2017 study which sought to add information\nto that survey further found that not only was CBD safe for long-term use, but it actually\nhad a better side effect profile at treating certain medical conditions like epilepsy or\npsychotic disorders. As I mentioned up top, Sunsoil has a couple\nof different products. They've got this oil tincture here. They have....What is this one? They've got the hard capsules, they have soft\ngel pills, and they have CBD-infused coconut oil. I tried out all these different products and\nfor me the oil tincture worked the best. If you don't like oils, they have these other\noptions for you. Since this one worked best for me, that's\nwhat I'm going to focus on for the rest of this review as we get into my personal experience\nwith the product. The oil either comes in the 600 mg concentration\nfor $30 or 1200 mg concentration for $60. The higher the concentration, the more CBD\nyou're getting per serving. According to Sunsoil, an entire serving is\none full dropper. In the 600 mg bottle, a full dropper has about\n10 mg of CBD in it and the 1200 mg bottle has double that, 20 mg of CBD. Deciding which concentration which is going\nto be right for you is going to really depend on your body size, shape, and weight. It's going to be different for everyone. For reference, I am about 6 feet tall, 165\npounds, so I decided to take a full dropper of the 1200 mg concentration bottle. Again, that's about 20 mg of active CBD which\nfelt right for me. If you're trying CBD for the first time, or\nyou're experimenting with a new brand, I highly recommend that you consult with a medical\nprofessional before doing so. It's going to come as much of a surprise to\nyou, but I'm not a doctor. Everything I'm going to share with you is\nbased solely on my personal experience. Just keep in mind that your own experience\ncould be very different from my own. Speaking of which, let's get into my experience\nwith the Sunsoil oil tincture which I'm going to break down into falling asleep, staying\nasleep, and the morning after. [background music] Cody: One of my biggest problems at night\nis falling asleep. Even if I'm super exhausted, as soon as my\nhead hits the pillow, my mind starts racing with a hundred different thoughts, worries\nand concerns. When I'm looking at a sleep supplement or\na new CBD oil, I need to make sure it's going to be able to quiet my mind and relax my body\nso that I can actually fall asleep at night. I'm happy to report that the oil tincture\nfrom Sunsoil worked like a charm. I took again, a full dropper of the 1200 mg\nconcentration and found that within 15 minutes I was feeling totally relaxed. My shoulders felt loosey goosey and it was\njust this nice fog of relaxation all the way from the tips of my toesies all the way up\nto my head. It definitely quieted me down and got me all\nready for bed and I found it was really easy to fall asleep. Another huge issue I have is staying asleep. Even if I can fall asleep, it's sometimes\ndifficult for me to sustain that slumber over the course of an entire evening. So not only does a sleep supplement or CBD\noil need to be able to knock me out at bedtime, it needs to keep me from waking up in the\nmiddle of the night, which I do most nights. Unfortunately here, the tincture didn't really\nwork for me that well. I'm not that surprised because CBD effects\nusually last for an hour, hour and a half so even if it's able to put me to sleep, usually\nit doesn't keep me sleeping throughout the night. I found here that the Sunsoil products didn't\nleave me sleeping throughout the entire evening and I woke up in the middle of the night most\nnights. Finally, the morning after. One of the biggest complains I hear from our\nfans and readers is that all these sleep supplements and CBD oils make them feel super groggy the\nnext day. I like to consider how the morning after feels\nwhen I'm reviewing a product. Here I'm happy to say that I didn't really\nfeel any grogginess, any hangover, anything like that from the CBD oil. That's probably because the effects wore off\nin the middle of the night, but I still think it's worth noting that I woke up feeling clear\neyed and ready to go for the day. [background music] Cody: OK, so we've gone over the brand, chatted\nabout the ingredients, and gotten into my experience with the Sunsoil oil tincture. Now, it's time to wrap this baby up with a\nfew final thoughts which I'm going to divide into some pros and cons, starting with the\npros. First and foremost, I thought this oil was\nfantastic at getting me to fall asleep. Within 15 minutes of taking it, I felt super\nrelaxed, super cozy, and my mind was really quieted down so it was easy for me to fall\nasleep. Number two, I love that it's made from organic\nmaterials so you can feel good about what you're ingesting. Number three, I think at $30 and $60, this\nCBD is priced really well. A lot of CBD oils go for $100, $150 so this\nis a pretty strong value buy, especially for how it feels. Unfortunately, there were also a few cons. My biggest complaint is that the oil didn't\nreally help me to stay asleep. Again, that's not really the brand's fault. CBD usually wears off after an hour, hour\nand a half but it's still something I feel is worth mentioning. Number two, I didn't really care for the taste\nof either of these oils which either come in a chocolate mint or cinnamon flavors which\nfor me are a little specific and don't really fit into the palate that I generally enjoy. Well folks, that about does it for my review\ninto the Sunsoil suite of CBD products.

methods furthermore I will explain briefly how I came to this method cannabis oil can be used for many projects such as cancer skin problems patents on digestive problems rejuvenation of bones and even your brain cells to name a few for skin conditions like eczema or skin inflammations or skin cancer the use of cannabis can be very effective and very soothing to for people with cancer the use of cannabis oil is very beneficial and ensures that our body can relax and it gets the ability to heal itself in addition it is a pain killer in his entire inflammatory it strengthens your immune system and has an anti-tumor effect it reduces the damage the femur therapy can cause to the nerves and brings the body in a more balanced state in the case of colon cancer laboratory studies show that it really works with lung cancer the sputum production will decrease and it prevents choking cold oil is highly recommended for Parkinson projects the raw oil has many active ingredients that are very beneficial to Parkinson when taken regularly this effect is also noticeable when ingesting Cokely obtained juice from the leaves of the cannabis plant how to use cannabis oil the application of cannabis oil can be done in a number of ways for two are the most efficient the one is on the skin and the second one is under the tongue the oil can be rubbed in daily on the affected area like a kind of ointment it's best to dilute the wheat paste with castor oil instead of other oils in the preparation process because castor oil is a bit thicker and easier to apply and it helps the wheat oil to pet deeper into the skin in the case of any other conditions the cannabis oil is taken orally you can do this in front of a mirror so you can see easily how many drops you take then drop the oil under the tongue and leave it there for a couple of minutes before swallowing it this is done because under the tongue the oil is absorbed by the body much quicker the dosage it's advisable to take the oil every day and to continue the treatment for as long as possible for paint projects it's convenient to take the oil every few hours to keep the analgesic effect constant when it comes to treating a tumor or preventing a cancer from coming back it's enough to take the oil once a day because every oil has a different strength it's very useful to test your daily dose with every new obtained bottle of oil you can do it very easily by taking for example three drops and the next day take four drops build it up slowly every day with one drop until you get slightly high if you're slightly high you know you have to take one or two drops less to set your dose if you become very stoned during this process it's best to relax and enjoy it the effect will decrease sometime the advantage of cannabis oil made on occult meth is compared to the heat of method cannabis contains at least 200 different potentially active medical ingredients other than THC and CBD because there's little research done about these ingredients there's also little known but what we do know is when heating it a lot of it will be lost this inspired me to do a little research on cannabis oil made in a cold method the most common cannabis oil is made with the use of heat this process is called decarboxylation and ensures that the THC acids are converted THC the THC and CBD strongly stimulate the cannabinoid receptors that are naturally present in our body these receptors activate human system and heal the body an additional effect is that the intoxicating effect of the oil is strengthened and therefore more suitable as an anesthetic painkiller in cannabis oil that is made without heating air the assets from the THC are preserved as well as all the other ingredients that are present in the plant the THC acids have a similar effect as the family let alone Aveda the pe\u00f1a from our body which is a balanced riparian molecule this molecule provides an analgesic and and diplomat ory effect it has a positive effect on the immune modulation of our body and takes very effective role in protecting the nerves in chemotherapy the pe\u00f1a itself is also stimulated by the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience in the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience with the use of cold oil is that it works very well it keeps and makes the body healthy if you want a stronger effect you can even use to both oils at the same time because they work in a completely different way I hope this video has given you more clarity about the use of cannabis oil if you have more questions you can use the comments or go to my website feel Ofcom thank you for watching you [Music]", "hQ8lxpUZTHc": "hey friends Dustin here I want to take a minute and just shoot a quick video and let you know a little bit about our year as a family this last year haven't really said much about anything and it's not that we're trying to keep anything a secret but just really haven't said much and I wanted to use this video to kind of come out and let you know about are you this last year cuz I might think you might think it's interesting so 2019 we became farmers Fiona told me a year ago that I was gonna be a farmer so I thought you were crazy but here's the story I my day job is in digital marketing and one of my digital marketing clients is a CVD extraction facility and so I told Rachel early on you know it'd be a lot of fun if we could firm him this year so we reached out to our friends Albert Kelly who have planned pitch the idea to him they said let's do it so we jumped in and we farmed nine acres of industrial hemp this last year and again you might be thinking this is incredibly crazy Dustin farming and Dustin farming hemp I'm gonna just tell you right now this isn't marijuana the genetics that we use are bred for high CBD they're below the legal limit for THC which is the psychoactive property in marijuana the genetics are below 0.3% THC so yeah that's more used for things like aches and pains and people use it for sleep people use it for anxiety there's lots of different people use CBD I'm not going to really get into that because the FDA doesn't a hasn't approved CBD for treating hearing or preventing any diseases so I'm not gonna say anything about that no makin any claims but that's the reason that some people take it chances are you or somebody you know uses CBD so anyway let me tell you a little bit about the farming thing it was really a fun time for our family to be honest kids are teenagers now so it was a good time to be able to teach them about hard work at their hands dirty and there was some real invaluable experiences in the last year we got 12,500 seeds and we propagate those seeds in a greenhouse and when they were ready about a month later we transplanted those seedlings and about three or four inches tall into the field about a hundred yards behind me and about four months later we harvested the plants and at that time the plants were five or six feet tall that's tall as me they it was amazing to watch them grow be honest it was just a great experience and so yeah in the barn I don't know if you can see the barn I think see the barn behind me we hung dry about 9,000 plants and those in the barn and when we were done we combined the plants into a biomass form kind of a chipped kind of form and filled up about 45 super sacks that can hold about 350 400 pounds of this biomass we ended up getting 16,000 pounds of hemp biomass took it down to the processing plant that I worked for just down the street and processed that into CBD distillate and then we ended up making these tincture bottles out of it so we've kind of gone the distance with this whole CBD thing and so I kind of just wanted to tell you about that it's kind of a fun story but we've been up to this last year like I said chances are either you or somebody you know is using CBD right now and so here's my ask if you don't use CBD right now I'm not trying to convert you if you do use CBD I want you to buy it from our farm and here's why I'm gonna give you two reasons first of all we farmed processed formulated bottled and labeled these bottles right here ourselves so we did the whole thing I can tell you exactly what's in this bottle if you're using CBD right now CBD tincture CBD oil whatever chances are you don't know what's inside your bottle is it made from crude oil it's made from distillate made from isolated is it is it THC free or is there any CBD in it at all you can buy a bottle just like this says hemp oil on it and it's actually made from hemp seed oil there's no CBD in it whatsoever you can use it for cooking so you're paying a high premium for something that doesn't even have the medicinal qualities if you want to call it that not making any claims again of CBD so I can tell you exactly what's in this bottle because it hasn't left a 20-mile radius of right where I'm standing right now we've done everything ourselves second reason is because we've done it all ourselves it's just Albert and I doing all this we can offer it for about half the price of what other premium CBD brands sell these bottles for and so you can save some money so we offer it in two different doses there's a 1,000 milligram bottle and a 2,000 milligrams bottle both are under the legal limit of 0.3 percent THC that's less than one third of 1% THC so it's a legal product in all 50 states and you can go to green method Farms calm and purchase is there we'll send it to your doorstep free shipping maybe you don't want to buy CBD but you want to learn more about the farming maybe this is kind of interesting to you and you want to learn more about it at green method farms calm you can go check it out I made kind of a documentary video of the whole process from field preparation all the way to harvest so if you want to hear our story and kind of see some of the images of what we did this last year go ahead and and check that out if you have any questions by the way go ahead and message me you have any questions about the farming process if you have any questions about the products or what's in the products or whatever so anyway green method farms calm thanks for watching this video and we'll talk to you soon [Music]", "7aVRp1GgLNY": "hi I'm dr.

hemp plant there are no cannabinoids in hemp seed oil there is no CBD in hemp seed oil now if you were to look at him oil that's extracted from the leaves and the flowers the hemp plant that is what we use to create our cvd products very different than hemp seed oil if you were to go to Amazon and you type in CBD just about every product listed on Amazon is nothing more than hemp seed oil and anybody who's experiencing a health benefit from hemp seed oil it is largely a placebo benefit so that is the difference between hemp seed oil and hemp oil [Music]", "uR_AJLRDjM8": "hi my name is Charlotte and today I'm going to talk to you about the difference between full spectrum pure CVD and hemp oil that you can buy at the grocery store so we'll start with the grocery store items what you can buy at your local Fred Meijer Whole Foods Walmart what have you vitamin cottage is hemp oil that has been refined strictly from the hemp plant it is going to contain very very small amounts of CBD and other cannabinoids but it is not going to be anything that's actually going to be beneficial to you it is going to be something similar to cook with like a coconut oil or a olive oil something like that that's not actually going to contain sufficient amounts of any of the cannabinoids to really do anything for you full spectrum is going to be refined from the plant and it's going to have all 85 cannabinoids present this means that it is not strictly CBD so when the bottle says 300 milligrams it is absolutely 300 milligrams it's 300 milligrams of combined cannabinoids whatever was in that plant so if they got lucky and they had a high CBD plant then yeah I might have 20 milligrams of CBD and they're 50 milligrams but certainly not going to contain 300 milligrams that is a major difference and misconception with full-spectrum CBD products they are a lot cheaper because they are a lot cheaper to produce because they are extracting the entire plant which means that it has all cannabinoids so it's not strictly CBD so it is a lot cheaper to manufacture like I said making it cheaper all around so the misconception is that is but it says 300 milligrams right but that 300 milligrams is not necessarily CBD which is a molecule you're going after for the medical benefits when you find a company that has ninety-nine point eight percent pure CBD that's when you're getting a pure product that's when you're going to get all of those milligrams are going to be CBD when you come across a product that just shows you that they use a cold rolled press that means that that ninety-nine point eight percent pure CBD that point two percent is water it's h2o so there's no harsh chemicals and that means it is extracted pure natural organic water ice no nothing harsh that's not going to be beneficial to your body so then that 300 milligram bottle now means that ninety-nine point eight percent of it was CVD is CVD so you're actually going to be able to absorb that in your body it's not going to be full-spectrum so that's when the CVD will make a difference and it'll actually work for you so that is the major differences between your full-spectrum your pure CVD and your hemp oil something you buy at the grocery store", "KeO-_y6dXOs": "okay so um like like I said before if I don't know how to explain it simply than I don't understand it and so what I really wanted to do is break down the important parts of hemp what it is what it does and even to how its farmed so you understand it a little bit better and I also want to talk about why I think Q views from Q Sciences fit all of these things that are really important to me and really important I know to other people and why it works better than anything else out there excuse me okay so the first important thing I'm going to talk about really five things that are really important to have the first thing is full spectrum hemp oil and notice I'm not saying CBD I'm not saying hemp seed oil I am saying full spectrum hemp oil and what is that that is um it's an oil that uses the entire hemp plant without destroying any of the medicinal and healthy benefits of the plant there are three parts of the plant that are really important and they work together in order to have a good health benefit for you the first thing is called a cannabinoid okay and I have read so many things about cannabinoids but all I know is the number of cannabinoids in the full spectrum hemp plant I have heard anywhere between 80 and 140 basically what these are are there little compounds that nourish our bodies and they regulate the systems of our body they balance us I really like using the word balance because that means something different for everybody for me it was anxiety for my mom it was reducing her pain symptoms for other people it might be it might help them sleep better other people they can tolerate their kids better it can be a lot of different things to a lot of different people so that's why I like saying balanced cannabinoids balanced our body the second part of the plant is called a flavonoid and these are just parts of the plants that are antioxidant what antioxidant means is basically they help keep your cells healthy and they get rid of that damage that anything out in the environment can do to your body and the flavonoids are linked to a reduction of risk of cancer heart disease asthma stroke and it also protects your brain that can mean for it can reduce symptoms of Alzheimer's multiple sclerosis seizures and all of those things that originate in our brain so we call it neuro protective basically it protects the neurons in our body and and obviously if neurons brain spinal cord and it has eight fatty acids and they're really good for your brain your skin your heart your joints okay the third compound that I want to talk about is called a terpene terpenes are part of the plant that makes it smell right because you know I just went to the Iowa State Fair you can walk by the people and tell what they've been smoking that night right and those are those lovely terpenes now of course we know that hemp is not marijuana never has been marijuana and I'm gonna talk about that in a little bit but it still has a smell to it okay but what that smell does is the smell that plants have it protects them from like animals and like insects and everything that kid that's gonna eat it or litter rewards right and the terpenes make the cannabinoids right those things that go in and nourish your body and give it balance it makes them work better and it's called an entourage effect basically it just helps your whole body all of these things these parts of the plant help the cannabinoids work better to bring that balance that's why having the whole plant felt full-spectrum hemp oil that's why having that is so important and I do want to reiterate that hemp is not marijuana okay it has never been marijuana it may be a cousin of marijuana but that it does not mean it's marijuana and it's kind of like in Iowa we're gonna understand this you know because we're a corn State but it's like seed corn versus sweet corn the stuff you're gonna give pigs versus the stuff that you're gonna give humans um it they're similar but they're not necessarily for consumption or they're not meant to you know what I mean so they're cousins but they are not the same thing and um hemp oil is also not have seed oil okay it's not pure CBD oil and this we're going to talk a little bit about CBD but CBD comes in isolate form distillate or synthetic and basically what that means is they are not using the entire plant CBD is only one tiny little part of the plant and I would like to I I just heard this football analogy that I really like CBD is like putting only the quarterback in for a football game it might be effective for a little bit it might do a little bit of work but it's never gonna win a football game and having a full spectrum hemp oil is like sending in the entire team and they're gonna work right they're gonna win so that's what CBD versus full spectrum hemp just the quarterback versus the whole football team okay the second important thing that I'm going to talk about in relation to hemp is how its sourced or how it's farmed and once again hemp is not and has never been marijuana and any form hemp specifically has to have um less than 0.3 percent THC 0.3 percent THC and hemp it actually grows up to about 20 feet tall marijuana is only about 6 to 9 and hemp harvests in anywhere between 60 and 90 days marijuana is 120 hemp has grown outside marijuana is primarily inside hemp will not make you high and marijuana will and hemp is a lot of times it's used in health obviously but also textiles rope is made of have a lot of things in marijuana is basically the purpose is for recreation or medicinal so those are the two differences now what's really important to [ __ ] to look for if you're looking for a high quality full-spectrum hemp oil is certification certification is not necessarily government regulated unfortunately but the reason you still want to look for it is because it verifies that it's safe it verifies the THC levels in so that way and it's third from a third party it's not the actual company doing the verification they literally have to get it certified by the Department of Agriculture in whatever state it's being grown in and so um so not everybody does certify their hemp and what's the reason because if it's trash they have to destroy it and who what farmer wants to get rid of their entire crop and not make money off of it not many want to do that right but the good ones are going to certify their hemp and make sure that it's safe for you to consume and it's below that 0.3% THC levels so that's what I want to say about the farming of it obviously it's totally different from marijuana and you want to make sure to look for a hemp that is certified and I will go over you know the oil that I specifically use and some of the people on this collar specifically using I'll go over why um like ours is a little bit different but just make sure since the government regulations are so loose do you find the ones who are holding themselves out a good standard and getting certified the third important thing when we're talking about hemp is called extraction basically this is how they make the oil so this can be done a couple of ways one is chemically and they can get the chem with they can get it from ethanol and butane so basically alcohol and fire right but the problem with doing this is that hemp is really porous it takes on stuff from the environment it um which is good if you're feeding it good things but if you're feeding it bad things such as alcohol butane or even pesticides it is going to be in your hemp and so that's why the the hemp oil specifically that I am using does not do that it's organically farmed so there's no pesticides and they do something called super critical co2 extraction and let's just call it co2 extraction because absolutely a lot of words so the only way to get the full spectrum hemp oil that first thing that we talked about that was really important is to get this supercritical co2 extraction that's how you get your oil because any other any other way that they extract it destroys part of the plant and we know that we have all of those things that are really important for the for the full spectrum hemp oil to be full threatened have boiled and that stuff that we want all those cannabinoids in the good plant nutrition we need to make sure that we have the co2 extraction basically what that means is it's put under high pressure the hemp plant is in low temperatures high temperatures destroy things but low temperatures maintain the plant and so we want that co2 extraction we want low temperature and that maintains the plant and all the benefits of the plant and that's pretty much it with extraction um the fourth really important thing is called stability and this is important because we don't want the nutrients to leave the plants we don't we don't let me call it nutrient fallout so the full spectrum hemp oil in order to be a good quality it needs to be stable in hot and cold temperatures and we don't want it to be affected by water stomach acid or even if it sits on the shelf for a long time and altitude altitude is important too those things can affect the oil and number one make it not safe elevate the THC levels that also destroy the plant nutrition that goes along with it and also can make you feel a drug screen if it's not safe stable so that's really important as well so most oils have something called liposomal technology and what that is is basically it is a like kind of a fatty substance that delivers things to the cells of your body what's nice about liposomal technology you're not gonna hear me say a lot of things about it but what's nice about it is that it makes it water-soluble and it's important to have things water-soluble so it can get into your body so just think if I were to put a dab of oil like olive oil let's say in a dab of water on my hand which one is gonna absorb into my skin faster it's gonna be the water right so that's why having something water-soluble is so important so it gets into your body better but we can't have liposomal technology because that's gonna make us unsafe because it's not safe in temperatures above 80 degrees and it's not safe safe in the stomach acid so if it's shipped to any part of the country or in another country and it is above 80 degrees you're gonna see nutrient Fallout and you're going to see possibly elevated THC levels and the second it hits your stomach acid it's going to do the same thing and plus our bodies are over eighty degrees right we're 98.6% eat point six degrees and so we don't let the liposomal technology so when we get to bioavailability the next kind of like little pillar that we have I'm going to talk about that so the hemp oil that I'm using it has a different type of technology so you want to avoid the liposomal technology and you want to make sure that it's stable in many conditions so the fifth thing I want to talk about is bioavailability like I just said and basically that means it's a fancy word for how well your body can use it so native full-spectrum hemp oil is only six percent available to your body for your body to use and it takes up to an hour and a half to work and so just think about if you are standing at a gas station and you're putting gas in your car and you filled up your tank but only your car could only use six percent of it would you be very happy I know that I would it and just think if you would have to wait an hour to an hour and a half to even start your car after that that's kind of what we're talking about when we're talking about bioavailability and native full spectrum hemp oils adding a carrier oil such as like some these will do like MCT oil or other some other types of oils they help it helps it absorb but it doesn't help how fast it works and so um basically what I'm the full spectrum hemp oil that I'm using is it and I will talk a little bit about it in here in a minute but it has a different type of technology that doesn't need the liposomes and doesn't need a carrier oil to help it absorb into your body it just does it on its own with a special thing that they do just like looking at them when Oh making sure my kids are getting ran over okay my husband's here I promise I'm not like just letting them play out in the street okay and so what does um what does have oil do what does that we will do so it can do a lot of things for different people and like I said before I really like using the word balance but I won't do that right now um so it's good for the skin it's good for the brain it's good for the heart it can provide some natural pain relief reduce those pain symptoms it can reduce acne muscle tension it's anti-inflammatory it can help your anxiety decrease those awful anxiety symptoms it protects your brain like I said before and it also has been shown to be anti-cancer which is really important so it can do a lot of things for a lot of people like I said and it just promotes and in in medicine we call homeostasis are basically just the natural normal function of your body and I do want to touch on legality here for a minute too and I know we're all from different states so I would just encourage you to look at your state's laws to make sure that um what you're you know that you're up front with people that who you're talking to in Iowa we have more strict um more strict laws about hemp and other other states there's like no limits on it and I think that's kind of where we're going but when I was talking about the regulation and certification before the government really just wants to make sure that we're safe and that um that people are putting out the product that they say they're putting out so I think we'll the that the regulations coming down the chute but at the same time this the hemp oil that I'm using called cute views it's putting itself above the laws so they don't have to change anything when those regulations do come about um so I am going to talk a little bit about cue fuse they have boiled that I'm using one of my bottles here okay here it is this is a fantastic little bottle it does so many wonderful things so this is the full-spectrum Kemp oil and it has those awesome plant benefits that go with it cue is you fuse is certified it comes from Kentucky so they make sure that it's they test the crop it's always below 0.3% THC I think um the last time I heard our third-party testing what's coming in at point-o eight THC so roughly a third of what the legal limits say if the hemp can be so it's grown in Kentucky its certified its organic it's non-gmo it's just great great quality plant and they also use like I said before that extraction method they use the supercritical co2 extraction they use you know so it's safe it doesn't it doesn't destroy the plant in it and it uses cooled instead of heaps so it maintains the plant as well and then it uses bio absorb technology rather than that liposomal technology that i talked about before so it's stable one of those things that's really important right stable hot cold stomach and it has a two-year or more shelf life and it mimics the body's own absorption so it doesn't have to have a carrier carrier oil it doesn't have to have the liposomal technology and it's water-soluble even without those things and what I really like is they have done blood like blood sampling from humans to show like the onset of action and how long it takes and all that kind of stuff they've done to human and one animal study and they've done those studies two times and they made sure that it was verified by blood testing and because that's the most accurate form of testing for something like this and when I talked before about how most oils are only 6 percent bioavailable or ready for the to use ours is Q fuse is 85% bioavailable and it has a fast onset it has a 15 minute onset and it lasts for a long time the blood tests were showing about 11 hours now I want to say like even though it does last 11 hours some people have to use it more than that I know for me I usually use it twice a day sometimes three just kind of depends on if I have like aches or pains from having anxiety trouble um my mom who uses it for reduction of pain symptoms she has two uses sometimes four times a day and then I have some customers who only have to use it twice a week it just kind of depends on the person there's no you know magic dose or anything like that but ours is going to be the most available for the body it's going to work the quickest and it's going to last the longest because of our bio absorbed technology and you can also get it because it works so well you can use lower doses so your body bottles gonna go a lot further than a lot of things you're gonna buy over-the-counter and so if you are already not part of the Q family there are two ways to be involved the first is um through being a preferred customer what's really nice about our preferred customer program is you get the same discount as an ambassador and you're also able to get your products for free through our care and share program so if you're not um you know fully aware of the benefits of it please talk to the person who invited you tonight and the second way is by being an ambassador so not only do we get a great discount we also can get our products for free every month and plus we can make commission from our customers and from any organization or team that we grow with us so if you have any questions about any of those things please let the person who invited you know and really that's it for my presentation I just kind of wanted to go over what's really important with hemp and how it's farmed what it does all of those good things um does anybody have any questions look the chat and I don't see any but oshi okay there we go last myself certain in asking questions what I'm watching tip I'm watchin Tiffany's dog barking in the background looks like he has a question oh my gosh well and my computer's being weird okay there we go this DVD being sold at Trader Joe's and how are they getting around legal issues in Iowa okay so honestly I don't know the answer to that so basically I know in Sioux City they were doing a lot of they were actually taking CBD out of stores and and getting the people in trouble and they were doing that in the Des Moines area but recently there was a place in downtown Des Moines that opened and the honestly the police came out and said that they weren't gonna do anything about it um so the legality in Iowa you can't sell it retail and honestly you're not even supposed to be in possession of it so it's a little bit different and I'm gonna

We want to make sure that they live for a\nlong time. So in this video I want to talk about some\ninteresting ways that CBD is starting to help out the life of our furry friends. I want to start off with one particular study. The study was published in July of 2018 in\na journal known as the Frontiers of Veterinary Science. Now, what this study was looking at was overall\nthe effect of CBD oil versus placebo for pain management. Well, the results ended up being pretty darn\ninteresting. You see, what they found was utilizing what's\ncalled the Hudson Activity Score, they found that the dogs that ended up taking CBD ended\nup having much less overall pain and much more activity, and ultimately more mobility\nas well. Now, the Hudson Activity Score is just a way\nthat we can gauge basically how a pet is feeling and their pain management based on questions\nthat the owner is presented with. So, sure, it's somewhat subjective, but when\nthe responses are as stark as they are with this study, we know it's really working. You see, they saw that 80% of the dogs that\nwere in the study had decreases in pain and increases in mobility. 80%. That is pretty darn astounding. Now, here's the best part; no side effects\nwhatsoever. Normally when a dog goes on some kind of anti-inflammatory\nor pain management drug, they end up having side effects. It's hard on their liver, it's hard on their\nkidneys. There's all kinds of things that they have\nto be careful of. So CBD is seemingly a pretty harmless way\nto get a good quality of life back. Now, how does this work? Well, the thing is is dogs have the same CB1\nand CB2 receptors in their bodies that we have in ours. Simply put, what that means is that when they\ntake in CBD, their bodies end up producing more of the natural endocannabinoids. So when humans take CBD, we produce more of\nthese naturally occurring endocannabinoids that help us feel better. They elicit bliss, they make us feel calm. But they also affect our inflammatory signals\nand inflammatory markers in the body, making it so that we have less pain. Same things happens with dogs. Dogs have inflammation, and that inflammation\ncan lead to joint pain. That inflammation can lead to disease. So the cool thing is is that these endocannabinoids,\nlike andandamide, that are produced when we have CBD coming in, actually stop some of\nthe production of tumor necrosis factor 1-alpha and nuclear factor-kappa B. So it makes it\nso that these dogs can modulate inflammation better without having to take a bunch of anti-inflammatories,\nbut also target inflammation more at it's chronic core, not just for pain, but at the\ncellular level, too. Now, we can take it one step further, because\nthere are some studies that start looking at the effects of CBD on seizures in dogs. Now, some of this is a little bit inconclusive,\nso I want to go ahead and cut right to the chase. The fact is is seizures are complicated. We don't know a lot of what happens with a\nseizure in a human body or in an animal body. It's just complicated, but what we do know\nis it's some kind of disruption of the electrical system, and we have concluded that there is\nsome correlation with what is called a voltage gated sodium channel. This voltage gated sodium channels are channels\nthat allow an action potential, like the potential to move or the potential for energy, or potential\nfor electrical current from the brain to actually get somewhere. So it's really important. But if we don't have a system that's properly\nfunctioning, like with our Nav 1.1 system, which is essentially the sodium gated channel\nthat transfers that energy, that's when we have issues. That's when seizures can occur. Basically we have random surges of action\npotential and random surges of energy that should or shouldn't be there at a specific\ntime. Well, dogs have this too. CBD has been shown to inhibit the Nav 1.1,\nNav 1.1., meaning less instance for seizures to potentially occur. Now, it's so complicated because we don't\nreally know how it's working. We can only hypothesize, but the fact is we\nare seeing improvement in dogs with seizures. So it's simple. It's really a no-brainer when it comes down\nto it. We question things that we put in our bodies\nbecause there's so many bodies of research, but when it comes down to our animals, a lot\nof times we just throw it aside. We don't even think about it. But the research is there. The research that shows that dogs and cats\ncan start feeling better if they utilize CBD in an efficient way. And it's a heck of a lot cheaper than being\ndependent on pharmaceuticals for your poor furry friend all the time. As always, keep it locked in here with Octagon\nBiolabs, and I'll see you in the next video.", "gCHJdLXLi6Y": "[Music] what's the difference between full-spectrum hemp oil versus isolate as the term suggests full-spectrum CBD comes with all the cannabinoids present in the plant in hemp oil this includes a long list of cannabis compounds such as CBD CBN CBG CBC and THC it is critical to point out that small amounts of THC can also be found in hemp the government regulates concentration levels at 0.3% dry weight for industrial hemp products resulting in very limited cerebral or psychoactive stimulation when CBD is in the isolate form it is separated from other cannabis compounds in the source plants it was previously believed that CBD isolates were more potent and concentrated than full-spectrum CBD this certain assertion was eventually debunked by a study from the Lautenberg Center for general tumor immunology in Jerusalem in the 2015 study researchers were able to prove that the full-spectrum CBD is capable of offering greater levels of relief as higher doses were administered to mice by comparison the group that was given CBD isolates did not experience the same level of relief at higher doses to better understand how the to CBD formulas differ imagine being presented with two types of spaghetti sauce in the first bowl you have you'll find a simple spaghetti sauce made out of pureed tomatoes CBD isolate and in the second bowl you can now find a more complex spaghetti sauce containing roasted garlic and fragrant Italian herbs the full spectrum CBD it's clear that both balls are holding spaghetti sauce but the second recipe is more flavorful and interacts with one's taste buds differently also known as the entourage effect which one is right for you or for me based on the comparison above full spectrum hemp oil is more effective than CBD isolate making it highly recommended for people interested in the holistic approaches hemp oil is an extremely potent source of CBD responsible for a large bulk of the oils cannabinoid to fully reap CBD oil benefits one should explore the different mediums of the compound available in the market today capsules tinctures topical creams and vape oils we will also be launching our pet line as well as skin care and cosmetics line as well here soon we thank you for popping by", "qDPI79Ou610": "let's get back to our call back to 10x sure and if you're not familiar with the details of this product is because they're coming to you now but what it is and what it can do for you is amazing we have two strengths of this product 500 milligram in 1500 milligram and here's what's so exciting about it by adding just one milliliter of 10x peer to a 30 milliliter container the drops model that all the drops come in if you add just one milliliter of tanks pure to the CBD oils that we sell it's been shown to increase the effectiveness the the potency the result producing potential of that CBD oil by up to seven times but here's the face we're not just adding one milliliter we're adding two milliliters of obtaining spirit to every one of our 500 milligram and 1500 milligram 10x pure 30 milliliter products now we still have the regular product as well as the isolate and the full-spectrum without the connector but with the ten extra product there's two milliliters of this additional ingredients being at it so when we say it's up to 10 times more potent and more effective we're actually being conservative than that and the reason for the increase potency and effectiveness of these products is what we're here to talk about tonight and it all has to do with water solubility and spinal availability but before I bring on our amazing scientific expert guest speaker who I'm really looking forward to just letting her kind of let her loose watching so to speak I want to first introduce the man that made it possible for c2fo to get the exclusive rights to attend occur in the entire network marketing industry world wide is the co-founder and CEO of t4 manufacturing which was founded in 2017 but then in November of last year they brought on highly experienced scientists with extensive expertise in organic and targeted biological processes and what happened was they developed a patented process that's what we're gonna be talking about tonight we can't go into details because it's patented but it's what makes this ingredient and this part of our products so amazing so please welcome with our heartfelt thanks and appreciation for the exclusive rights you've given us the awesome Jeremy ducharme and Jeremy I just want to say thank you so much for joining this time so I'm gonna introduce someone to you folks that you want to listen closer to she has come to us by way of Yale University New Haven department of molecular biology University of California San Francisco and in many other locales where she has honed and developed her expertise she's a molecular biologist extraordinaire it's definitely one of the smartest people I've ever met please welcome the amazing Francis or we called her friend DiNozzo friends thank you so much for being on the call tonight thank you for having me thank you for being there even though Jeremy somehow dropped off because I know he was off he was on it's okay with you I'm gonna sort of just as Pompey I'd like to ask you some questions that we've received from members in our company and then just let you share with us your extensive knowledge of what we have our hands on here with ten insecure I said okay trying okay so number one first can you please explain to our listeners what is and extra ingredient is how it affects our CBD oil when it's combined what's what what you can share with them about it I guess this patented process and anything that you are allowed to explain to us about it sure so 10x pure is a mixture of a unique supercharged oxygenated oil and a full spectrum and educator the oil itself is hydrophilic which means that it is has an affinity with water this allows the oil and water to form an emulsion since most of the human body systems are water-based this property will allow the oil along with any associated molecules to travel effectively through the body so Willem patented process produces an exposed oil with the thin layer film removed it is super light and can rapidly penetrate membrane another advantage to the k\u00f6ppen molecule is the ability to adapt other closed molecule with a state-of-the-art coupling reaction to establish and covalent let clear structure the covalent bonding creates a synergistic CSEC meaning that they may work as a team resulting in increased opens easy and faster reactions so actually the first questions that you said to me are a little bit overlapping and that's why I combine the answers okay okay so that was the how the combination of the CBC of the CBD oil in 10x pure expected increase the overall effective I gotcha right okay okay so I guess one of the things we hear about in the industry a lot is the nanotechnology stuff and whether those of you there were at the gala event in Las Vegas heard pranced and share this and with an analogy to can you kind of go into how you feel this is a definitely an edge up on what annal technology does to usual full-spectrum racemic um yeah actually I've borrowed some of this terminology directly from a blog from an expert in nanotechnology and so I'm just reading verbatim from his blog this morning most of the other products available are CBD by swiftly so there is some confusion in the terminology in the field view so sense extract is actually a hoie form of cannabis that consists of between eighty and a hundred individual to Navigon and provides the most optimal healing benefits and calming effect however there is no water soluble CBD whether have the organic level or the nano level so the nanos products in collaborating nanotechnology which is the great technology cannot supply you with the full spectrum hemp extract it does have subedi in it but it has holy CBD and one way to think about this is the difference between honey and sugar for example both will make you see sweetly but honey his raw unprocessed natural product that in addition to the sweetness has nutritional and added health innocence so taking as dr. Seaton explained at the gala taking only the seed out of the hem extra really stressed it away from what she referred to as the entourage of Festus of the complete sheet full spectrum extracts and I'm just gonna sort of open it wide open I don't know what you have to share on this one but I just like to invite you if there's anything on any levels that you'd like to share about connect pure about CBD about CFO about anything any things that from your perspective and what I will very I believe accurately call your expertise teeth perspective share with our listeners tonight at all this is sort of my final question for you anything at all that you want to add to what to settle so yeah again summarize what I said earlier penetration and absorption are the most important property to success successfully deliver a product to its target this exposed oil is considered five times at least five times better than other oil in terms of its penetration ability and permeability it is also has a lower flashpoint and in itself is antibacterial antifungal and prebiotic tenets pure is absorbed easily and travel through the body quickly and brings along a full spectrum temp extract not only a CVD isolation very very thank you so much Brandon [Music] you [Music]", "qFrYfn49rTg": "hi this is Catherine with foods that heal you I'm gonna talk about CBD oil isolate today I had a question this morning about that and I thought I would go ahead and try to explain this and make it as simple as possible because it really does get confusing with you know CBD you isolate full-spectrum hemp what is the difference okay so when you get when you grow a hemp plant it has cannabinoids in it has over 113 known cannabinoids so CBD is just one of those cannabinoids so when you buy a hemp product that says full-spectrum the means you're getting all of the cannabinoids in there not just CBD CBD is the focus because it has a lot of medicinal benefits but there are other cannabinoids that have benefits as well and I will have a link to my website below this video you can click on and you'll see a wheel a cannabinoid wheel that will tell you the benefits of like CVG or CBD a or CBD the benefits of the different cannabinoids I personally recommend the full-spectrum and that's what I have available because it's kind of like if you eat the egg and you only eat the egg white and you don't eat the egg yolk you can end up with a biotin deficiency because God made food to work as a whole food synergistically I don't believe that it's ideal to take and extract and pull foods apart kind of like the same thing goes with vitamin C when you extract vitamin C from a plant you miss out on all the phytonutrients in that plant all you're kidding is an isolate of vitamin C it's always better like I said in my opinion as a nutritionist to consume the whole food that works synergistically so that all said CBD isolate is just CBD nothing else no other cannabinoids it's stricken strictly CBD isolate that might work for some people it's not you know for me it's not something that I'm going to have available because I believe in as close to the whole food form as possible because everything in nature works synergistically when we start pulling things apart it's kind of like pharmaceutical we're turning a natural plant into a drug at that point okay I hope this video explained a little it better like I said I'll have my website link below this video so you can check out that can of a cannabinoid wheel and if you have questions about which product to choose because I know like I said this gets really uncomplicated and I'm trying to make it as simple as possible so if you have other questions post below this video I'll leave that enabled so you can ask questions and I'll see you in the next video have a great day thanks for watching", "VfOgKlcXKDs": "so what is the difference between full spectrum and broad spectrum cbd well broad spectrum actually has only cbd in it pure cbd they've extracted everything else and burn those other elements off whereas full spectrum tincture you're actually getting all of the other minor cannabinoids uh you're getting terpenes and you're getting flavonoids that are in the plant and all of these things work in combination to provide what's called the entourage effect and essentially what that means is that these compounds are much more effective when they're together with these other elements that were all also in the plant during the maturation of the plant and its entire growth and life cycle so honestly full spectrum is better [Music] [Applause] [Music] medicine you", "eFt87SAJy5o": "it's the latest health trend that everybody is talking about CBD oil now it comes to the cannabis plant and many believe it can help with everything from anxiety and chronic pain to diabetes even cancer we're in the midst of a CBD oil boom with products popping up everywhere today dr.

Steven ho Z founder of the Hopi Health mala Center we've got a great show today with dr. Derrick DeSilva they will be discussing the benefits of full spectrum hemp oil and how it is even better than taking CBD oil dr. hope thank you so much Stacey and thank he's one of you for joining us today on dr. Hodes and wellness revolution you know I believe that you and everybody needs to have a doctor and a staff of professionals who can coach you onto a path of health and wellness naturally so as you mature you can regain and maintain your health and you've got energy you've got vitality and you're enthusiastic about life today I'm so pleased to bring to you a close friend of mine and really an innovator in natural approaches to health form and nutraceutical products vitamin and mineral products who's going to talk to us today about CBD hemp oil it's dr. derrick desilva dr. DaSilva thank you for joining us my pleasure thank you dr. Jose fighting dr. de Silva is an internist it's an internal medicine doctor out of New Jersey and he practices there at the Raritan Bay Medical Center he's also on the teaching faculty of the JFK Medical Center in Edison New Jersey he's lectured on numerous topics across the world to various medical conferences that encourage and teach other doctors how to treat patients from a more natural point of view rather than a pharmaceutical point of view he and I really are on the same wavelength about believing that pharmaceutical drugs are poisons and then they make you sicker quicker and most doctors treat symptoms with drugs that don't resolve the underlying problem dr. de Silva like I addresses the underlying problem of the symptoms that you have by treating the underlying cause of those using natural approaches I have been interested like many of you have in the whole concept of this CBD oil you've heard about it for years guests of ours here at the host health and wellness center have asked me on numerous occasions what do you think about CBD or I don't know I'm you know it's not in our bailiwick it wasn't even allowed in Texas up until I think the last session passed the law allowing it to be used in Texas and CBD oil comes from the cannabis plant I didn't know or think much about it but I've known dr. to silver for a number of years and I know what an innovator he is in addressing health problems from a national point of view with vitamin and mineral supplementation that he is designed well over 100 to 200 different products combinations of vitamins and minerals that produce wonderful health benefits and individuals so I was visiting with him several months ago and he told me we happen to get on the topic of CBD oil it feels yeah I use CBD oil in my practice I use a full spectrum hemp all I said really you know he would be the last person that would have thought was using hemp oil and I would have doctored it to myself if dr. DaSilva is using hemp oil and in CBD oil there must be something to it I said tell me about it what do you use it for so that got us into a very robust conversation and I'm gonna to the point that I said okay he is designed a product he's gonna tell you about which is fantastic and back in December I said I'll tell you what we'll do I'll private label the product you've developed it will allow us we'll just market it and let our our guess here at those health and wellness center try it see if it works I was the first one to tried and I had dramatic relief of a severe problem I had my neck and it made me a believer I was shocked and so we've used it here at the hotels and Wellness Center and dr. de Silva happens to be in town and I wanted him to visit with you firsthand and tell you about hemp oil full-spectrum hemp oil which is derived from a cannabis plant cannabis ruderalis plant and the benefits of full-spectrum and how this is different aren't how it's the same as CB Deal so dr. de Silva why don't you tell us tell us about what made you interested in CBD oil and the hemp oil and what you've developed and what we can expect to benefit our guests and other individuals can expect a benefit from it I think the first thing we need to establish dr. hood see is what's the difference between full-spectrum hemp oil or CBD and something like THC now the THC is the psychoactive drug that our molecule that's in the cannabis sativa plant the marijuana plant that causes people to get high and when they smoke it exactly we then that's the first thing that we have to separate because this is where all the confusion lies the confusion lies in the fact that people look at this and they think oh my goodness I'm going to get high if I start using full-spectrum hemp oil and that's not true because full-spectrum hemp oil is non psychotropic whereas THC is the psychotropic component that that that will that gives you that effect the confusion lies with the legislators with perhaps some of the viewers out there and also with physicians so separating the two is the most important place to start well okay so in our in and you you in what you have designed is a product that's a full spectrum hemp oil now we've heard about CBD it's one type of the can remember in the cannabis plants you have cannabinoid oils and there are a number multiplicity of these oils of which CBD is one so what's the reason you didn't design a product that's strictly CBD as opposed to a full-spectrum hippo what's the benefits the first thing we need to establish is what is the endocannabinoid system every single person every single one of you that are watching this along with your dogs your cats your horses and any other pets that you have that has a vertebra if you're a vertebrate you have an endocannabinoid system so a lot of people say to me well what does it do the endocannabinoid system is called a system of homeostasis it is a system of balance if your cortisol levels for example are too high then it will bring them lower if they're too low they will bring them up they follow what is called our circadian rhythms our circadian patterns of how we wake up in the morning and how we go to sleep at night so if anybody asks you what is the endocannabinoid system very simple answer is it is a system of homeostasis or it's a system of balance now the question you asked me was why didn't I just develop a CBD product right as dr. Hodes he mentioned there's there are various there are hundreds we've isolated about 400 different cannabinoids I personally believe that we are just scratching the surface when it comes to the endocannabinoids had--we've that we've isolated there's CBD there CBG there's cba to CBN and there's a whole host of other cannabinoids each one of those has a particular effect now there's a little bit of crossover between the two but here's the thing that I want people to understand when God made this plant God didn't just make CBD what he or she did am trying to be politically correct here you know what what the plant is is that it is a combination of terpenes Flavin's flavonoids cannabinoids vitamins minerals fatty acids pulling out one piece is like saying okay I'm going to buy a suit or I'm going to buy a blazer but I'm only going to go you're going to go to the store and you're going to tell the gentleman I want a blazer and he comes out with just the sleeve well that's not the blazer that's just the sleeve I want to buy the whole jacket and that's exactly what the full spectrum hemp oil is it's the whole jacket it's the whole deal and the sleeve the lapel the pocket for the pocket square of course right pocket square it all works together when you take pieces out what happens is you don't get what we call the for the entourage effect or the full benefit of all of the pieces that are part of it now so you made a great decision and very I don't know on the market there very few if any that use the full spectrum how many there are literally thousands of CBD products on the market there's everything you combine with them you go across the street to the filling station they got some CB deal who knows where it came from or who made it what's in it there's no third-party verification and validation which we do and which doctor desilva's done because he designed this product now when you design the product you put in full spectrum how many other or full spectrum there are others that are full spectrum but here's the difference in or full spectrum when you say in the market in the market there are a lot of isolates out there I would say maybe 40 50 percent or have the full spec that have the full spectrum but here's the different here's tell us the difference is what I was going to ask you about the difference is is and this is very important folks if you have two glasses of water and you take most of the oils that are out there and they're oils you drop it into the water what happens to an oil in water it floats very simple it floats the difference between that and what I have designed is that the oil quote unquote oil that I have when you drop that into that glass of water it is completely soluble it goes completely into solution so what's the big deal well tell them how you did that you designed this product to do that and it's a special process it's a liposome oh it's Maine so describe to them what it what it means they have microsomal full spectrum oil it's not only liposomal meaning it it gets dispersed very quickly because we cover it with what is called a lecithin sphere but we also have a new technology that I probably haven't even talked to you about is we have this this technology that breaks those molecules up very very carefully so that it doesn't damage the end product and it it's it's part of that process along with Mike's am i civilization the liposomal you all of this technology goes into this product and this is not this is not a candy that tastes good that's sweet no I'm sorry this is a what I like to call an application as as as it's meant to be so it's a little bit chlorophyll in there there's a little bit of quote-unquote sediment in there it's not pretty but it works right and that's what I think it tastes fine and what and the the real benefit of having it in the liposomal form and being dissolvable in water is that it is well absorbed sublingually under your tongue so when you take it you put it under your tongue and you hold you and you hold it there for 30 to 60 seconds and it's absurd through the mucosal lining under your tongue because it is absorbable it's dissolvable in water whereas these others that are oil and most immoral I don't know I think there's a very small percentage that are microsomal oh no there's that that's a small number very small number so most of them are oils and they're not well absorbed and the absorption rate is what three to six percent okay so if you get CBD oil and you're buying then you put it under your tongue or swallow it three to six percent it's gonna get what's the absorption right now when we use the liposomal this dissolves in water what can over 50% okay so and I have the studies to prove it dr. ho t and this is what a lot of things these are the other issue is people say that it's bioavailable right you go to the store and you buy something and they say it is highly bioavailable but did you prove it did you do a study to prove it well I did and we're involved right now in other studies on the product that you have and because that to me is the key differentiator when it comes to products design and how we utilize this now we've talked about the product why do what do you use it for what it what is the benefit of full spectrum hemp oil we might use it for in my practice I have three primary indications three primary number one for people that have joint discomforts you have soreness you have tenderness you have muscle tenderness your neck bothers you your back bothers you your your toes are doesn't matter anything that has to do with joint discomfort is what I use it for pain joint pain joint discomfort number two I use it in people that are uptight that are agitated that are nervous they can't settle down because remember I said in the beginning it sends the body into homeostasis it has what are called adaptogenic qualities so people that are uptight people that are anxious etc that's number two and number three is for sleep you will sleep like a baby why because what it does is that it sends you into deeper levels of REM sleep I never have trouble sleeping and in fact dr. Hodes he asked me this morning when he picked me up he said how did you sleep I said I hit the bed and I'm done I'm history why well last night I took the full spectrum hemp bro because I'm traveling I'm here in Houston and I knew bad new pillow you know a little bit of noise that you're not used to and you need that little help but for you ladies that are out there that are perimenopausal and menopausal you're getting up at night you cannot sleep let me tell you something it is unbelievable and I like what dr. ho Chi said put it under in your mouth keep it in there for a couple of minutes now if for some reason you don't like the flavor mix it in about an ounce of water because it goes right in the solution you don't need to worry about that mix in about an ounce of water and hold it in your mouth for about 20 to 30 seconds absorption will be pretty quick and it gets right in and by the way I did a study showing bioavailability and what that's this study showed was that in 30 minutes about 75% of this is in serum so I mean your blood it's in your blood so I take this about 30 minutes before I go to sleep and our study showed that it stayed in the serum in the blood for about 12 hours at the end of 12 hours it started to taper off so I take a dose in the morning which is about 25 to 30 drops in the morning and about 25 to 30 drops before I go to sleep when we talked earlier about endocannabinoid system endo means within we're taking this hemp oil full-spectrum and there's a bottle of it right here and this is how it works you take it off after you've shaken it you squeeze it and you get that would be considered an approximate dose probably 20 drops and you this is a dose you use that twice a day to start with if you're an adult you may need twice that much you'll just have to see how your symptoms everybody's different and then you just squirt it under your tongue and hold it there for 60 seconds so it goes into your body and as is dr. Mishon it goes in and it goes into the receptors for your own endocannabinoid system you have a cannabinoid system within you that makes two products it makes an and amide and it makes two AG and those are those are indo indo within cannabinoids this is XO it's from without calves annoyed and what happens in your body when you're injured your body produces an and amide which goes to the receptors primarily in your brain and your and in your spinal cord yeah spinal cord in your nervous system and it regulates that so it helps think of it when you get injured or you're nervous or anxious your switch has been turned on on the receptors for the endocannabinoids and the body makes cannabinoids or inand amide and two AG and goes into the receptor and it turns off the switch so you don't you're not anxious or you're not you don't have insomnia it also goes to receptors in the immune system you have two different type of endocannabinoid receptors CG 1 CG 2 and I'm sorry CB 1 you want cb1 and cb2 and the CB 1 is for the brain and the nervous system and CB 2 is for the immune system so it down regulates inflammation and modulates your immune system tell you what I had I had a bad I had injured my neck playing golf unbeknownst to me didn't happen for the until the second day at night I had terrible pain in my left side of my neck shooting into my shoulder doctor doctor de Silva was here a couple of months back and spoke at our conference here at the office about those effects spectrum him Paul I had already seen my chiropractor I've been decompressed I said you know what I'm gonna start using this I'll see if it works the second night I used it I had been up for 10 nights 12 nights in a row the second night I used that the pain was completely gone I've had no pain at all since then now I did get adjusted I did get decompressed at the chiropractor's office but this was an is a chiropractor how long does it take east normally takes 20 treatments to get relief and I'd only been I'd seen him three times and I really hadn't had relief anytime I had been adjusted yet although I needed it so he helped with the mechanical problem but the but the hemp oil helped with the inflammation and it was dramatic trust me I use it that paint was so bad I said God if the pain didn't go away take me home it was so bad it was like somebody put a knife and I never had a pain like that and I've had a kidney stone so I've experienced some bad painting that was horrible and the hemp oil helped me and and so we've heard back from our guests tell him about tell him about your mama that is a remarkable story that I shared this story last night and I'm I I haven't really shared this in in any major forum but and I don't mind sharing this because this is pretty remarkable my mother had a major intracranial bleed about 20 almost 20 years ago and she had both of her frontal lobes removed my mom should not have lived you know she's 84 now and you know she was in a coma for three weeks she was at at a major New York Hospital and the doctors were great you know I said them I want my mom to have I want to liquefy her Co Q 10 I would liquefy her vitamins I and they said doctor de Silva you do whatever you want put it in the G to put it in the gastrostomy to and I did mom made it 98 percent of those people don't make it so my mom was one of the 2% and you know so it's 20 years later my mother acts like a dementia patient and it's hard I mean it's difficult this is my my my the love of my life which is my mom and recently mom's been getting really agitated you know she's 84 as I said and the only person that she would allow to clean her and help her get dressed and help her in the bathroom is my dad and my dad's 84 so it's a little bit difficult so we have help that comes in and dad said look we got to do something you know and I said dad take her to the gist my dad kept saying I want to take her to the neurologist and get her checked I said fine do all of that I spoke to the neurologist he said well you can give her some of these drugs we have that will calm her down like like the xanax and the ativan and all all the drugs your doctors have wanted to give you in the past for a host of different reasons and and I said that just before we do anything let's try the full spectrum hemp oil and my dad just kept saying and my dad's in medical field also kept saying I don't know I don't know I said dad and I actually got annoyed and that's not something I typically do what my father that you know I'm 63 years old that I've ever done and I really got a little annoyed nice to dad you need to do this he said okay he took I said start mom with 20 drops he put it in a little bit of water and gave it to mom and he called me less than a week later and said I cannot believe it she's better she's allowing the help that comes in to clean her she's calmer she's sleeping better and she's doing well and now I can't say to my dad I told you you know and and he said look this is great this is great and actually right now as we're taping this my father is on vacation with a bunch of his friends that I'm sure they're drinking all my liquor cos are at my house in Florida and they're having a great time okay on a golfing trip they're absolutely with all his buddies and you know they're hanging out at my home I'm afraid to go there because I've got to get the place cleaned afterwards but seriously if this is something that I feel strongly about believe it or not I have a four-year-old grandson who's very active we give him a couple of drops before he goes to sleep you know one drop or 20 pounds my son gives them actually two drops for 20 pounds and when I go to watch am i given three drops for 20 pounds only kidding but seriously this is something that is safe it's effective and there are applications again start low and go slow and see how you feel with it well thank you very much for this great presentation on the full spectrum hemp all the reason I they're the rear let me tell you the reasons I like it one I truck I know like and trust dr. de Silva and he I've heard him speak on heart disease numerous times at the various health conferences I have attended by the way he is the chairman of the of the age management medicine conference which has over twenty fifteen to twenty thousand physicians who belong to this who used natural approaches to help their patients get on a path of health and wellness naturally he's the chairman of this organization I'll be speaking at it this April down in Florida so I'm looking forward to that thank you for that invitation you're welcome the so I've respected dr. de Silva I know like and trust him and so when he started to talk about CBD oil or as as it is produced full-spectrum hemp all my ears perked up and look he knows what he's doing he's well-respected I respect him I'm gonna try it based upon knowing and trusting him and I and we've done it I'm tell you what I'm a believer now and I wasn't a believer before I didn't I was agnostic about CBD oil when I used it for myself I use it every night trust me on that and I'm going to because I never want to have that pain again and now I know that I've got some inflammation in my neck I don't I mean I have degenerative changes in my neck I don't want that to flare up again so I'm gonna keep it under control but remember we also now have a topical yeah which that's right yes so he just come out with the topical full-spectrum hemp oil that you can put on the areas of your of your body where you're exhibiting the pain and the surrounding muscles so by the way no parabens it is it's got a really its water soluble so the solubility on this is is important it is completely water soluble that is why is that important the reason solubility I didn't do my nails so don't get too close to this okay solubility is so important because when I put this on my shoulder or on my knee I don't want my clothing to get sure messed up what I want is to this to go right into solution I wanted to go because the solubility it's not greasy and it doesn't stink this has a very nice odor it's a mint like odor but it immediately goes into skin and it's completely sobbed there's no parabens there's no chemicals there's no preservatives this is this is the good stuff and it works now I told this story last night that many many many years ago whenever I came out with a new product I gave it to my mother-in-law to try first if nothing happened to her I would give it to my mother but you know what's happening today dr. Hoadley my son keeps saying dad let's give it to my mother-in-law so now we gave everything to his mother-in-law first cuz god rest her soul my mother-in-law is gone she has left us and we gave it to my son's mother-in-law she put it on her hands and she and she had some [ __ ] some serious joint you know in mobility and it's feeling so much better so we have a new guinea pig which I'm very happy about and it's working so here at the OGF and Wellness Center we offered the full spectrum hemp all again the reason I like that I like doctor the silvers product is one it's organically grown secondly it's grown in the United States thirdly it's full spectrum it contains all the cannabinoid oils not just one and fourthly it's in a liposomal form so that it is dissolved in water and it's it's much more highly absorbed in the system than if you just had regular oils and also its third-party independently tested for what's in it and we can we can show you the certificate analysis a certificate of analysis trust me you can't get that on most of the other now CB deals who knows what's in them that's very important and plus we've done testing third-party testing on individuals that have taken it so I know they're getting the product I know it's rapidly absorbed and I know from personal experience and from testimonies of our guests that they've had real success with it so here's here's what I recommend if you're having problems with pain whether it's joint pain or muscle pain maybe even headaches if you're having problems with pain if you're having problem with sleep if you have any problems with anxiety nervousness or panic attacks give it a try what have you got to lose you buy a bottle of it if it doesn't work you're not obligated to ever buy it again if it works then you've got a solution for your problems and you may want to give it to some of your family members if they have similar problems so it just gives us an added on in what we do is regenerative medicine and we want to revitalize and regenerate the cells to everybody to keep them healthy as we mature and age using hormone replacement good healthy eating programs treatment of yeast natural hormone replacement vitamin and mineral supplementation to help you detox a good exercise program all these keep the body rejuvenated keep it healthy keep it vital keep it active and this is just another adjunct therapy that we can use to help you stay healthy and this is the full-spectrum hempel so I just recommend that you give it a shot we have it here at the ho chi minh store and you know we bought we bought initially 150 bottles and it sold out like that I couldn't believe it you know and now we we just got another 500 bottles and they they've told us already in the first two weeks since getting that we sold a hundred bottles so there's a demand for it and a great interest for it and obviously it wouldn't sell if it didn't work correct so the proofs always going to be in the pudding and some you know we might have some conventional doctors going well give me a double-blind study look I had a neck problem and it was killing me and I was asking God to take me home and hurt so bad and I used the hip haul and went away that's all I need to know it's a subset of well it's a null set it's a test of one I had neck pain I took the I took the hemp ball and went away thank you by the way just as an FYI 125 people die every year 100 of that's probably more of fda-approved drugs 125,000 hundred - excuse me 125,000 people die every year of fda-approved Doug's donut don't approve this please please don't approve this so I'd rather stay the waiting right and this is natural so people don't die from overdosing on vitamin C or vitamin D or any of the vitamins and minerals vitamin B you that's not gonna keep people die from drugs pharmaceutical drugs and those are dangerous so this has no side effects of course even if you take too much water you can kill yourself and it's natural so we don't overdose there's a certain range that we use in all our natural products but the natural products don't cause the debility the pharmaceutical products do and so instead of taking pain medication or any anxiety medication or sleep medication when you have problems pharmaceutical which are going to make you sicker quicker try the hemp oil either in the sublingual form or you can use it in the topical form you can get it here from hozeva dr. de Silva thank you for your I pledge your great work in this field and I sure appreciate you I look forward to all the other new products that you're developing as a matter of fact I'm gonna work with dr. de Silva he's got some wonderful products he's developed we do vitamins and minerals here at the hotel and Wellness Center hosts vitamins and he's got some great ideas on how we can improve the viability the the use of these vitamins and make them even more effective for you so that you can maintain and obtain and maintain health and wellness naturally as a matter of fact I don't want you just what I'm thinking of changed the terms up for 20 years said obtain and maintain health and wellness naturally we want you to be able to regain and maintain your health and wellness that that's what regenerative medicine does so thank you again dr. de Silva thank each one of you for joining us here on dr.

minutes and I'm hoping it's just a few minutes about the announcement that we might be partnering with Charlotte's Web a maker of CVD oils so I've written up a bunch of things I'm just gonna give you some research that I have looked at for a little bit now and then want to give you a personal opinion on it as well so I know I've had some of y'all contact me about it already and just thought you know what that video is the best way to go about this and I want to train you guys this week on what this looks like coming down the pike what is CBD oil what does it do tons of questions not sure I'm gonna have all the answers but hopefully this week it'll be a little bit clearer okay disclosure I'm not making any speculations about what is gonna happen with plexus and CBD oil from Charlotte's Web as of today today's may 4th for me 2019 we have no information from plexus corporate other than the fact that one of the founders of a company called Charlotte's Web is going to be speaking at convention the speaker's name is joel stanley and he's one of seven brothers who founded the CBD oil and company the men that founded the company our brothers char very own Jane Hopkins she's one of our appliance if you guys have not heard of her name or you don't really know how she's related test I think I'm maybe her level six or something secondly I'm hoping this video is going to provide an information that I've researched already said that I'm not gonna try to answer every single question you have but I'm hopefully over this next week lots of answers to some of the questions and hopefully this video is going to better educate you on what exactly CBD oil is what it can do for you and the company behind it all right so let's talk fact versus fiction for a second because I don't have the wrong impression of CBD oil and I'll talk about that a little later towards the end of the video fact there are two active ingredients in marijuana and him those active ingredients are called THC and CBD you guys can look at what those stand for I'm just trying to make this a quicker video by the abbreviated version of it THC is the component in the plant that is psychoactive and gets you high okay CBD is the component in the plant that modulates chemical and electrical activity to help quiet the excessive activity in the brain causing a myriad of issues one of them being seizures all right fiction this is a big one for me because I thought this was true CBD oil is only made of marijuana not true CBD oil is not medical marijuana at the beginning when Charlotte's Web oh I'm sorry at the beginning Charlotte's Web and their product was classified as that so if you're looking at stuff I think the CNN documentary even calls it medical marijuana once it was classified is that it is no longer classified as that okay it's been reclassified as hemp which you go into a whole food store I'm assuming Trader Joe's as well and you can find him okay CBD oil contains 21 percent of the CBD component and less than 1% of the THC it's actually like 0.3% of the THC all right it took years of crossbreeding to break down that THC because the brothers wanted the medical component of it and not the psychoactive aspect of it why do we need CBD oil okay so we've discussed the fact that it's not going to make you kind of go out of your mind it's not psychoactive you're not gonna get high off of this why is everybody talking about it I went into my holistic doctor and with my newborn just the other day is a whole row set up of CBD oils he's a believer I walk in he's got Christian stuff everywhere and the TV station had on Christian speakers and preachers and so he had CBD CBD oil everywhere I went into my car vouchers office two weeks ago when the baby was born got him adjusted and she has CBD oil stuff everywhere so it's kind of um it's kind of a new thing that help was kind of the new thing and now we're kind of talking about CBD oil and why do we need this every single person okay not just people who smoked me to the best every single person has something called an endocannabinoid system in your body all right now this system was discovered in the 90s I've seen different dates given on that 92 94 so I'm just gonna say the early nineties so if you didn't hear about this biological system growing up in school it's because it's more relatively new so let's talk about what this system actually does in our bodies and this was kind of a fascinating study for me I really enjoyed and learning more about it so um first let's just mention homeostasis some of these words are coming back from your biology class right homeostasis is your body's effort to keep everything operating correctly I'm going to put the links for where I found all of this information in the comments of this video so if you're like where'd she get all this I'm going to share it with you okay it works to keep your internal environment inside stable and optimal no matter what's happening in the environment outside of you guys okay so I'm going to give you an illustration of kind of what that looks like you guys are just all from a website but I love the way to explain it it just makes a lot of sense so let's think of this system as the electrical panel in your car okay so the endocannabinoid system think of it like the electrical panel in your car the gauges tell you something is not operating correctly okay you're gonna have a light flash on when something isn't operating in the right range like your temperatures too high your heart's beating too fast maybe your hormone levels are off your body is going to activate the endocannabinoid system to regulate it if you're really hot and you begin to sweat it's your endocannabinoid system working to cool you down right your endo cannabinoid system does this using two receptors okay and from my research we only know about two receptors there's possibility that there's more but i'mma tell you let me know now CB CB one controls your central nervous system CB 2 controls the nerves in your extremities digestive system and specialized cells in your immune system we've had a fun science day already haven't we okay your endocannabinoid system can help regulate your appetite your digestion your immune function inflammation including it gyro inflammation your mood your sleep your reproduction and fertility motor control temperature regulation memory pain it's a lot of stuff right so hearing all of that how does I guess your next question is well how does the endocannabinoid system like how does it why does it need the oil to help it well just like poor gut health can wreck your the rest of your body your endocannabinoid system can also be wrecked just by things that are happening to you things that you eat that are not good for you etc so because we have something like pro bio that can help the gut and we're all aware of how great that is we have we turn to something for from the plants as well to help the endocannabinoid system just continue to function correctly or to start functioning correctly again we take phyto cannabinoids to help the endocannabinoid system okay if you remember science Fido is from a plant so we take plants to help our endocannabinoid system CBD is one of the phyto cannabinoids CBD can go directly into your endo system and like a key it can unlock that system that is not working properly so CBD is kind of a supplement like vitamin C it's it's very benign but it can be very important for a system that for years we didn't even know we had I'm hoping that makes sense it made a lot of sense to me I really enjoy the study of that I know you still have got questions I'm hoping this week on our team page helps with that I'm going to continue to give you more information as I hear about it from corporate or from other people with plexus who are much more skilled and well versed at this stuff than I am I want to close with the fact that most of you know I'm a conservative Christian and and I want to give you a personal opinion about what I think about the CVD oil that might have been why you are watching this video in the first place just to hear my opinion on it when I heard this was coming out with plexus I was really skeptical my husband and I talked about it now we still do not know what's coming out it just when I saw that we were having a speaker from this company come speak obviously we start thinking something's coming down the pipeline and I was really skeptical and so is my husband and he even said you know Courtney you've had a great five years of plexus and maybe this is just the time that God had for us and we need to be done now and I was like well let me just educate myself on it and see what it is which is what I'm hoping this video has done for you and it's maybe even been a jumping point for you to do your own research and come up with some more answers to questions that you may have but the more that I once uncovered about CBD oil especially with Charlotte's Web I feel comfortable with whatever plexus decides to do in the future with a product as long as the THC levels remain below that 1% and here's how my husband I came to that conclusion about ten times in the Bible we are told to be sober minded that sober mindedness is one reason why we choose not to drink I know there's a lot of Christians out there now who choose to drink that's kind of between you and God and I we just for ourselves have chosen not to because we choose to stay sober minded anything that can mess with my mind and cause me to act or speak in a way that I don't have completely complete control over is something that I choose personally not to use there is no psychoactive materials in the CBD oil produced by Charlotte's Web it is illegal in all 50 states to use ship or sell CBD oil okay so I'm not breaking any laws by using it selling it it's also able to be used by anyone if you watch that amazing CNN documentary where they kind of named the whole company after this one little girl who was having about 300 seizures a week and after using this product she no longer is having seizures I think she's seven years seizure freedom but if you've seen that obviously even children can use it and she's not the only child that has used it that they have worked with so ultimately what I'm saying is this is a decision you guys have to pray through um is it something that you feel comfortable with you and your family using is it something you feel comfortable selling I will say if it's not something you feel comfortable using or selling that doesn't mean you have to quit Lexus and it just means maybe that's not something you actively promote and that's not a testimony that you share on your page if it is something you feel comfortable with more power to you I do not want to be the I guess deciding factor for you and your family on what y'all are comfortable with and so I'm leaving that up to you as the individual as families that's just my take on why we are going to continue with plexus why we left Lexus and why we feel comfortable with whatever is coming down the pike as long as it stays about 1% or less of the THC so I'm hoping that helps guys I look forward to a great week sharing more information as the week goes on have a great day", "3msoAj5S6ts": "oh hi I'm just catching up on my Einstein here you know I read that if you take CBD it increases your IQ but I think it must be a scam because I don't understand a word in this book hi I'm Greg welcome to happy talk and today I want to talk about syringes and how to use them these syringes that we carry come in one gram 1 gram syringes and which is a thousand milligrams of hemp and that's pure hemp extract there's no carrier oils there's no MCT there's no other oils in it and other additives just pure hemp and we carry two kinds one is has 17% CBD one is 25 percent so 17 percent of a thousand milligrams this one has 170 milligrams this is the gold 25% formula so that means it has 250 milligrams per each syringe these syringes are marked by 1/10 of a gram and that's generally a dose 1/10 you might want to take half of one tenth or one twentieth of a gram in the morning another one twenty the night or just you know one 1/10 once a day and these are really easy to use all you have to do is take off the cap at the end and then push off your dose easiest thing is just put it on your finger and then put it between your gums and cheek or you can also put it off in a spoon push it down and spoon that is so they push out your dose put it between your cheeks and gums and that's it now the gold formula tastes like normal hemp wood like you expect it to taste and the green formula 7 the 17% definitely has more it has more plant materials so it's definitely a stronger taste but both are work excellent and excellent way to get your daily CBD and now if you'll excuse me I got some Einstein to study you", "FzHpka3Zefg": "cbd is a popular cannabis plant that has exploded into the mainstream it's been featured on multiple news outlets major online e-commerce and all-over headlines you may be wondering where does it come from well cbd comes from the hemp plant or more precisely cannabis sativa l plants you may be familiar with thc it's associated with that high feeling it's responsible for mood altering and it's also illegal in many states this is also found in hemp plants and the also psychoactive cbd however is the opposite it's not mood altering and is legal in europe in all states in america in europe however cbd sold more as a food supplement and contains little to no thc in it around 0.3 to be exact one of the reasons cbd is gaining so much traction and popularity is because it has been linked to benefits such as pain relief sleep and anxiety it's crazy let's get into how this works so cbd is the stimulator of our body's natural endocannabinoid system i know that's a mouthful but just imagine the endocannabinoid system as a major component of things such as our mood our quality of sleep generally it just wants to help maintain a healthy bodily system furthermore unlike thc cbd is a natural stimulus that helps our body produce more of what it likes it acts as a powerful anti-inflammatory for our system there's a growing awareness of benefits of cbd oils for health it's suggested to carry a lot of therapeutic benefits their properties are different from medical marijuana which is meant to be used as a pain reliever to alleviate symptoms in patients but cbd oil is a hemp extract collected from legitimate hemp varieties so in short thc acts more like a drug whereas cbd promotes the natural production from our body so that means we're not changing or blocking anything it's in many forms now actually oils creams wine tea bags and sweets if you've tried any of these or we've missed any please let us know down in the comments below now i guess we should talk about some of the possible side effects cbd products are generally well tolerated and safe to consume most people can ingest cbd oil without experiencing any unpleasant side effects but there are a few to be listed like diarrhea changes in weight and appetite and fatigue more research on the health benefits of cbd oil is still ongoing today and there's still a lot to be learned but all studies today say that cbd is safe and a great choice of treatment for many health issues now a lot of you are probably on your second tab searching to buy cbd right now but there are still some important pointers we need to talk about especially if you don't want to waste your money first of all be careful not to buy hemp seed oil cbd and hemp seed oil are two completely different things a lot of people can be misled thinking that the hemp seed product that they found contained cbd in it but they would be disappointed to find that hemp seed oil actually contains no cbd hemp seed oil is only extracted from the seeds of the hemp plant they don't contain any cannabinoids in them but they still do contain a lot of valuable nutrients also to ensure you don't get into any legal trouble you must make sure you're looking at the broad spectrum cbd not full spectrum full spectrum cbd is extracted from the cannabis plant with all the other compounds that means it also contains thc in there it's not illegal in the uk yet but it's best to avoid it as it still could result in some legal ramifications in the future as we said earlier thc acts more like a drug that means if you're an athlete you want to make sure you're taking 0 thc just to be sure there's also the isolate spectrum which is the purest form of cbd to achieve this all the plant materials filtered out of the extraction resulting in 99 pure cbd it's the most processed form of hemp basically making it a refined version of cbd broad spectrum cbd on the other hand is cbd that has been extracted from the cannabis plant with all the other beneficial compounds without thc broad spectrum is linked to more that therapeutic effect so for most people broad spectrum should be what you're looking for now if you're looking for cbd oil broad spectrum that is on our website we sell cbd balm oil and capsules if you want to try out some bodies of yours you can send a coupon to your friends and you both benefit from 10 pounds off your next order well everyone we hope you enjoyed the video today expect more videos talking about cbd oil and its effects with things like depression how you should take it

Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract\nyou need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it\nsmells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the\nplant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an\nextract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you\nhow to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is\nthe leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you\nknow there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different\nvarieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could\napply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol\ntake a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very\nfast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it\ndoes you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough\nethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three\nminutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you\ndon't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix\nwell then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do\nsimply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit\nyou know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're\ngoing to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you\nhave left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine\nIt can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the\nfiltration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid\nand you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order\nto accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has\noccurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any\nmore, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so\nwhen you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example\nof a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and\na water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with\nany of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who\ndoesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier\nlet's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the\nethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation\ndepends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect\nthe pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it\nagain and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when\nto stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's\nindication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly\nand look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is\nthe time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful\nwhen you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose\nit and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what\nwe have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the\nheating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that\nyou're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from\nall the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality\ntest we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use\na lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is \nstill ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you\nneed to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a\ncannabis extract at home you need a lighter\nfilter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls\nsieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into\nthe bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter\nthe alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still\nuntil 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball\nhit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the\nremaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon\nand the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will\nproduce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get\nany sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned\nnext time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure\ncannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful crystals See you next time", "zZfwGaaa-Q8": "[Music] in this video we're going to be covering a number of topics what is CBD what's the difference between hemp and marijuana and cover the health benefits of cannabidiol or CBD what is the difference between isolate and full-spectrum CBD and then we're also going to share some of our recommendations for the best CBD for pain anxiety sleep we're gonna share what's the best you can bundle and save as well as the brand that has the best variety of CBD products at the very end we'll share with you some coupon codes so that you can get the most out of your money so what is CBD CBD or cannabidiol is a compound extracted from the cannabis or hemp plant and CBD can be separated from the other cannabinoids through an extraction process that leaves you just with the benefits of CBD now with the cannabis plant the most famous compound is THC this it has psychoactive effects and people often associate this with getting high now CBD works in the body differently it's does not have psychoactive effects and it binds with your endocannabinoid system to bring balance to your body and that's why it's so popular with folks in treating conditions such as anxiety chronic pain and even epilepsy so what is the difference between hemp and marijuana marijuana and hemp come from the same species of plant but they've been bred for very different purposes marijuana is probably the better known of the two and it's often associated with recreational use this has to do with the fact that the compound THC is often high in marijuana it's actually been bred to be so for people who are looking for a psychoactive effect now this has also led to heavy regulation of marijuana by the go in the United States hemp naturally has less THC than marijuana and has been actually used in the past to make ropes paper textiles and building materials it grows taller than marijuana and it's comes in strong woody stalks now CBD that is extracted from hemp is able to isolate and remove the THC so that you're not going to have that psychoactive effect hemp itself has made huge grounds recently legally with the passage of the 2018 farm bill which has legalized the cultivation of hemp federally in all 50 states so what is it that makes CBD so popular well the core of CBDs popularity lies in its health benefits it offers there are a myriad of health benefits that CBD can offer ranging from being able to improve your mood or reduce anxiety all the way to having significant health benefits when it comes to injuries or heart health or bone structure now CBD health benefits have been researched and there's actually an fda-approved drug which is a CBD medicine for epilepsy now because hemp and marijuana have both been regulated for so long we're still in the early stages of CBD research but the results are incredibly positive in the tests that we have now if you've been looking online at CBD you probably see a lot of discussion about full spectrum versus isolate CBD we'll break it down for you full spectrum CBD contains every cannabinoid present in the cannabis or hemp plant so when these products are extracted you have not just CBD and THC but all the different cannabinoids now full spectrum products do contain only a small amount of THC and they have to have less than zero point three percent now isolate on the other hand is when CBD is separated from all the other compounds so you're not going to have any THC present in this and so they will just be the CBD compound now one of the benefits of full-spectrum is having all these other cannabinoids present there's something called the entourage effect where the cannabinoids work together to maximize the benefits you receive from taking CBD however many stick with isolate if they're concerned about even that trace amount of THC is showing up on a drug test it's not that we've talked a bit about what CBD is here at popular CBD brands we review products we look at lab

you're new here and i do reviews of all kinds of things today i'm super excited because i'm going to review product that i've been using for a very long time a couple products actually from charlotte's web so if you are new here i would absolutely love if you subscribe to my channel and turn on the notifications so you get all of my new reviews now today just so you know this product review that i'm going to tell you about i'm also going to write about so if you want to read the article that i wrote go ahead and click in the description i'll have the link in there it'll be a little more detailed than this video because i'm going to kind of do an overview tell you how i like this stuff i've been using charlotte's web cbd products for a very long time and let's just jump right into it so i have three products here these are the three products from charlotte's web that i regularly take i have the capsules which is a cbd capsule i have the tincture the cbd tincture and i have the gummies these are the sleep gummies specifically so if you are in the market for cbd or maybe you're just doing some more research trying to figure out if cbd is right for you i'm going to talk a little bit about that at the beginning but just know i will have more information on the article in there so charlotte's web most of their products all the products that i have here are a full spectrum cbd product now there are different types of cbd products there's full spectrum there's hemp there's broad spectrum there's a cbd isolate so there are different types so just so you guys know up front these that i have today are full spectrum cbd products which pretty much just means that these products are made from more parts of the hemp plant which in my opinion gives it even more positive benefits so that's why i really like a full spectrum cbd product so if you want to learn more about the differences of full spectrum versus broad spectrum versus cbd isolate i would definitely recommend doing that but let's go ahead and tell you about this so i'm going to start with my favorite product first and that's the gummies okay so these are the sleep gummies and i love this because i personally use cbd the most often to help me sleep yes there are other benefits amazing benefits like helping with inflammation helping with stresses or anxieties helping with worries i know a lot of the times when i do get a little stressed i will use either the capture the uh capsules or the tincture as well i have the chocolate mint tincture by the way and it's so freaking good it's my first time trying that flavor um but i really like to use cbd to help me sleep and these sleep gummies also contain melatonin which is a hormone that our bodies naturally produce that helps to promote good sleep these are raspberry i'll show you guys what they look like and i take two of these gummies which it says two on the back and two gummies um there's 30 servings of two gummies so there's 60 gummies inside of here and then each serving contains 20 milligrams of hemp extract just so you guys know you can find all this information out by the way on their website um and this is what they look like so you can see they literally look just like a gummy so i'll take one now but it'll calm me down it will really if i take one during the day which i sometimes do take a gummy during the day it tastes just like a raspberry gummy um the flavor is not horrible at all i actually enjoy gummies cbd gummies um but when i take two of these which i take about 30 minutes before i go to sleep i sleep so good like when i tell you these work they freaking work so if you have trouble like getting to sleep like i do or staying asleep or getting into a deep sleep this product may be for you i absolutely love it and then another one that i really like to use are the capsules so capsules i really like the benefits of these because you don't have to worry about like versus a tincture you don't have to worry about like measuring it out or how many like milligrams you're getting the tincture in here one dropper full contains 25 milligrams of the hemp extract so like you have to have that full dropper full to make sure you're getting the 40 or the 25 milligrams in there these they're already like pre-measured out you literally can just take a capsule you don't have to worry about like putting the tincture and the tincture just means guys it's just like a little syringe and you put it in your mouth like under your tongue when you take it for about a minute and you can see that color there that's from like i think the cocoa mint because other full spectrum cbds that i've taken are just like clear with a little hint of yellow but i think that is from the cocoa mitt flavor but back to the capsules i'll take these if you know i had a really hard workout i noticed that this helps with like if i have muscle pains or muscle soreness if i experience any inflammation i have back problems so i find a lot of relief with the capsules when i take them for those things and then the tincture which is the coco mint i'll take every once in a while so i absolutely use one of these products every single day because there's actually been research done to find that you do have to be consistent so in order to get the amazing benefits of cbd you have to continue to take it and that's when i find the most benefits so i do take at least one of these products every single day to help with my sleep if i'm stressed if i have inflammation or pain i find that cbd really helps for me in these ways so i love all of these products so much and i i'm gonna put again that article below if you guys want to check out more but just so you know charlotte's web as a company i'm gonna tell you why i love this company so much they are super transparent this is why this is one of the companies that i absolutely love because they're super transparent not only about what their products are and how they work what to expect you literally any question you have about cbd you can find on their website but they're also super transparent about their process so not only how they grow their plants which they grow their own plants in here in the usa in colorado they're super transparent about it but they're also super transparent about their quality and what steps they take to ensure that their products are the best of the best quality they have all of their tests like their test results on their website you can access them to me a company should absolutely do that if they want to be trustworthy i find that charlotte's web does all of those things provides in my opinion even more information than they really have to so i 110 trust this company and their products and the quality of their products so i wanted to share because they're one of my favorites i get so many questions about cbd and what do i use cbd for so hopefully this was helpful absolutely if you guys have any questions for me or you know about charlotte's web about these products specifically they do offer way more products than what i use regularly they do offer a cbd isolate as well so if cbd full spectrum isn't something you're looking for they do have other options as well they offer different doses so i would definitely recommend finding out which product and again this is all on their website which product is going to be best for you but let me just tell you you can't go wrong with these the sleep gummies the coco mint tincture or the capsules these are ones that i use every single day and love but hopefully this was helpful if you guys have any questions again let me know in the comments and i'd be happy to help but thanks for tuning in and i will see you guys in the next video i'm actually going to be sharing even more cbd companies that i love because i do absolutely love cbd products and they've helped me in my life tremendously so get ready for that along with many many more reviews of tons of different things so i will see you guys in the next video take care [Music] you", "4fSyQ8imidY": "so I wanted to do a review for CBD I've been trying some of their products the two products I've tried are the peppermint full-spectrum oil and the neon gummy bears first off a little bit less important but both products taste really good the gummies I almost just ate a whole pack one time because they tasted really good and they actually work great compared to like a lot of the other companies that I've tried CBD gummies and then this stuff to CBD peppermint oil it's super strong I'll take it if I'm having trouble going to sleep I'll take a dropper in it with about 20-30 minutes I'm feeling super chill super calm and I'm usually sleep in like 20-30 minutes how they recommend this stuff I also found out that on the pack there's a QR code that you can scan and it'll tell you the lab results so you can actually see what you're putting in your body which is really cool and there's only like a few ingredients in here which are make let you know that there's not any garbage that you're that you're taking both the products super solid and highly recommend both of them I'll continue to buy these they're definitely my favorite but but I highly recommend them thanks TV", "I36VDGeppaA": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "NXNPDILjQ94": "[Music] hey everybody due to YouTube's new terms and conditions this video is now age restricted if you are not 18 or older please exit the video thank you hello everybody and welcome back to your query cannabis in today's video I'm gonna be making cinnamon flavored CBD oil but first before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind hit that subscribe button if you're new here and you've already subscribed don't forget to give the video a thumbs up and I really do appreciate you guys supporting our channel so today we're gonna be making a cinnamon flavored CBD oil now the first ingredient of course is going to be our hemp flour that we grew this summer and today we're going to be using our cherry wine have flour so this came in at 17.4% CBD so we'll be doing 13 grams of decarboxylated hemp flour per cup so a total of 26 grams of d carb hemp flour but and today's recipe I will be adding cherry wine shake or trim now this is just trim buzz the sugar leaves or buds that fell off during the trim bag process and these are great to add CBD a now CBD a is the raw plant material so when it's d carved it removes the a and then you just have regular old CBD that we're all familiar with CBD a has its own good properties so we are going to be adding about 4 grams of raw material on top of the D kar material and as you just heard the oven is preheated so is that 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're going to put it in for 30 minutes so while we're waiting for the D carve our I'm gonna gather all the materials in the magic butter machine get that all set up so we can start making our flavored CBD oil 10 grams of cherry wine trim or shake whatever you want to call it this is raw plant material that is not decarboxylated and I'll get our decarboxylated hemp flour in a minute so I did 5 grams per cup of MCT oil so the first time add that material right into the magic butter machine next I'm going to measure out two cups of MCT oil okay so that's 2 cups now I'm going to add our cinnamon now this is all-natural ground cinnamon and you really don't want to overpower it now is the cinnamon going to eliminate the plant flavor no it's definitely going to knock it down but it's not going to taste like a big red or anything like that ok and I do just about a half a spoonful and right into the machine it goes now machine has a blender and a grinder so don't have to mix it around or anything like that now I'm going to go ahead and grab our D carved hemp flour now that's 26 grams of our cherry one head flower at 17.4% cvd so and it goes I can never get all the buds into the magic butter machine without losing a couple of them ok get this out of here and that's the recipe folks and of course I will leave the recipe down in the description below we're going to plug in our magic bard machine get it ready to go all right and we are going to do 160 degrees for 4 hours so I'll see you in four hours and I'll show you the finished product okay so it's been four hours and it's time to get the product out of the magic butter machine so stereotypical magic butter machine style you know you've got to get all the plant material off the base of the blender you know nothing crazy but you don't want to lose that material or at least try the best you can to get it off you're gonna do the same thing on the container you can see in there all that plant material so it's gonna get that all out of here all right looks good now again if you're using another kitchen gadget you know it really depends how messy you want things well that's why I like the magic butter machine so we're going to get our magic butter micron filter and put that into our four cup Pyrex and dump it in you know see if we can get all that out of here again the reason why you want all this plant material is the more you can get in this micron bag the squeeze the more will you're gonna get out of it because all this plant material has got oil in it okay it looks pretty good for now we're gonna get the love gloves silicone gloves just shake it down we're going to give it to squeeze you can see all that material coming out of there all that oil coming out of there so I'm excited to give this a go I know it's gonna be great in some like chai tea stuff like that that cinnamon really holds some good flavor again it doesn't get rid of the plant taste but it definitely covers it a little bit so that's it for today guys I really hope you enjoyed this video hope you use this recipe to your advantage and before we close out the video I want to remind everybody you can find us on Instagram and Facebook now I'll leave those links in the description below along with the recipe that I use today and thank you for watching if you haven't subscribed yet please do don't forget to give a thumbs up on your way out and I will see you guys in the next video take care", "0B-5VgkniMQ": "hello everybody this is pat level 5 custom processing and ranch CBD net i am the chief operating officer today we're going to talk about full spectrum a lot of confusion about that term you'll see this in the supermarkets you see it all over the internet you'll see it on drug store shelves and you'll hear it talked about at your cocktail parties what is full spectrum well let's go back to the basics every plant has essential oil cannabis plants no different essential oils are made up of chemical compounds and water in the case of cannabis a University of Washington found that there were about 480 chemical compounds in the full spectrum oil of the cannabis plant they tested about sixty six of those were cannabinoids that's a follow on video we'll talk about the advantages of those the cannabinoids have the THC the CBD and just a wonderful bouquet of of other chemicals but the real bouquet is in the terpenes so along with you but you're 66 can have a noise you've got about 100 terpenes down there terpenes are our other chemical compounds that work with our body they have effects on our body in those terpenes you'll find things like pining you're familiar with tiny'mon if you've ever walked through a pine forest or picked up a two-by-four a pine 2x4 that's had sap on it and that sap gets on your hands or you'll smell it you're smelling the pining the terpene out of the essential oil of the pine tree full spectrum is quite quite simply it is is the full bouquet the full the full list of the chemical compounds in the essential oil and and when you're harvesting that for human use what you have to do is you have to eliminate the parts of the plant for that that aren't any that that aren't of use for instance the first thing we do is we we dry out water we remove the moisture that moisture is coming out of the oil essence the essential oil the the next thing you're going to do is you're going to remove the fiber and this is an extraction process where we actually take the essential oil out of the plant out of the cells and the fiber of the plant it comes out quite frankly looking a little bit like baby poop it's a yellow yellow thing anybody if you got kids you would recognize this and and what we do is then run it through a cold process where we chill it down we we liquefy and go through a winterization process and we remove the wax out of that plant any of you folks out there that have ever dealt with plant waxes you know that it has wax when you pull the wax out because that's not that's not part of the essential oil that we would use and the rest of the oil there which has about the 480 chemical compounds is is quite frankly what is the full-spectrum product that we're using commercially the wax goes off for one use but the rest of that oil is is an ineffective fall spectrum folks when you're looking at a full spectrum product when they claim that there's a couple of things you need to know you need to know what their processing is all about you know finding that on their website if they're using any kind of heat process they're destroying the full spectrum oil full spectrum oil or the there will the essential oil is is a is a taken apart similar to what an oil refinery takes apart crude oil where an oil refinery would make take and apply heat and pressure to crude oil and they would make gasoline or diesel oil for us some manufacturers mostly the recreational manufacturers out there will actually apply heat and pressure to a full spectrum oil and they will pull the THC out of it and they turn that into a recreational product that many many people use and enjoy if you're looking for it for a health purpose you don't want that taken apart the full-spectrum oil is is a has a lot of goodness in it and and it has entourage effects and in quite a few things that we will talk about in the next videos coming up be careful with your full-spectrum oil folks get educated on what you're doing when you do cannabis just like anything else if you're out here for your health you need to get to know it you need to make sure that it's been tested you need to make sure that their processes are deed preserving the full-spectrum oil that you need and you need to understand how that's going to affect your body in the endocannabinoid system and the Android can endocannabinoid system is a homework assignment for you get online and learn about it because it's inside you folks this is Pat with level-5 custom processing and ranch CBD and and I got one other thing to show you here this is actually what a full-spectrum extraction looks like this is out of a plant a strain up in the Emerald triangle of California you'll see there how clear and how beautiful that is you see the dark color this oil has had of course the fiber remove the plants con and the water has been removed it is stable and we've removed the wax so what you see here is I'm ruling the jar and you'll just see it's clear it's beautiful it has a wonderful bouquet of smells in the thing and being up here in wine country we've we've kind of attached to it if if you smell this oil you will smell it and can describe it similar to what they do in the wine industry it has a hint of oak and it has a hint of pine and it has a hint of these different flavors and it smells listen folks it's it's it's it's pretty it's pretty exciting for an old guy like me check us

hello and it's a really odd time for me to be down live on YouTube so I don't know if anyone's gonna watch life but please feel free to watch back later on and comment and I would try my best to get back to you because this is a conversation I'd quite like to see being quite interactive now the label the the title of this sounds extreme and it potentially is extreme however I've been doing some research as far as the popular use of full spectrum sea video is concerned now up until recently all of the oils that I've used have been full spectrum and all of the oils I use contain in that case a degree of tac now for those of you that don't fully understand how seed oil works um you tend to get a couple of different types of see video oil but the most popular is full-spectrum oil and that obviously contains CBD but it also contains the full spectrum of compounds found in the cannabis plant and now the general idea has always been that so long as the THC levels and this is in the UK it might be different from country to country but the general idea has always been the salon as the ETH let's see levels are under naught point two percent that it is legal and that that assumption comes from the the rules of the hemp production license so in order to grow hemp in the UK you have to have a license and one of the rules of that license is that the that in order for it to be deemed as hemp the the THC levels need to be under that that naught point two percent level however I've done it's been doing a tiny tiny little bit of research and one thing I came across was a Freedom of Information request from someone called em mr. Conway and he wrote to the Home Office asking them as far as the legality of getting a hemp license and then also the legality of the full-spectrum oils that contain trace amounts and we're talking trace amounts of THC their response is quite interesting and so this letter was this year 2018 and and I will be I'll read you a few sections of the response I can link into the full response letter for you guys if you want to read it in full but here are a few of the important facts now of course to start with they confirm that a CBD product in its pure form is not controlled under the misuse of drugs acts they confirm that and they go on however to say and this I'll read this to you up exactly however a CBD product which contains any trace of the psychoactive compounds are found in cannabis such as THC is considered to be a controlled substance under the 1971 act and therefore unlawful to possess and supply unless it fits the criteria of an exempt product now it goes on to also explain what the criterion exempt product would be and that would be a product that is sold as a medicine and obviously to sell it as a medicine it has to be licensed and there's actually only one product in the whole of the UK that is licensed as a medicine and that contains both THC and CBD and generally it's used for epilepsy and that sort of thing so does that mean that all of the full-spectrum products that I've been using are in fact illegal that that is the question here and and I'd like you guys to the picture I'm literally sat here with a full full spectrum and vape well right next to me am I breaking the law right here by using this and that's why I want you guys in the UK to chip in and any knowledge that you have as far as the legality if you if you know anyone the that can give some honest legal advice on this matter I'd be really interested to hear it I'm the Home Office seem to be really clear and that is there any trace amounts of TAC and a product is in fact illegal and pretty much every full-spectrum oil you will find I've got a full spec spectrum paste here will contain trace amounts of THC and they are trace amounts they can't get you high now I have always believed the line that if it's under naught point two percent is legal because that's they they're also the hemp production license but the home office are absolutely saying otherwise and the home office are absolutely saying that if you possess or distribute a full-spectrum product you're breaking the law I mean to me that is crazy absolutely stupid so there are alternatives the alternatives are to use an isolate product and I have here some CBD dabs from CB Life UK these are really good and these are CBD isolate which is like 99.5% pure CBD and the point five I believe might be something like CBD n or something like that so it is it doesn't contain any and banned substances whatsoever and and you can also get the pure I mean this is got I am terpenes in so you still get the benefit of the entourage effects you still get the kind of full spectrum benefits and you can then get pure isolate which is just a powder pure isolate you can you can use that again to dab or you can just eat it I've also checked a few of my other vape juices so I've got one here and which is CBD go which is really really good products I'm trying at the moment and from I can see this uses CBI select so zero THC you say yep zero percent THC so again a lot of products like this are okay and I've got some vague plots as well from the iced head shop and and and I'm not sure I'm gonna have a good look into these this just says um cannabidiol it doesn't say full spectrum so I'm guessing again that these kind of products use the M the isolate powders so we this really needs to be cleared up because I mean you can walk into these days almost any health food shop I mean Holland and Barrett is a fine example and you can find full spectrum oils so our whole in the Barrett breaking the law and distributing an illegal substance what they are according to the Home Office they absolutely are they categorically are breaking the law so why can big companies like Hollen Barrett get away with breaking the law but regular cannabis users can so it needs to the law needs to be straight it needs to make his mind up I mean I've made it quite clear over the past few months that I'm excuse me I'm very keen on seeing the legalization of cannabis I believe personally that although I'm not a I'm not a cannabis user myself I believe personally that I am cannabis in all its forms should be legalized I think that prohibition hasn't worked and it's very easy to get hold of cannabis I think most people could walk into a town they've never been before and they could pick up cannabis within an hour or two without any problem and people are using anyway whether it's legal or not so why don't we legalize it control it however to suggest the products with such trace amounts are in fact illegal is just I mean to me that's just stupidity and I genuinely don't understand why that's possible and if it is illegal why it's okay for some and okay for others the law needs to be the law you can't we can't have big corporations selling illegal substances but Joe Bloggs can so it doesn't fit it doesn't it doesn't sit well with me at all I'm not comfortable with this situation right now so I'm going to drop a comment in fact I can do it while we're live just in case because there are a few people watching to the home office response from the Freedom of Information request and if you guys want to check it out yourself you can see it just to see that what I'm saying is you know yet and it comes from the home office and so there we go I've just pops a quick comment in there on the side so check that out let me know what you think O'Hara I didn't try again I'll try to do that later I'm pop in the description so that's really right behind me if we can sort that out I'm gonna go in a minute anyway it'd been really too bright that whole time sunny day out there guys there's a few people watching and no comments to say hi at least so I feel like for a go I've had like a hello or just any kind of human interaction because I'm saying an office look my wall fell off but my plaster fell off the guys next door were throwing things at window to redecorate and the vibration destroyed a bit plaster tried to hide up some flowers and it's not really worked um hi I got high that's what we need I'm happy now look I just needed some kind of human interaction felt like I was talking to what I am talking to a screen just a bit weird and I would do a few updates have been doing some pretty cool stuff I've been trying some great products see buddy go I've still been trying their staff and there's a comic rice headshot that have sent me some really cool stuff there's so many flowers and and from these vape shops they sent me and yep hemp flowers so I am solid and some sort of got lots of dabbing products I know someone's got am a flower press or a heat extraction press that going to use for the the hemp flowers to press them and hopefully extract some really flavorsome CBD and and I'm gonna keep doing some research into the legality of the full-spectrum CBD products and also use it this is an opportunity to really look into the options for CBD isolate products so we can be sure those of us that want to and want to medicate with the benefits of CBD and want to stay legal we can be sure what we're getting so I'm going to really focus on pure CBD for a couple of videos so again if you're watching this and you know any producers of any of isolated CBD oil Xand things like that and send them my way please don't drop links in the comments I really don't like and too much turning into advert in the comments and but you can drop me a message hand me down on face book reason to find and and let me know so thank you for watching guys and I'll leave

"ew4MvHUA3FI": "[Music] [Music] hi friends trent the wizard with factory six today we're going to be talking about how to make a cbd tincture specifically the key components to an oil-based tincture now there's a lot of variety there's a lot of options that we're going to be going through it's really up to your personal preference your audience the demographic the people you're selling to as to what you pick and choose we're going to go through some of those options and really kind of help you out and guide you along the process so first thing is the ingredients and of course the most key ingredient is cbd and as you can see magically i've made some cbd appear because i am the wizard so again just to remind you all all of these here this crude oil this distillate this isolate all comes from this little special nugget here we've got another video we go into the different types of the full spectrum broad spectrum isolate what that all means so check that out but today we're really going to be focusing on how we're going to be using these as ingredients in a cbd and tincture so the first thing is this crude oil extract here as you can see is very rich it's got this nice super runny but it's a dark consistency as you can see because it's got all the plant fats it's got the chlorophyll still in there still under the 0.3 thc however it's the taste is going to be a little bit more earthy it's going to be have a little bit more of what we would call a bite to it on the profile of the flavor and then from there we're going to move up to distillate which is as you can see a beautiful honey color it really really plays nice inside of a cbd tincture and it's really delicious as you can see we've taken out the plant fats the chlorophyll that's what gives it this beautiful color and again this comes in either a full spectrum or a broad spectrum that you can put it in this is what we actually use for most of our tinctures because it's such a fantastic ingredient to work with it's easy to use the next thing we have is an isolate based again this is for more of your targeted type tincture for someone who's you know maybe worried about job loss or something like that maybe they're a first responder maybe they're you know um they work for the government or whatever your job may be this would be a fantastic option for that kind of demographic or audience if you're you know that's what you're selling to there's you know pros and cons to each again with the crude oil you're getting all those plant fats that's more of like an entourage effect with that crude when you move up to the distillate you can still get that entourage effect with the full spec or you can move up to a broad spec which again you're going to be losing out on some of the minor cannabinoids but you get a better flavor profile with a distillate as opposed to a crude and then of course the isolate it's odorless it's colorless so it's really really easy on the palette the next key component to our cbd tincture oil is going to be our carrier oil voila our carrier oils here so the reason we use a carrier oil is to help dilute the cbd make it a little bit more absorbable to the body one of our favorites that we like to use is mct oil it's odorless it's colorless it's tasteless so you can add flavors and other active ingredients and you can still kind of have those flavors come through without messing with it or you can also use something like hemp seed oil again you're going to have a little bit more of a flavor to play with with that ham see it's a little more earthy has a little bit more of a bite to it it's got some omegas but also a fantastic oil to use you can realistically use any ingestible oil like an olive oil even we've had some clients do that it really is up to the audience and the demographic that you're going to be selling to who you're really trying to target that you're you know which will guide your choice as to which carrier oil you really really want to use now the last thing that we're going to be talking about with our cbd tinctures going forward with our last key component is packaging we have our packaging here so one of the most important things we're going to be talking about is going to be the different components to the packaging itself we're going to start off with the glass the glass bottle itself the color now the color is important because it helps to protect from uv light that uv light will degrade your cbd tincture over time that's why you want a darker tint to your glass now it can be an amber color like this it can be a cobalt or a green or like this which is a painted almost black matte you could do all kinds of colors in this same thing though you could do a white you could do a blue a green lots of options lots of varieties again when it comes to that color of that glass now there's different options and styles as well as you can see these are very slight very small differences this is a european style round glass this is a boston style round glass very slight differences but again when you're looking at different types of packaging for your branding what have you that's important things to consider you also have different sizes you can see we have a two ounce here which is a 60 milliliter it's like more like a two month supply as opposed to a 30 milliliter one ounce which is like a one month supply so the other thing that we as you can see all of these are glass glass bottles we recommend glass we always recommend glass the main reason is oxygen barrier it really helps to prevent that degradation oxygenation will degrade your cbd tincture again so from the uv and the oxygen barrier that's why we always say go with glass now we're going to be talking about droppers the dropper is a really important component this is what you're going to be actually using to deliver this cbd into your mouth so there is a couple different types that we're going to be talking about this is a crc which is a child resistant cap as you can see there's a little contraption up here that helps prevent children from being able to take it off the top now it's plain and you didn't see any numbers on the side whereas this is a calibrated dropper that has numbers on the inside or the outside of the dropper that shows you how much you're actually taking so you're either taking a milliliter three quarters a half or two quarters up to you what you want to use with your own packaging you can even just get a simple non-crc non-calibrated dropper as well that's also available if that is the case this little safety shrink seal this is a requirement for all ingestible products you must have a safety seal and that's kind of where this crc prevents the children from getting in but this safety shrink seal is another component that you really want to be aware of the last component that we're going to be talking about with respect to our packaging is going to be our labeling it's really important that you get the labeling right for that reason i'm not going to go too much into it today we have a completely separate video all diving deep into those labels because there's qr codes there's compliance there's formatting there's all kinds of things you need to be aware of guys the last thing is let's chat i'm so excited to talk to you guys if you guys have questions comments below or if you got more specific questions on how to make a product go to our website there's a lot of free content there dye lines fact panels ingredient decks you name it so fill out that form ask those

I want to talk about the difference between CBD isolate and a full spectrum CBD oil CBD isolate is just that it's CBD by itself a full spectrum CBD oil like our product contains all of the naturally occurring cannabinoids and terpenoids II and create the entourage effect entourage effect is when all of the different cabins and terpenes work together to allow the plant to give the most benefit for more information visit us on our website at eco life supplements com", "358_hT33ZEc": "hi there and welcome to Green Valley nation my name is Jennifer Dixon and today I want to talk to you about the swiss relief 1000 milligram CBD isolate tincture but before we do make sure that you like and subscribe to this channel so what is the swiss really 1000 milligram CBD isolate tincture you ask well despite its name it's a US grown product that uses nanotechnology to encapsulate their CBD isolate thereby creating a more efficient or bioavailable CBD supplement for your use this u.s. grown product is actually proudly single sourced so on their website they use this word single cultivar and I was like what the heck is that basically what it means it's it's one a single strand of an industrial hemp plant the idea is if you use one particular type of industrial hemp it will help to standardize the results of each batch from crop to crop Swiss relief does use the nanotechnology which has been around since the middle part of the 1900s to help provide medicines into our system that we'll get through the digestive tract they've been using medicines with this nanotechnology for decades and it's still relatively new to the CBD supplement market but it's making great headway because it does provide a way for the CBD to get into your system a little bit more efficiently so that means you don't have to take as much of it to get the same benefits Swiss relief does carry a broad range of products from this team sure to capsules topicals things of that nature but today we are just going to talk about the 1,000 milligram CBD isolate tincture when you order your CBD from Swiss relief it's going to come in this in box there's one size 30 milliliter and they suggest a one milliliter dose this is the bottle that gives you about 30 servings if you do that one milliliter these are organic non-gmo and vegan friendly they are available inside the US and the most important thing is you can find a QR code here on the box and on the bottle I had to find it there for you to get a direct access to the COA the certificate of analysis there by even further I guess giving you the information to know that this product is exactly what it says to be on the front of the box and the front of the bottle let's spend one quick moment talking about the test results in VO labs in florida actually performs all the test results for the swiss relief product and you will find when you look at these test results that it comes in as NT non-traceable for things like pesticides residual solvents microbials that kind of helps to reinforce the fact that these are organic products that means that they don't put a lot of crap on the plants which could come into our system crap is my super scientific term for that by the way when you dive a little bit deeper into those COAS you're gonna find that in fact there's a little over a thousand milligrams of CBD in this product it is truly a CBD isolate product because it tests non-traceable loq a lower quantifications for THC and all the other terpenes and cannabinoids so if you're genuinely concerned about having the THC in your system this could be a really great product for you I bet you're curious to see what this looks like when you open the bottle you will see it comes in really dark it almost looks like a full-spectrum product when in fact it is a CBD isolate I don't usually take a full dropper of this product because I don't need it so I'm just gonna take about a quarter of a dropper you put it underneath your tongue and you wait about thirty since if you can wait up to two minutes it's even better but I have a really hard time doing that because the stuff doesn't taste great let's talk about your life supplementing with the swiss relief 1000 milligrams CBDT share so when you get this in the mail it'll come in this nice green box and on the front it's clearly labeled exactly how much CBD is in the bottle and you can find the QR code along the other side you can also find the ingredients in the suggested serving size and all that on the the box as well on the bottom of the box here on that back corner as well as on the bottom of the bottle you'll find a lot number and an expiration date the lot number is generally used for the COAS however in the case of Swiss relief they put all of their cos based on the product itself not the actual lot number so the very first time I took this product was at the end of the unusually chaotic day chaos is kind of like me and modified if you looked it up on the Urban Dictionary you'd probably see my face in it my life is always a thousand miles an hour so it was a particularly busy day and I tried some of the CBD I went ahead and took a little bit more than I normally do because it was an isolate I think it took like a half a dropper and within 20 minutes the chaos that is the squirrels inside my head were finally calm it was really great I was able to fall asleep my gosh I think it was in record timing my husband was making fun of me because he looked over and I was kind of like drooling and and completely out it's really really awesome so this product did work the thing I will warn you about is it's sort of woke me up as tired as I was getting because this does not taste good okay let me preface that with I do not love the earthy flavors commonly found in CBD tinctures my sister on the other hand loves it so if you love the earthy flavor you are going to love the swiss relief 1000 CBD tincture because it tastes like you are going out into the forest and eating pine needles i don't really care that it tastes that bad because it works really really well it helped me to relax and follows quickly but beware this definitely has a very strong earthy flavor I've continued to use this product for the last several weeks and every single time I come to the product it works I generally don't take more than a half a dropper because I don't need that much but every single time I take it it will help to reduce any pain that I'm having like a crick in my neck or in my low back I know a crick in my neck made me sound like my grandfather this stuff works every single time you take it whether you take it first thing in the morning to help reduce the pain that you might have right when you wake up or the last thing right before bed you're gonna find that you have reduction in pain and a reduction in stress anxiety you just kind of it kind of helps to melt all of that away but if I do take it in the middle of the day it doesn't make me sleepy I can take it in the middle of the day and I'm able to focus I'm able to not get distracted by the beeping phone and things like that so I can get a lot of stuff done as I supplement with the swiss relief 1000 milligram CBD by now you probably guess that I actually liked using the Swiss Relief 1000 milligram CBD tincture other than the fact that it tastes like Tinkerbell serve me dinner so it works and let me give you the three reasons why I think you should try it the first is it's a very very simple product all you have in this bottle is a CBD isolate and hemp seed oil the second reason why I think you should try this product is that it uses a advanced technology commonly found in really really really good pharmaceuticals it's the nanotechnology where they break up the CBD into tiny little particles that's like three zeros it's point zero zero zero that's how small it is and they envelop it into a lipid which helps to make it through your digestive tract faster which makes the CBD more bioavailable for your system so the biggest reasons you should try it is the fact that it's very simple and it has this advanced technology enabling your system to absorb more of it which leads to the third reason why you should try it the fact is is this stuff works if you can get over the flavor you will be pleasantly surprised with how well the Swiss relief 1000 milligram tincture actually works I only have two beefs about the Swiss Relief 1000 milligram tincture the first one is this stuff does not taste good it tastes very earthy very earthy and for a CBD isolate product I was actually shocked about how earthy this stuff tasted the other thing is because it uses that advanced nanotechnology you're going to end up paying two or maybe three times as much per milligram of CBD as you would a traditionally or conventionally manufactured CBD supplement so definitely keep that in mind it is earthy and it's a little bit more expensive however you get what you pay for this more expensive more advanced technology helps you to get more of the CBD into your system your digestive tract your digestive acids don't kill it before it gets to you right so you you do end up paying a little bit more for it but you might have to use less of it because more of it gets into your system one more thing you should keep in mind about the swiss relief 1,000 milligram CBD tincture is that it is an isolate since it is an isolate you don't get the full benefit of the industrial hemp plant when you get all the cannabinoids all the terpenes all of the whole plant working together oftentimes you'll find the entourage effect helps to magnify the overall benefit of the plant so keep that in mind if you are looking for a full spectrum product this would not be for you just to cover everything up really really quickly the swiss relief 1000 milligram CBD tincture is a CBD isolate that is grown and manufactured right here in the US you can get it here stateside it is organic non-gmo and vegan it comes in one size this 30 milliliter size and the suggested serving size is one milliliter because it is created with that nanotechnology it does cost a little bit more per milligram of CBD however it is much more effective in my opinion at creating the sense of ease and reducing the pain so it's worth the little bit of extra money in my opinion thank you so much for watching the review today again my name is Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation I hope you learned a little bit about this really cool nano emulsified CBD isolate product and I hope I encourage you to try it it does work and it is a very very very simple natural product so if you don't like the sugars and the other kind of artificial stuff found in products on the market these days this could be a really great product for you I'm curious have you tried it did you like it I'm also curious to know if you thought it tasted quite as strongly as I did it's it's definitely a acquired taste perhaps but it's effective so let me know drop some comments down below and don't forget that you should like and subscribe to the Green Valley Nation channel so you can stay up to

also quickly get into the reasons why I personally uses CBD and hemp oils to improve a various aspects of my life so let's get into it as many current subscribers are aware I'm heavily into different aspects of training weight lifting cardiovascular stuff and a little bit of martial arts as well so I'm a huge proponent of recovery and that is one of the main reasons I personally use the CBD and hemp oil product I've also covered sleep and the quality of sleep many times in previous videos and on lifehack or articles hemp oil and CBD products are a great way to naturally improve your sleep cycles and remain in a deep sleep state longer throughout the night so I'm big on that obviously I like to recover and the bulk of your recovery is done during your sleep time aside from this a huge aspect of recovery is anti-inflammation and CBD and hemp oil has huge anti-inflammation benefits as of late I've been using a CBD hemp oil product which is called calm and it's by Wellness Co it comes in different flavors the ones I've actually picked up our peppermint and strawberry lemon-aid but they have a full range of flavors that are available and you're welcome to check out the link in the description below I've also included a pretty hefty coupon code down there for you as well so you can get a pretty significant discount if you're interested in trying out have oils and CBD products for the various reasons I'm mentioning in this video a benefit that's important to note and something that many people have expressed interest in is reducing anxiety social anxiety and overall stress now this could be chronic stress or acute stress in response to acute stress the body's sympathetic nervous system is activated due to sudden influx and release of hormones after the threat is gone and after you've calmed down quite a bit it could take between 20 upwards to 60 minutes for the body to return to its pre arousal pre stressed levels this is basically called the fight-or-flight response it is also known as the acute stress response both of these forms of stress can affect the body in many different ways that are pretty detrimental to overall health so I'm big on improving the body's function and just optimizing your overall well-being aside from bringing down stress and anxiety levels hemp oils and CBD oils can also have major impacts on the brain function the brain and hands-on sufficient amount of cannabinoid production and the omega fatty acids especially omega 3 and 6 as well as lonoa acid are all responsible for producing cannabinoids Omega 3 especially is

David David is our cvd and expert and you can see that feel-good essential and CBD you're right here David can you just David is holding the camera is open here today can you tell us a little bit about what this bottle is why do we have two different colors I don't know if you can guys see at the bottom there's like a different residue versus the oil commodities amazing pump here doing okay firstly the dark oil on top that is CBD oil okay that's heaping you are extracted only olive oil nothing else see we need some olive oil just to confirm there's no solvents there's no one coordinate seal - no okay just CBD and olive CBD oil the plot material and olive oil at the bottom of the flask you see the light residue that is all the plant mixes the plant waxes that we don't need that just naturally sink to the bottom and we don't use those that we don't put those in the bottle there's nothing really very good in the plant waxes at all they're not harmful but it's just the natural waxes that exist in all the plants the flask has a special very accurate metered pump at the top you know you can pull that up and push it down with time it's just going to recirculate the oil all right so that's measures very very accurately the contents we use that to fill bottles that's engineer you guys are gone is yeah it's recirculating at the moment so that's a laboratory dispenser the measures oil every time you pull up up up and push it down again an exact amount so each both will get the same 10 milliliters each bottle get exactly the same 10 milliliters that's it that's all I can tell you really it's laboratory glass flask it's a SIMEX Pyrex glass well so everything gets sterilized every time when we make a batch of oil the pump get sterilized every time you make a batch of oil the residue at the bottom we put back in the composting it gets nothing gets thrown away that's useful that's it really amazing thank you so much for that so that's we're gonna try to bring those videos more that do if you had a question today vide for me anything about CBD that you'd like to know please leave us a message below it's a unique product a unique opportunity to get and try it so when it's here for you I hope you get to try it for those of you trying it I'm sure you're enjoying it already and thanks again thank you", "SGpOdFeZlgs": "[Music] and I want to talk to you today about the five pillars of full spectrum hemp oil so the five pillars of effective hemp products start with one being full spectrum oil to being sourcing three-bean extraction for beans stability and five bean bioavailability let's talk about the those five pillars in detail the first one is full spectrum oil what is full spectrum oil and what it is not so what full spectrum oil is is industrial hemp oil that has been refined purified without destroying the medicinal and help the cannabinoid flavonoids and terpene benefits of the oil what it is not is marijuana and it's not hemp seed oil is not pure CBD oil isolate distillate or synthetic let me talk to you a little bit about I get a lot of questions about what it means by pure CBD oil what pure CBD oil is is synthetics I slits or distillates that have been purified or extracted to the point that they have no other cannabinoids terpenes or flavonoids as part of those oils which make them not unlock the full potential of full spectrum hemp oil it's it's proven in in many studies and in in practical use today that an isolate or a distillate or a synthetic is not nearly as effective sometimes ten times less effective and it doesn't even work on all the same things that a full spectrum or oil works on so let's talk about what makes up a full spectrum oil full spectrum hemp oil has over eight essential fatty acids that's omega 3 6 9 they're the the fatty acid profile of a full spectrum oil affects brain development effects healthy skin it affects healthy hearts and joints these are all components of fatty acids and an isolate a distillate a synthetic has no none of those essential fatty acids that that complement each other to make it work in the way that a full spectrum oil works so those essential fatty acid components of the full spectrum oil become very important to the help health benefits of full spectrum oil the other part of the that what we know about full spectrum oils now and how it works on both the c1 and the c2 receptors in isolate a distillate a break out of one cannabinoid does not work on all the different components in the body the body the way the body works the way the body reacts and in the way that the hemp full-spectrum hemp oil works in the body is on the inner cannabinoid system the endo cannabinoid system was only discovered in the late 1990s and there's a lot that we don't know about it but what we do know about it now is our two predominant receptor sites and that is the c1 and the C to the C one receptor sites are the ones that work on both the the brain and the CNS system and that is why you get so many CNS effects with a full spectrum oil the CB 2 sites is are primarily in the immune system and in the Indian and that's why that that when when you get a full spectrum oil they're working on both those sites do you have multiple effects that's why the inner cannabinoid system can work on multiple different pathways in the body and the endocannabinoid system is very similar to a computer system in your car that helps regulate the whole entire body functions in different areas in the body if you just use one component like a part of the CBD or the full spectrum oil such as one cannabinoid you're not going to get the effects that you get like you get when you get a full spectrum well when you're hitting both the c1 and c2 receptor sites that's why a full spectrum oil is so important in a product and not something that has been taken apart and put back together that may look or claim to be a full spectrum but is not in its native state there is there's a reason why hemp was made and created if you if you if you choose to use those terms in the way that it does because it locks this fantastic and amazing benefits to the body through the inter cannabinoid system but you have to have all those components you have to have the cannabinoids the flavonoids the terpenes you have to be firing out they'll see one and they'll see two to create this but we call it in the in the industry and in medicine we call it the entourage effect without those all those components working together you have kind of like a band plane with one instrument you might have a drum in the background but it doesn't work the same as you do when you have a full spectrum oil the next important thing with with a full spectrum oil is the sourcing so let me talk to you a little bit about the definitions between industrial hemp and the other side of cannabis which is marijuana industrial hemp are cannabis sativa strains that have THC delta-9 less than 0.3% in the US this is a very strict and in a very exact definition the federal government has put on that if you're if you're industrial hemp in order to be categorized as industrial hemp you have to have THC levels below this at no time is an industrial hemp plant a marijuana plant hemp grows to be about 15 to 20 feet tall it looks like sugarcane when you walk out in the hemp fields it's mostly grown outdoors there's no psycho effective effect for an industrial hemp plant on the other hand you have marijuana which has grown mostly indoors most of them are three six feet tall their bushy they have lots of buds on them they've cultivated these things in in modern day to produce high amounts of THC the THC in a marijuana plant can be high as twenty or thirty percent whereas an industrial hemp plant it's below 0.3% there is no way the industrial hemp plant can get you high if with a product that is certified industrial hemp let me give you a little example that I always use and if you've been around farming you know this the difference between industrial hemp and marijuana seeds even though they're the same genus meaning they're both cannabis is the same is between feed corn and sweet corn sweet corn is what you put on your table it's what you buy in the grocery store to cook at barbecues feed corn is what they grow to feed to animals it's what these four corn sweeteners it's what they use for industrial purposes of of corn that is what that's the equivalent of what industrial hemp is industrial hemp is used for clothing rope textiles horse bedding lots of different building materials and the oil extract from that is what we use to make our full spectrum hemp oil products at no time can you take a piece of feed corn and even if it's young and it's just barely growing you can't pull that and barbeque it and make it taste good it has not grown that way it's not genetically made up to do that that's the same with industrial hemp industrial hemp seeds are grown for a very specific type of hemp and marijuana plants are grown for an entirely different different type of of cannabis and so the difference at no time in their growth are they ever the same as you can see that one of the things that we run into a lot in in in making these kinds of products is the actual certification paperwork what you're seeing here is the actual certified Kentucky hemp papers that the Department of Agriculture produces and certifies every grow that comes out of Kentucky one of the reasons we like hemp is because not only is it certified but you know as abroad in in as far as a state but every grow that goes out of these producers in Kentucky is certified they have to they have to go out and get them do the testing and they have if it's not at the at the at the level that it's supposed to be it's destroyed you get into some of these other states and other less aggressive agricultural programs they can't test their hemp they don't have enough people to go out and so what we get coming across the border from some of these states is industrial hemp that has THC levels that are way higher than the 0.3% we also find that the that the purity and the levels that they're getting how these girls are not overseen by Department of Agriculture that is so vigilant about making sure what we're getting is pure and it's what the label says it's going to be the next pillar that we have is is actually extracting there's lots of ways to get the industrial the the the oil of full-spectrum hand boil out of the plant you can take it you can chemically strip it out and and use toxic solvents to to to pull that oil out of the plant we don't like any of those sources right now because some of those residues some of those things coming out of those extractions those chemical extractions and stripping end up in the final product we don't like that we tend to go and what our standard is now is to use the gold standard of extraction which is supercritical co2 extraction in this way the the the hemp is put into to the co2 machines it's more expensive it takes a little longer but the output is is this pure hemp oil that we get out of those industrial hemp plants and that's what we want to put in our products so using supercritical co2 is the gold standard the other types of extractions that you'll get will lead to you can get eye slits and distillates out of these chemical stripping's but what you're getting is not the same as what you get out of a supercritical co2 extractor which we just love and the oil coming out there is just beautiful so let's talk about the next pillar in our full spectrum oil which is stability stability is a very critical factor in making full spectrum hemp oil products a lot of companies will come out and say hey we've got this bioavailable form we've got this liposome or this this Nano that is just the best thing ever but one of the things that no one talks about in these products is the stability one of the terms we use in the industry is called nutrient fallout it's a term used to describe whether an ingredient stays in its ideal bioavailable form or it falls out and lies at the bottom or the top of a solution liposomes are one of the things you see a lot out in the market I come from the pharmaceutical in the in the biotech industry liposomes failed in the pharmaceutical industry over 15 years ago because of one key factor they are not stable in fact if you get a liposome over 80 degrees fahrenheit the thing falls apart so when these things are being shipped across the country I don't care where they're being shipped to but in some post office in some truck especially in the summer they're all gonna give above 80 degrees so nutrient Fallout you want to avoid and you want to avoid stability issues our full spectrum oil is stable in both hot and cold conditions it's not affected by the change in the temperatures it's not affected by the the charge in the waters it's not affected by the stomach acid and it has extremely long stability over two years is what we've looked at and it's completely stable you can see by this slide illustration looking at our electron microscope how uniform and tight these might these these these tiny water cells are that we put the product into that means that that it is small and tight there are about 22 nanometers which means that those cells will stay very tight and very stable for a long amount of time and yet when they get into the body they can go to their cells and they can go do what they need to do which is you want in a full spectrum oil and in a bioavailable product let's talk about the fifth and final pillar of full-spectrum oil which is bioavailability I've saved the best for last the Achilles heel of full-spectrum hemp oil and hemp oil in general is bioavailability bioavailability of native full spectrum hemp oil is only 6% and the onset of action is is between 60 and 90 minutes that's the equivalent of going to a gas station and taking your nice car and going to the pump and pulling out premium gas and and pouring it all over the pavement until 94% of that is on the ground and you put that in and put the last six percent in your tank no one's gonna do that no one's gonna go take your minivan your Ferrari your SUV whatever you drive and pour out almost all the gas onto the under the pavement and yet we do that every day when we take oils in nutrients into our body that are not absorbed a lot of companies will go out there and say hey we've got bioavailability data and they'll show you some obscure trial that was done on animal tissue layers or on on some kind of in vitro test some kind of cell test what I say to you is show me the data we've done two human studies and one animal study to look at bioavailability the most important of that is the human studies in our animal models we showed that you can get 85% absorption through the intestinal tract meaning that 85% of the of the nutrient passes through the intestinal tract into the into the into the body but absorption is not bioavailability absorption is just one component of that it's an important component but it doesn't tell the whole story the most important story is the bioavailability data which means how much of it is going into your bloodstream and actually going to the the cells into the end places where they go if you're triggering they'll c1 and c2 receptor sites you're gonna need to get into the bloodstream and you're gonna have to do it fast and get out there so let's look at the actual data from the human bioavailability sites that we've done and this was repeated twice so that we made sure we knew what was actually going on in the body so if you look at this data you'll notice a couple things really fast one is that the peak effect happens within 30 minutes but at 15 minutes over half of the full spectrum oil is RT in your bloodstream and when people take this within 10 to 15 minutes they start to feel in effect the second part of this is that within 30 minutes almost all of the full spectrum oil is in the bloodstream and going to the different areas in your body compare that to the regular standard full spectrum oil it's so much lower and takes so much longer that people have to take extremely high doses and wait a long time for it to fill effect the other thing too is the duration of action the duration of action you can see on this slide is that it's about 12 hours you're getting that full spectrum effect in the body so we tell people that if you're taking this for cute conditions you can take it and fill effect within 15 minutes 10-15 minutes you're gonna start to feel something a lot of people feel it within five minutes the second part is that you're going to get the full effect and it's going to last in there for a long time and you have to take a much lower dose of that any time you can take lower amounts and get a higher effect is better there's no need to go back to my illustration of the gas pot there's no reason to take ninety four percent of something and have it just go out the body and just use the last six percent the better thing is to use almost all of what you're taking and that's what we do with this full spectrum hemp oil with our tech technology is you get a high amount of it very quickly and it stays in your body for a long time in summary these five pillars make up the industry leader in full spectrum hemp oil some companies may have one pillar some companies may have two pillars some companies may have three pillars but only cue science is going to deliver these five pillars in their full spectrum hemp oil products and these products will make a huge difference in people's lives we've seen it over and over and at the end of the day if we can help people and we can help ourselves and be better and healthier that is what it's all about and these this technology and these full-spectrum hemp oils these full-spectrum in foil products will deliver it in a way that no others can do that you", "qtCVXT9vI5c": "in 2018 it became legal again to commercially produce hemp within the united states which is great because the tax act of 1937 and the controlled substance act of 1980 are complete utter jokes don't get me started this history teacher on a tangent of why those are so terrible but the good news is we have two ingredients that have become pretty popular in the beard game especially within the last two years and that would be cbd oil and hemp seed oil but there's a lot of confusion out there there's a lot of mismarketing as i would call it with these two products and these two ingredients and i'm gonna break down the differences between these two different ingredients for you guys today the main thing is the source how it's produced the benefits all of those things and i will cover all of them my name guys is dnc bearded welcome to the channel if you are new here and you like beards even if you're not you just want to check out these ingredients welcome as well and a huge thank you to everyone that is coming back the subscribers the people that are viewing you are appreciated if you like this content consider subscribing it does make a difference for the channel my life and my passion so thank you guys one more time i hope you enjoy this content let's start off by establishing some vocabulary and i'm going to be very specific here we're going to talk about hemp and marijuana they are both varieties of the same species hemp is going to equal less than 0.3 percent thc and marijuana is going to be 0.3 thc or more now they both have different growing and cultivating methods of that same plant species hemp is usually grown outside it can be bigger it doesn't have a ton of control as compared to marijuana which is often grown commercially inside it's very controlled and usually has smaller plants that is the first major difference we've seen between these two different ingredients okay let's talk about where these two ingredients come from and how we actually get them so we established we have the hemp plant which is less than point three percent thc and we have the marijuana plant which is point three percent thc or more usually much more we're getting up to upwards of like 30 percent thc possible well as of 2018 because of the farm bill in the united states it again is illegal to produce hemp but it is not federally legal to produce cbd oil or hemp seed oil from marijuana so we're going to disregard this plant over here and we're going to talk about the hemp plant producing these ones the first one is pretty simple as the name says hemp seed oil comes from the seeds of that hemp plant essentially they take those seeds and they use the cold press method all that means is they squeeze the seed until oil comes out and in that oil there is very little to no thc and we'll come back to that a little bit later in this episode but we now need to look at the cbd ingredient now this primarily comes from the leaves and the flowers of the hemp plant there's also the stalk and a couple of other aspects but primarily we are looking at the leaves and the flowers now how do you get this ingredient now it's a little bit more intense and it is called the carbon dioxide extraction method there's a little bit more to that but essentially they are removing that ingredient now here's the interesting thing cbd is cbd it is the same whether it comes from the hemp plant or it comes from the marijuana plant but in the u.s federally legal only from that hemp plant but we're taking that plant we have two different areas the seeds as compared to the flowers and the leaves for this next part let's cover the question a lot of you are thinking a lot of you have asked or you have looked up and let's again let's establish some vocabulary here thc essentially that is the part of the marijuana or cannabis plant that will get people high now hemp seed oil is very simple there is zero thc in hemp seed oil none easy goes cbd is a little bit more difficult because we have different types of cbd but for this video let's go over the full spectrum cbd that's going to give you all of the benefits and within that it is legally allowed to have up to 0.3 of that thc level now will that get you high no it would take you to consume to drink about 600 bottles of beard oil that have cbd oil in it even full spectrum in one night to fail a drug test or to get high now to feel that you are probably gonna feel some other things with drinking 600 bottles of beard oil before you felt any of those thc impacts on there so no with if you are using cbd in beard products you are not going to fail a drug test you are not going to get high do not drink it do not try to have any result of getting high from these products it is not going to do that with that legal limit of 0.3 cbd with thc next let's compare the different properties and benefits between these two ingredients and to begin the cbd oil is going to be much more expensive than hemp seed oil and you want to make sure you are finding somewhere that has a coa a certificate of analysis because it is important to get these things checked out by a lab do not go on google do not go on amazon to try and find cbd oil chances are you're gonna find it on amazon but if you really look into the fine print and the fine details they're just selling you hemp seed oil now what do these do they actually do pretty much the same thing but cbd oil is just better at it and don't get me wrong hemp seed oil is one of my absolute favorite carriers but everything it does cbd oil also does just at a higher level now the one that is the most common benefit between the two of them when it comes to hair and skin and again that is important if you guys look up the benefits of cbd oil or hemp seed oil online you're likely going to find a lot information about diet and we're not covering that here we are covering how does it help your beard hairs in the skin underneath it and the number one way is they are both great anti-inflammatory ingredients essentially what happens is your skin where it meets the hair is going to swell up for many different things like stress poor diets poor grooming habits just being a man being out in the sun just living life is going to get that skin where it meets the hair it's going to swell up and what happens is it does not allow blood to flow to that source and we know blood flow is important for the growth and health of your hair i've talked about this on many times on live streams we launched the cbd product on youtube which youtube actually took the stream down which was kind of crazy if you guys were there but i've gone over this but just to reiterate that anti-inflammation is really really important hemp seed oil is great at it cbd oil is phenomenal at it right hemp seed oil is an all-star well cbd oil is in the hall of fame one of the greatest pros of all time which is interesting when you look at them but the price also matches when it comes to those two different things so know where you're getting this stuff if you have it if a company is using cbd oil they likely have one of those coas i know plenty of beard companies that are happy to give that to you because they need it to get banking and to get funding and to sell it it is something that is kind of gray area in the us it can be done it is legal but a lot of places and banks in particular kind of like i don't really want to address this because it's just been within the last two years where it has been legal places like canada and europe have been doing it for a very long time and have been really boasting about the properties of both of these ingredients the us we just had some terrible legislation in our history that set us back but we're here now all right i'm gonna come back to you guys in two seconds with a conclusion wrap up all these thoughts and challenge you guys to leave a comment or question down below i believe i've covered everything in this video that i had planned on i wanted to make something that was kind of quick easy to deliver to you guys and to digest because this is a topic that you can dive much deeper into you can get far more scientific than i did today and i'm open to that if that's something that you guys would want in the future let me know in the comments but oftentimes those videos do not do as well so that tells me that you prefer this style but again i'm here to help you guys and give you the information that you are wanting so let me know if this fits your needs or do you want me to go deeper on this so we talked about where they come from we talked about the differences maybe some misconceptions in there and just overall information about hemp seed oil as compared to cbd oil so to leave you guys with two things please help me out here first thing is have you ever had experience with hemp seed oil or cbd oil what are your thoughts did you notice any differences any benefits nothing at all maybe you had some adverse reactions bring that to us in the comments down below and then do you have any questions was there something you were wondering about these ingredients that i did not get to i would be happy to give you guys the answer if i know it or try to find it if i do not or point you in the right direction to somebody that may know the answer so thank you guys for watching i love these kinds of videos a lot of you like to call me the trusted teacher for all things beard related and hopefully i'm living up to that name with videos just like this dancy bearded i hope that you guys stay bearded and stay positive so you", "OQ3miEg3QG0": "this video takes a look at liposomal CBD and nano emulsified CBD why it matters to you and which is best absorbed by your body after watching you'll have a better understanding of what liposomal CBD and nano emulsified CBD are this knowledge will help you in your purchasing decision the weird liposomal comes from two greek words lipo's which means fat and soma which means body a liposome has a fatty tail that helps the body absorb the nutrient composition pharmaceutical or in this case CBD scientists and doctors recognize liposomes is a potent means of delivering nutrients while liposomal CBD oil is an effective means of absorbing CBD there are other options nano emulsified CBD offers greater absorption than liposomal CBD nato emulsified CBD is made up of molecules that are smaller than those found at liposomal CBD nato emulsification is a process where the molecules of CBD are spun into tiny particles that pass easily through our body cell walls the particles nutrients vitamins or in this case CBD are so small yet collectively they have a greater surface area allowing maximum absorption and efficacy into the body when used as a method for delivering supplements nano emulsified substances are absorbed at higher rates in the body that other methods of delivery particle size is an important consideration when purchasing CBD oil the average size of a nano emulsify droplet of oil is 25 nanometers in comparison liposomal CBD is measured between 100 to 5,000 nanometers it's a really big or rather small difference because of this small size there is a much larger surface area of the CBD itself that is able to enter the bloodstream and the body absorbs CBD more efficiently what are the practical differences to you we recommend nano emulsified CBD oil why greater absorption means you need to use less making your bottle last longer you get more value in purchasing natal emulsified CBD because more of the CBD will be absorbed into your body so you don't have to use as much taking 3 milligrams of liposomal CBD is not the same as taking 3 milligrams of nano emulsified CBD thus you'll have to take more liposomal CBD to get the Effects of nano emulsified CBD consistency is key even dose with every serving your CBD oil should be stable and even throughout nano emulsified CBD stays in solution evenly while liposomal CBD may produce an uneven mixture resulting in some doses having more CBD than others while liposomes are beneficial nano emulsified CBD offers greater absorption making it the best choice for most people now you know the difference visit him pure CBD com", "1mnSg9Kh8us": "In today's video I'll share with you 19\namazing ways CBD oil, nature's arthritis, anxiety, pain management and cancer\ntreatment benefits your dog. Cannabidiol, CBD is one of the most\nremarkable compounds in nature. CBD oil has proven very effective for joint pain\nand inflammation. Increasingly, clinical studies have demonstrated CBDs abilities\nto halt cancer cell growth and shrink tumors. There are 60 compounds specific\nto the cannabis plant called cannabinoids and CBD is one of them,\nwhich holds the key to a variety of medicinal and therapeutic effects that\ncannabis offers. CBD oil is extracted from the stalk,\nleaves and flowers of the cannabis plant and contains hundreds of natural\nbotanicals in concentrated form. Just as in humans a dog's body houses an\nendocannabinoid system as part of its immune system which runs throughout the\nbody, and this system is filled with receptors that bind to the cannabinoids\nin the CBD you give to your dog, and this stimulates all kinds of changes in the\nbody which are beneficial. CBD is not psychoactive, the psychoactive effect of\nthe drug cannabis comes from THC only so basically CBD won't get you dog high,\nsimply relaxed with zero psychoactive effects. And more scientific research is\nbeing conducted on the therapeutic effects of CBD than ever before as new\nand exciting evidence uncovers major medical benefits. And with this in mind\nlet's look at 19 different ways CBD oil benefits your dog. CBD provides fast\nresults, usually signs of improvement begin within days. CBD reduces stress,\nseparation anxiety and nervousness to allow your dog to be more calm and\nrelaxed. CBD reduces the effects of arthritis quickly and increases mobility.\nCBD hydrates your dog's skin. CBD reduces inflammation and alleviates joint pain\nand studies have proven CBD is highly effective at\ncanine seizures. CBD Boost's your dog's immune system to provide optimum\nprotection. CBD reduces skin irritation and itching. CBD restore shine and\nsoftness to a dog's coat. CBD improves a dog's appetite. CBD improves alertness\nand mental clarity in dogs, it improves your dog's gastrointestinal\nhealth, and it's important for effective canine cancer pain management. CBD aids\nin post-surgery recovery and it also improves comfort and pain relief for the\nlast days of life, it's also really good as a cortisone replacement. It aids in\nweight loss. CBD aids in thunderstorm and firework phobias and CBD has no known\nside-effects. I've researched these benefits myself\nover the years directly from thousands of dog owners, so I can confirm that\nthese 19 benefits are real, effective and working right now to heal canine\nailments and assist dogs all over the world. Many dog owners report that within\ndays their arthritic, limping or in pain dog is greatly improved with\nfreedom of movement a much reduced pain. There are also lots of reports of\nrenewed energy, alertness and playfulness especially in senior dogs with reduced\nanxiety, more calmness, appetite and reduced use of vet prescribed drugs and\ntheir side effects. You may even notice that once your dog is experiencing the\nbenefits, they'll happily encourage you for more. As a side note, one owner\nrelated how her dog had never let her near the dog's mouth,\nso CBD was added to the dog's food. Well the following day while the owner was\nsat in her armchair, the dog came up to her, place her head on her lap and was\neager for her to administer drops directly into her mouth.\nCBD comes in different amounts per bottle and depends on the strength\nneeded. For dogs you want it in the 350 to 500 milligram range per bottle.\nHigh-quality organic CBD oil is not cheap because extracting CBD from hemp\nrequires a lot of plant material and careful monitoring of the growing\nenvironment. I only recommend an organic product as hemp is known as a hyper\naccumulator, meaning it absorbs contaminant\nfrom the ground it grows in and will pick up heavy metal toxicity\nunless it's organically grown. CBD oil must come in a glass dropper bottle, not\nplastic and be organic. CBD is dispensed into your dog's food or can be given\ndirectly by mouth under the tongue. I recommend giving under your dog's tongue\nif that's possible as it's more effective by this method, simply because\nit gets directly into your dog's bloodstream rather than eaten with food,\nwhich means your dog's liver will filter out some of its effectiveness. It's\nimportant to note that prices range wildly from $20 to $65 plus for a 250 to\n500 milligram one ounce bottle full plant organic extraction. This gives you\n8.3 milligrams of actual CBD, enough to be effective with dogs for the\nbenefits I discussed. Another important thing to note is that I've been working\nwith CBD oil for 15 years and it's only recently that CBD products have taken\noff and for good reason. However the information on CBD oil can be confusing\nas large online retailers like Amazon are not allowing product manufactures to\nmention CBD in their advertising and so confusion arises about whether any given\nproduct is true CBD oil or just made using the hemp seeds, not the whole plant\nextract. So I'll link to a product in the description below\nthat's genuine CBD oil, it's organically grown in Colorado USA and has been\nextracted using co2 full plant extraction and contains all the\nbeneficial terpenoids, flavonoids, essential oils, vitamins A and D, trace\nminerals, phytochemicals and omega-6 and three oils for dogs and cats. And for\nchronic health conditions like phobias and fearfulness, you can give half the\nstate to dosage and this will mean cost savings while still getting effective\nresults. My recommendation is to start with half the stated dosage, observe the\neffects for five days and work up to a full stated dosage if you don't see\nnoticeable effects for the condition intended. If your dog has major health\nissues like cancer, try working up to a double dose, as every dog, just like\npeople have their optimal dose, and there are no side\neffects other than a potential to sleep more soundly during the day. If your\ndog suffers arthritic conditions and especially if they're on vet\nprescribed medications for the condition don't even second-guess this natural\nalternative, get a bottle, stop the meds and treat with CBD and you'll be amazed\nat its effectiveness, without the side effects and the expense of veterinary\ndrugs. Raise the dose if you need to, it's safe and to find an effective level for\nlonger term use and the side benefits and numerous has discussed. Also if your\ndog has arthritic movement issues, an excellent complimentary dog supplement\nto feed alongside the CBD is bacon flavored soft chews, they contain many\nnatural ingredients including the CBD to aid pain free movement with universally\nexcellent feedback. They're also USA made with a hundred percent money-back\nguarantee with excellent customer service, again I'll leave a link to these\nin the description below.

here with living with cbs.com and this is my fifth video about the ananda hemp products and if you guys remember in my last video they sent me some free samples okay along with a handwritten card which is somewhere near here anyways so this video is pertaining to my last pill with the spectrum gels okay as you guys know I love my hot chocolate right before I go to sleep it helps me sleep for me I feel like it helps me sleep I know for a fact that milk increases your melatonin levels before bed so having hot chocolate warm milk you guys all know about the home remedy of warm milk it's an old past time home remedy to help you soothe yourself soothe yourself to sleep so hot chocolate my last pill of my spectrum gel I gotta say guys I've not stopped taking my name to hemp drops and one thing that I've noticed adding this after about the second or the third day my sleep I felt like my sleep was more sound and I woke up more rejuvenated now I know this already helps me sleep I've made videos about this already but I don't know if there's different kinds of cannaboids and this as opposed to this it's all legal okay it's all 100% legal in all 50 states because there's no THC in it so there's no psychedelic side effects relating to the THC component in cannabis there's only the CBD benefits so look non psychoactive I know that the words or backwards is because I'm using the flip side of my camera but it's non psychoactive so with it helping me sleep I felt I feel like it's helped relax me throughout the day basically be more calm not be as quick to anger that's one thing that I know that I struggle with and something that I have been praying to God about try to work on is my quickness to anger and I'll be honest guys having these two products together like I felt like this helped but I've only been on this stuff for ten days and after about day three I just felt more relaxed throughout the day I just felt calmer less stressed and just felt better about life I guess that's that's literally the only way I can put it like having this and this I just I feel good guys I feel a lot better it helps reduce the frequency of my symptoms relating to my Crohn's disease and my cyclic vomiting syndrome and one of the things that really bothered me was you know battling these symptoms has made me kind of an angry person I felt like it's kind of changed me you know I'm not as relaxed anymore and it's I I know it's related to the additional stressors that have you know entered my life since being diagnosed and these symptoms entering my life so I know that's changed me a little bit because of that you know it's in the back of my mind you know a lot of the stress and then that can change people just in itself just stress not dealing with any physical rehabilitation but yeah guys I like this stuff I really do so I'll leave a link in the description below for their website and I highly recommend it at least at least at least try it out give it a month and let me know

[Music]", "zXckKimT8MU": "[Music] hey everyone this is the infirm made by hemp and today I'm holding in my hands two separate CBD products they look extremely similar and you can buy them both on Amazon for around the same price however there is one huge difference between these two one of these is not what they say they are with being the one stop shop for any sort of online shopping Amazon is one of the places where you can find many quote unquote CBD products there's only one problem many of these products are not what they say they are if you go on Amazon right now and search CBD products what you'll find are over 4,000 results all of these products don't have CBD in the actual name though they all have hemp oil the main reason why companies do this is that CBD is actually not allowed to be sold on Amazon at all according to their own list of restricted products amazon states that neither CBD or hemp oil rich and CBD are allowed to be sold on their site even though that CBD is now federally legal thanks to the 2018 farm bill amazon does have their own right to prohibit the sale of any products that they want on their web site which does include CBD so with none of these CBD products supposedly having any CBD in them we wanted to see what was actually in the products themselves we went out and bought three of the better reviewed CBD products on amazon ourselves not to take them ourselves but to ship them off to a third-party lab to get them tested this would allow us to see exactly what was in each product first off was the hemp works tincture which overall has really been reviewed quite well so what did the results say instead of having p1000 milligrams of CBD as stated on the tincture itself the test results show that there is only eight point seven milligrams in the entire bottle we were able to reach this final number because the product is in a one ounce bottle with a total liquid inside weighing 29 grams so if we multiply 29 by 0.3 we get the total CBD in the product itself so obviously this product didn't have anywhere near the amount of CBD that was on the Amazon store page itself the next product that we sent in to be tested was the elite hemp gummies which has been reviewed positively by around 600 people so what did the lab result say about the elite hemp gummies according to the lab results there are only 0.3 milligrams of CBD per gummy which is a lot lower than the advertised 30 milligrams found in each coming with the lab tests showing us that there is only 0.1 milligrams of CBD per gram and with each gummy wing 3.0 5 grams we multiplied point 1 by 3.0 5 to get the result going into the third and final product that we got from Amazon we were really expecting there to be a huge disparity between the advertised amount of CBD and the actual CBD content just like the previous two products however this product actually really surprised us with having more than the advertised amount of CBD found in it even with this being a huge change of pace for our entire investigation there were still some things about this product that made us feel very uneasy as we were doing our initial research on this brand we couldn't find a single website or social media account associated to it at first you might not think that this matters but when it comes to only being able to reach a CBD company through Amazon itself and having no other names or addresses associated to it it seems less and less legitimate even with the great results that we got back from this product unfortunately big CBD products are not only an issue on Amazon but everywhere else as well well you can do to make sure that you are never scammed is to make sure that the CBD company in question actually has their test results posted on their website this will help you a lot in knowing what you are actually buying if you would like to learn more about the difference between hemp oil and CBD please make sure to visit our website at made by

our hip store I'm super pumped because it is not only is it a Chattanooga company but it is also owned and run by one of my old old friends and so I'm so so pumped to be able to help him start spreading the news about the benefits of CBD and helping to carry his products it is called Bodhi life it is a full spectrum CBD they currently have two items that that they carry and we're going to have them both in studio this product is their tincture it's an unflavored tincture it is actually processed right here in Chattanooga - so that's really cool it's not just a chatting to own company it's a process right here in Chattanooga company and they use a what's called cryo ethanol processing to get it out so it's a it's a very efficient and it's it's kind of taking the best of the both worlds with an alcohol extraction keeping it very pure and it's a full spectrum oil so that means you're getting the entire plant so you get the CBDs the cbn tea a little bit the legal limit of the THC and it's in a carrier oil and MCT carrier oil it comes in a package that looks like this someone put it really close oh my gosh that's gonna be backwards for you guys because I had the camera showing to me so that might not be that awesome okay so I'm gonna have to pretend that you can read this backwards and so it comes in a little package it's got 250 that means if you take a full dropper full it's about 17 milligrams of CBD which is is a pretty good sized dose especially if you're starting out this is 15 ml so there's actually 15 dropper full so if you take one drop a day it'll last show that over two weeks if it's or if you take two dropper tools a day it will last you you know right there about a week it just depends how often you take it and how much you need to take is really really depends on your own personal have what your personal needs are to say the least okay so it comes in a box like this you'd have to open it up today the serving size they do suggest in one full dropper but if you're new to it you can start out with half a lesser quantity of it for each dropper fool I know me personally I usually take between seven and ten milligrams at a time I'm kind of a lightweight my husband on the other hand he he needs a little bit more like 33 or so each time he takes it so this one full dropper would be 17 milligrams and this is what it looks like it's a like kind of dark brown opaque bottle and then when you open it you'll see the little dropper and if you look at the limit get out if you look there's little delineations that says 1 ml and then point seven five point five one point two five and so that's a really great way for you to judge how much you're getting and so again if you take the full dropper full you're gonna get that 17 milligrams right now when I just did it I did one I squeezed the bottle to bring it in and it brought up about 0.75 milliliters hey guys thanks for watching so um it's a great way to be able to tell if I'm taking 0.75 you can kind of do the math one one milliliter is 17 so if you're taking about three-quarters of that you're gonna get what is that like 14 my math right oh my gosh math in my head that's so scary so I love how the the thing has how much are taking 0.25 point five because you can eyeball it and be like I think I took a half of it on this way you kind of know you're taking more like three-quarters of a full dropper and that was when I did just one squirt I guess I squeezed the lid a little bit and then pulled it out this time when I did a brought out the full one milliliter so you know one milliliter is 17 milligrams with this particular brand it tastes really mild especially compared to we have another alcohol extractive company here in the studio that takes a lot more like alcohol this one doesn't taste nearly as strong of the alcohol it tastes a lot more mild you still taste a little bit I think the the going the going saying is earthy if you're not taking a big taking it because it tastes good you're taking it because it's gonna help you to relax it's gonna help you to sleep it's gonna help you to experience all the benefits of CBD like pain relief and things like that so again make sure you stop by and try some of this we do have some samples here at the desk so ask for samples and I'll do another video here probably in a few days and talk about they also have a vape cartridge which is pretty cool too I can't wait to see it thanks for stopping by and don't forget we have some great stuff going on this weekend we have the free yoga

series on the science of clean and safe cannabis today's cannabinoid profile is on cannabidiol [Music] cannabidiol or cbd for short is the second most prominent compound found in the cannabis plant a lot of the medical benefits of cannabis that are attributed to thc or other cannabinoids are actually due to the cbd content of the cannabis it has very strong anti-inflammatory properties and not only does it help suppress inflammation but there was a study that showed that it also helps the body to not make the chemical that causes inflammation so it actually has somewhat of a preventive role cannabidiol has also been found to have anti-convulsant properties in that it can reduce the seizure threshold for a number of patients i've had my own patients who have said that once they started using cbd-rich strains they have found that they have had less episodes of their seizures cbd is synthesizing the plant through the same pathways as thc cbc it starts out as german neopyrophosphate and alatolic acid those two compounds join together through an enzyme catalyzed reaction canogiborelic acid cbga is the starting material for cbda thca and cbca so cbda synthase if it's found in large enough amounts will take this canon gibberellic acid and make it into cannabidiol carboxylic acid which is cbda cbda is cbd with a carboxylic acid attached to it now with heat or through time this carboxylic acid will naturally release from the compound as it is very unstable and become cbd this process right here where we lose this carboxylic acid happens at about 80 degrees celsius a number of studies were done where they actually gave patients an overdose of thc to see what would happen when they then added cbd and cbd completely turned around the negative effects of an overdose of thc without changing the levels of thc in the blood so that means that cbd exerts its own medicinal just doesn't reverse thc it actually has its own medicinal properties cbd has been found to cause cancer cells to what we call commit suicide while preserving the normal cells and what appears to happen is it appears to bind to the receptors on the cancer cells which then induce the cancer cell to kill itself cannabidiol has also been found to be what we call biphasic in terms of sleep so at low doses it's what we call alerting it kind of keeps you awake at higher doses it can be very sedating and cause you to sleep but what's nice about that is you can control whether or not you are alert or you're feeling tired when i started testing cannabis about two or three years ago we saw virtually no high cbd plants almost every plant we tested was high in thc anywhere from 10 to 20 percent thc with some outliers on either end some plants would have maybe one percent cbd at the max one and a half percent cbd at the max now that we've been testing for a while we see anywhere from eight to fifteen percent cbd and maybe five or six percent thc will be strained some strains we get a 50 50 ratio it can happen in in all different ratios but what it is it's a recessive gene in plants so we have breeders have to actively go and try and breed this back into these plants and find these high thc plants that might have that high cbd gene locked away and and breed them together and see what they find and really the only way you can know if it's high cbda is testing with testing and and growers or breeders having access to that knowledge base we see them coming back and reversing some of the trends of the last 30 40 50 years and breeding the cbd back into the plants now there have been a number of studies that have looked at cannabidiol cbd exerting a protective property to damage neurons and it appears that in the studies cbd protects the nerves by inhibiting the process by which nerves are damaged cbd has also been shown to protect against a brain injury when patients or lab animals have had a brain injury cbd appears to protect the brain from damage that occurred to the nerve cells the studies have shown that it can actually fight mrsa which is methicillin-resistant staph aureus a notorious bug that is resistant to a number of antibiotics a topical application of cannabis was able to fight the infection and the mrsa was eradicated from that infection site sc labs tests for cbd with a high performance liquid chromatograph also known as an hplc there's two different ways you can test for cannabinoids it's either with an hplc or with a gc if you hear someone testing with other methods it's probably not a scientifically validated method but with the problem with the gc is is that the gc uses heat to test for these these cannabinoids and as i said earlier all the acidic cannabinoids are very sensitive to heat so the gc can give you no information about the acidic cannabinoids it can only tell you about the non-acidic cannabinoids the heat is decomposing these compounds it's definitely decarboxylating all of them and you're trying to measure it as these compounds are in a state of flux and that's just it it's kind of fuzzy so we use the hplc because it keeps the cannabinoids in their natural state they're in their liquid state there's no alteration there's no heat or anything like that happening and so we get a much more accurate and a much more realistic picture of what's actually in the sample that we're testing one of the important things for people to understand about cannabidiol is it is not psychoactive that means it does not change your mood your mentation the way that thc has psychoactive properties and can actually cause what we call the high cbd does not do that for patients who are not interested in the thc effect but are interested in the cbd effect this is a terrific choice for them to have", "pvYeFk2BY5g": "hello my name is john botting welcome along to this presentation today i'm going to be talking to you about the 500 milligram natural cbd product from hb naturals i'm not sure how much you know about cbd oil but it's very very important that you are able to prove that the amount of cbd in the products you're buying what is actually in the product you're buying and whether there's any certification or anything else like that to go with the product you're buying so we can all go off um and we can buy cbd online are you absolutely 100 sure you know what you are getting when you buy that product even when you buy go into a shop and you buy the product through a retail unit there's no guarantee that you're actually getting what you think you're getting and speaking as somebody who is from the uk only last week there was an article um on our national news talking about cbd products and about a very well-known national retailer in this country and how some of the cbd product they are selling is not actually what people think they're getting the amount of cbd content in the product is not what they think they're getting and so it is vital that whoever you're buying it for from is able to prove to you that you are getting the full cbd you think you are getting and i will show you that in a brief second about how we prove that we are giving you what we say we are on the label and that is in that bottle you are getting 500 milligrams of cbd product okay so our cbd is grown in kentucky in the usa it is um naturally rich in turbines omega-3 six and nine essential fatty oils okay um the retail price is 59.95 us dollars and if you're in the uk that will equate to around about 49 pounds 49 to 50 pounds in the uk okay um and then we just scroll down the page um and uh let's just click on this so this is the ingredients so in our 500 milligram product there is unrefined organic cold pressed hemp seed oil very important it's organic and it is gold cold pressed okay so again some product is not cold pressed cold press means it is pressing out um as much of the cbd as possible it's organic and it's unrefined all very important check that your cbd is unrefined organic and cold pressed and is it whole of plant as well ours is whole of plant okay and then that's a lot number i'll explain to this in a minute and then it just talks about how much um cbd and it's full spectrum another thing you need to look for is your cbd full spectrum because it's very important so that's the amount of milligrams of cbd per one ounce bottle of our product okay um and that's basically just gives you a little bit more information about i'm not going to go into all of that information and then we go into the additional information section so on here then you've got um the label okay which you can view as a pdf and then you have um this is the lot number here which is the documentation is for so there is a pdf product information there is a pdf on the potency on the microbials and on the solvents and i'm opening all those up for you to show you okay so this is the pdf on the product so that gives a lot more information about the product okay suggested use suggested suggested dosage okay how you need to take care of things about the fact that it's full spectrum and why that's important okay so that's all in the product pdf all of our products are certified by an independent third-party company and we use a company called green organics and they are based in the usa okay and this gives you a full breakdown of the 500 milligram cbd product okay it tells you the thc potency the total cbd potency and the total potency altogether of this product okay and then it actually gives a total breakdown of the cannabis within that the thc a the thc the cbd cbda cbn cbdv cbg cbga and cbc and then the total of all of that combined okay and then there's the graph to go with that and then it's signed and it's stamped as independently so this gives you the quality of the product okay this is the certification of the microbials so again it shows you that don't ask me what microbials is but it's a pass okay then we have the certificate of um analysis of the solvents okay again and it passes on all of the solvents okay so that it's all safe and then we oh we don't want that uh yeah and then this is the last one um the certificate of the microbials again they're they're past so we provide all this information um in with our product does your cbd company present you without all that information okay very very important that you are aware of all this and then on top of all this there is a business opportunity as well should you be interested just click the link below that will take you to another page and if you do this right and you work with our team you will actually start getting your cbd product for free which is good news thank you very much for this and i hope you find it interesting and thank you very much for watching my video

a quick hello to everyone thank you for being here we're we're so excited to have you this is a topic that um has come up gosh weekly if not monthly since i joined the staff two and a half years ago so i'm really we're thrilled to share this content with you and to hear from synchronicity and so i'm going to turn it over to elizabeth thanks for being with us guys hey thanks it's so great to see so many faces here on the zoom i'm not sick of zoom but it's like brings our community together especially on this topic so i i'm elizabeth ollette i'm on the board of directors of the cmta and more so i'm a patient advocate and the mom of a young adult with cmt i'm no longer able to say child i'm a young adult with cmt and with us today is dr stephen krauss he is the president and the ceo of synchronicity which is a full spectrum hemp oil company and when i was looking and also we have sam salem mclaugh where are you salem he's the director of e-commerce i don't see him on my front screen but if he salem if you talk you'll show up on the front screen anyway well sale is trying to figure that out he'll be we'll be hearing from salem and we also have dr greg stillwell and he is on our advisory board he's a podiatrist he's an he's an exercise enthusiast and he actually introduced us to um this company and we're so happy he did dr krauss can you just tell me how how did you get involved with this i hear you're in iowa now the company's in colorado you go back and forth what are you doing well i was a practicing chiropractic physician for 30 years and i was able to start a medical device company a number of years back and that got me involved with fda audits with good manufacturing processes i've owned a number of companies for operations and they asked me to come out with my science background i've done some published research in the past and with bringing the good manufacturing process and certifications that come with a nutritional pharmaceutical type company i brought that expertise out here and assembled a team so that we could deliver our product in a very safe manner and because it was all natural that fits my mo i'm a holistic practitioner and i love organic and i love holistic healthcare wow that's that's great that answers a lot of questions for me but i still don't understand why you're still living in iowa well i have seven children and uh and uh i still have three kids in college three in high school and one married so they're all back in iowa so i wasn't gonna be able to move everybody out okay that explains that question too well with that why don't we um whoops uh thank you laurel i just want to thank laurel also who put everything together so let's let's get to your slides dr krauss has some slides that he's going to show us to explain he said he's going to rip through them because there's a lot of them but it's very informational and dr cross can we get these slides later on after the presentation okay great and then we'll be able to ask some questions so go ahead dr press welcome well thank you and i i really appreciate cmta for allowing us to present educational information about how the body's endocannabinoid system works and how a natural product like synchronicity using full spectrum hemp oil can hopefully make a difference in those watching and for the loved ones of those watching here as we know you know cmt with genetic and not really any kind of cure what we're hoping to do is make the lives better of those individuals having the various symptoms so as you've kind of already alluded to i'm the president and chief operations officer here at functional remedies and so i work with everything from our organic farm to our certified gmp production facility to our iso 9001 certified company and we're real proud to have our operations in colorado and this is the view right out of the window just three feet from me uh that i i'm lucky to look out of each week and so uh that was that picture you see that was taken just a couple weeks ago right outside my window so as mentioned uh we're a vertically integrated company where we take care of our own soil our organic farm through our production process all the way to the bottle so we control and own every step of the process so that we can guarantee what's in this product and the safety of it so let's talk generically here first i think there might be a number of individuals who have heard about hemp oil and cbd but they're not really sure what is it so let's just talk a little bit about what are the reasons americans are currently taking these types of products you've got well over 30 million americans taking this now on a daily basis and the number one reason is pain relief and then the next four reasons are pretty close second through fifth you've got relaxation stress relief reduced anxiety and better sleep those are the reasons that individuals have stated as to why they take hemp oil or cbd but i think it's important that we understand the differences and there's a lot of buzzwords out there and unfortunately there's a lot of i guess i'll call them garage companies who are trying to make a fast buck and you need to be careful uh making sure that you're you're getting uh what you think you're getting so let's address the elephant in the room can you get high off of hemp or cbd and the answer is clearly no and so let's describe the difference between hemp and marijuana they both come from the same plant cannabis sativa but the difference from a legal perspective is simply this if the plant has more than 0.3 percent thc it's considered marijuana if it's less than 0.3 percent it's hemp so thc is one cannabinoid in a hemp plant in a marijuana plant and that's what gives you the hallucinogenic or the psychoactive high feeling that you hear about cannabinoids such as cbd cbg all the other 120 cannabinoids that are in that plant do not get you high so with hemp you cannot get high or have altered mental status uh from an uncontrollable factor by taking hemp or cbd you cannot so we've worked very hard over the last 20 years of naturally crossbreeding this plant to make sure that our plant has an extremely low amount of thc so it's important to have a little bit of thc in there and our plant averages about 0.1 and you really need you know anywhere from 7.00 to start feeling something from a high factor so you're not going to feel that you'd have to drink you know a few dozen bottles of this to get anything but then i don't think your stomach would feel so well so let's talk about the difference in plant genetics for just a moment that's really the difference all these cannabinoids and phytonutrients including bioflavonoids which help free you know protect your body against free radicals uh the phenols all these wonderful benefits of skin protecting nutrients anti-inflammatory properties but having a full array of all these phytocannabinoids and a tiny tiny amount of thc is where the benefit comes from and our plant right now is the only fully dna sequenced plant in the cannabis genome it's even published on the nih website if you go to the ncbi website the subdivision of ni of nih you'll find that our plant which we call cbd or x18 uh we fully sequence the dna so we know exactly what's in our plant and this is our plant on our farm right here in colorado and there's a difference between full spectrum hemp oil and cbd all by itself so let's explain that cbd is one molecule there are over 120 identified different cannabinoids 120 different molecules of cannabinoids plus there's another 300 molecules of terpenes phytonutrients so you've got around 400 different molecules in this plant and what's interesting about the genetics is the human body the dna in our human body matches nearly 40 of the dna in the hemp plant it's the most closely related plant to the human body than any other plant even certain vegetative plants they have certain dna similar to the human body as well but the hemp plant has more dna similarities to the human body than any other plant and i find that very interesting now your body has a system called the ecs the endocannabinoid system and it's a it's made up of a bunch of receptors that are located on your brain on your nervous system your spinal cord on your skin on your digestive tract your endocrine glands near your joints your nervous system even your endocrine system where it balances all of the hormones in your body so the ecs system isn't something that any of us were taught in high school and the reason for that is it wasn't until the late 80s early 90s that it made its way into all the medical textbooks and the ecs system the receptors is basically the master system of the body to control and regulate the other systems of the body so that they produce the correct enzymes for inflammation so that they produce the correct hormonal release or the correct amount of serotonin from your brain so that your body's biochemistry is balanced that's what the ecs is doing is it's allowing your body to be in a homeostatic state and the way it does it is with a variety of different receptors now these receptors the majorities receptors are triggered by cbd that one molecule but many many of the receptors aren't triggered by cbd at all they're triggered by the other cannabinoids cba cbd and even terpenes terpenes are found in oranges grapefruits terpenes are very rich in the hemp plant as well and those botanical compounds also trigger and activate these receptors so that they then send messages to the immune system to the gi system and so the difference between full spectrum hemp oil and cbd is this full spectrum means we're taking all of these botanical compounds from the whole planet that's that whereas cbd is simply cbd is simply one molecule and in order to get cbd out what certain companies have to do they have to use an extraction process and that extraction process involves chemicals like ethanol or ether it's a harsh extraction process and the problem when you do that is you have to remove that molecule they cleanse it and then they put it back into the liquid and so it's really not an all-natural process it's a man-made process whereas lipid infusion which is what our synchronicity product is made from it's a gentle hand pressing and so literally here's what we do imagine this folks imagine a container a stainless steel large pot with organic coconut oil which is a lipid and then we put hemp raw hemp material right from the plant and we've already tested that plant to make sure there's no heavy metals no pesticides no chemicals all organic on our organic farm and that hemp product goes into this and under a specialized heat under a specialized pressure we cook and infuse all of those phytonutrients in the hemp plant and they attach to that organic coconut or lipid molecule and literally with our hands we hand press with a an apple press we squeeze out the oil out of that plant we don't use any harsh chemicals like the co2 extraction methods and the difference is this would you like to have the pure cells that you see on the bottom here or would you like to have the adulterated molecules that are shown above from co2 extraction put into your body i don't know about you but i'd rather have these nice holistic all-natural molecules go into my body versus an adulterated biochemical compound that you see above as a result of ethanol extraction and then you want to make sure that before you put that product in your body that it's pure that it's got the correct potency that is on the bottle that you know you're getting the amount of hemp nutrients that it says it has in the bottle and so it's important that it's tested for antimicrobial properties it's important that we test for heavy metals and make sure that there's no residual solvents and make sure there's no toxins and we want to make sure that there is no amount of thc above 0.3 percent and we've demonstrated this so we are federally certified by nsf for gmp and not a lot of companies have that designation and we're the only company that has an iso 9001 certification for the entire company from the farm to the corporate office to our production facility and gmp we're the only company in the united states out of over 3 000 that have that dual certification for as a hemp only company so it's important that you know you're getting pure potent and safe products put into your body and one way we control that as i mentioned earlier in the presentation is that we're vertically integrated because we test our soil we test the plant before we harvest we test the plant after we hand harvest we're literally out in the field and we hand plant every single plant by hand and we harvest every single plant by hand and then it's cared for in the facility and because we use this lipid infusion process it allows for a better bio availability into your body a better absorption because lipids are more easily absorbed in the body and it's important that we are able to get all of those botanical compounds that the hemp plant offers into your body because of what we call the true entourage effect it's the whole entourage of all these wonderful botanical compounds to trigger all the receptors so that your body is fully balanced and the best way i can explain it is when you've got an orange would you rather have fresh squeezed orange juice or would you rather have a concentrate and i think most of us would choose fresh squeezed orange juice right and that way you get all of the cannabinoids and that's what your body needs is all those cannabinoids to balance all the systems of the body so the other question i'm often asked is well what's the right amount that i should take i've been diagnosed with cmt so i've got neuropathic pain i've got some numbness in my extremities i've got achy muscles i've got gi problems you know a variety of issues right so here's what we say in order for you to feel the full effect you kind of have to ask your body you've got to start low and then go a little slow and your body's going to tell you so i'm going to share this with you i you heard at the top of the presentation i had seven kids three in college three in high school every one of my seven children have taken this product whether it be a topical on their skin whether it would be an ingestible whether it be a facial cream but all seven of my kids take this product on a daily basis my college kids take it to sleep better and as an anti-anxiety is why they take it so i recommend what you do is start with 25 milligrams a day and now this depends on your metabolism it depends on what other kind of medications might you be taking so if you're taking a you know i guess i'm going to call it a molotov cocktail of all kinds of medications you do need to talk to your physician about this but the crazy thing is folks most healthcare practitioners out there they don't fully understand cbd and hemp either because when they were in college it was they didn't study it so most of the research has been done over the last several years and on the nih website you'll find thousands of studies ranging from far you know female issues with endometriosis to simple problems like anti-inflammatory where there was a lot of research but my recommendation to you is this if 25 milligrams a day doesn't change anything go to 50 milligrams within three days after that if you didn't notice anything you can go up to 150 milligrams without impacting any kind of liver or other problems in my opinion and anything above that you should talk to your family healthcare provider so one of the studies was done back in 2018 over in europe and what they did they assembled a panel of experts to review over 10 000 different scientific abstracts that dealt with sia with cbd dealt with hemp oil in general and how does it affect the endocannabinoid system of our body so their conclusion was that there is substantial evidence that hemp oil does work specifically the number one thing that it helped was acting as an anti-inflammatory and as you know most pain is from inflammation and we all look at all these various health care conditions out there they all end with itis itis gastritis uh conjunctivitis everything ending in itis simply means there's inflammation of that structure and we all know now that cardiovascular problems is really inflammation of our arterial walls and one of the uh yeah actually one of the world's leading cardiologists dr joel khan over in the detroit area he's published a number of new york bestseller textbooks and he recommends this and he only treats ceos and high-end individuals for heart problems and he recommends you know our product for anti-inflammatory problems for the cardiovascular system um there's a lot of research out there that you'll find on the nih website so i encourage you to go there yourself and if you just google hemp studies on nih thousands are going to show up right from the immune system to the gi tract to the nervous system to the endocrine system uh you'll spend months reading these studies so i'm going to wrap it up here real quick with how do we feel the full effect well it's different for everybody and what form factor is best for you well there are capsules lotions there are tinctures which is a dropper that you might take and so the topicals that you see here everything and all these topicals we've added additional ingredients besides the hemp oil so it's all organic ingredients in the sports balm for pain so for those of you who don't want who don't want to take an oral uh ingestible such as a capsule or a tincture i might recommend you you try the sports balm and that's a roll-on on your skin over achy muscles or joints that you would apply and that's a good dose that's 2 500 milligrams of the total bottle but we've also included a number of other organic ingredients from arnica to menthol and some other soothing items as well and our body oil uh has helped many many people who have had different skin inflammatory processes my my 20 year old son who had severe acne in high school he's not in college it got rid of 90 percent of his symptoms he looks the best he's ever been the body butter on the far right uh cracked heels um on your toes fungal areas works wonders um uh my other son who's in high school is a basketball football athlete uh has worked wonders for him on athlete's foot and things of that nature so that's what the sports bomb looks like and this is what the body butter looks like that we just discussed and then the tincture is all natural or you could have a flavored tincture such as berry lemonade and for those of you who don't like the all-natural hippie taste my recommendation is try the berry lemonade and that'll mask uh any if you don't like kind of a hemp flavor as you put that in your mouth swish it around and swallow it um and the dropper itself uh one dropper contains uh 25 milligrams on if you buy the thousand milligrams uh bottle if it's a 500 milligram then it's 12.5 milligrams so you might take two of these before bedtime if you're taking it for sleep i personally take 50 milligrams every night before i go to bed so i take two capsules every night before i go to bed and then i use the youth serum on my face on my wrinkles uh it's got a bunch of uh organic properties in there along with the hemp oil and it's cleared up a number of my i'll call them age spots here on the side it's done wonders and because cmt was so uh gracious and allowing us to speak tonight and now we'll open up the questions in a moment but you might want to write this down it's cmta 30. so it's pretty easy to remember you all know who cmta is and then the number 30 if you use that on the website you'll get 30 off uh any order that you have and that's at www.synchronicityhempoil.com so at this point i think we can open it up to q a and keeping in the theme with our colorado base this is our red rocks uh outdoor amphitheater that i took this photo at a blues concert last uh two summers ago now and uh it's nighttime now but i don't see a full moon out there like i did that night so we can go ahead and start with q a so thank you so much that you did get through those slides pretty quickly it was very informative um before we go to q a i'd just like to bring dr stilwell who's on our cmt advisory board many of you know him already and dr stillwell is the one that brought this company to us and he himself has experienced the the full effect of some of these products and greg i wanted you to speak a little bit about that before we go to q a well hi elizabeth thanks for having me here i'm so grateful that this seems like a pretty objective presentation stephen so thanks dr krauss for a lot of good stuff you know for me i've been taking this synchronicity for about two years and um for three main reasons elizabeth you know one was that i started off with pain with uh kind of that neurological pain in my legs i don't know you know i i guess everybody's pain is a little bit different but uh what i found was uh i tried other cbd oils and uh capsules and these things without any kind of relief and this one um i would say 80 to 90 percent gone when i take it now i have to take it every day um the second thing is uh kind of this feeling of uncoordination you know that uh i'm sure a lot of people seem to can relate to you know that i feel clumsy when i walk sometimes or maybe my hands don't work the way they should and when i take the hemp oil um you know i haven't actually done like scientific studies to see how much it improves but i can sense that my my hands work better and that my uh legs are less clumsy and um i'm not sure why that is exactly but uh last reason is is that there is kind of this whole mood and stress relief kind of thing you know dr krauss talked about uh not getting high but but but there is definitely something that it does to the brain and um and so that when you take it like your mood kind of is elevated that you know you know um things are happier for me and uh so thanks so much he's good do you take the pills dr stillwell yeah so i take a 50 milligram capsule uh uh sometimes uh you know if i do a lot of exercise or if i have done something bad for my body like traveling then uh i'll take extra but um well thank you so much for that testimonial thank you thank you for bringing us uh we're you know introducing us to synchronicity this is great laurel thank you i look forward to the q a thanks sure yes we've had lots of questions start rolling in and i have received a few um before uh tonight as well so we'll just sprinkle those in so i'm gonna dive right in and um one of the first questions uh dr krauss is how is this good for people with cmt are there special benefits for us i can't say that there's special benefits uh again when we talk about anxiety or we talk about what uh dr stillwell just mentioned you know mood there is a lot of research on improvement that patients have mentioned again it's finding the right dose for that but the big thing to me that i would think for cmt patients is the anti-inflammatory properties that's all natural we all know that when we watch tv and a medication commercial comes on one third of the commercial is the narrator listing off 50 different side effects that occurs and we all know uh if we're going to take tylenol we're going to cause liver problems we all know if we take advil and nsats we're going to cause gi problems and kidney problems uh there's just no way around it so long-term utilization of those types of anti-inflammatory products has side effects and the all-natural organic properties of hemp oil and specifically full-spectrum hemp oil [Music] can give an individual those anti-inflammatory benefits and anti-inflammatory benefits affects the whole body uh i'm gonna just share a quick little story and this is uh just one anecdotal and it's my blood test so ever since i was 23 years old when i started taking my my blood work i have had high triglycerides high cholesterol my entire life and when i take life insurance physicals on myself those results came back i had a heart attack about five six years ago they wanted to put me on statins i did it for one year [Music] i just had another life insurance physical done and they did the blood work i couldn't believe it i went to the hospital did a follow-up it's first time in my life i'm not on any medication i take no statins and i've been taking this product for a year and a half every day and my cholesterol triglycerides are normal i can't say to you it's from this i can't make that statement but nothing else changed in my life because i still eat steak and i still drink a mountain dew every now and then so my diet is not perfect and i'm the worst for exercise so the only lifestyle factor that changed for me is introducing hemp oil and i and i believe it's because of the anti-inflammatory uh effect uh on my blood vessels okay very good can i ask a question you talked a lot about phytonutrients can you explain what what that is yeah so phytonutrients what nutrients in the plant there's a whole host of bioflavonoids the terpenes the phenols it's a way phytonutrients is a way to describe all these other botanical compounds that are found in the plant and so they've identified a little over 400 botanical compounds in the hemp plant and so many good natural ones for the body now granted a lot of them are very very small amounts um with cbd being the largest one of them but again to get this full entourage effect the reason why so many experts are now saying full spectrum hemp oil meaning whole plants you're getting all the nutrients in the plant you're not just extracting just the one phytonutrient cbd thank you yeah okay i'm just trying to get back up to the top of the questions um someone had asked if your products are available in canada salem's helping to answer the chat questions and unfortunately your products are not available in canada um just wanted to share that with the with the group because we have a few friends from over the border up in canada with us um [Music] so we we will get to people raising their hands but also if you could put your ask your question in the chat feature um that is a great place to do that as well is it illegal to send to canada why isn't it can you you can't purchase it and have across the border it's a regulatory factor yes okay all right okay that's supposed to be changing soon we'll see okay that would be great and this question has come up a couple times dr krauss um you know someone is saying this all sounds wonderful and organic but where are the clinical trials to support it specifically um clinical trials in general you might speak to about uh cbd and hemp oil but also as it relates to cmt you bet so one thing that we're investing in here at synchronicity we are we just got approval from the irb the international review board to do a human trial a clinical study and we'll be initiating that in the next two months and the purpose of that study it's a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial and we'll be testing different dosages and its impact on sleep pain anxiety and general lifestyle so a person diagnosed with cmt could be in in that study it wasn't designed for just cmt folks um and there is another trial that is supposed to be released uh in about six to eight weeks and that study had 700 individuals testing liver enzymes and safety at different doses for that if you've read about potential liver toxicity the only reason that came up through the fda is because when gw pharmaceutical it's a pharmacy company that created an anti-seizure medication so it's listed as a drug and it's primarily cbd isolate only it's not the full phytocannabinoids it's heavy doses the smallest dose that i've heard of with that drug is 375 milligrams a day but the studies used thousands of milligrams over 2 000 milligrams in the study a day so think about that we're talking about using 50 milligrams they used 2 000 milligrams each day and it showed some possible in some patients some possible liver toxicity at those high doses for those people with severe certain type of seizures and so my reason for bringing that up um [Music] while this discussion about liver is because of that seizure medication that triggered that discussion and that's why we're also doing safety clinical trials on the liver to demonstrate to the person's question clinical safety thank you dr krause um it's been asked a couple times in the chat does um your do your products interfere with any prescription medications that people might be on whether it's gabby patent something for neuropathic pain or any other medications is there any contraindication a number of studies have been published on nih website and of those it was interesting some medications there can be complicating factors but then at the same time they showed certain medications worked better when the person took uh hemp oil i'll give you one example a certain antibiotic worked better because they have also shown that hemp oil has some antimicrobial properties in it specifically for uh things like staph staphylococcus so but some microbes that are gram positive that test gram positive it's not that effective with it did not enhance it but gram negative it did so my my point here is i mean we could spend an hour going through you know a thousand medications does it does it not and the problem is a lot of research has not been conducted on all these different medications and again that's why i said earlier if you're taking a you know a menu list of medications you should talk to your family physician about it so are you already taking um [Music] you know certain antidepressants and things of that nature um [Music] so it's not well understood yet which medication doesn't work with or not okay um and you mentioned that hemp oil can help with the numbness that's associated with cmt with um cmt cause numbness as a result of sensory nerve impairment what is the mechanism by which hemp oil might help to improve the numbness yeah so neurotransmitters are impacted by your endocannabinoid system in your body so regulation certain release of neurotransmitters again we have to remember what is hemp oil actually doing hemp oil isn't going in there and attacking neuronal issues or the myelin sheath that's not impacting that specifically what it's doing is it's allowing the nervous system itself to regulate itself better or to release certain biochemicals uh at the axonal level and again there are a number of studies that have shown that at the axon level it does actually cause certain enzymatic release that can help so i'm not going to sit here and say hemp oil resolves neuropathies but there is a study on nih if you type in neuropathy and cbd or neuropathy and hemp oil you'll have a half a dozen studies pop up and uh there is some evidence of improvement with those cases okay thank you i think it would be helpful i'm seeing a trend with the questions here um could you just review uh again dr krell's how um these products might help the cmt patient so looking at neuropathic pain sleep relaxation um anxiety anxiety associated with with having a progressive disorder you bet and and with the litany of items you just mentioned there and then of course depression starts to happen because of all these symptoms and individuals suffering from so again if you can get restful sleep they've shown that if people can sleep better and get rest they have more energy the next day their body is healing in that process so what i'm going to tell you is if your body's neurological system and your body's anxiety great you know dr stilwell talked about uh just mood enhancement uh feeling better feeling happier uh anti-anxiety effects so again we're not treating a disease here folks with with hep oil what we're doing is it is modulating your body's regulatory system when it comes to certain hormones certain enzymes certain neurotransmitters to function better which therefore the end result is less anxiety better sleep less inflammation and so while there's no cure for cmt if we minimize the symptomatology that comes along with it uh you're feeling better you're happier and so i'm going to say this because you folks have a sequela of a variety a mishmash a bucket load of symptoms i believe it's not true all the time but i believe you're going to need higher doses and that's why earlier i said consider up to 150 milligrams i believe you should start small at the 25 work your way up find the right dose for you and you will know you will know within three days a week at the most in my opinion based on the thousands of testimonials that we've got on the tens of thousands of people who take our product um i encourage you to try you you're not gonna get hurt um [Music] as long as you're not taking a litany of medications that you do need to be careful with okay thank you very much for that and um this has come up several times will it cause you to test positive on a drug test great question so the answer is it depends it depends on the drug test and here's what i mean by that if we rewind the clock 10 years ago employers would do a marijuana test right when you talk about a drug test what is the drug the drug that they're testing for is marijuana hip oil clearly is not marijuana okay because the federal legal allowed limit in every state is less than 0.3 percent of thc you are allowed to have that the problem is the cost of a drug test that is specific for just the thc is expensive it's 45 retail to the doctor's office they're going to charge the employer 100 bucks and it's for thc so what they did 10 years ago when it was illegal to have hemp oil back then they found that by testing for cannabinoids cbd was much cheaper 14 so the drug test what they thought was well we know there's cannabinoids in the marijuana plant also let's just test for cannabinoids and that means they're taking marijuana if they have a bunch of cannabinoids showing up so what's happened is about 60 of all employers and labs have shifted away from testing for cannabinoids and are now testing for just the thc true marijuana and unfortunately about 30 percent of the labs still use the old method so my answer to your your person asking the question is it depends on the type of test that the employer is doing my advice to you is to quiz them question them on what they're doing or what the lab is doing and i guarantee your employers are saying i don't know i just hire this lab over here or i hire this doctor's office to do drug tests uh they don't know the details and the specifics of it so it's important to understand what they're testing for and then number two even if they are testing for thc if your body's metabolism is poor and you are taking high doses of hemp oil full spectrum headboard that has some thc in it it's possible very remote very unlikely less than three percent chance but it's possible the person could still trigger a thc test false positive granted but it still can be triggered okay um thank you next question is there an age minimum and maximum um what is that recommended age range and i'm specifically asking because one person asked if it's safe for her 91 year old mother well my mother is 80 years old and she takes it every day i know many elderly here's what's funny if you my mom is extremely religious and if the word marijuana came up you were a sinner you know in her mind right so what i'm telling you in their little church group she told me she took a poll and there's like 12 ladies who played bridge and all this eight out of 12 of them are taking cbd and they're all they're all in their 80s that's awesome so the whole attitude has shifted so here's what i'm going to say i don't know enough details about your 90 year old grandfather or grandmother but again it depends on medications and other things and give them a low dose it depends what they're taking it for right now we don't recommend it in children or pregnant women why not that we know there's a side effect it just hasn't been tested there's not enough studies on it so that's why we say no but i will tell you my youngest son uh is 15 and he was taking it when he was 14 for certain things granted his was a topical and just so we're all aware when you take a lotion or a body butter it goes on the skin you will not test positive on any drug test taking a topical because it does not penetrate the bloodstream so when you use a roll-on on muscles or near a joint the topicals will not trigger positive results on a drug test and topicals certainly will not cause harm to those on lots of medications you can put on the skin and just so we're all aware your skin has cb1 and cb2 receptors all over your body you have endocannabinoid receptors on your body on your skin which is your number one immune protector the the immunes your skin is an immune protector and it helps they a study just was released on february 4th of 2021 talking about the protective properties of hemp oil on the skin cells increasing uh the hydration and immune properties of our skin very informational um thank you for that um next question um can you build up a tolerance um for it to where then you would need to escalate your your dosage great question i think that happened to me um after taking 50 milligrams daily for probably almost two years now uh there were many nights i bumped it up to 100 milligrams my brain is going a million miles a minute so in the past a lot of times i would sleep for three hours wake up be restless now i sleep on rock solid five to six hours i'll still sleep another two hours a little bit off but i i get the best sound sleep i've ever had these last few years and it seems like as we get older we all seem to have challenges sleeping and that leads to other health problems if we don't get good rest so to answer your question is it possible you build up a tolerance it is possible i don't have enough studies though to comment intelligently so just pay attention to your body okay um some people are saying that the code is not working so could you just speak to that you have to register with synchronicity um and then use the code or so basically you just have to go to you know you enter the you enter your product and then you put it in your cart and then you put in the code and you have to kind of go to the very end once after you've filled out your billing information and then you'll see that code is applied okay so that's probably where a little bit of confusion is coming in thank you see what happens at the end okay um uh sorry dr cross any side effects from daily use so again if your dose is in that 25 50 to 100 uh milligrams a day uh the only side effects that we have ever had reported and i'm not kidding we have thousands of testimonies we ask was a little bit of some people talked about dry mouth in the in the morning they might get a little dryness in the mouth um other than that uh we have not had any reports and again we we've sold this to tens of thousands of folks okay i'm really sorry if i asked that twice i'm trying to judge 11 different things i'm sorry um hang on one second we'll we'll get to people's questions who's raising their hand i'm just trying to get through the some of the chat things um any research on um the addiction or dependency associated with pure hemp oil no um you know i think what you're going to find is a lot of people will say to you oh i tried hemp oil or i tried cbd it didn't work for me and i will say this again that person probably took a cbd isolate from a co2 extraction method meaning they just took cbd only and the dose was probably so low and if they bought it at a gas station you know god knows where that came from and even if there's cbd in the product the fda did a study two three years ago and they randomly selected i think it was about 80 different products off the shelf and it's unfortunate and embarrassing to tell you that about 20 of those companies in their products didn't even have half of the cbd listed or no cdd listed these are frauds and that's why i say to you you have to get a gmp certified company because it's all validated uh they follow the processes they're regulated um [Music] it's critical but back to the point no i've seen no studies on dependency um or tolerance buildup so i'm not saying there is or isn't the tolerance buildup i'm just saying that there's no studies yet okay but i'm aware of and then um is there a different approach for children one mom is asking her daughter is 13 years old weighs 100 pounds would you start her at 25 milligrams so great question so what i would do so this is what a tincture looks like and so it's a dropper and on the side of the dropper i'm going to hold it up to i'm going to squirt it there's the color here so do you see the numbers kind of on the dropper kind of yes you might see some numbers there so it's got one milliliter 0.75 my suggestion is go with the berry lemonade tincture and instead of doing a full dropper i would buy the 500 milligram not the thousand milligram for your daughter 13 year old therefore one full dropper is just 12.5 milligrams okay and all the information is on the back of the label and so my suggestion is just do a half a dropper of the 500 milligram very lemonade tincture with your with your daughter and see what kind of changes and i'm assuming no try uh no research yet on on children no studies have been done correct uh off the record i'm on the record you're all listening i know i know lots of people who give it to kids uh lots i i know uh of a teething baby that a mother put a one drop on her finger and rubbed it on the goons of the infant um [Music] just sharing that yeah okay um any concerns for anyone who has been through chemotherapy for cancer and and using cbd i'm assuming not since it's pure uh absolutely no concern as a matter of fact uh if you go to the nih website go ahead and type in cancer and cbd cancer post treatment and cbd there are a number of studies showing that those who have undergone radiation or chemo have incredible relief by taking cbd as a matter of fact there's a lot of research on that that many cancer patients uh take that it's not helping the cancer it's helping the the feeling the icky feeling uh after uh treatments okay and you do not need a medical marijuana card of course to purchase these products no you do not because it's not marijuana it's not marijuana okay um mr lopez yes did you want to ask a question soon is it possible to get a copy of that slide that showed the various websites for different parts of the body like the gi tract and so on that looked like a really useful slide i you bet i'll definitely make sure you get that yes if if uh dr krauss shares his slides with me i can get that out to everyone who has registered for the zoom tonight what i'll do is i'll convert the slides to a pdf because right now the graphics on the slide are so thick it won't be able to be emailed so i'll convert the slide presentation to a pdf and then you can give them access to the pdf okay wonderful thank you and also um for the people who came in late and asked if we are recording it and will it be available the answer is yes just give us some time to edit it and get it up on our website but we will be doing that um okay so and just no contraindications for people dealing with diabetes uh no they're diabetes you know we've got liver involvement uh we've got insulin involvement [Music] there's not studies on that but uh that's one of the cases that we need to be careful with if you have diabetes in taking hep oil there's not enough research but that's a kind of health condition that could have potential side effects okay and um so there's no need to register with your state if you're going to be purchasing or using hemp oil or ordering products they just come in the mail so here's the interesting thing every state has different laws on selling cbd so we're based out of colorado so we're selling out of colorado so when you go on the website you bought it from colorado we mail it in a box like this to your home um and the u.s postal service fedex and ups all have policies that they will deliver hemp oil to all 50 states no problem okay um and what product dr krauss did you say helped with your son's acne he applies uh two products he applies the body oil uh to his back so he had i mean he used to get teased that it was very emotional for me he the kids would call pete's face i mean he was just loaded with with acne and again i'm not making a claim here folks i need to be clear that this is me personally this isn't synchronicity making a claim that we treat acne i'm not stating that what i'm saying to you is my son uh applied the body oil to the body because his back was loaded with severe acne with deep pits bubbled up red and then on the face you use the facial cream it's in a jar like this and after about three months let me back up after about two weeks we noticed an improvement but dramatic improvement after about three months and he still applies it and my wife and i are just so excited for him because he was just you know harassed as a kid yeah so could you tell me what what is the difference between the i know the difference like you know um the physical difference but when do you use the tincture and when you use the capsules yeah so here's what i would say to you the the tincture and the capsule both have you know the same hemp oil in it just a different form factor slightly on the organic coconut uh one's kind of an mct coconut the other is more of a liquid so my point is the capsules there's nothing liquidy in the capsule it's hard inside the capsule um it's you'll look at it and you're going to say oh my god this looks green and maybe even a little black it's it's hemp oil it's hardened hemp oil with it with lipid coconut the tincture i showed you is a golden green you know if you see that right on my computer and you'll just put that in your mouth after i went to the dentist i switched that around because my shot had worn off i took three full droppers and holy cow pain 100 gone in five minutes so the tincture is fast acting because it's right in your body okay so if you take the tincture before you go to bed you'll want to take that like right before you go to bed whereas the capsules you need to take an hour before you go to bed okay because it'll take an hour before it starts to have an effect on you thank you so that's if you're doing it for sleep uh my daughter who went to grad school uh is in grad school her first semester in grad school her anxiety level was so high she was away from her boyfriend miles away from her boyfriend away from family all new people hardcore classes and i put her on 150 milligrams a day so morning uh rabbit she got up at 7 a.m took 25 milligrams of a tincture kept her relaxed wouldn't get full anxiety she took another tincture at one o'clock and then so it's 25 25 then she took 100 uh before she went to bed and she did that for a month and then i backed her down to 75 a day okay laurel i think roy has a question i was just missing the exact same thing raising his finger roy go ahead oh he might just have to unmute how big is the capsule um [Music] it's the 50 so we have two capsules a 25 milligram capsule and a 50 milligram capsule salem i don't know if you have one uh readily available but it's not a horse pill if that's what you're asking yeah that's what i'm asking yeah i have trouble with or spills yeah it's not it's not one of those monster horse pills okay good thank you yeah okay iris iris if you want to unmute go ahead am i unmuted now yes you are um did i understand correctly uh dr krauss that yours is the only company right now that's selling a full spectrum version no there are there are many full spectrum companies out there but our company is the only full spectrum hemp oil company that has dual certification the iso and 9001 gmp certification okay uh there are other full spectrum helpful but i will share this with you those other full spectrum hemp oil companies do not use the lipid trans process because we have a patents pending on that process so nobody nobody infuses the way we do it they use it so someone could still use a whole plan and be full spectrum but they still might use a harsh chemical to get all the stuff out and then they have to cleanse it and put it back in and my point to you is it's not all natural they've now adulterated the biochemistry of the cell wall so they still meet the definition of full spectrum but to me it's adulterated it's it's not the molecules aren't in their initial natural state so you have a pat you have a patented process a patent pending right now uh you know how the patent office works takes three years thank you because there's so many cbd products on the market and i've tried a few of them and they do have they do help me but i was just what um you're wanting to understand a little bit better the difference between what's out there now and what you are offering i'll share i can only share what others have said and that is they've taken a buddy one he's the i.t guy he's about 46 years old and he goes i've been taking cbd for years and because he does our computer system here uh i gave him ours he's a holy cow totally different and and to him he still took a 50 milligram and he was doing 50 milligram before but he said big difference so try it you know i i'm getting certified as an aromatherapist and it's very similar to with that in the aromatherapy field when the product is certified and they give you the list of the components in each oil and they sell it out for you and if it's not a good company it's adulterated and they won't provide that data do you so i find it very interesting and so you bring up a great point so on each box you can see what's called a qr code so you see that [Music] that qr code or you can just go to our website and pull up what's called a coa certificate of analysis so every batch that we do we do a coa and it tells you exact amount of thc and all the other cannabinoids and it also tells you the heavy metal testing uh we actually test for over 70 different pesticides because we have to meet california prop 65 rules in that state and so we do we spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on testing every year uh for purity potency and we also have an aromatherapy product that you might be interested in them too i saw that yeah we're coming to a close but i want to take a question one last question from beverly and then we're going to wrap but i just want to know while we're taking this last question um i have put my email address in the chat and if your question was not answered this evening please reach out to me and we will make sure that it's but beverly go ahead so in using a topical say for lower back pain first of all what product would you recommend and secondly would there be any adverse side effects to a patient who has say acid can cause any any side effects for that type of cardiovascular increased blood pressures things of that nature yeah great great question um so for the back pain you would get this it's the sports bomb i know your husband there probably isn't playing a lot of sports so don't let the word sports bomb confuse you but the sports bomb is is a very potent topical will not affect the heart or the blood system at all um so that's my recommendation to you is to use the sports bomb and then you would apply that to both sides of the back uh i can't my my plumber uh he's he's still working this guy's 70-some years old and he's still bending over underneath the sink his knees are killing him and i gave him this as a gift and uh now now he comes to my health hey got any more work i need another one of those you know it helps his knees tremendously is there any way of what about dosage as far as that though is there can you overdose no no way you can't overdose on this just read the instructions it says apply it two to three times a day you'll be fine no problem thank you is your capital considered kosher wow so guess what um we were about to obtain our kosher certification and they bumped up the fee by three grand and so we're going to get it um so i can't sit here and say we're coaches kosher certified it's on our list of additional certifications we are going to obtain but uh they jacked up the price on us so we we pushed it back on uh i have a lot of rabbis right here really good question really good question all right everyone elizabeth um i think we'll turn it over you to you to wrap up well i just want to thank everyone for being on the call dr krauss that was very very informative salem thank you for answering the questions that i would not have been able to answer so i think we got a lot done this evening if you have any further questions just email laurel and it's laurel at cmta usa.org and i hope everyone found this to be interesting informative and i wish you all a good evening and we had a great turnout we had over 200 208 we had about 208 people the most ever so this is a very great topic thank you for the 30 code and we'll be in touch if that doesn't work for some people thank you so so much that was very very well done thank you thanks for joining us thanks dr krauss thank you caleb have a great night everyone bye-bye bye thank you", "6dj7gFDjUME": "using CBD oil for anxiety miracle cure hype stay tuned and find out [Music] my name is Douglas block I'm an author and depression survivor welcome once again to your depression recovery channel where each week we talk about practical tools and coping strategies for healing from depression anxiety well today's title the video is CBD oil for anxiety miracle cure or hype before we find out of course we have to tell our joke and I was gonna be one that I thought was pretty good but Jerry my videographer liked this particular one so this is for all you with history buffs out there what do they call a history book about cars an autobiography we both like that all right so let's go to our subject here which is anxiety and a while ago ed maybe you're so I did a publication of a video called which is worst depression or anxiety oh my god I mean they're both horrible aren't they but a lot of you chose anxiety and I can see why because when you're anxious severely anxious over time you become disabled you can't do your regular routines you can't go out meet with friends work and pretty soon you're not accomplishing anything and that can be very depressing and so I exoti often turns into depression however unlike depression where you can have any depressed since which you can take for a long period of time those of you for whom they work anxiety medications known as benzodiazepines or habit-forming or can be and you can create dependence with them so as a result many psychiatrists these days are reluctant to prescribe them thus I became intrigued when some of my group members told me that they were using something called CBD oil to bring down their anxiety I thought well this is interesting so before I talk about my take on it I just wanted to give some basic definitions of what it is so CBD oil is a natural compound found in both the marijuana and the implants and because it contains less than 0.3 percent of THC which is the psychoactive component of marijuana you can't get high from it so unlike smoking pot when you take CBD oh you don't feel anything now the story behind CBD oil is quite interesting it burst on the national scene in 2013 there was a six year old girl named Charlotte Figi who lived in Colorado and she rare form of epilepsy called Rebbetzin Roman she was having multiple seizures in fact 300 grand mal seizures a week it was eating up her brain the parents were desperate nobody knew what to do and then someone suggested using marijuana and because medical marijuana was legal in Colorado at the time they found a grower and they got a strain that was very high in CBD oil and very low in THC and they gave it to the girl the doctors were quite skeptical but sure enough the seizures stopped first for an hour then for a week and pretty soon the girl was healed so now I think she's 11 she maybe only has 2 or 3 seizures a week and most of them are sleep so this this strain of marijuana CBD was called Charlotte's Web and it's now famous and there's a bunch of brothers in Colorado six of them who had developed the foundation where they give this away to people who need it and it's a wonderful thing they're doing because you know in a lot of places people can't afford it so good for the good for Charlotte and good for humanity that this substance was discovered the next question we're going to cover is how do you take CBD oil well it's taken by mouth and it comes in many many forms when I took it it was a tincture but you can also use pills chewable gels vape cartridges cream on your skin and foods like chocolate that's how marijuana is often delivered - well remember marijuana brownies anyway the amount and quality of CBD oil and these products can vary greatly so the next question I want to address is is CBD oil addictive well no not pure CBD but many of the products also have THC in them as a matter of fact and the research i've done talking to the pharmacies in oregon and washington they tell me that a ratio of nine part CBD to one part THC is very helpful because the THC potentiates or increases the power of the CBD oil now if you're taking something like that and there's THC you might be affected so the key is to know what you're taking and what percentage of CBD THC it is but if you're just taking pure CBD well derive from the hemp no addictive properties and again no soy no psychoactive properties so the next question that comes up is what conditions can CBD L treat now if you remember it became famous or you know became used initially because it helped this girl with the seizure syndrome called Trivette syndrome epilepsy and sure enough it's been researched there also for pain my brother takes over pain inflammation believe it or not psychosis and also it helps people supposedly break the addiction to cigarettes and drugs like heroin methamphetamine cocaine because it relaxes the muscles and gets people more at less anxious state so people are investigating CBD oil for a variety of conditions nothing definitive has come yet but I know do know people who did take it for pain and a nurse I know it was quite involved in in the alternative care industry here in Oregon says that a lot of her patients take it for pain okay so now we finally get to the topic in the video or the main topic which is CBD oil and anxiety now when I first heard about this connection I thought to myself well this makes sense because CBD oil is an anti-seizure medication as we saw in the case of charlotte and klonopin which is a benzo that I used to take it essentially saved my life even one of my episodes is also an anti-seizure medication so klonopin and anti-seizure medication helps with anxiety cvbl and anti-seizure medication should help with anxiety well here's a testimonial money ol from oh one of my group members who first turned me on to it he she said I've been using stevia orally for a year now I've been experienced quite a lot of anxiety due to stressors in my life I was having a hard time sleeping I started to take a dropper full of bedtime and again if needed when I woke up too early in the morning the CBD oil greatly reduced mind's eye and had a nice side effect or side benefit of reducing joint pain as well I've never felt groggy in the morning after taking it I highly recommend CBD oil this is one person who obviously worked for now I want to bring up my particular case so in June of 2000 17 last year visiting my brother in New York unfortunately has chronic pain by the way for you any of you out there who are dealing with pain I'm going to be doing a video on depression and chronic pain because as you imagine that's a really bad combination anyway he was prescribed in New York medical marijuana is legal so he was prescribed this by his physician and he ordered this stuff on the internet but it had a strawberry cane he didn't like the taste it was a hundred eighty bucks I said wow that's a lot of money he said no you take it I'll get I'll get a different flavor so I took it home back to Oregon and one night I woke up and late morning or 4:00 in the morning as they often do with you know anxious discrimination my heart was beating rather rapidly and normally I just lie down there and breathe and try to calm myself down but this time I reached for the dropper you know put it under my tongue took about two drops and I start to notice that my heart rate went down slow down and it's my heart rate slowed down I felt more relaxed and my muscles were less tense and within about 10 minutes I was back to sleep so it really took the edge off the anxiety and got me back to sleep a lot quicker than I would have had if I hadn't had it so fortunately I haven't had very many of those awakenings but when I do I have the the oil by my bedside to use in case it happens finally I talked with a worker at a local pharmacy here in Portland on medical marijuana pharmacy and I he mentioned to me that he's been using CBD oil to replace an X the anti-anxiety drug he says at night it helps him ah breathe more easily relax the muscles of his chest and as he breathes deeply ah he can relax more and go to sleep he also said that some of his customers have used it to minimize the brain zaps that come when you come off on a depressant and also that they have used CBD oil to minimize the withdrawal symptoms when people take opiates after an operation so it obviously has many many uses so now comes the $64,000 question is how do you obtain CBD oil well first a good news if it just is derived from the hemp plant and has no THC as was the case with my my group member you can get it in any state in the country us except for Idaho on Nebraska and South Dakota and they ban all marijuana even products coming from the hemp plant which which I said we're not psychoactive so most of us can get CBD oil over the internet or in various other places however if the CBD oil has some THC in it I mentioned that the THC helps to make it more effective then you can only get it in states where medical marijuana is illegal which i think is only four or five states so you're much more limited then but still the hemp derived CBD oil can be effective and you're much more likely to get that so in conclusion the purpose of this video was to describe my research and looking at the CBD oil as a treatment for anxiety and also for pain and I found that many people do use it effectively now this doesn't mean you should run out and get her I'm advocating you do it you should probably check with your prescriber or your doctor to make sure it's not going to adversely interact with any medications you've been taking however I did call the pharmacy right before I shot this and they said it what they tell their customers as long as you don't take the CBD at the same time that you're taking your other drugs maybe wait two three hours then there shouldn't be a problem but again the final authority is your physician well this has been Douglas block I hope you enjoyed this video I hope you gained something from it if you did so give it a like or leave your comment in the comment
