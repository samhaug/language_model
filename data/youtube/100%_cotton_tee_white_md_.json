{"D8DahUYbK4Q": "[Music] hi guys today I'm doing something much different than I've ever done before I really want to review something very basic and compare it with all different brands I've got a whole bunch of white teas for you guys today they are all crewnecks they are all 100% cotton they're all different price ranges so one of them is like 15 bucks the last one is almost $200 and I want to see if it's actually worth spending that kind of money on such a basic white tea for the record I don't plan on keeping all of them some of them still have their tags attached and that's just a chance for me to be able to keep the ones that are the most distinct from the pack and anything else that I feel is a little maybe subpar I will be returning and none of this is sponsored or gifted everything is something that I purchased myself so I will leave everything linked down in the description below that will list my sizes that I bought as well as my own measurements of my body so you can kind of compare and make a judgement on which size that you would get the first one is from made well this one's 15 bucks on sale right now I have to say it is very similar to a more expensive one that I have in a few minutes so keep watching what I want to talk about with this one is that the fit is really beautiful I like the fact that the shoulder is a drop shoulder which means that the sleeve isn't very long but it looks longer on me that's a preference of mine I like for my sleeves to be a little bit longer I also think that this shirt this fabric is very much more on the see-through side of things it's less opaque so it looks more like you would see a white bra through it so I think that that's another preference if you like to have your shirts be maybe more breathable and you don't mind if your bra shows a little bit then this would be a good option I like all sorts of tees I like really thick ones I like thin ones it just depends on the outfit of course with $15 you're not getting as much as you could be with things like ethical standards some other companies that I want to feature today are you know five stars on that realm but this one is just made well so they're making strides on fair trade but really just in their denim Department so far another factor to the fact that it's a see-through shirt it's a very thin material this shirt wouldn't last for you know several years like some of them will that's also something to keep into consideration maybe you aren't looking to invest in a white tee because the t-shirt will become stained over time especially if it's a thin material this next one is from ever Lane it runs 18 dollars right now it again is a very thin material but it's not as thin as the made well one was the fit of it I think is a dream I like the fact that it has like more of a longer sleeve but it's not incredibly long I also like the fact that the sleeves are a little bit tighter and that's just again everything dimension here is preference so judge for yourself on what you like if you like things to have a tighter sleeve or a sleeve that's up higher I prefer them to be longer no matter really how wide they are but I like the look of this one I think because the sleeves are tighter compared to the body that's a really flattering look when I was comparing the feel of each one of these shirts this one was one of the highest-ranked ones on how comfy it is it's very soft it's that pima cotton that makes it so soft there's nothing like that you know it compared to a regular regular cotton of any form this one is so super soft as far as durability like how long it will last I don't think that it will last like a month I think it'll last much longer than that but I don't think it'll last for a couple years just because it's a thinner material and that already will make it more prone to stains and rips and that type of thing I've had plenty of ever lain shirts that are made of this pima cotton material and I find that like my turtlenecks especially they will last about a year and when you think of a turtleneck you're wearing it through several seasons and same with a t-shirt you're gonna wear that spring summer fall at least so those are things to consider I would say that this is a really fair price considered all that I've read about with the good trade they've shown a lot about whatever lanes ethics are and I can link that again down below next is alternative apparel and this one runs about twenty four dollars it's a much thinner material just like the other ones were but this one has a very loose fit so this one's a small on me and I would say that the sleeves have the biggest difference there a shorter sleeve not my preference not my thing it's almost the way that a cap sleeve looks you know when it's just up and angled a little bit more so this one is not really one that I prefer the fit of myself the really redeeming qualities about it is that I think that it's the most comfortable thing it's not the most comfortable out of this pack but this one is right up there with the best of them and I will say too that this one is much more on the you know ethical and sustainable route if you want to go that route then this one would be an option for you to look into this one I'm quite shocked about so this is j.crew it's about 30 bucks I would say that it is so incredibly similar to the made well one the first one but you know what's so interesting is the fit is a little bit different the sleeves don't have that you know you don't have that drop shoulder that's making the sleeves look more flattering I really don't care for the fit of this one at all and I was looking closely and it's already starting to have a hole in it and all I've done is put it on a hanger and wear it around just for this video and it still has the tag on it like I haven't worn this out at all it's an extra extra small it's got that same fabric from made while so it's thinner but I have to say that I think it's just the way that made well has created there's I don't know exactly what they've done but this one is so much more fragile than that one is and the fit of it again not my favorite this is me not that like I made that feel both of these shirts he thinks they feel exactly the same but to me this one just feels just a little bit scratchy err in this case I'm just really surprised because this one is backward I think through July or any for months not only that but it's a best-seller I'm just kind of shocked at this one it's much different than what I would assume it's you know double the price of the made well one if you are torn between the made well and the j.crew one because they are so similar a hundred percent I would say go with the cheaper the made well one before reviewing the tape on all of these I thought this next one was going to be my absolute favorite and I haven't ruled that out yet but I have to say the feel of this one is just like heaven it is so dreamy and comfortable and soft it's so much softer than any of the other ones and so this one is from Quiana it runs about $45 the sleeves on it are very interesting because they are cuffed and they're sewn to be cuffed so you can't uncuffed them unless you take a little you know ditch remover and get that off but I love the look of this it's beautiful you know when you're thinking of the complete opposite and you buy a pack o t-shirts you know in a Hanes bag you wouldn't get something like this like this looks like something hanging up in a really nice shop so that's what I appreciate about this it's very extremely drapey and loose again I'm such a fan of longer sleeves so that one's hitting that box forming it's not extremely long but it's somewhere in the middle it almost has a shine on me too and when I was wearing it's acts like you know that has like a sheen to it and I found that to be really interesting a note about their ethics they're more of a slow fashion brand they're very fair trade and I actually even though it's a thinner shirt I don't think it's gonna fall apart very quickly it's very tightly knit and I think that that will give it a little bit more life to it but I do think that it could stain kind of easily next is redone and this one runs about $78 about a year ago Rhydian gave me a shirt and it was the exact same one it just I wore it to death and so I wanted to buy a new one myself and put it in with this list and just kind of compare it and hold it up against the others so one thing to note is that similarly to the made well in Jake it's got this sort of pattern to it if you look closely it's it's not an even pattern it almost looks like it's this heather color you know the way that it's knit together it's significantly different than the made while j.crew option it seems softer and yet heavier it has detail and the way that they knit this together in the back or sewed it together it looks like it's going to stand up the test of time much longer than some other options I just love the look of how vintage this looks it's just so inspired by that and I feel like I just have a different look about me when I'm wearing this shirt I also think it's great that they're using recycled or upcycle materials which redone is just known for I do think that there is just a couple of other shirts in this pack that I prefer more than this one I will say that this one is a dream it's durable it's got up cycled products that is using fabrics but then also just the fit of it it's gorgeous I would say that probably the way that how long it lasted me the last time was about a year but that was when it started to fade and I wanted something that was just bright white that I could compare against these and honestly I could still return this one and still keep going with my old one just kind of judge that for yourself how heavily you'd use this but I am really incredibly happy with this one this last one is somewhere in between really really expensive and affordable and I know that that's different for everybody but what I mean is it's luxury definitely it's not Chanel expensive but it's not you know much more affordable like the $15 option so this is Jesse kam and it runs about 195 dollars there are some really redeeming qualities about it where I am very tempted to keep it so I will just review those with you first of all it's more of an antique white it's not like a starch crisp clean white and I think that that will make it last a little bit longer because I don't have to try to maintain that brightness if you look closely the stitching on it is a very starch clean bright white which i think is a really unique detail to it then they put extra detail around here where it's like double stitched and the material is extremely thick it is so incredibly thick that I would say that you could definitely wear it in like spring and fall or you know if you're indoors but if you're gonna wear this outside in ninety hundred degrees you'd get pretty warm which might make you sweat and maybe stain the shirt so just kind of think about that but reviewing the tape I would say that this I was just blown away at how different this shirt was cut to make it look on me versus the other shirts the other shirts look more standard you know and that's what you get for what you pay when you wear something like this I was really surprised to see how much different I felt like it looked on me because I wasn't expecting that much of a difference for a basic white tee which is why I wanted I was like curious and wanting to try this example and I do love how long the sleeves are that's like automatically I'm gonna fall in love with anything that has that it's got a really wide cuff on the sleeves and I feel like that's another win like it looks really flattering there and then I because it's such a thick shirt and it's just made with such detail and quality and extra stitching everywhere this shirt is not going to disappear in a few months like some of the more like see-through or cheaper options are going to only last maybe you know a season whereas this one's going to last I could see if you took care of it maybe Scotch guarded at first it would last me you know a couple years at least maybe three years so you are paying for that and if you're more trying to buy less and just like consume less then something like this would be a good option because you're gonna have it forever you know as far as white tees are concerned and there's such a staple that I could see that that would be a really great benefit so Jesse Kim is more small business I think she has like three employees it's made locally in and those are reasons where it goes more into the cost of what you're paying for so look into all of that judge for yourself and just see where each one of these companies aligns with where your values are in those realms but this shirt overall it's five stars on how long it will last the fit of it I am absolutely in love with very tempted to keep it the feel of it I would say is the only thing holding me back from skipping it like five stars because it isn't super soft but I love the feeling of having a thick shirt sometimes you know so going into the ones that I'll be like keeping and returning I love love the Quiana one that one is my favorite I think that it's just such a great price range and I also think that the fit and the feel we're absolutely amazing so I definitely want to keep that one I'm also very tempted with the Jesse cam one even though it's much higher price I could see in the footage the difference of how it's cut compared to any of the others where I feel like okay it's a designer shirt like this one has reason for the price because it's just such a beautifully designed shirt and then the quality of it is right up there so no disappointments there I just you know maybe with time it will get even a little bit softer I wish that was just a little bit softer if it was it would have been my favorite out of the affordable options definitely the ever lane one was my favorite $18.00 and you get an incredible shirt and it's just beautifully cut the the design of it was flattering it's very light weight and it's something that I could wear every single day as for the ones I'll definitely be returning the alternative apparel one just really didn't amaze me enough to keep it just the way that it fit really was a little bit awkward to me and so it's just really not my preference I do think that their ethics are just amazing what it stands for so those are qualities that you might want to invest in and make up your own mind on that my least favorite in the one I'll definitely be returning was the j.crew option I just don't think that it was a good fit I feel like it was poorly put together it was double the price of the made while option and it's you know same company everything so I would rather just go with a maid well one if I was choosing between them I think that the maid well one had a much better sleeve length as far as having that drop shoulder and this one just doesn't have that so definitely not a fan of this one and that's it hopefully you found a shirt that meets exactly what you love maybe there's a certain fit you love or a brand or you know that it's standards behind it or maybe it's just a price point thing for you and all of those things are something to judge for yourself but I definitely have my winners and losers in this pack for my own personal taste and hopefully it just gives you guys insight if you like this sort of video then let me know because I could definitely do this more frequently with different types like maybe jeans or shoes or there's just so many options so give this video a thumbs up if you liked it don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys next time love dancing you never mind cloudy day make the world a better place do you love dancing [Music]", "Y-Goi_A2CZo": "Today we're talking about our Gildan 100% cotton t-shirt. Now, this t-shirt is our standard, most\neconomical t-shirt that we offer here. It comes in a wide range of colors\nhundred-percent cotton more generous fit than a lot of the more expensive brands.\nI'd say this is our go to shirt for a lot of large events. If you're ordering for a big group go with the one hundred percent cotton. It offers so many colors, it also comes in a comparable ladies\nstyle, so you can also order a ladies style to complement the unisex. Now, more\ngenerous fit, just like I said so just, instead of telling you about it we do have our model here. He's gonna come over and you're going to see what I mean. First off,  more generous fit here, it's not going to be as tailored. There's no side seam, here a lot of the more expensive shirts. A Canvas, Next Level,  American Apparel, Alternative and so on They have a side seam here, which basically is going to be more tailored, more contoured fitting. This is going to be more generous. Also, it is a hundred percent cotton so it's not gonna have kinda that pull to it. It's gonna be more contracting. Which, you don't have to worry about shrinkage and is pretty true to size but, just with that over the\ncourse of a lot of washes, there's a chance it could shrink if you dry it on high So, with that being said this is more of\na one time use shirt or, you know, a few uses. It's not gonna be one that's gonna be your favorite for years to come. In terms of the fit here the sleeve, more generous cut. I wouldn't say it's tapered by any means it is going\nto be a little baggier. Standard length right here it goes kinda down the bicep. In terms of the neckline here, very standard collar, it's gonna be right up on the neckline. The pull of it, it's always gonna come back, it's not going to be very stretchy. It's pretty much just the\nstandard cotton. If you want to step up, we really recommend maybe the Next Level hundred percent ring-spun, the Canvas one hundred percent ring-spun or even the American Apparel those are great kind of step ups. But this shirt right here amazing bang for your buck and nobody's\ngonna complain because they get a great shirt. It's just the soft factor is not all gonna be there. So, you look great in this, Tyler. Thank\nyou so much. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a one. Thanks for watching this video. Please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters and so do our customers.", "rQivpKEG73k": "Look at this side-by-side photo of these\nthree tees. Which one is the softest? This one is $1.50 this one is $2.50 and this one\nis about $3.00. How could you ever tell without touching and feeling\nthem? The softness of a shirt has everything to do with the little details\nthat improve the quality of the fabric. In this video we're gonna explain the\ndifferences between the different grades of cotton. What's the difference between\ncarded open end, ring-spun and airlume combed and ring-spun anyway? We're about to\nexplain why the type of cotton matters and which kind to look for in this\nepisode of our series Us vs. Them. If you like this series so far go on and\nhit that subscribe button. Let's start with the worst type of cotton. It's\ncalled Carded Open End or COE for short. This type of cotton is super cheap,\nmaking it the cotton of choice for the one to two dollar tees of the world.\nIt's scratchy, heavy, stiff... kind of feels like the love child of a burlap sack and\na T-shirt. Now let's move on to ring spun. As fewer and fewer people were willing\nto settle for COE, manufacturers started making ring spun cotton.\nPeople often throw out the label ring spun and combed and ring spun\ninterchangeably, but these types of cotton are not the same. When cotton is\npicked there are a lot of impurities in its raw form. It's a plant so you have\nsoil and plant matter and it's just all-around dirty. If cotton is ring\nsponge but not combed and ring spun it means that all those impurities are spun\nup into the yarn. Whereas with combed and ring spun cotton\nthe raw cotton goes through a refining process to get rid of those impurities.\nWhat ends up happening is you lose a lot of the original cotton, resulting in a\nsmaller yield and costing manufacturers. But in the end you get a much better\nproduct. For you visual learners, just compare this photo (which is like ring\nspun cotton) to this photo (which is like combed and\nring-spun cotton). If cotton isn't combed it results in a tee that is hardly soft\nand a print surface that's less than optimal. Wondering where airlume cotton\nfits in this mix?At Bella+Canvas we go a step further with our airlume cotton to\nachieve something even more premium than combed and ring-spun cotton. First, we comb\nout 25% of the cotton we start with because we have super high standards for\nwhat constitutes as clean cotton. With most combed cotton only a small\npercentage of the impurities are actually removed. Then using only the\nlongest staples of cotton we spin yarn that has less stray fibers resulting\nin the smoothest print surface possible. Bottom line there's no cotton that's as\nsoft as our signature airlume combed and ring spun. So next time you're\ndeciding between a few tees make sure to pay attention to the type of cotton and\nmake sure it's airlume, the most premium blend of combed and ring-spun. It's just\nanother thing that separates Us from Them. Next week in this series we're\ngonna unravel the mystery of why your shirts are shrinking and let you in on\nthe secret as to why ours don't.

I'll be giving the prices in US dollars so it's an extra small but it definitely feels much bigger it's quite long it goes down below the crotch as you can see and it's also quite large on the side so it feels very oversized quite baggy definitely does not feel like an extra small and this fits much more like a medium size than an extra small as for the quality of the material it's a bit see-through but not too much I guess that's okay it feels slightly better than the Primark one but it also does not look like high quality cotton at all okay number three we have this regular fit H&M t-shirt this is super weird guys like I feel like a bat the fit is just really awkward like it's super super long and the sleeves are super tight there's like plenty of excess fabric right here which kind of makes it look really awkward lifts the tag here I'm definitely gonna be returning this one it's also six dollars 99 the other one was a much better fit to be honest even though it was also a little too big alright there we have it [Music] next up we've got Yoona close supima cotton white t-shirt so I've actually been wearing these for a number of years now I've got a couple in whites and then a couple in other neutral colors like Navy and gray they're all in extra-small underpriced that 9.99 for my height at least they fall right about mid crotch which i think is perfect for a t-shirt they're quite slim and they fit nice over the body and the sleeves are just about right I used to think that the sleeves were a little too big because my arms were a bit thin but now to be honest like I've been working out a bit getting a bit of arms and the fit is just perfect overall it's obviously not the highest quality cotton you're gonna have like it's it's slightly see-through and you lose a bit of that softness after like washing it a lot of times like not after a couple of washes but let's say if you had the t-shirt for like six months to a year and you've been wearing it like every week and washing it often you're gonna lose a little bit of that softness in the material but asides from that I've been quite happy with them I think they're a great balance between quality and budget so a $9 98 they're not gonna break the bank but you're still getting really good quality and the fit is nice but with that said the next four t-shirts I've never tried them on in the past so maybe who knows we're gonna find one that's better than this one from Uniqlo let's see what happens [Applause] all right so the next two are both going to be from a skits as I mentioned I go one an extra small and then one in small because they've got those 15 different sizes so you never know when there's that many sizes which one's gonna fit your best so one an extra small regular length and one in small also regular length so this one is the extra small and to be honest it feels super nice the cauda is it's a heavyweight 100% Egyptian cotton it does not look see-through at all and it just feels super nice and super soft onto the body and I keep in mind I haven't washed them yet but they really feel super nice on you lengthwise it does feel slightly too short the extra small it hits like at the crotch and maybe slightly too high on the armpits let's try on the small see if it fits any better be right back all right so now we have the ask it in size small regular length it definitely has a more room than the extra small one especially around the midsection and around the torso area and it's longer it hits about slightly under mid crotch which honestly I prefer the length of the Uniqlo t-shirts the material on this one feels better but I kind of feel like I would want it in between the two you know because it's much roomier on the sides and it's also longer but maybe slightly too long God you guys are gonna say I'm so picky but maybe like if you get an extra small in the longer length would that be better would it be in between the two would it be like super long I don't know okay so conclusion on these two from a skits if you're slightly under five foot seven because I'm five foot seven so if you're slightly under that and a little more thin I think the extra small in regular length would be a perfect fit but if you're slightly taller than me slightly taller than five foot seven and you slightly have a little more mass on you I would go for the smaller and if you're like me I would go for any in between so probably the Uniqlo ones okay let's move on to number seven alright number seven we've got this bonded cotton t-shirt from costs so this one is super big it's definitely much bigger than all the other t-shirts but not big as in ill-fitting big more like long line slash oversized kind of vibe so it would definitely work for a street wear a kind of look with that long line t-shirt maybe like under a denim jacket and you got the t-shirt kind of growing out of it to be honest I really like it it's got these kind of bands at the sleeves and at the bottom of the hem and it fits nicely for an oversized t-shirt like I would definitely not buy like 10 of these and have them be like my staple go to everyday t-shirts but as a more unique piece in my wardrobe I would rock it so it's priced at 60 I think just a second sorry about that it's priced at $45 USD so yeah it's definitely a bit more expensive than the rest but the material feels nice feels supersoft like you can feel that it's like heavy weight cotton drapes nicely over the body if you're into the oversize kind of look and you don't mind putting 45 bucks into a t-shirt I will go for it and lastly we have this t-shirt from a PC in size small and it is priced at $85.00 sir not too surprisingly it also fits a bit long like many t-shirts from many brands because I'm so short but other than that the material feels nice regarding the sleeves they feel slightly big but at the same time they also flare out very nicely and geometrically on the sides like this and although they make my arms look a little small I kind of like the look of it I like the look of how they flare out on the sides but then again is it worth $85 you guys decide for me probably not I probably wouldn't want to spend $85 for a t-shirt but the quality feels nice if you're taller than this like if you're slim if you're thin and you're tall like five foot nine or something this would probably fit you perfectly to be honest because other than the length it fits me pretty nicely all over so it's really only the length that's the problem if you're five nine and slim and you've got the money to pay 85 bucks for a teacher try it on fits nicely quality is good alright now that we have reviewed these eight different white tee shirts also I know that I didn't review one from Zara because I went to the store and couldn't find any t-shirt even not in whites I couldn't find anything in size small I mean in size extra small so sorry guys I cannot review that so in conclusion which one of these brands makes the best white t-shirt in my subjective opinion with my size and my height and my frame and build if we simply take into account the fit of the t-shirt I would definitely go for the unique low ones now if you're bringing the quality of the material and the durability and how transparent it is and how soft it feels to the touch I would go pretty asketh once those felt really high quality to me at a reasonably affordable price compared to like the more luxury brands like a PC like for a skits you get really high quality t-shirt for 40 bucks I'm not saying it's cheap it is expensive for a t-shirt but to get that premium quality fabric I think it's reasonable but then again when it comes to the size and the fits of a t-shirt it all comes down to your own personal body type so only use this as a reference while keeping in mind my size and keeping into account to your body type and how it would likely fit you and there's no better test than simply buying the t-shirt for yourself trying them on and seeing how they fit with that said I hope you guys got some value from this video let me know down in the comments if you enjoyed this style of video it's a bit

One question we get all the time is what t-shirt should I get? That's a tough one. This is understandable because there are literally hundreds of styles out there. Maybe thousands. I don't know can somebody check that? [beep] We're gonna help you decide by subjecting some t-shirts to a series of tests. It's science. So the fabric type of a t-shirt is its most important quality. So that's what we'll be testing Luckily, we can break these fabric types into four main categories and that's what we have right here. 100% cotton. 100% polyester. We've got the 50/50 cotton poly blend and we have a tri blend which is cotton polyester and rayon. Dan, and I will be ranking the shirts for each test and giving the best one a score of four and the worst one a score of one At the end will add up all the points and let you know the overall winner It's the t-shirt test [music] [swoosh] But first let's take a closer look at these test tees. Wait, that doesn't sound.... can we edit? [beep] But first let's take a look at the t-shirts we'll be testing. All right, I'm here with Dan and our first test is all about the feels. It's the feel test. [swoosh] Now what we mean by feel is the softness, the touch, the texture. This is often called the hand. Because you feel it with your hand. So we're gonna test these shirts by feeling them. You ready? [kazoo music] All right, so after some rigorous scientific investigation, we've come to a conclusion on the feel of these shirts. What did you think Dan? Um, I was just drawn with the tri-blend for some reason, you know, it was really soft. Stretchy. Very, very soft. Definitely the softest. Yeah, so I think the try blend is the clear number one. Lightweight, alright. So that's number one, I would agree with that. Number two is a bigger conversation. It's really a hard choice, but I almost think I want to say cotton. I would say cotton. 100%. Alright, so there's our number two. I think, I think poly number three. Alright we'll give poly number three. Alright so that means 50/50 is the last one. it's gonna finish in fourth place. Get outta here! The results are in for the feel test and we have tri-blend in first place taking a lead with it's super softness. followed close by cotton in second then polyester in third and 50/50 bringing up the rear. Okay for the next test we're calling it the wear test [swoosh] And for this test, we're gonna have Dan wear the shirts. Oh, really? Yeah. Alright, let's do it. [clap] Whoa! That was fast. Okay, so this is a 100% cotton. 100% cotton. Feels pretty good. Feels like a standard shirt, nice fit. Not too heavy. Next up will be a 100% polyester. Are you ready? Yup. All right. Let's do it. [clap] Wha--how are you...? It's just....we wanna move this video along you know what I mean? Okay, so polyester... Feels very light, very airy. I can definitely tell that. Next up we have the 50/50. You ready? What are you gonna do to me this time? [clap] What the? This is backwards. Sorry about that. [clap] Ah, okay. There we go. So this is the 50/50. Honestly feels a lot like the cotton. It feels really good. I can't tell if it's lighter or not. It might be a little bit more breathable, it feels like. You like the cotton better? Yeah, honestly, this might be my favorite one so far. Okay, favorite one so far. There you have it. You ready for the next one? I mean do I--? [clap] Whoa! Wow, okay, this one feels great. Really soft. Kind of like the best of what everyone else has had to offer. It's soft enough, it's very light. So what do you think? Hm, okay, so In terms of comfortability,  I'm think going to go with tri blend number one. 50/50, number two. Cotton, number three. And polyester last. But again, that's just my opinion Some people like poly, some people like cotton more. Well, science is all about opinions, so... You're right. That's very true. So here's our scores for the wear test It's tri-blend Once again in first place with its ultra comfortable wearability. Followed by 50/50 in second place. 100% cotton in third and polyester last because Dan said so. Next up We're gonna be stretching these shirts for the stretch test So we're testing the stretchiness of the fabric. And more importantly how it holds up after being stretched it's the way the fabric behaves when we stretch it Looks good stretchy. Let's stretch it up Here's your results for the stretch test Polyester getting the win on this one with its ability to snap back into shape, followed close by try blend in second then 50/50 and third and 100% cotton with a big loss here For the next test we're getting wet It's the wet test Actually, the shirts are getting wet We're gonna time how long it takes for each of these shirts to dry off in the hot Pennsylvania sun Polyester tends to be moisture wicking. So we're gonna see how that does. I have a feeling cotton is gonna lose this one, but we'll see. Let's do it Results of the wet test are in we have polyester in first place again with an easy win followed by tri-blend in second and a surprising third-place finish for cotton and 50/50 with the agony of a wet defeat. Okay, next up. We're gonna see how wrinkle-resistant these shirts are It's the wrinkle test We're both gonna take two shirts, put them on our chair, and sit on them for the rest of the day What? So we're gonna take each shirt and we're gonna ball it up and shove it in a sandwich bag and leave it for 20 minutes And see how it comes out after that 20 minutes later All right, so we got the shirts out of the bag and and they're pretty wrinkly except for this one. clear winner is poly. It was barely even wrinkled. The next one number two would be the Tri-blend here, not too bad at all, I bet these would come out as you wore it for a couple hours 50/50, Hmm Didn't do too well. Pretty wrinkly. pretty wrinkly gonna need an iron for that sucker and then cotton, oh the most wrinkly So that's a clear Clear 1 2 3 4 on this one. Looks like a topographical map. Here's the scores for the fifth and final test of this video It's polyester with another big win. This stuff just doesn't wrinkle it's kind of weird Coming in second once again is tri-blend with 50/50 coming in third and Cotton suffering a humiliating set of wrinkles. That brings us to the halfway point of this competition Let's look at our scoreboard and check the results so far Tri-blend is in the win column with a total of 17 points followed closely by polyester in a surprise second place with 15 points Cotton and 50/50 are tied with nine points apiece, and we'll have a lot of catching up to do in In our part 2 video of the T-shirt Test We will present the final five tests The screen-printing test the DTG test the mess test the wash test and the dangerous damage test, look for that coming soon Click on the items below to get more information about them or start designing on them right now Thanks for watching.

you're not welcome back um before we get started please make sure you guys like share subscribe all that good stuff hit the bell so that you get notified any time that i upload i try to upload at least one to two times a week sometimes more if i have time but at bare minimum one to two times a week um what we're going to do today is we are going to try sublimating on 100 cotton that's right 100 cotton um now i know like the first cardinal rule of sublimation is you have to have polyester but somebody not sure who to give the credit to created this solution um spray solution that you spray onto your cotton shirt and it allows you to sublimate onto the cotton basically the solution that you spray onto the shirt adheres to the cotton fibers of the shirt and allows the those fibers to be able to grip the ink so that you can sublimate on the shirt um is that's the information i got from the person that i purchased the solution from um that was the description that they gave and how it actually works so this is my first time trying it out with you guys i have not tried it on any other shirt before um and i felt like this was a perfect image to do i got this from a young lady in a craft group i'm in i purchased it from her um i can't remember her name off the top of my head i'm gonna have to look at my email and um i will leave her name in the description box so if you're interested in this image you can purchase it from her um but yeah this is the image i'm going to go ahead and use um i am going to mirror this because we know a sublimation we have to mirror i already have it have it sized out i'm going to be doing a 10 by 14 and a half and this is going to be on a large shirt i believe a large fruit of the loom um white 100 cotton shirt so i'm gonna go ahead and get this printed out i'm gonna come back and show you guys how i do it and we're gonna see if it works so stick around to see if we uh get it together all right guys so i am back here um i do have my image printed out here and then i have my this is my cotton t-shirt let me show you it's a haze i'm sorry it's a fruit of the womb platinum 100 cotton t-shirt 100 cotton um so that is what i'm going to attempt to silver on today um i do already have my butcher paper inside of my shirt to prevent any bleeding um okay and then i have my solution here i just put it in a spray bottle it came in a bottle this is the bottle that it came in and i put it inside of this spray bottle it's a hair um i've been using this for like just a water bottle for a while now but i put it inside of this to you know be able to easily spray it onto my shirt and i will link in the description box the etsy shop that i purchased this solution from so you guys can check it out if you want to okay so the first thing i'm going to do because this is cotton i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to do a um i'm going to let roll it and then i'm going to do a quick uh pre-press [Music] make sure my shirt is straight okay i'm gonna do a quick like 10 second um pre-press just to make sure all the moisture is um out of my shirt okay and now because my image is so big i'm just gonna place it on here i'm not gonna cut it i'm not gonna tape it or not i'm sorry i didn't even spray it gotta spray it first i'm just gonna give my solution a shake and then i'm going to spray the whole area you don't want it to be soaking wet you want it to be a little damp and then you gotta wait for it to dry so i'm gonna wait a couple minutes for this to dry and i will be right back okay so my shirt is um completely dry now um yeah it's completely dry now um so now i'm gonna take my image and like i said i'm not gonna cut it or anything because it's just a big piece of paper here i'm gonna place it on my shirt and then i'm going to cover it with some butcher paper like normal my heat press is already preheated 400 400 degrees and we're going to press this for 60 seconds so i will come back in 60 seconds all right so it has been about 60 seconds here my timer is going off i'm really hoping this works i can see the image through the paper that's always a good sign okay so it went through is definitely not as bright though i know for a fact that if i would have done this on a polyester shirt these colors would be absolutely popping and um here's the shirt and the colors are there it looks it looks pretty good okay it doesn't look bad for this to be a cotton shirt it does not look bad but i know if this was on a polyester shirt 100 polyester these colors would be absolutely like shining bright like a diamond but it's not bad it's not terrible it has a little bit of a vintage look to it i don't know if y'all can see but it did take okay so like i said this is the shirt let me show y'all the tag again it is come on camera focus a hundred percent cotton i don't know if my camera is focusing it's a hundred percent cotton shirt this was the sublimation and i'm actually pretty impressed um and because this is like a 90s throwback shirt the fact that it looks vintage doesn't bother me it kind of goes with the theme of the shirt so yeah i'm actually really impressed like i said i will put down in the description box the um the etsy shop that i purchased this solution from um i only purchased a small bottle because i wanted to try it out but i mean if this is the results i'm gonna get then i might go ahead and purchase myself a bigger bottle um but yeah i'll put the etsy shop name down in the description box it's not gonna be a blue link for you to click on it's gonna be an etsy shop name underneath the materials that i put in the description box so yeah and i got this um fruit of the loom shirt i got it from um um i got it from walmart and it's 100 cotton for the loom shirt so but i will put all of my materials down below as i always do thank you guys so much for watching questions comments concerns drop them down below make sure you hit that subscribe button all that good stuff bye", "88t_oHz-g9Q": "what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel in today's video we are going to be taking a look at three different plain white t-shirts from Uniqlo you guys already know how much I love Uniqlo I think they make amazing products amazing clothes prices that are affordable for most people and you guys also know how much I love plain white t-shirts I wear them pretty much every single day and in fact this one that I'm wearing right now is one of the ones that we'll be discussing in this video today the three white t-shirts that I chose for today's video are some of Uniqlo's most basic plain white t-shirts and I chose these because I think that they're the most versatile they don't have any pockets they're pretty basic in their cut and in their silhouette so I think that these are the ones that a lot of you guys will choose if you guys plan on buying some of these plain white t-shirts as well but if you guys want me to review some of uni clothes more Craigie or seasonal white t-shirts I can do those as well because I do own a few of those as well just let me know in the comment box down below and I'll be sure to make that happen also if you guys like this type of video go ahead and hit that thumbs up button because it really does help me out it helps more people find this video it helps the channel grow so I'd really really appreciate it the three shirts that I chose from Uniqlo are the package tri plain tee this is the crewneck version I also chose the FEMA cotton T which is the shirt that Uniqlo is very known for and the last one is the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt and before we get started I just want to mention that I am a little over 5 feet 9 inches as of making this video I'm around 165 pounds so that should give you guys an idea of how these shirts fit me and how they might fit you as well and yeah that's about it let's get started so the first shirt is this Uniqlo package dry crewneck shirt this also comes in a v-neck variation which should be similar if not exactly the same except for the collar and this is the cheapest shirt out of the three that I'm going to show you guys today coming in at around five dollars and ninety cents in the US and here in the Philippines where I'm from it comes in at 290 casos making it the most affordable out of the bunch and this is the one that I was actually the most excited about because I haven't tried the shirt the other two I do own so I've you know I have a lot of experience with it but this is my first time actually trying the shirt so yeah I'm really excited about it so I'm gonna start off with the things that I really really like about the shirt and right off the bat I love the fit of the shirt I like the length it falls around mid crotch for me you know this is where my belt is and I like the length of the sleeves as well they also are not too loose not too tight which I do like it's very it's a very regular fit but it fits really nicely and I'm actually very happily surprised about how the shirt feels so yeah I'm really happy about the fit of the shirt the next thing you'll notice is the sort of the quality or the thickness of the material itself and in comparison to the supima tee that I'm used to this is thinner and you could also say it's a little rougher than the supima tee which may not necessarily be a bad thing because if you're not comparing the two side-by-side you won't really notice the difference because it is still very soft now it is also a little thinner so as you can see it's a little see-through that may or may not be a deal-breaker for you for me it's not particularly you know too much of a negative and in fact in the Philippines ran from sometimes these lighter materials even if they're technically not as good as heavier weight materials can be really nice in the heat you know walking around outside so yeah I really really really really dig the shirt overall I'm very very pleased with this I think it's a very first house shirt you can use it for a lot of things yeah that's pretty much it I really like the shirt and at the price I don't think you wrong with with this with a shirt at all the next t-shirt is the supima cotton tee from Uniqlo this is the famous two pima cotton tee it's very very soft it's very very nice and this in particular is my everyday white t-shirt this one comes in at around nine dollars and ninety cents u.s. and here in the philippines it comes at five hundred and ninety pesos making it sort of the middle range between all these three shirt shirts but yeah I really love the shirt again it's my everyday shirt very very comfortable so let's just get straight into the look in the field first off right off the bat you'll see that the length is very similar to the previous tee to the dry package tee it comes down around mid crotch here the sleeves come around mid bicep and again not too tight not too loose the shoulders are just the right size for me this is a large by the way so all of the shirts that I'm fitting today are large because I'm generally a little bit bigger in the chest and in the shoulders yeah very very nice now in comparison to the previous shirt this is very noticeably a lot softer and a lot thicker in terms of material I did buy a brand new one because I do have a bunch of these but you know there are shirts that have been wearing for a long time now so I wanted to make this video with a brand new shirt just to see how one feels right off the bat and there it is super nice you can see it's not really transparent if it is it's very very little and you know it takes a lot to see that so it is a lot of thicker a lot softer and it feels a lot more durable than the first one but again you know it really depends if what you're looking for if you wear your white tee shirts a lot what you're gonna use them for so if you don't wear your white t-shirt often and you just want to have one in the closet you know you can go either of two ways you can just get this one which is a little bit more expensive but since you don't wear too much and you know you're not going to be spending a lot on my t-shirts you might want to spend a little bit more for this so that when you do wear it it is you know a little nicer a little bit more durable or you can go the other way you wear you know since you don't wear too much you don't really care for that slight bit of extra durability and quality you might just go with the cheaper one they're both great options at this point what I can say is that I'm not sure how the packaged dry shirt wear is over time but for me in particular I have a bunch of these supima shirts some of them are some of them are actually maybe two or more years old and I still wear them until today they fit very well still they basically lasted a long time especially you know this year where I'm wearing white t-shirts almost every day they've they've been very very good so that's it that is number two the supima cotton tee from Uniqlo the third and final shirt of the bunch is this one this is the newest shirt of the bunch in terms of when they came out this is the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt short sleeve tunic shirt and there are many differences between the shirt and the other two shirts but I think that this is one of the shirts that they might keep in their lineup for a long time so I decided to show you guys this shirt as well now this shirt is also a large and in terms of price it comes in at around fourteen dollars and ninety cents in the US but the strange thing is here in the Philippines this comes in at the same price as a subcommittee at around five hundred and ninety pesos so I think we're pretty lucky here in the Philippines for that to be the case and I don't really know why that is but I'm pretty happy about it so again this is the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt short sleeve crew neck shirt and the big difference between this and the other shirts are I think what Uniqlo is going with the shirt is they were trying to do sort of a more retro feeling plain shirt and they do that through having this thicker material so the other two are sort of a soft more modern material I guess you could call it a more modern blend making it very soft making making it comfortable but this one purposely gives you a rough texture a heavy material giving you that sort of more more retro feel the shape is also not as form-fitting as the previous two it's a little bit more boxy as you guys can see the sleeves are a little tiny bit longer tiny bit looser so was the body area and again this is a large but it's supposed to fit that way it dropped a little lower in the crotch and yeah it's a little heavier a little rougher but I do like the shirt because it gives you that you know it gives you that retro look it's a completely different look it looks very very relaxed and as you guys know I love wearing cargo shorts and sure it fits the aesthetic really well so if you guys are more laid-back and you like this casual retro look the shirt might be the one for you now even though this shirt is heavier is thicker it's not like the thickest thing in the world and there is a certain level of lightness to it so they could have made this a lot thicker but they didn't which I actually do really really appreciate especially again here in the Philippines with all the heat yeah here's here's how it looks super nice super comfortable and this is one of the shirts that are in my er rotation I actually only have one of these in my current rotation so I'm happy to have another one after purchasing this one so this is nice some of you guys might actually like the shirt more than the other two and I think that's you know not a bad thing it's a great option there you go so that's it guys that is my comparison of the three plain white tee shirts from Uniqlo the package dry shirt the supima cotton tee as well as this the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt if you guys found this helpful if you guys enjoyed the video let me know by giving me a thumbs up and if you guys want to see reviews of more seasonal shirts from Uniqlo leave those in the comment box down below

see you guys super super soon", "3vuQseWRksw": "hi everyone thanks for joining me I'm excited today I have partnered with a dye press and they are a company that has a product that allows you to use sublimation ink or your infusible ink on 100% cotton t-shirts yeah hundred percent cotton t-shirts we're no longer limited by the t-shirts that are available in the infusible ink line or the t-shirts that are available in the sublimation line so now we can use 100% cotton t-shirts that's what I did for this this is a 100% Gildan t-shirt just like you get at Joanns we've all had some of these and look at those results that's 100% cotton t-shirt with sublimation printing this is permanent washable dryable not going to go away this is a permanent design it's not going to crack it's not going to peel you can see if I spread it apart it's part of the fabric it's not laying on top it's not a transfer like an iron-on this is 100% cotton t-shirt with a very permanent result this is in fusible ink on a 100% just a plain old fruit of the line 100% cotton t-shirt in fusible link I used this in fusible link this one 100% cotton shirt you can't feel it this is permanent it's not going to go away you can wash it dry it again permanent I also tried it on a colored shirt now keep in mind anytime you use in fusible link or sublimation ink on a cotton t-shirt it's a translucent ink so the color of the shirt is going to show through but it still worked on this fluorescent pink shirt I got a transfer and you know of course it's colored or kind of changed color by the color of the shirt because it's a translucent ink but this is permanent so we can now use in fusible link on colored t-shirts we can use sublimation ink on colored t-shirts we can use our favorite cotton t-shirts I mean come on the possibilities are endless and I am absolutely thrilled with the results of this product this is the product that are talking about it's called Die Presse this is poly T plus it comes in a concentrated bottle like this you you mix this with water we'll go into all of that in the next part of the video but you use the concentrate you mix it with some water you put it in the spray bottle and you treat the shirt and then you can treat it just like any other iron-on or any other sublimation transfer or confusable ink transfer it does something to the fabric there's something magical in it but it does something in the fabric that allows it to take the ink so this the beauty of this is that you can't feel this it's washable it's dryable not gonna crack not gonna peel it's on there for good and why not I love it so let's get started into the video and I'm going to show you how I made each of these projects so let's take a look at the instructions here so it tells you for one ounce of poly t+ mix it with three ounces of water and that will give you 4 ounces of spray or you could take a quarter cup mix it with 3/4 cup water and that makes eight ounces of spray for this particular spray bottle they've got it right on here I need 2 ounces of the poly T plus 2 6 ounces of water and it's going to make eight ounces of spray so that's what we're going to do it goes on and has more information if you have a bigger or smaller spray bottle or you just want to mix up a little batch so one bottle of this is going to go quite a ways so the first thing it tells me is 2 ounces of poly T plus so let's put two ounces of poly T a plus in here and I have a little funnel just to make sure that I don't make a mess I haven't opened this yet so let's see I don't know if we have to open a tap here yep so we need two ounces of this got a measuring cup here two ounces of poly T plus now we're just going to put that in our spray bottle and it's telling me to add six ounces of purified water so I'm going to fill this up with six ounces there we go so that's it that's all you need I think it's pretty cool that they let you mix it themselves I watched her video and she said why should we why should you as a consumer pay to ship water when you all have water at home so they've made a concentrate which makes the product go much further and saves on shipping cost we're almost there all right we've got six ounces of water so I'm just going to go ahead and turn my spray bottle into mix shake it up and it looks like that so let's make sure we've got it primed must be a oh there's a little stopper right here you just need to turn that to the side to get some bottle to work oh we're already primed so we're good there okay so you can see I have a Gildan 100% cotton t-shirt right here this is 100% cotton now if you want a more vibrant print the more polyester that's in it the better so even if you had a 40% it's going to give you a little bit of a more vibrant result but we're going to go with 100% cotton because I want to see it actually works so I'm just gonna put a towel on my surface just to absorb some of the moisture all right and I have a design that I'm gonna put on the shirt that's this so it's about an 8 and a half by 11 size so I'm just going to use a piece of card stock just to kind of give me a guide and I'm gonna spray the corners just to give me a guide of where I need to spray and we're just going to begin spraying the shirts within that area the white a little bit harder to tell when it's wet I've got it pretty wet she suggests that you use a foam roller I don't have a foam roller but I do have my cricket brayer so I am just going to break it push that moisture down in the shirt and I can see now that blue behind there that I need to add a little bit more spray you want to get it pretty saturated but not sopping wet I'm just gonna push that down into the fabric so we're going to press it for 30 seconds at 330 degrees that's going to dry the poly t+ and it also removes any site and you'll probably see a little bit of steam coming out of the press that's the sizing and that's exactly what we wanted to do so we've got about ten seconds left and then we're going to give it a second coat of the poly T plus I'm just going to do that right on the press according to the directions it does not need to be as heavy of a coat this time so we're just going to take the poly key plus so we're gonna get to see what it looks like on a colored shirt I'm gonna take my roller and just roll it into the shirt place it with my parchment paper and again 330 degrees for 30 seconds now if you have the first version of this product you might have gotten a separate product to remove the sizing this new poly t+ apparently you don't need that it takes care of everything all with one product now this is the second shirt I've done you can see I've only used this much this jar is still full up to here so you can just imagine how many shirts I can do with one bottle of the poly T plus alright we're coming up on 30 seconds for our second press and we're going to open the press now the next step we need the press to be at 385 so I'm going to go ahead and raise the temperature to 385 and it's going to be at 70 seconds so while that is preheating I want to show you what the shirt looks like all right so that's going to heat back up to 385 so here is our shirt so it feels kind of starchy like it's a little bit stiff but the first time you wash the shirt that's going to come out but it as if you would put spray starch on something and then iron it kind of feels like that but it's totally dry and that is the poly coating that's going to make this so that we can sublimate again this is a 100 percent cotton Gildan t-shirt pick this up at Joanns nothing fancy about this whatsoever we're going to try it on a colored t-shirt but I want to show you this one which I look gun I forgot to turn the camera and this is the white Gildan 100% t-shirt that I was just working on and just look how good that transfer came out now again it feels kind of stiff but as soon as you watch this it's going to feel just like the t-shirt because it's now the ink is now in to the fibers of the fabric it's not laying on top so it's going to feel just like a t-shirt once you wash this but that's amazing there's not one ounce of polyester in here and we have a polyester or we have a sublimation shirt so really really believe in this product I'm really interested to see how this pink shirt does now the next step tells us to raise the heat to 385 and then pre-heat for five seconds we no longer need this on here because this has no moisture in it so I don't have to protect the press anymore so I'm just going to put this down back on the press just like it was and as soon as this hits 385 I'm going to replace my parchment paper and press it for five seconds at 385 again all of the instructions are clearly printed out for you so that you can be very successful they've taken the extra initiative and made sure that you have a good experience with this product it's not difficult at all and again she walks you through every step if you want even more instructions this it's included inside there is you can just if you put your camera on your phone on camera setting and just scan this it will open right up to their Facebook group which you can join which is called dye sublimation or you can scan this and it will take you to her YouTube video which again walks you through this step-by-step so that you are successful with this product it is I'm totally totally wild and amazed by the outcome I mean that that is just a plain white t-shirt there's nothing special about that so that means I could now open up sublimation to a whole wider variety of products so for our next design I am going to send a another picture to the Sawgrass printer there we go that should be printing out here in a second and we are almost up to 385 it's at 375 so we're gonna wait just a few more seconds one question that I wanted to address that I keep getting in the YouTube comments and on my other sublimation videos and getting messages on Facebook there seems to be some confusion about the sublimation ink and using a inkjet printer the magic is in the ink it's not in the printer it's in the ink so if you are using an inkjet printer you have to convert it to sublimation ink you can't just use regular inkjet printer some people are under the impression that if you use sublimation paper printed it out with an inkjet that that's what was happening and that's the magics not in the sublimation paper again I'm just using copy paper the magic is in the ink so you need an inkjet printer that can be switched out to sublimation ink if you're going to go that route this is a dedicated sublimation printer by Sawgrass this is my what I prefer to do I didn't want to convert a printer once you convert an inkjet printer you really shouldn't convert it back to ink jet so it's you know you you can't just go back and forth and switch it anytime you want unique because then you would have to clear out all that ink out of the lines so a sublimation ink comes out very dull you're not gonna want to use this for everyday printing plus it's going to be much more expensive so if you're going to use an inkjet printer keep in mind that once you switch it to sublimation ink you're not going to be switching it back and forth again and so you can't use regular inkjet and do this method that nut needs to be sublimation ink all right so we should be up to three eighty five we are we're going to press it for pre-press for five seconds there we go I am going to add my design facedown right on top again this is not a pink shirt so remember when you're doing sublimation on colored shirts it's not that it won't work but your ink is it's a clear ink so if there's not something white or light behind it it's probably not going to show up as well as if you were to put it on a white background so keep in mind that the ink is transparent so when you put it on a color the color is going to show through the color of the garment so we're pressing now for 385 for 70 seconds and again it's all in the instructions you can't go wrong with this process you make sure that you have all the information you need so that you have a great press all right so we're counting down we are at 7 seconds so that parchment paper is no longer any good again I press I printed this on regular copy paper so there you can see what's left and you can see this is just plain copy paper and again this is on a colored t-shirt so it's not going to be as vibrant but still absolutely gorgeous result a gun it's still a little stiff but once the first time we watch this then it's just going to feel like a regular cotton t-shirt here it is on white so you're always going to get a better result on a white or a light-colored t-shirt but I really wanted to put this to the test and see how it looked on a this is live like a fluorescent pink t-shirt I'm not sure how well it's coming through so it's kind of on the medium side as far as a darkness so I've prepped one more shirt with the dye press product and this time we're going to try the cricket in fusible ink I have cut the words be kind out of the infusible ink course it's weird and we're going to try that this is a hundred percent cotton Hanes t-shirt just a plain old t-shirt and we're going to try the cricket and fusible link with the dye press treated cotton t-shirt so let's see how this goes I've already done the two layers of the poly tee I'm gonna go ahead and put the words on we're going to cover it with our parchment paper three eighty five seventy seconds and let's see if cricket infusible ink also works on a cotton t-shirt I enjoy finding new ways to use this cricket and fusible ink I know some people are limited by the fact that you could only get the white or the gray t-shirts now that's not going to be a problem we can use cotton t-shirts in fusible link and get some really unique projects just keep in mind that just like the printer ink this is a translucent ink so the color of the shirt is going to show through the design just like it did on this but if you use a white cotton t-shirt you're going to get the more vibrant result so let's see how I did on a white t-shirt take off my parchment paper wow so here is the transfer after the ink has been lifted and here is your fusible ink on a white t-shirt I don't know if you can see the label but this is just a plain Fruit of the Loom 100% cotton t-shirt and look at that result so let's take a close-up look at some of the shirts that we made today I am so impressed by this product to be honest I thought it would work but I didn't think I would work this well and you really cannot tell that this is not a hundred percent polyester shirt everything is vibrant everything looks amazing and the transfer is solid so very very impressed I hope you guys enjoyed this video and you're enjoying the sublimation series if you did please like subscribe and share click that bell so that you're

on a cotton t-shirt not until now we've got a new product to look at let's have a look at it right now those of you who do transfer printing like I do and vinyls and stuff like that onto 100% cotton t-shirts the reason why we use concierge is because they're basically half the price of sublimation t-shirts for those of you who actually are in the know now we've got a new product here where I can now sublimate or use sublimation to print onto a cotton t-shirt let's check it out Robin I've just got this test batch of a new product that's out and what they do is provide you with a special transfer paper and some special powder which you put through your sublimation printer in this case it's the year Rico print which we are using and you use the sublimation inks on the transfer paper and then you apply a powder over the top which is like a polymer powder and that then gets pressed onto a 100 percent cotton t-shirt and it's supposed to leave the sublimated image permanently fitted onto the t-shirt now I've not used this before so you're using it for the first time with me so let's give it a try I'm going to get our cotton t-shirt now it's basically for white t-shirts and light-colored t-shirts is this a product by the way it's not for dark t-shirts so let's just get a t-shirt now give it a press and then we'll see what happens right so this is the paper and I know if you can see there it's from a company called subway to cotton comm and again this is just a sample sheet here it's a little bit thicker than the normal transfer sublimation paper so what I'm going to do is to open the tray and you place this facedown in your Rico sublimation printer like that I'll turn it on first obviously and I've just pulled up a color print here of an image it's Lightning McQueen me grandson loves that I'm not going to sell this this is purely to get a good sale good the color definition is in this so I've never tried this before once it prints out the image what you have to do then is to lay the image on a tray and then you sprinkle this polymer powder over the top of it which again I've only got a little sort of bagful here so we plan to do that and cover the ink up that as it comes out of the printer it's obviously still wet and sprinkle that over until all the inks come and then we can actually press the air t-shirt with 100% cotton t-shirt so let's give that a go now and again all I've done is pull up a graphic here of a lightning McQueen cars and the image should come out here wet right as we can see it started to come out now so I'm going to bring the image black straight down in the tray like that and I'm just going to get this white powder now I'm just empty it onto the tray I'm not going to you gotta be careful not to smudge this as well apparently so I'm just going to put the whole lot on for the moment and I'm just going to swish it all about so again I've never done this before so you have to bear with me on this so I'm just going to sort of just try get it all over the top of the image this is all brand new to me and just make sure literally that the whole of the image is covered which I can see there that it is there you go so now we've done there I'm just going to pick the paper up carefully dust it off like that as I say there's no cutting around the shapes either so as you can see here it's just literally just drop it all off and I can see there that everything is actually covered and there's only this residue which is actually just stuck to the image itself I'll just lay that there for a second I've already pre pressed our t-shirt as you know what we always do there and as I say the temperature which I'm pressing it here is 180 degrees and I'm going to be doing that for 30 seconds now you've also got to be careful that when you put this down face down that you don't move it about so you want to be in the correct position really right from the beginning so I'm just going to place that down there like that and cover up with me cover sheet as you can see there now don't forget this is a hundred percent cotton t-shirt which normally you cannot sublimate - so let's just press that down there and we're going to be counting down for 30 seconds now so I've never used this before myself it might seem a bit of a faff but again it's a learning curve and it could be a way of producing I mean the biggest thing about sublimation t-shirts are they normally double the price of these cotton t-shirts right here we go so I'm just going to take it off like that we've had it under for 30 seconds I don't know what it's going to do what it's going to look like and I'm just going to pull this straight off and this is a set view is 100% cotton t-shirt using sublimation inks now look at that first of all I'm going to say to you but then colors are absolutely fantastic look at this look how about that can you see how vivid that is and there's no seams or anything whatsoever there now that looks really nice I'm very surprised by that and look at the depth of the colors as well I'm sure you can see there and as I say this isn't a transfer this is sublimation ink on our Gildan t-shirts which as you can probably see on the sign they're 100% cotton using sublimation inks how about that well all I can say is really that that's erm that's really surprised me I'm a little bit taken aback by that to be honest with you I've never used this before I've heard of the product as I say but this is in the UK at the moment I don't know if you've got it in any of the other countries at the moment I think this the price of these as compared to the normal sublimation or transfer papers I think it's about double the price at the moment but apparently the manufacturers are trying to work to get the price down so it can compete favorably with the the transfer paper market and also you know you'll be saving because these t-shirts are literally dirt cheap as well so I'm think you'll find there's no you can fill a surface there obviously but it's like a polymer surface which you get with any sort of printed surface but that ink is been taken by the polymer power that which is obviously sunk into the actual world garment as well so that's why it's actually part of the garment as well there so well there you go that's a new one on me and if you probably see I'm trying to stretch it there look can you see it's actually stretching because it's actually part of the garment as well there we go look there's no sign of any sort of degradation when you stretch it and well please wait I think I turned that lovely and look at the vivid colors as I've said before well that's just something to looking out for and that is from a company called sublet ooh cotton limited a brand new product here in the UK although I have heard of it before maybe in different guises and it is a polymer powder to be used on top of your sublimation ink with your sublimation printer so that you can actually print on 100% cotton t-shirts there you go I hope that was of some interest to you it will be to me because I'll be running it through to watch many many times and we'll update you obviously somewhere further down the line in a different video there you go hope you enjoyed this one thanks very much for watching don't forget to subscribe to my channel share my videos and we'll see you again in the next video till then bye for now you you", "ZgOX2AjzYZs": "what's going on guys in this video I'm gonna tell you the best cheapest and easiest way to make t-shirts and that sublimation printing on cotton let's not waste any time and get right into it so the first thing you guys will use an epson double you have 7710 printer this printer can easily be converted to a sublimation printer you guys will need the sublimation ink cartridges and sublimation ink and you guys don't need sublimation paper make sure you guys install the sublimation ink cartridges this is not gonna work on regular ink we're gonna go on a website called gypsy shirts and by our 100% cotton t-shirts here you'll need sublimation spray this is basically liquid polyester you can get these cheap on etsy so the first thing to do is mirror image with image image rotation click horizontally and they're gonna print image so the good thing about this printer is that it can fit 11 by 17 paper this is a large paper and is the perfect size to make t-shirts so when the sublimation paper is printed on the colors are not gonna be bright don't worry about this when this transfer onto the shirt is only perfect so the first thing we're gonna do is preheat the shirt after that's done we're gonna spray the show with the sublimation spray I'm gonna let it dry for around 20 minutes make sure you guys spray the entire area where the image is and if you transfer also don't worry about spraying outside of that area anything that sprayed outside is now going to be visible when the shirt is done next one alignment to the t-shirt to make sure it's straight you guys can tape it if you want just make sure the tape is not go on the heat press we're gonna place the image onto the heat press we wanna put the silicone paper on the heat press and we're gonna press it at 350 degrees for no less than one a minute also make sure you guys add a decent amount of pressure will present with sublimation you guys have to press it for at least a minute because if you don't the full image is not going to be transferred and it's going to look Peyton if you want a bright vivid image you have to press for at least a minute now we're gonna move the silicon paper remove the sublimation paper and our shirt is finished take a look at how bright and perfect and vivid the shirt came out so because the shirt is seldom mated the colors will never wash out so this shirt costs around $1 80 cents to make if you guys want to slow show it's online in my opinion this is the best way to do it you guys can easily sell these for over $10 also make sure you guys have Ward the Amazon sublimation sprays these are complete garbage the image quality is gonna be horrible and also this fray when it's dried out is gonna make the image surface hard so definitely make sure you guys award these another thing you guys should avoid is these sublimation powders the whole process is super messy and the end result is garbage also it's a hustle because even though the powder is cheap you guys cannot sublimate on regular sublimation paper you will have to buy special silicone paper otherwise it's not gonna work and these silicone papers for 11 by 17 they cost around $4 per sheet so again if you guys want high-quality results use the Etsy sublimation sprays and you're good to go I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did please hit the like

in this video I'm going to be reviewing Yoona clothes two people cotton t-shirts stay tuned so you know clothes - pima cotton t-shirts have a bit of reputation in the menswear community in fact any discussion around you know the best t-shirts for men is sure to include this highly regarded tee and some men swear by them while others just don't really understand the hype I bought four pairs of Yoona clothes supima cotton tees and so you know you kind of know where I stand in that camp but we got grey we got heather gray white and navy even with all the high praise nothing is perfect and so let's dive right in with this Uniqlo supima cotton tea review in this review i'm going to cover the t-shirts of style and fit shirt quality comfort and durability how well they've held up over several years of wear you know the pros and cons and as always if you want a deeper dive head on over to gentlemen within i'm gonna link that down below and then you can read more about it cuz it just showed I own four unit clothes - pima cotton tees for reference I've had the white and navy shirt for around four years now and the two grey shirts for about two years so exactly what is pima cotton well it's a type of cotton that's actually grown and sourced in the United States it represents less than 1% of cotton grown in the world and it's a unique sort of cotton due to the extra long fibers that contribute to its premium properties of strength softness and color retention the facts pima cotton is lighter and 45% stronger than regular cotton and it provides superior comfort durability and softness for the shirts style you know clothes pima tees are as clean and minimal as a shirt it's going to get it has zero branding no logos on it except for on the back tag where it's printed you know where it's made in the Uniqlo logo they come in all the basic neutrals of white gray Navy and black all in all you're going to find 14 different colorways but the wide ranging shades from olive green and yellow to red and cobalt blue there's no shortage of options to choose from here in terms of the shirts of fit you know I've said it before and I'll say it again Uniqlo the pima cotton t-shirts are some of the best of fitting t-shirts that i period they're fitted without being skin tight and have an overall clean drape the body length is spot-on hitting around mid fly and the sleeve length is also perfect landing around mid bicep the sleeves also hug my biceps just the right amount without being restricting I can't say it enough but Uniqlo supima cotton tees were actually the first t-shirt to actually fit me pretty impeccably off the rack before discovering them you know I was wearing these cheap-ass H&M tees for like $5 and the sleeves way too short and so they were always riding up and then you can see my armpit hairs and when I put them through washes the fabric just kind of got all distorted and it just did not hold up over time and so when it comes to the fit of these shirts I can't speak more highly of them some of the product details that actually comes in double x-small all the way up to triple XL and so you know there's a wide range of sizes here however they don't carry any tall sizes so if you're a really tall guy you know over six-foot some you might have some trouble with you know clothes shirts which is you know something I encountered when I was you know doing some research on forums a lot of guys on reddit some male fashion advice the taller guys were saying that the fit just you know wasn't there for the product details Uniqlo says that it's you know hundred percent supima cotton and it has a glossy Sheen with a premium feel there really is no glossy Sheen this shirt is not shiny at all however it does have a premium feel under percent supima cotton and these shirts are made in Vietnam not us which is kind of weird because supima cotton is sourced in the US so I'm not sure you know what's happening there now let's dive right in with the shirts Comfort so Uniqlo supima cotton tees are really soft and they actually get softer and softer after every wash it's a nice mid weight cotton and it is not see-through by any means you know comparatively it's not as thick as you know Banana Republic pima cotton t-shirts or ask it but it's thicker than brands like Express ever Lane and even the mountain bowed rigs t-shirts that I reviewed in you know my best t-shirts roundup in terms of where the shirts have been through dozens upon dozens of wears over the years I can tell you that they've held up supremely well they've gotten softer over time as I mentioned before and you know there are no holes in the shirts so that goes to show you that even a ten dollar t-shirt can withstand the test of time and get better over time and so price isn't always going to be a factor when it comes to finding quality comfort we're just gonna get right into the durability of the shirts had them for a couple of years now plenty of washes as I said before and the shirts have no holes in them they're not weirdly distorted or warped through many washes the shirts still have a clean drape and a nice fitted aesthetic I would say that the durability of these shirts are really good and they've held up really well over the years but it's not all perfect though and assurance actually do fake considerably over time especially the colored shirts and so my Navy shirt I would say more saturated colors are gonna fade over time with washes and dry cycles so the Navy is not as saturated as it was before that's going to knock it down a few rounds all in all though Uniqlo Supima cotton tees have proven to be immensely durable over the years where you can buy them you can shop online at Uniqlo comm or you can hop into one of their brick-and-mortar locations they have locations all across the US and so you know if you have one near you go in get fitted and see how the Uniqlo supima tees fit on your body all right so let's finish it up with some of the pros and cons for the pros best bang for your buck at 990 a shirt crafted with long-lasting high-quality supima cotton one of the best fitting t-shirts that I own period classic crew neck and v-necks in a myriad of colorways can conveniently shop online or in-store for the cons not the best for tall guys you know no long sizes and color shirts they're gonna fade quite a bit over time and it may be too sheer for some people it's not really thick material here if you have any brands that you feel are a better value you know leave some comments down below and let me know but yeah in the end Uniqlo supima cotton tees have a reputation for a reason with a price point of $10.00 and high-quality long-lasting product Uniqlo supima cotton tees are really hard to ignore and so it's definitely one of those staple pieces in my wardrobe by under $10 it's hardly an investment piece and so feel free to go crazy there with all the colorways

you're new and if you are already a dreamer welcome back welcome back welcome back okay y'all i'm geek today i'm excited today i am going to be using this poly acrylic i'm going to be using this some good old h2o and i'm going to be sublimating on a hundred percent cotton shirt so i'm gonna do two i'm gonna do gold because i'm feeling bold and i'm gonna do white you see this white so these are just your classic gildings i don't know about this when it's a heavy cotton these are classic guildens 100 gildan excuse me 100 cotton shirts both of them are 100 percent content now both 100 content and we're just gonna see and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna show you the image that i'm gonna use but i'm excited so what we're gonna do is we're going to use um this is spray bottle i got from the dollar store gonna use eight ounces of water and we're gonna use two tablespoons of this poly acrylic okay so the finish i'm doing is clear satin they have matte they have a bunch of different ones but this is the one i'm using so we gonna see how this one go okay okay so this is the image that i'm going to be using and now i just want to see how i want it on the shirt um the shirt is gonna be a medium shirt i typically really wear i could wear a medium large or extra large depending on how i want the shirt to fit i just grabbed a medium that was the first one i chose so i'm trying to figure out i think i'm going to duplicate it just in case i mess up i'll have the original copy right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to stretch it out a little bit i'ma see if i could do it because i like the page flip this way but i'm gonna see if i could stretch the image out a little bit just so i can wear it the way i want okay so right now we're just playing with the size so that's something you always want to be sure of when you're creating things how it's going to look on the shirt so remember the area that i spray you want to make sure you can actually see the image right so i'm letting it air dry then i'm probably going to just blow dry it to make sure it's all the way dry and soft and not like hard because if it air dry it'll probably be hard so i could throw it in dryer or blow dry it whatever i'll probably just blow dry because i don't feel like going down there so i mean i'm just keeping it real y'all know that's what i do so i'll make sure that i have enough of the image um so it can be this way yes i'm just doing like this now a few things this neon which i'll talk about later when i print it out it's not going to be neon because i don't have neon ink sublimation ink they do have it i just don't have any so it's going to that green is not it's probably gonna come out looking like this down here green okay so i do know that so i want the colors to pop but i know neon won't show because i don't have the colors to mix to make that so it'll be a different variation of it so i'm going to go ahead and send this to my epson workforce 7720 um and i'm going to do two of them because remember i'm doing it um i'm a print twice because i'm doing it on my um the gold shirt too just because i got to be fancy i don't know i just said i wanted to try it just to see how it would stick on that one too so we are going to y'all know i have presets already my popping colors i'm doing this in cassette 2 because that's where my larger paper is i'm printing two copies and yeah so that's the image we're gonna print it out i'm gonna come back once it's printed out and dry and we gonna get this thing popping ten all right stay tuned okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put one tablespoon in first then i'm going to put the eight ounces of water then i'm going to put the second tablespoon okay then i'm going to close it up and ignore that that's just my makeup and then i'm going to make sure it's closed and i'm going to shake it up shake it up shake it up shake it and that's literally all you have to do make sure this is closed clean everything up shake it up a little bit and that's that ready to go okay y'all so guess what i have put my um shirt up under the heater sounds like maybe while i'm recording the um other portion that it'll help dry a little bit it completely dry so if this will completely dry now i will say it's not soft like if i put in a dryer like i literally can feel where the poly is which actually is a good thing because now i know where i can lay my image so my first picture came out this is the asap paper today this is what we'll be using is asap today and this is the image it came out so good look at that that looks amazing right so and actually that neon remember i said it was ago it looked a little bit yeah so show me so anywho this image came out looking so good this is uh so i'm going to um dry the yellow shirt but we might as well go ahead and do this so let's do this one first so i'm about to go ahead and do it it's on 400 degrees 60 seconds if you missed it you can rewind it but i have poly acrylic i put two tablespoons um and eight ounces of water here i was safe i had my gloves so the shirt is dry it's completely completely dry this is that can you hear this so you can hear it so it's completely dry i'm going to go ahead and um uh put it under heat press for a couple seconds i'm so excited y'all then i'm gonna do it and see how it turned out then we still gonna do the gold one but we gonna do this one since we're here so let me go ahead and set this up and move in move you guys in closer all right y'all let's see how this turned out this is my first oh snaps oh my goodness oh my goodness now i just threw it on there y'all saw that look oh yo i'm so good look at that and this is 100 cotton shut the noise oh my god are so good oh mine turned out so good look at this y'all stop playing with me shut up this this image i just found on google too i literally just found this on google okay so let's rewind what i did yo i'm tsugi okay let's rewind [Music] poly acrylic mine was clean satin i got this from lowe's eight ounces of water two tablespoons of poly acrylic and then i put this under the heat press so i actually laid it up under the heat press while i was doing the other portion i think it was like maybe six minutes not even 10 i don't think it dried it completely and then y'all i'm sorry i have my sucker y'all know i always be whatever and then look at this so i'm gonna do a wash test i'm not gonna do it today but i'm gonna do a wash test so we can see what happens but we gonna do that gold but baby we gotta just let's take a minute to just admire this real quick i might put this on today so it was a success if you want to do this for just like a day for an event let's say you're doing a walk let's say you have something you want to use um as far as being toxic i did hear that because it's only two tablespoons and diluted in eight ounces of water and then we shake it up it's not a whole lot of the poly acrylic that's in here it's diluted with eight ounces of water right so it's two tablespoons eight ounces of water we shake it up so it's not like it's really harsh or toxic um do this on your own wrist i don't have anything you know i'm not a dermatologist or a doctor or anything like that so i'm not saying that you would do it i feel comfortable enough to do it for myself so you don't try this at home that's my disclaimer but for me because i didn't use that much i would feel comfortable putting it on myself even if i just had a undershirt or something on under here to make myself feel better but yeah so we gonna try this gold out so i'll be back oh why the gold is getting dry real quick guess what it's not hard no more so it feel it make a little bit it's not hard like how it was i don't know if the heat did something to it but it feels feels good it's not like crisp or crunchy or anything like that y'all okay we're gonna let that finish dry i'll be back all right i'm back yes i'm getting yes i did put it on excuse i got some makeup on there so excuse that that's just the makeup but 100 cotton size medium image from google shout out to whoever was the artist makeup by me messing up my list whatever so now we're just going to see this this might be a fail let's just prepare ourselves this one might not work but it's okay because this one did okay so we're just gonna see all right and you do want to put um butcher paper in the middle of it i ain't doing it for right for right now because i'm just not but you do want to put so anytime you sublimate you want to put butcher paper in between the images on top of it to protect everything this just for the for myself my i'm not doing it right now um i just ordered some more butcher paper actually from amazon and it just came in the mail today

ain't i really mean that", "Sp3X-tvG7dU": "this is jocko podcast number 272 with echo charles and me jocko willink good evening echo good evening so when i worked with seal leaders and and then on top of that interacted with leaders from the army and from the marine corps sometimes things went great and sometimes they didn't and if there was a problem between leaders between leaders between people between troops 99 of the time when i would pull the thread on that problem at the end of that thread would be ego you'd find it all the time i'd find it all the time and when i retired from the navy and i started working with leadership in civilian companies no shock i found the same thing when when leaders can't get along when when they can't find a solution when they can't even move forward despite having a common goal when i'm working with companies and i pull the thread on that problem i find the same thing i find ego and egotistical leaders scream and they yell and they get emotional and they would rather lose they would rather lose than admit that they're wrong they would actually rather die in some cases than admit that they're wrong and and if you think that that's an exaggeration history is full of leaders military leaders that died clinging to their plan even in the face of their own death or worse the deaths of their troops all because of their ego now look of course it's a dichotomy we know that not all ego is bad you need ego to push you and drive you and make you want to win and that's great but over inflated ego is the root of a vast majority of problems that people and leaders face and as i look at the divisiveness in america right now the people that are screaming from the extreme ends of the political spectrum when i listen to what they're saying and why they're saying it i try and figure out where this is coming from when i pull the thread on all that screaming and all that anger yes once again i find ego because if you if you think you're right about everything if you think that you're right about everything that means everybody else is wrong and if you think that you know everything then that means no one else can know anything and if your ego is so big and you think you're so smart why would you even have to listen to anybody else because you already have it figured out why not just scream at them to shut up and you gotta watch out especially when if if if someone is saying something that actually makes some kind of sense and it hurt your ego then just scream louder and when i look around and i see people that are screaming and not listening that's what i see i see ego and sometimes it's driven by insecurity insecurity that they think there might be wrong and so then again what do they do they just scream louder don't let anyone else talk shut them up that's what the ego does that being said there are people out there today many of whom are humble people that do listen people that can have an interactive conversational exchange with someone else that might have opposing viewpoints and they're confident enough in themselves to actually listen and discuss and compromise and change their minds and learn and grow and understand and empathize and those types of people well they make good neighbors they make good soldiers they make good friends they make good human beings and they make good leaders and i'm lucky enough to have one of those people here with us tonight a soldier a martial artist a surfer a former congresswoman a hawaiian and an american you might have figured it out tulsi gabbard tulsi thanks for joining us aloha the last time we were together was on joe rogan's podcast yes that was fun when was that i think that was sometime in 2019 were you running yet i was yeah i was crazy yeah and um yeah it's been a wild ride it's been cool um well it's been cool for me to watch i know it's not always been cool i'm thinking like i don't know if cool is the word i would use it's always cool for me to look at someone that's like trying to make something happen and coming up against all kinds of obstacles and still striving forward and pushing forward so from that perspective it's been cool um so let's let's kind of like um i always like to start from the beginning it's kind of what i like to do so i have a better context and understanding of where someone ends up because we know more about where they came from yeah so let's talk about where you came from how did you end up here today it started off where american samoa american samoa is where i was born um i am the did you just suddenly correctly [Music] yeah it's i don't it's just a fact right i feel very comfortable speaking i mean obviously i speak all the time but words that i don't know how to say i just do my best and move on and i i will cover books i've got french words and german names and what i just run into total things that i i just don't know how to say them and so what i do is i just do my best and move on and i think i get a certain level of forgiveness from people completely i do get tightened up from time to time if i really make something awful but yeah i guess you have to forgive me a little bit because i just kind of say what i what it looks like to me phonetically and move on no no judgment whatsoever i however would get in trouble if i am not yeah pronouncing my homeland properly if you say samoa though like samoa samoan that that's more like forgivable right now totally like yeah it's not that's like the proper way that's like you use the proper way yeah but if you don't it's kind of like okay it's it's way more forgivable with someone yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so it's not a major violation not at all it's not it's actually not a violation right no like really it's not it doesn't like it's literally it's only people from samoa who say is it insulting that i would say samoa yeah that's a good question a little bit no okay so we're good either way yeah you're good either way all right well when i went to guam there was people from samoa there and we hung out most good people nice all right so how do you feel everywhere so um my mom was born in indiana grew up in michigan uh dad born in uh born in samoa um my grandfather was in the air force and so he was born there but he spent the first years of his life in hawaii my grandfather was stationed at hickam and then um you know moved around a few other places but ended up growing up in the panhandle of florida so so wait so your grandfather was in the in the air force yeah both both of my grandfathers on my mom's side and my dad's side served uh served in the military that must have been around world war ii it was yeah um so my mom's dad served in i believe he served in europe i don't know exactly where and then but but for a shorter stint that he didn't spend a career in the military but my dad's dad did spend his career uh in the military and at different times served i think he was in the army for a little while then he was in the army air corps then he ended up in the air force and um so they both had completely different upbringings uh you know my mom grew up in east grand rapids michigan which was during that time a very kind of well-to-do area in her school there were no there were no non-white people and so you know she grew up she's a cheerleader she was this she kind of had the all-american upbringing so she's a white person too she is a white person holly as we say in hawaii which which you know little digression here people say haole is a derogatory word but all depends on how you use it yeah it can go it can go either way that's sort of like and it can be it's it can be referred to as an attitude like i don't care what your skin color is it can be used in a derogatory yeah or it can just be like okay you happen to be caucasian and howly but yeah so yes my mom is holly um based on her skin color and uh and yeah my dad polynesian grew up grew up essentially in the south and um it was so stark their upbringings and and to hear both of them tell stories about it because you know my dad's going to elementary school and he he's told me how like the teacher asked asking all the kids okay where are you from and he raised his hand he's like i'm from samoa and she said what somalia are you from africa he's like no no no samoa it's you know and that that was it like all the kids started making fun of him he's the only kid with brown skin skin in the class and uh you know would go out go out in town and and and get called get called the n-word get scolded out of you know the men's bathroom and told you gotta go use the colored bathroom um you know there's no water fountain you gotta go use the hose in the back because the water fountain is for whites only and and so as he was so confused coming from samoa and then hawaii and he's like i mean i'm not i'm not black i'm like he he was it was it was at a young age this kind of being confronted with racism obviously but also just confusion on his part and that that kind of was the uh made a huge a huge impact in his in his formative years in life and um so fast forward he's going to college in california mom's going to university of michigan they both had summer jobs at yosemite and which is how they met and uh that was you know what year that was that would have been in the 60s and maybe they know tilt one of our one of our frequent podcast guests john striker meyer who ended up being a green beret sog guy in vietnam before he went in the army he he went out to yosemite and worked there in the summer is he the guy who um has come with some of the vietnamese yes yeah okay that's cool that's cool those are amazing oh my god i love those hearing from those guys out of this world so they're working so they meet they're so they're working at a cafe in yosemite dad's checking mom out and um asked her out and she's like okay like let's go she's like do you play tennis he's like yeah he didn't play tennis at all she's like okay cool let's go play as their first date so they went out in the tennis court she beat him six love six love for the non-tennis players that means zero he got zero points but i think the key word was actually love i could see where this is going love and what became uh a very healthy competition he he then later on went and became a actual tennis pro um and they've been married now almost i think 53 years and still play tennis almost every day together that's awesome um but that was how that was how mike and carol gabbard began and uh the first i think one of the yeah i think the first time um he went to visit my mom in michigan after they were they were going out for a little while um and my mom i think actually i think they were going out for a little while and my mom had decided like she wanted to marry this guy and told my grandma and my dad happened to be in the garage about to walk in the door and started over here this conversation inside the house and um heard my grandmother's response to my mom saying carol but he's not even white how can you marry him and uh dad was a little taken aback and turned around and went back and got in the car and went went and took a little bit of time um but it was just a reflection of the complete stark differences and where they were from and you know their views of the world and you know obviously they fell in love with my dad and uh um it was uh yeah uh bringing together of two different people two different backgrounds and and ultimately you know my dad took her uh away from the mainland and and to to samoa where they both went as teachers they both got jobs as teachers there my mom was doing um she's a speech therapist so helping kids who had different kind of speech issues and dad became i think the assistant dean of the community college there he was an english major and so they the three there's five kids in our family and the three middle kids uh were all born there and then we moved to hawaii when i was two years old so hawaii's been home for me ever since did you get to hawaii and i mean you're what's what's it like when you get there what like what are your memories of growing up in hawaii what were your formative memories so was one of my earliest memories so so i'm four of five so my little sister was his baby of the family and she was she was born in hawaii and um she basically she came a little sooner than expected and so my dad delivered her at home quickly and i watched that happen that was that was a big strong dose of reality and you know i'm i'm three years old at the time can you remember it i have i i vaguely remember remember pretty much i i don't remember like i can't visualize it but i do remember being somewhat traumatized by it yeah well the story goes that like my babysitter who was there also that that after witnessing that um i told her like i never ever want to do that but um yeah so uh we we moved around grew up on the island of oahu what was your parents doing for work there they were teachers um they were teachers there um they had started kind of a small a small private school that we went to and then um and then they ended up the school had to close down for for one reason or another um but then anyway they ended up teaching us we were homeschooled and they ended up teaching us and a bunch of other kind of kids in the neighborhood at home and then they they're they're entrepreneurs at heart they've always been even back in samoa they were teaching but they had uh mike's ten mike sports shop they had his little sports shop and so they've always had some kind of side gig happening and always different ideas for new businesses and and eventually they opened a kind of family-style deli restaurant healthy healthy eating so they they've done a lot of different things in their lives and um it's always been uh family family affairs everything that's going on you did you have involvement were you making sandwiches down at the deli i'm the one i get to take credit for coming up with the name of the restaurant it was called the natural deli and we i remember us sitting around the family living room and having a brainstorm session and we're all we are all quite competitive uh and the the deal was whoever get whoever comes up with the name of the restaurant gets one free dinner at the restaurant apparently you're competitive but not a great negotiator exactly completely i had no idea i felt very victorious in my my of my win however had no idea that we would pretty much be eating there every day and so how long were you in this homeschool before it was cool scenario i um all the way through high school really yeah yep and uh it was so there's a five-year gap between me and my closest brother the three boys are about two years apart and then the there's there's there's a story that my dad loves to tell which is that after the three boys my mom was like that's it i'm done um she got her tubes tied she was seriously done it was she wasn't just saying it this is in samoa like way back when where the hospital today is still probably about you know 20 years behind modern medicine so um so i took my dad a few years but he finally convinced her to to uh have more kids so she went to the hospital in samoa she's like okay gotta undo what i did here and it worked and so my sister and i came along and and that so there's a five-year gap between us and every birthday for me and my sister he's like girls you better thank me you wouldn't be here without me and your mom your mom too but what were you thinking of when you were when you're going to high school what are you thinking of doing with your life um i didn't have i didn't have a specific profession in mind or career path or anything i did understand and realize from a really young age even before high school that um i think i think two big two big things number one was that i was happiest when i was um when i was doing things for other people so you know we go out and we do like beach cleanups and and you know growing up in hawaii's i love the ocean i literally like i learned how to swim at ala moana beach you know in in the in the shore there and and um just just loved our home and and from a really young age had a really deep appreciation and a kind of a sense of being a protector for our home and so you know we we'd go out and and um you know do beach cleanups and do other things and i just i just felt happiest when i was doing things for others when i when i could be of service and um understood and realized from a young age that that's what i wanted to do and and really in a deeper spiritual way understanding that i was happiest when being of service to god and what better way to be of service to god than to care for and to serve god's children and and this this planet so that was something that i knew in a decision i made very early on but what exactly that would look like how you know what path that would take i had i had no no idea but i also knew and i i distinctly remember i was probably 11 or 12 and i felt this reality that i didn't know how much time i would have in this life and that death was something that could come at any time and i knew that i wanted to and needed to make the most of my life and the time that i had and understanding how precious that was was there anything that triggered that did you lose a family member did you see a fish die on the beach or something like that or was it just something that came from i mean it came it came from um there was no kind of external trigger um i think it really came from spending time in prayer and meditation frankly um because i mean this this was something this was something that you know god has been the center of i mean it's the center of my parents marriage and it's not not in a sectarian way at all just understanding hey real religion is love for god and however you choose to worship at home or a church or a temple or a mosque or whatever however you choose to develop that relationship with god that your happiest that is where you can find peace and shelter and happiness and and um that that i think is the foundation that allowed me at a young age to realize that truth and not in a way that like oh my god i'm so scared i'm gonna like i could die tomorrow not not not in a fear-filled way at all but rather just a sense of understanding the truth um that is not only you know we have no control over when our time will come and uh therefore surrender that surrender to that and surrender to knowing that hey my my life is ultimately in god's hands and also knowing that the death of this physical body does not mean the death of me the soul within the body and therefore understanding that being free from the fear of death but understanding also how precious this this life is and [Music] wanting to do my best to make sure that i didn't waste waste it well it's amazing you and i can actually even have a conversation as two human beings because if you're talking about when you were 10 or 11 years old and you're thinking about what you were thinking about when you were 10 or 11 years old first of all i did i didn't think i could be killed and that lasted until my mid-30s i think and then on top of that like um you're talking about serving people and helping people and i more than anything just wanted a machine gun did you so were you you mentioned that that religion was part of your life what what you know what religion did you get obviously that must have come from home because you were homeschooled so it was your parents what sort of religious view did you all have what was it it was it was the i think the deepest um truest meaning of religion itself which is is that real religion is is love cultivating a loving relation personal loving relationship with god and so the backdrop on that which is um i appreciate so much not having not not understanding kind of what is sectarianism um as as a as a kid growing up at all my mom grew up in a methodist family my dad grew up in a catholic family um my dad went to seminary for a while he thought he wanted to become a priest and and both in their own ways um ended up coming to a point separately and then later together in um wanting more than they were getting from the religious or spiritual practice that they had that they had grown up with and like for my dad he's told me how um in the seminary when he went you know as a kid he had grown up memorizing a verse i think or a prayer that said something like in order to be happy one must know love and serve god and so as a kid he's thinking okay know love and serve god in order to love like the first step of that is you have to know god how can i know god so that i can love and serve him and he asked one of the the priests at the seminary that question like where can i where and how can i know more about god and um the priest kind of patted him on the head and he said you know this is a mystery my my child this is a mystery and so for my dad who's like well i don't like that doesn't compute how do you how do you love someone if you can't know who they are and so he like even as i don't know he was a teenager i think at the time and that that kind of planted the seed of that hunger for more knowledge and that more uh you know having the depth of that personal um relationship with god and and ultimately um they both found their ways again through different paths to um looking at you know eastern spiritual practices and meditation and and found um scriptures and teachings um based in uh the vedic scriptures which come out of india and hinduism but that are also not sectarian like you don't convert into hinduism or you don't convert out of it they're timeless kind of universal spiritual teachings of bhakti yoga something called bhakti yoga and karma yoga bhakti yoga being a spiritual practice in seeking to live your life in in loving service to god and karma yoga if people are familiar with the word karma which really means action and karma yoga meaning um doing your best to take actions that have a positive impact to be of service to others and so those those are the spiritual practices that that i have in my life um and that i was introduced to from from a really young age so it's not it to answer this is a very long answer to your question but it's not about like it wasn't like we at you know we went to bed my mom would say the lord's prayer and read stories about you know krishna from the bhagavad-gita and you know we'd watch jesus of nazareth like 1600 times because that was one of the few movies we were allowed to watch as kids growing up and um you know celebrate celebrate um uh celebrations like john lost me which is which is the the celebration of the appearance of krishna in this world over 5000 years ago and celebrate christmas and set up the nativity scene and sing christmas carols and there was never ever any any sense of uh contradiction or having to choose one or the other you know we go to mass with my grandmother when she came to town and go to and and there was no contradiction because frankly when you get right to the heart of it once you get past all the all of the unfortunate um like bureaucracy and divisiveness that that exists too often that create conflict amongst people of different spiritual practices you just get to the heart of it what is it it is about loving god and whether you call god krishna or allah or jehovah god has many names there's one god he has many names and it doesn't matter none of that none of none of the the superficial matters if in your heart you're doing your best to love god and to serve him and so that's that that i'm grateful to have been able to realize myself from from a relatively young age and knew that that is how i wanted to live my life so how did you end up with so so you have this really kind of heavy spiritual background what what where were you grounded to like interacting with other kids who were jerks and you know it seems like you could be sort of a a little bit sheltered in this world i could be totally wrong but it seems like if that's the way you're raised and all of a sudden you know you go down to the market and someone says you know get out of my way you you know you little brat or whatever how do you what was the what was how did the rest of how did you interact with the rest of the world when you were in this stage of yeah you know we weren't i i we weren't we weren't sheltered or kind of closed off we had a lot of you know there's a lot of kids in the neighborhood and um we we you know oftentimes like my mom was the head cook at the restaurant and so she'd go in at like two in the morning to start cooking we'd go in with my my sister and i'd go with my dad a little later on we do school in the office with him and then spend the rest of the day like either wiping tables or hanging out with customers and just talking story and and um like that that was a little bit of a second home for us you know did gymnastics did martial arts did did all the things and um you know there was no there was no um i don't know separation or anything like that yeah no so it sounds like there was balance and oh yeah or you know working at a restaurant that's what i should have put that together because when you're working at a restaurant you got customers you got people people that are happy people that are sad people that are mad people are going to tell you to you know go screw yourself and that your sandwich sucked and people that are like oh this is wonderful you get all those people yeah so you learn a lot about the world and so that's a good that's a good balance very much so very much so so sports you just mentioned kind of like no big deal martial arts gymnastics how into you were how into you were all how into all of that were you very much so um i loved i loved gymnastics until i started to suck cause i got really like too big and i think i started to grow um and then i i transitioned i was i was definitely more of i you know tried ballet as a little girl too and me and ballet didn't jive so well so uh my sister was definitely more of like the the the the ballerina type and i don't know i just it was not not so much my my flavor so um i i definitely gravitated towards martial arts and earliest did taekwondo and started learning tai chi and um chan and filipino stick fighting arnis and so got got introduced to a lot of different types of martial arts and i was that kid that was told like okay if you want to like toughen yourself up you need to go across the street to the park and kick a tree trunk over and over it's like sweet awesome i was the kid that and maybe echo can relate i'd never liked wearing shoes and would purposely like we'd go hiking up a mountain and i'd be like shoes shoes are for weak people i need to make my feet tough cause i don't want howly feet so that was that was kind of me growing up and and maybe you know having three older brothers who who had a lot of fun making me and my sister do really stupid uh tortures a strong word but you know we'll call them challenges yeah let's call them challenges challenges that really had no good outcome one way or the other for for us other than being tough yes other than being tough uh have you been to yosemite i have not i forget which hike it was but you know my son was the same way like no shoes ever and we hiked one of the legit hikes at yosemite just a day hike but you know many thousands of feet of altitude and many miles of walking and he did it bare feet barefoot and people were walking by him and they're just disturbed they're looking at me like [Music] it was literally no factor for him yeah i mean a zero factor because the kid would never wear shoes ever so that and you know the kid's got tough feet he can sprint on just gravel yeah you know are your feet still tough probably not as tough just because you know you like have to wear like a suit and heels and all those things for work that was an adjustment now your feet are weak i know i have work to do where was this by the way what part of oahu did you grow up with so my sister was born in wahiawa and um that's where we lived then but most of my childhood was um in kalihi valley and and then later later was like downtown honolulu so a little diverse little little slice of each each of the different kind of cultures and communities on oahu what year did you graduate then from high school or graduate from home school that would have been like a 97 i think okay so you get done with high school then what what are you doing um so i had started an environmental knowledge because spirituality doesn't pay the rent unfortunately so yeah did you work that out i had um so i had started uh co-founded environmental nonprofit uh called healthy hawaii coalition um maybe i was 16 or 17 and i was thinking about i figured out like okay you know we're going and doing beach cleanups on the weekends and every weekend we come back and there's more trash on the beach like how do we start to try to solve a deeper problem and and came up with an idea of of going and talking elementary school kids about like hey guys here's why you shouldn't like throw your soda can in your chip bag on the beach because this is our home this is our playground and here's what happens when you when you do that and and i came up with like um like a fun little skit called the adventures of water woman and a friend of mine who's an artist came up with like a workbook and a coloring book for for kids and i thought elementary because you know obviously kids are starting to figure things out and um yeah so we we had this this two-day program one day was the skit and the workbook and then the next day we actually took kids out to to like a field trip and like testing water and understanding like okay here's like clean water versus dirty water and why and how it gets contaminated but in a very simple practical way that they could really relate to uh in their lives and so i was the original water woman i had like the blue board shorts and the cape with the big water drop on the back and it was so much pictures there they exist there may even be a video somewhere i don't know but so it was water woman and her nemesis was oily al and uh the skit was really a day in the life of oily al and you know he'd be out there like you know throwing his trash out on the street or changing the oil in his car and then dumping the dirty oil down a storm drain you know dumping a bunch of pesticides in his garden and every step of the way um you know water woman comes in just in the nick of time and saves the day and tells oily owl like if you dump your dirty car oil down the storm drain it's going to kill all the fish in the water and you know when telling the kids when you go surfing the water's going to be really gross and it was just the coolest thing to like see all these kids sitting cross-legged on the ground like you know first second third graders and seeing kind of like the light bulb go off in their eyes because these were examples that they could understand and and relate to and that was my hope in doing this was that you know it would at least plant a seed for them to understand and appreciate there are consequences to your actions and um we care very much about our home and so stop and think for a minute before you do something or if you see uncle or auntie like auntie don't throw your trash out the car window and and be able to start to make more of a you know behavioral kind of change and impact um to protect our home did you get these you know what now was your dad your dad was in politics at some level in hawaii wasn't he he um he and i might the first person our family who ran actually ran for office was my mom she ran for board of education um i think it was in it was in 2000 oh okay so so the water woman that was predated that yeah that's just but that's what inspired me eventually like it got to a point where and and and healthy hawaii coalition still exists today there are other water women's have have come after me um but she's still out there but it got to a point where i i so i started going to community college and with the aim of working in the tv and film industry leeward community college and started the tv and film production course out there and then was going to transfer to a mainland school to be able to continue continue that kind of education um but a couple of things happen uh my financial aid package fell through and i couldn't afford it to come to the mainland and so and then the other thing was just um there there was a an open uh seat in the state legislature where i lived and i i you know i i started to think about okay um i have an opportunity here to stand on the outside and there were other things you know we they wanted to build a huge landfill over one of our biggest water aquifers in hawaii all of our water comes from groundwater so you know i and a whole bunch of other people we went out and got petitions and we organized and ultimately thankfully were able to get that that project cancelled but it it got as far as it did because of a politician who is kind of in the pocket of the landfill company and so i started to think you know i can i can stand on the outside and hold a sign or circulate a petition or i can try to put myself in a position of influence and decision making to um directly impact a lot of these environmental issues that i really cared a lot about and that's what led me to uh run for state house in 2002 uh my how old were you i was 21. and my dad that was the first that my dad ran for city council that same year so it was kind of it was kind of fun for us to share he ran for city council out in waianae and i was running for state house in ewa beach and so our districts like they didn't overlap really but they were adjacent to each other but every morning it was like okay my mom would pack a lunch and um uh send him out and i went out we were sign waving every day and knocking on doors every day for for months but that was that was both of our introduction into running for office at the same time and it was for me it was a totally it was a totally foreign experience because i had no you know formal education in it i was not a part of a debate team had not been trained to public speak in any way at all and on top of all of that total 100 introvert like you know i had my circle of friends growing up but i was i was so shy and i was fine with it because i just hung out with who i wanted to hang out with but anybody outside of that i would not um i wouldn't talk to people i'd make my sister go out and talk to people and i'd read books and do my martial arts and yoga and just do do my thing and so to then put choose to put myself in a position where i'd have to learn how to give speeches i'd have to figure out how to pick up the phone and call total strangers which was anxiety-inducing in and of itself but not only do that but ask them like hey would you like to donate to my campaign for state house to then go like i never forget the first day i went to go knock on doors like i knew enough about i'd done enough research to know okay if i'm gonna run for this seat i'm gonna run to win and in order to do that i have to convince this many people to vote for me in order to win this race so i had i had the math figured out and i had the voting list people's addresses and names and um literally got on the computer made like this black and white kind of janky brochure saying this is who i am and so i had you know copies of that that i went and made at the coffee shop and and i sat in my car it's like a aqua colored geo metro two-door geo metro um on old ewa beach road in in waipahu and um it took me about 30 minutes in the car to summon up the courage to go knock on that first door and i was terrified absolutely terrified just thinking of every scenario that could possibly go wrong but also like what are the first words that need to come out of my mouth and then what if they ask me this question what if i don't know the answer just all of these different things and and you know like one knocked on the first door and like this wonderful old filipino lady answered the door and she's like hey how are you she's wonderfully kind and offered me a glass of water and like the whole thing's like oh my god okay then went through the whole scenario all over again for the next door a whole scenario like every single door was was a major obstacle uh for me and and ultimately like why put myself through this and and how did i get through it it really just it that groundedness and and the ability to step way outside of anything i was comfortable with came from um that that desire to serve and knowing that ultimately keeping reminding myself ultimately like why do you care so much about yourself this is not about you if you wanted to do something for yourself you would certainly not be doing this you'd be out surfing right now and um and that was that was my introduction into uh into elected politics so you won did your dad win i won and he won yep and my mom my mom was serving she served one four-year term in the board of education so for two years from 2002 to four um the three of us were all like in serving in different buildings all in the same kind of you know quarter quarter mile quarter square mile area in honolulu it was it was fun and and obviously you liked it at some level you liked the impact that you were able to have because you carried on with this sort of yeah it is life i never once thought you know when i won that election it was a five-way democratic primary first that i had to get through and then a general election that i got through um i i yes i liked the impact but i never once thought that i want to have a career quote-unquote career in politics i was absolutely not attached to that i thought okay hey this is something i can do now and i'll make the most of it and then you know we'll see we'll see where it goes and i ended up serving just one term there because of um iraq so when did you when did september 11th happen or what so i was where were you at yeah so i was i was um just starting my my campaign uh to run for the state house when that happened and at what point did you decide you wanted to enlist in the the national guard in hawaii i i knew in some way um when 9 11 happened and obviously we're in hawaii you know we're six hours behind new york on that day so we woke up to turning on the news and it had already happened um and you know i think like like everybody in our country it was it um it deep it's it deeply impacted me in a way that i felt almost right away that i wanted to do something to to to go after and defeat the terrorists that attacked us then um i just didn't quite know exactly how to do that because i was i had already made a decision to pursue this particular path of being able to serve hawaii and um so eventually eventually i felt that i had learned about the national guard and what it's about and you know serve your state in its time of need but also be ready to stand up and serve your country and and uh decided to enlist in early 2003 because i felt that would be a way that i could accomplish both objectives essentially did you have familiarization with the military because of your grandfather that had spent his whole career in the army and in the air force or were you really just just through stories um he passed away while i was still relatively young and because they he and my grandmother lived in samoa we didn't get a ton of time together um my dad had had and his high school best friend had tried to enlist to serve in vietnam they had both gone to i guess it would have been meps or some sort of version of it and they both walked in together and went into different rooms to go through all the medical exams and stuff he wanted to be a medic and when they came out my dad had been rejected for medical reasons it may have been flat feet or something like that and he was he was totally heartbroken but his best friend came out and was enlisted and so ended up going and serving in vietnam but it was something that my dad always wished that he had um been able to do just to to be able to serve and so um that was prob that was pretty much the most of my personal no no one else in my family my some of my uncles had served but again we're in hawaii so like we don't you know they don't get to see them or hang out with them that much so so you show up to boot do you go to boot camp yeah camp i had i was in the state legislature at the time and so i had to i you know took the asvab and everything the recruiter is like yeah you can you can have whatever job you want just tell me what you want to do and literally made the decision i was like look my session is done on this date and then i gotta be back by this date so find me a basic training and an ait that can fit within these like this five month period i gotta knock it all out at once and so i ended up uh in a um like medical uh operations or something like that because the ait was only seven weeks long i advise like i want to do like uh combat journalism or something like that but you got to go to school for six months or whatever but so i shipped out right after the legislative session was done i enlisted on the uh actually on the floor of the state house and um went to fort jackson the summer of 2003 um managed to um not get noticed by the drill sergeants for my political job until like week seven of nine which i was pretty happy about and only got found out because um [Music] uh me and my my assigned battle buddy we were pulling duty at like the battalion headquarters one afternoon uh like watching the door whatever it was and the battalion star major walked in and did what sergeant majors do uh like hey privates how are you and where do you come from and what'd you do before you joined the army and you know that whole conversation and so he talked to my battle buddy first and she told him i think she was from the midwest and she's like yeah so you know i was working at mcdonald's and decided to join the military and this is what i want to do and it's like oh you know that's great it's great and what about you it's like oh yeah i'm from hawaii and um i'm a state representative there and you know this is what i want to do and and he just looked at me he's like wait you said what you do what he's like how come i don't know about this he asked me that how come i don't know about this like i don't i don't know uh i you know the in processing paperwork that says what is your civilian occupation i i wrote it down and turned it in but you know who's your drill sergeant going from hawaii going from like the kind of cruising mode of hawaii yeah which i know it sounds like there's there's a little bit of well there's there's also like this whole competitive thing with your family and you're obviously we're driven because you're out creating these things and running for office and all this but i mean all of a sudden you're in boot camp was it a shock of course yeah yeah i mean it's i'd be worried if if it wasn't a shock um but i i'm really you know i'm happy that i went in with the perspective of at least just understanding that whatever the madness is there's a purpose to it and don't get i i just i've never i've always been a pretty chill person and i don't get freaked out by that much and um yeah so yeah i i actually in a very weird and twisted way really loved it it was it was the the camaraderie and the kind of bond that that is built in a very short period of time with a whole bunch of strangers from all over the country knowing that and appreciating that like all of us are there for the same reason all of us are there for the same purpose whatever the motivating decision was to enlist really didn't matter that um you know we all were the same uniform and all on the same team was it was i loved it how long after you got back from boot camp and ait was it that you went on your first deployment came back home at the end of 2003 from training and then the 29th brigade combat team from the hawaii national guard was activated i want to say um the notification came out in the summer of 2004. i was campaigning for my re-election at that point in time and um remember going in and and uh taking a break from knocking on doors knocking on doors again and uh i got an email at home checked my email at home and and uh got the notification of the deployment but i was not on the i was not on the deployment roster because they they already had somebody who filled you know that job in the medical in the field medical company and so i immediately called my commander and just said hey like what's what's the deal here i don't see my name on the roster and he said tulsi congratulations like you get to stay home you don't have to go and um that bothered me a lot and i i just said no um i i just you know i i knew that there was no way i could stay back and that to you know sit in my office in the state capitol and watch everybody leave was not an option for me and so i i continued the conversation with my my commander and i just said sir um i'm going tell me what job i need to get trained in that you need filled so that i can go and that's that's that's what happened so i i kind of i publicly withdrew from my reelection campaign it was too late to take my name off the ballot but told everybody like i'm not i'm not running for reelection um volunteered uh to fill this position and we left restarted our active duty train up uh i think it was in august of of that year of 2004 and then we were in country in early january 2005. what job did you get trained for what job what bill it did you it was medical logistics um so supply um which and you're a specialist at this point yeah i was an e4 that's kind of a fresh e4 and as as you know like okay i felt i filled the position but once we actually got there i ended up becoming i ended up filling a position that was previously held by an e7 as the brigade surgeon operations person and so kind of was working you know like line of duty paperwork and injuries and um tracking supplies for all of our medics and docs and pas who were uh attached to all of like the infantry units and and and also uh every day just tracking um going through going through the the report every day for our brigade commander of looking name by name down this list of casualties that had occurred in the previous 24 hours to see if there was anyone there from our nearly 3 000 person brigade and make sure that they were getting taken care of whether in country to stay in country or getting them evacuated and staying with them and tracking their care every step of the way until eventually they made their way home where were you actually stationed in iraq we were in uh balad in lsa anaconda most of us were there that was kind of the base and then we had units in camp victory in baghdad and then a couple other kind of smaller fobs out in different areas and so i moved around i moved around a little bit kind of going out and visiting some of our units and checking in on them um where they you know where they were but that was that was primarily where i spent most of the time and how did you what was that deployment like from you know your perspective now looking back what kind of lessons did you bring back what did you learn from that from that deployment to iraq a lot yeah i i came back and my family told me this after i don't think i fully realized how much i had changed but it was something that they immediately noticed in um in in coming back just more sober and more focused uh and that that really came from you know i talked a little bit about how realizing from a young age like death can come at any moment well that's that's a philosophical realization and being there that became very real very quickly um and you know there there was have you been there did you ever pass through there when i went to balad i'd be there for like 20 minutes and go to a meeting and leave so i barely remember anything about did you come in like vehicle or bird yeah so there was there was within the first couple of days of of us arriving there it's a big camp massive and so you know i kind of was going out and like okay orienting myself where's everything at and i noticed right away at at the north gate of that camp at least at that time i don't know if it's still there but there was a big there's a big huge sign that someone had put up on you know that you would see every time you leave camp out through the north gate which is where most of our patrols um use that gate that the sign read is today the day and i just remember being stopped in my tracks and just taking a minute to to to take that in and the meaning of it so that none of us would ever forget that today could be the day and um that that was the welcome message and it really it it hit home so much um in in that daily task that i had of of actually seeing names of people who i never knew people in different parts of who were serving different parts of the country but also people who i did know whose names would pop up on that list every single day that i went through and recognizing again how precious life is and any any any day any moment um you know that that could be your last and then of course we we had unfortunately you know we lost we lost a lot of people during that deployment and um to me it it really it changed everything for me because ultimately coming home i knew there was absolutely no way that i could just go back to the life that i had left behind as though i didn't just experience like the people like oh you're going to go back and run for your seat in the state legislature you're going to pick this up and kind of like hit the play button on my life that had been paused and it was impossible i didn't even think about it because i knew that somehow this experience that i had had i wanted i wanted to do something um positive with it uh in in being able to impact the kinds of decisions that took us all to that war in the first place so then so then what was the next move when you get home it's two is it now two thousand 2000 yeah so we were in country for a year and uh then you know had the demobilization when we came back and uh so it was 2006 and i was trying to figure out okay what what am i going to do there was no obvious answer to the question that i was asking which was how can i you know how can i take this and turn it into something positive ultimately i ended up volunteering our one of our us senators from hawaii at that time um senator akaka was being challenged in a primary election which kind of unheard of um you know the the power of incumbency is is very real plus he's like the kindest most aloha guy you will ever ever meet in your entire life no one has a bad thing to say about him but he got this challenge that came out of nowhere and i didn't know him at all personally i had no personal relationship whatsoever the guy challenging him um i did have some some interaction with um that was not positive and so i was i was like okay i'm gonna go volunteer full-time for senator akaka make sure that that um that he wins his re-election uh and he did and he i don't know if he was already or i think he was after the re-election he became the chairman of the u.s senate committee for veterans affairs and so after volunteering on the campaign as chief of staff said hey do you want to come and work in washington and as a legislative aide and help him with that work on the committee and and you know environment and energy natural resource few other areas and so that's what i did um i ended up going and working with him in washington for a couple years went through ocs while i was there and how did you get an ocs billet did you graduate college somewhere along the way good question i forgot about that part i was working i i was i was um while in iraq working on my degree going on the education center tent and you know like okay sometimes you got mortars coming in and the alarm sounds you got to go in the bunker and come back out and say i was i was continuing my education while i was there and i had gotten just enough credits you needed 60 credits to go to ocs and i had just enough credits to go and i was still working on my degree when i was in dc and i was you know working there and so i was kind of working full-time and doing school at night um but yeah slid in slid in uh and then got i think you needed 90 credits to get your commission or something like that you still had to keep squeaking them out so yeah so i just uh i barely squeaked by and then um so you go to ocs is it anything anything shocking about ocs anything that was i loved i i knew obviously ocs is to train leaders but i didn't know going in um the depth of that and that was why that was why i wanted to go through ocs when i graduated from basic training i was like i want to be the sergeant major of the army one day all about it and then you know i got a deployment under my belt and got to witness some some examples of of great leadership also some examples of leaders that were lacking in a lot of areas and and especially in a deployed setting in a dangerous way and um that was that that made a major impact for me coming back to say okay you know i same thing like i can complain about having shitty leaders or i can actually go and try to be be a good leader of soldiers and and i love and i tell kids who come and ask me like hey i think i want to join the military become an officer very biased yes you can go do the west point thing and that's great i highly highly highly recommend ocs because it is it is intense it is relatively short and it is just like it is it is the essentials of providing it provides you with the essential tools to to begin your leadership uh path and i just i loved it so much that i ended up going back as a tax officer after i had gotten a deployment as a platoon leader under my belt and then i loved it even more how long is this how long is army rcs so there's the active duty army ocs at fort benning which is i think three maybe between three and four months i went through an accelerated national guard ocs in alabama at fort mcclellan that uses the same program of instruction as the as the fort benning program but just condenses it down to i think it was maybe 10 weeks and like you know the difference is like they they get weekends off at fort benning like they get to use computers and phones and like that and we got none of that it was it was seven days a week you know four a.m to midnight um all up orders like no access to technology whatsoever so everything you were doing it was like you're writing it you're writing your your six page op order yourself and um you know it sucked as you're going through it of course but you know i i'm old enough now i'm approaching 18 years now in in the army reserves and uh so i'm like one of those old people who's like man you guys got it so good now back in the day back in the day um you uh so then you go on another deployment and this time you go to kuwait yeah you're in kuwait that time yeah yeah we were um it was a different it was a different mission for the brigade and kind of each of the battalions were tasked out in a lot of different areas a lot of our our infantry battalions or cav battalions were doing convoy security from within kuwait in and out of iraq um my platoon was attached to a field artillery battalion and we were we i i'm so grateful for this but we were we were physically located very very far away from the flagpole um and then the big bases that exist in kuwait so we were within an active kuwaiti naval base and right on the water which you know that's my gig i gotta be close to the water if i can um but our our main mission um the artillery battalion had kind of a force protection mission but my platoon uh we had had two things one was kind of security um like like high level security if we had vips coming into kuwait or and we worked with the embassy a lot we did a lot of stuff in and around the embassy so like psd like personal security um you know we did security for a lot of the the ammunition movements from the ports to where they had to go uh and then also um we did i had a training mission which was the which was the the fun one for me it was being able to go and train the the kuwaiti army on you know marksmanship um basic you know how to clear a building uh what do you do if you're dealing with uh like a civil disturbance or a riot right tactical tulsa teaching the wrong appearances hell yeah it was it was it was interesting for me though because um you know i platoon leader for a military police platoon in kuwait where i didn't realize until we got there they don't allow women on their bases at all it doesn't matter if you're the general's wife or you're a janitor there are no women what if you're tulsi gabbard tulsi gabbard showed up and i really didn't know when we rolled up like that first day to go in and meet the unit and meet the unit commander obviously i'm in uniform and my hair is up i got you know a big ball of hair on the back of my head and i didn't know what they were going to do at the gate did you have other females in your platoon i had i had um two two females in my platoon there were um one was an e3 and one was an e4 the rest were you know these are guys who are working state local or federal law enforcement mostly at home in their civilian jobs and just about all of them had uh at least one or two deployments under their belt and so they're they're seasoned experienced guys um but yeah so i showed up i showed up on day one and you know kind of showed my id card at the gate and the gate guard was didn't really know what to do but he saw you know he saw the american flag and he was like well okay go ahead and and so uh my i was my partner in this was a master sergeant at e8 and um super super cool easy going guy and and so we went and we started to uh we got introduced to the the guys that we'd be training we ended up doing a number of iterations of different groups of guys but um you know kind of went down the line shaking hands and saying hello and uh there was probably half of the kuwaiti guys who i was invisible there certainly was no shaking of hands certainly no eye contact or even acknowledgement that i was standing there and you know okay got it challenge how do you go from like i don't exist in your universe to actually being able to help provide you with some instruction and and develop the rapport necessary to be able to do that and um you know so i i kind of drawing from maybe the aloha in hawaii of just recognizing hey you know we're we're different people different backgrounds different language different culture different everything but i respect like i respect you and um i'm going to treat you with that aloha that respect and um gradually i started to see the ice kind of started to thaw and ultimately you know when we're out on the range and i'm walking up and i'm telling them like hey like okay here's this like basic safety things and and then like okay i'm gonna show you how to do it and then you know um gradually it got to the point i knew i knew i had made progress we sat down for lunch and they started to share their lunch with me is all like food food is food is the ultimate you know bridge builder and i knew once you were like hey like yeah here try my food like oh yeah oh awesome like cool yeah that's really good and it got to the point where um on on their graduation day of that first group their commander had everybody in the room everybody seated their getting there getting all the graduation certificates and everything and their commander asked me to come forward and presented me with this uh plaque of appreciation and thanks and uh some of there were some american civilians who were also working that um that mission and and they had been there longer than we had and they said tell us afterwards they're like tulsi i hope you understand what a big deal that was for this kuwaiti military officer um you know the traditional bearded muslim man to recognize the accomplishments of a woman and i i was very grateful to have been able to experience experience that in recognizing the bigger significance that you know not so much about like well this is about women's rights or empowerment but more so about how to overcome seemingly impossible barriers to get to a place where you have mutual professional respect and understanding uh and and the power of that alone and there are obvious parallels that we could point to in today's world here in america but yeah yeah i know it's that's a that's an awesome story and lately i've been talking a lot about the fact that if you want respect you got to give respect if you want people to listen to you you got to listen to them if you want to have influence over people you've got to allow them to influence you and if you want to build trust with people you got to trust them yes and i it's interesting um you know you kind of captured well at least for sure the respect part is aloha right it's the aloha spirit of hey you know what you're a little bit different than me but it's all good we'll figure it out and that way of building relationships is so much better than you saying hey look i might be a woman you might not think i'm here but i am a second lieutenant in the united states army and you will like okay good luck with that you never would have made any progress at all none and and so taking a little a little bit of aloha apparently with a little lunch as well goes a long way over time yeah and and people want to be confrontational because it seems like well it's the least offensive thing to your ego right when when someone looks at you or doesn't look at you treats you like you're not there that's that can be a blow to your ego that your ego can't can't repress it it just has to come out your ego has to say you will look at me damn it you know i am tulsi listen to me you have to listen and all those things even though it seems like it would be you know this direct i just need to be direct with them and tell them that i and it's like okay i'm telling you that that attitude doesn't work and look we're talking about a pretty serious cultural divide yeah but it happens with everything it happens if you and i are trying to figure out how to execute a mission and you think we should do it one way and i think we should do it a different way and i tell you well tulsi that's because you don't you haven't done this kind of operation before or because you you haven't been in as long as me or because you don't you you went to ocs and i went to west point so therefore i know but all those things are wrong all those things are going to make it harder for us to come to a good an actual good the best possible decision which is what we want so putting your ego in check add a little aloha to that and and we can actually make some progress and unfortunately you know it's kind of like what i started off talking about you know if you have an idea about something i have an idea about something and my my default mode is to say you're freaking wrong how are we going to have how are we going to talk about it how are we going to actually figure out what to do no you stay on your side and i'll stay on my side and we won't do anything which is a freaking nightmare yeah and that's where that's where i see um the parallel in that experience with the aloha that that i strived to bring every day to my work in washington is you start with you know finding that common ground even with such incredible stark differences that that are real you start with okay what what is what is the common ground that we can stand on comfortably together coupled with what is our shared objective what is the thing that we are trying to accomplish and recognizing that whatever your personal feelings may be however strong they may be what your views are ultimately if you can find some commonality in both those places then you recognize that it's not about you it's about this shared goal and purpose that you have and then like you'll find a way you'll figure it out again this is another thing i've been talking a lot about lately is if you and i can get aligned we we can come to a solution but we sometimes have to go pretty high up the ladder of alignment to get to a point where it actually meets so we have a mission and you want to attack the target from the left and i want to attack the target from the right well that's that's okay as long as we both know that we want to secure that target that's what we want to do and then all one of us has to do is put our ego in check for 15 seconds and say you know what kelsey attacking from the right sounds good let's do it your way right because i i just want to get to i just want to get the target secured that's what i want to do that's that's okay where we also get into a problem is agendas now you have an agenda where you want your platoon to do it and i want my platoon to do it so then we have to rise above those agendas now it's possible that our agendas that your agenda's still aligned with the goal you want to get the target secured great you want your platoon to do it you know what if i can put my ego in check for 15 seconds and say you know what sounds good tulsi once you take your your platoon can take lead and i'll support you right sounds good all i want to do is get the mission done exactly and people run around in circles and attack each other and worst part they never make progress they never make it to the target because they can't even they can't even come to any kind of agreement yeah that that's that that sounds exactly like one of the first things i was introduced to as a new member of congress where i the message was delivered very clearly from the leadership um within the within the democratic party and and some of my republicans went through some of the same stuff on their side so this isn't about one party or another but the message being like hey look this is about winning the election and if we're in power it's about keeping power if if we are not in power it's about how how do we get it back and so if there's a bill for example that deals with whatever let's say it deals with transportation something about as universally agreed upon as you can get like we need to move from a to b all of us do so there's a bill on transportation infrastructure and it's introduced by a republican you don't support that bill you you should support one that could be virtually identical as long as there's a democrat name at the top that's leading that effort because that will allow the democrat person and the democratic party that to then take credit for it which will then be put on a brochure or a tv ad that you can use in the next campaign which will get us closer to getting power or or uh maintaining power and this is where we want run into problems in the world yeah is when ultimately we're not aligned that's where the actual problem comes in is if you where you want to go the target that you want to hit is not the same as the target that i want to hit and then we can't we can't overcome these problems because we are not going to the same place they don't they don't they're not the same place so how are we going to go we can't be two places at once we either go to your place or my place and that's where we run into a problem when people are saying well the main point of us doing this is to get power not to help american people not to move transportation in a good direction but just so we get reelected and if that's what the goal is we can't get aligned and it's a problem and that is exactly where the lack of alignment exists because you have a political infrastructure where both political parties are ultimately and this is not every single person but if you look at the goals of the leadership of both parties it is about power so right you know i i served in congress for eight years um for the first uh like half of my time there republicans were in charge democrats were in the minority and then democrats won and took over the house democrats are in charge republicans and minority and you just see it play out where whoever's in power is trying to keep power whoever is not is trying to is trying to take it and there's no alignment because they're looking out for their own interests for the parties and they are not ultimately making decisions about what legislation comes to the house floor or what issues are being tackled based on what's in the best interest of the country which is where that alignment must be and and it's how our system of governance was set up that not that you have everybody as part of one party or marching in lockstep or having all of the same views but instead that you bring the diversity of different views experiences and backgrounds and ideas by having in the house of representatives 435 people from all across the country all elected by constituents in their districts who can then bring their ideas where you have debate and conversation you have bills that that theoretically go through committee where you can offer amendments and try to strengthen whatever the proposal might be or kill it if it's a bad idea and then you've got to vote on the floor like this is civics 101 that we learn about in school it does not exist in reality though today because instead of figuring out hey how do we work out our differences and come to that same goal of like how do we fix all of the potholes in our roads in hawaii and all over the country okay we need to invest in some infrastructure how do we do that how much money how is this best going to be executed instead and we saw this play out over you know i remember when trump first got elected i reporters asked me what what do you think tulsi is the one thing like what's the low-hanging fruit where there where bipartisan um agreement and work is possible i and most other people said infrastructure every community needs it every um this is a domestic job creator that actually solves real problems that need to be solved it never happened there was no infrastructure bill that even really came before congress for any serious consideration and why is that like the most low-hanging fruit that everybody agrees on that objective didn't happen because of partisan differences and an unwillingness to say okay yeah democrats had a certain idea and a certain dollar amount republicans had a different idea and a different dollar amount but there was never any real good faith serious effort to say okay where can we meet in the middle what am i willing to give up what are you willing to give up so that we can actually start to deliver on fulfilling the needs the very real needs that exist within our communities so i know you said not everyone is so entrenched but what percentage of people are entrenched on the left and the right i would say most i would say most and and not because they're bad people necessarily but if you look at the system that exists the power that the political parties have is massive and uh unfortunately there are too few people who go to washington willing to uh buck that power and deal with the consequences of that and the consequences being hey if you don't if you don't toe the party line then if you've got a tough challenge in your re-election campaign we're not going to help fund tv ads for you for example or we're not going to deploy resources to support you or we'll pull you off the committee that that you're on that you you really like or maybe we're not going to consider your bill on we won't allow your bill to come to the floor for a vote and sometimes these are very direct statements that are made and sometimes they're they're signals that are sent in an indirect way and um so the result of having too few people who are willing to kind of stand up and and make decisions based on purely based on on merit versus the political pressures is you end up having a lot of people who either enjoy and get right into playing the political games um and are all about it and then you have other people who maybe unwillingly or or even as they are disheartened but feel like they have no other option than to play the game and so it you know uh and and frankly it's because they see they see people like me uh you know president obama was present during you know i came i was sworn into congress in 2013 so his first four years and then i had president trump as president for the last four years that i was in congress and in both cases you know if there was an issue that i agreed on whether it's obama or trump i spoke out and said it if there's an issue i disagreed on obama or trump i spoke out and said it which is which is is is kind of heresy in washington because the expectation is even if it's the same exact scenario the same exact situation if it's your person in the white house and you don't like it you don't say anything but if it's the other party then i mean the world is gonna end look at this terrible thing and it's such a blatant double standard and so hypocritical i think this is one of the reason why voters are just like come on like we can see what you're doing so ridiculous exactly but you know they exist within this bubble where the the it's i mean it is it's i've talked about this before it's kind of like high school there is a popularity contest and it's both people it it's this ecosystem where people really care a whole lot about what parties they're invited to or who answers answers their phone calls um i'm just going to point this out because i've heard you talk about this before you're not saying like oh it's like high school where people care about what parties they're invited to you're saying people actually are thinking well tulsi didn't invite me to that party so we're gonna step on her bill that she put forth i'll give you an example very it is it is literal it's not like you know it's not an analogy it's it's literal there there was you know in the in the pre-coveted world and maybe even in the pre-trump world um the white house correspondents dinner is like the big event of the year and it is hosted by the media for the media and you only get invited as a politician if someone in the media invites you to go as as your guest it's kind of like washington dc's um oscars kind of gala type situation so you know it's all of the fancies everything and hollywood celebrities fly in for it and it's it's like a it's a really big thing and um i i remember you know i i happened to get an invitation to go the first year i was there without knowing anything about what it was and i was talking to some of my colleagues they're like tulsi you got an in like i've like this guy my friend he's like i've been here seven years and i've never been invited to that like hook a brother up kind of thing and it was so i mean it was so surreal to me especially because having gone from that where i was invited to go to that or other things you know like the first few years i was there and then um you know uh i stopped getting those invitations because like hold on a second she's actually like challenging whatever the narrative is or challenging decisions made within her own party or saying or doing things that didn't fall within the mainstream of popularity in washington dc and uh so i've i've experienced the arc of like okay you're cool you seem kind of cool and like you know you're a surfer you're a veteran you're this you're that and then all of a sudden like oh wait hold on you actually have something to say that's not just whatever literally the email talking points are of the day then you know it turns into something else let's uh let's let's rewind it a little bit to when you actually ran so you get home from in in what 2009 you get home in 2009 um i came back from my second deployment in 2009 and kind of faced a similar um pivotal decision point on on what to do next and just like the first deployment i came back with this same kind of sense of purpose and mission of wanting to find a way to be in a position where i could um i could help influence decisions or make decisions about our country's foreign policy and about our military and um but didn't know exactly what or how i would do that i didn't there was no obvious choice at that time i had applied for something called the white house fellows program uh which i thought would have been a great opportunity where basically it's it's a highly competitive you heard of it before yeah so it's this highly competitive program that ultimately if selected you serve for a year as a senior special assistant to a cabinet member or to the president or the vice president um so you kind of you know jumping your way up to directly being able to help influence and impact issues so i had applied for that got through to the regional finals and then got through to the final final interviews which was i think three days of um assessment essentially which consisted of you know we're told okay as soon as literally as soon as you arrive there you're being assessed by the judges i think there were 12 judges and ultimately they would choose probably 12 people out of maybe i think maybe they're 20 of us there and so whether it was the the welcoming reception uh or these actual boards essentially that you would go individually and sit before there's you know i think four different um boards of three judges and you know do a q a kind of thing and and then there was something that um they gave us an exercise where all of us who were there we had to pull names or positions out of a hat and so i think the position i got was white house chief of staff someone else was the president someone else was the vice president and then they say okay here's the scenario i don't remember exactly like country x has just launched an attack on us and um you have you you've convened a meeting in the situation room uh execute like you've got 15 minutes to prepare and then you go and execute and so role playing scenario kind of war gaming thing and um and the judges are just standing there watching and just trying to figure out okay what are the dynamics and you know who are the alphas and who's taking charge and who's just like the wallflower sitting on the edge and how do you make decisions thought process that kind of stuff it was a really cool experience long story short i didn't get picked why don't you think you got picked um i don't know i really don't know i i sought out a couple of the judges that i had developed a little bit of a rapport with to kind of get some feedback and and this was part of the thing like every step of the way people who were former white house fellows who had given me some mentorship on how to approach the process in advance and and some of the judges like uh they're like oh you're shooting like you were exactly the kind of person that this program was built for and um and so i um stupidly had started to believe all of that and uh you know went through it and was careful and did my preparation and went into it but you know in my mind i had already told myself like you got this like you're in and then so when i was i was writing the metro in dc and i remember getting off at union station and coming up the escalator and then my phone buzzed with a voicemail of course i was waiting for the call and uh the voicemail said hi tulsi we regret to inform you and so for that moment i was just like i i was i was incredibly disappointed obviously um but then had to reset be like okay so like that's off the table um and so i ended up i ended up uh you know i knew that i i was continuing to see what what can i do and i ended up running for uh and getting elected to the honolulu city council and focusing on those potholes and you know trash and sewers and parks and law enforcement um for two years until my former boss senator akaka retired from the u.s senator announced he was retiring and the uh one of the members of congress said that she was going to run for his seat which left a vacancy in the house and ultimately that's that's where i made the decision um i made the decision to run knowing that specifically in the united states congress i would be exactly where i needed to be to try to influence and impact those decisions was it a tough campaign i mean it's incredibly tough who who you're going against there were six people who ran you know it's strong democratic state so the real election is the primary election and there were six people who were running in that democratic primary but the main person who was kind of the assumed winner of the election even you know nine months out from the election was a guy who had just run for and lost a race for governor but who is also the former mayor of oahu the city and county of honolulu and so you know just for some perspective our state has about 1.4 million population around 980 000 of which live on oahu and the district that that we were running for um there's there's two members of congress from hawaii one is kind of the urban representative that that has almost the whole south shore of oahu the urban that kind of densely urban populated area and then the other member of congress which was the seat that i was running for has um the west side north shore and east side of oahu and all of the neighbor islands and so i came into this uh with i think it was about two percent known name recognition in that district because my city council district was actually in the other um it was in the urban part of oahu so there was again no overlap in those districts and the guy you know the front runner in the race he had everybody in the state knew who he was he also had a little bit of baggage um that came with having just been the mayor and uh that's a whole other whole other conversation but uh so so the the challenge was was pretty great to go from like three like three percent against 100 and somehow i had to try to cover that gap um and i just you know i remember meeting with with some some of the the political um you know elders for lack of a better word in hawaii and letting them know that people i had decent relationships with letting him know that i was going to run and and why and getting a lot of patronizing responses back saying you know tulsi you're i think i was 30 at the time 31 you're young you have no chance against this guy so just you know don't waste your time and come back and try again in like 20 years you'll be great in 20 years and i was like i don't operate on that timeline so you were like holding my beer pretty much pretty much did you just go super aggressive how did how the hell did you make up that kind of distance well so first i i had to um fundraising is a huge thing because i needed to be able to have the resources to let people know i existed and who i am first of all just my name period and then to let them know you know my experience and my background and why why i was wanting to serve them in congress and so you know we started out we started out just like putting signs up around the district and hoping that that would cause for people to say who's tulsi gabbard like what is this about and um and and it was it was a lot of time going and doing what what i called the most extensive job interview ever where i went traveled to each island and spent a lot of time in communities with individuals with groups small groups large groups introducing myself to them and answering their questions and letting them know why i wanted to serve them in congress what kind of leadership i would bring where i stood on on different issues that they cared about and um ultimately what happened was five months before election day my i i was pulling at 20 to the front runners 65 and then the rest was split between the other people and i was like awesome progress exactly and i just i i just continued you know i was i was on the phone and i was asking people for support and raising money and then also out on the road just you know seven days a week all day and uh it was it was it was an incredible incredible experience election day comes around uh in august of 2012. and all the way up until about two weeks before the election the local media and even some of the national coverage was just like this guy's this guy's got it i had heard from other people he was already interviewing staff a few months before the election that he planned to hire once he won um our debate we had one big televised debate we had a few others but there was one big televised debate i passed him in the hall right before the debate and he was singing that song um black eyed peas i think tonight's gonna be a good night as he looked back at me and and i will i will um i have been told i killed it in the debate and that was where a lot of people first started to take notice like who is she and um i think i think it may have caught him by surprise just a little bit but still like all the way up until about two weeks before it was like he's got it and then some of the polls started to shift and some of the local news they were like hold wait this can't be right these polls can't be right because you can't see a big turn around i ended up winning the primary election going from that 20 five months before to actually beating him by a 22 margin on election day and it was it was uh people people in dc like the next day they're like okay like what scandal caused him to to allow you to win essentially or what was the thing that you know that happened and it was it was there was none it was literally um i think the difference between someone who felt they were entitled to the position because of a number of reasons and and me recognizing what the position really is it's a position of trust and responsibility that is is granted to you by the voters in the state and they are the ones who i'm accountable to and who i work for and um it was just it was it was a it was a our local kind of walter cronkite anchor of our news station who's been doing it forever longer than i've probably for about 30 or 40 years he's still on tv now he's a vietnam veteran and that election night he was reporting the results and he actually started to get choked up and and got a little got a little tearful because he understood why i was running bringing that experience of service and having been deployed and the significance of that i was going to congress not for myself but that i was bringing my brothers and sisters in uniform with me uh and and um it was it was it was a heavy night i mean it was you know there were parties and things going on but um i remember leaving the the hall that night on election night and my sister was walking out with me and she's like tulsi you know you're allowed to celebrate you know you're allowed to be happy about this but i was just i was immediately like okay all right these are the results what are we waking up and doing tomorrow what's the next task what do we have to do now in order to make sure that we we hit our next mark and that's um and and that's kind of the the focus that i that i carried with me throughout is you know i'm not entitled to anything and i am here only because the people in my community in my home state have trusted me to to work for them and to to be their voice and and um to represent them to the best of my ability so the the hype of you winning that and come being the being the underdog champ rolling into d did that that kind of came to you to dc right i mean that that hype there's some hype train yeah from tulsi hype train i like saying that so the tulsi hype train shows up and you're sort of um you're viewed i think it's actually nancy pelosi called you like a rising star which is you seem to hear that okay it's not like it doesn't get thrown around that term doesn't get thrown around about political people but you were like a quote rising star in the democratic party so you came with some hype yeah i didn't i didn't fully understand why but yeah it was there i mean i had you know she i was actually making up drill time with the national guard after that primary election um i remember being at my unit and she called my my cell phone i hadn't talked to her before and she called my cell phone and left a message and introduced herself and just said hey you know we have a democratic convention coming up in a few weeks i would love to have you come and be one of the featured speakers during prime time as um and speak about veterans let me know if you're interested and so again like that's not an opportunity that one gets when you've just been elected to congress to go and speak to i don't know 50 000 people in an arena in the whole country yes the whole it's everybody yeah and uh and so you know i mean i i was grateful for the opportunity and and went and um it kind of yeah and then you know shortly after getting sworn in as a member of congress i was asked hey will you be vice chair of the dnc and like what what does a vice chair do um what is what is actually that you're asking me to do and and what what can i do in that sense that's what they're asking you to do it's freaking weird right this is all they they kind of saw you they saw a good horse to put money into and invest into a great story and they they wanted to get some control over that hype train yeah and i think use you know be able to say hey you know there are i mean there are biographical boxes that i checked a lot of boxes for you know the diversity uh pick the diversity higher and and you know for me i'm i'm you know just coming into each of these experiences com completely clear-eyed and not getting googly-eyed at all like oh my god they love me so much but just recognizing okay like what do you what are you trying to use me for even uh what do you get out of this and then for me thinking okay like weighing pros and cons and saying is this an opportunity that i can use to try to get some some good done and if it is then okay that makes sense like maybe there's a mutually beneficial thing here and if there's not then you know no thanks um but yeah that's that's that's where that's where things started so they started off like really awesome yeah hey you've got all this hype you've got opportunities they're looking at you as a as a potential kind of horse to put money into and invest into as long as we can control you on the track right that's the fine print at what point did you did when was the first sort of uh time that you kind of bucked a little bit do you remember what it was yeah absolutely it was my first year in congress in 20 summer of 2013. um every year in congress and i i don't know i think this may date back to pre-air conditioning days but every year in august congress goes into recess it's the hottest year of the month it's you know dc is a literal actual like geographical swamp and um so you go you go back to your you so you go back to your district everybody in the house and the senate there's a recess in august you go back to your district and you get like four or five weeks at home or to go and do a congressional delegation trip to another country or whatever you set that space and time to do that and so i remember being home and getting word that president obama wanted to go and launch airstrikes and a military attack in syria and um i was filling up gas in my car one i i so i started to get a lot of calls from constituents from people about this and this is where this is very quickly developing i don't have all the facts or information or intelligence or anything at that point but um people were concerned and i was filling up i was filling up gas one day um in kapolei and and a woman who pulled up her car next to me she saw me there and she came and walked over and she grabbed my arm she's like tulsi you know my kids in the military please don't do this because i don't understand what it's for and and there was a number of other kinds of messages coming from people just either expressing total opposition or concern and just coming out of like you know iraq and just every everything that had led to that kind of cynicism and fatigue or okay well you want to go start another war in another country like what what did they do to us and so the recess time was cut short i was on the foreign affairs committee at that time and i was throughout most of the time i was in congress and so we got called back to dc early so that we could go through and get the intelligence briefings and actually get gather the information and that was when i first started to take kind of a deep dive into what was happening in syria and why he was proposing this and ultimately after going into the issue and the question and and really he was not going to come to congress at first but then uh enough members of congress said you can't like the constitution does not allow you to unilaterally just start a war you have to come and get congressional approval for that um and so that's we went back and started to prepare for that that vote that would happen and i just i came to the conclusion after studying the facts that it would be a counterproductive military action and much of it came from and we had hearings with secretary then secretary of state kerry and others at the time who were trying to tell congress like well you know this is not going to be a pin prick strike but it's not going to be a decapitation it's going to be a punch in the gut and you know some of my follow-up questions were like okay so you're going to go and deliver a punch in the gut attack how will they respond oh you know we don't really know but we don't think it'll be a big deal okay who are their friends who are they gonna call for help and how may they respond how could this potentially escalate into something that is no longer a punch in the gut but something that first second third fourth order of effects their response will require response from us which require a response and all of you know the the tit for tat that then begins once you go over and say i'm not going to cut your head off i'm just going to punch you in the gut and think that you're not going to do anything in response and i just saw so many of the similarities of a lack of foresight and strategic planning and for me again as military officer basic level like military decision making process and actually thinking through these things and i saw similarity like this could very easily become another kind of iraq kind of situation where you start making these decisions and then they're on the fly and then you're not realizing or thinking through what do we do tomorrow and then the next day and and where do we go from here and oh so i uh i wrote i wrote like uh an opinion piece expressing my opposition to the president president obama's proposal um published it and um was the first democrat to do so to express opposition to his proposal and very quickly got a call from the white house basically saying how dare you who in the white house it was the the first lady's chief of staff and i i still to this day scratch my head about why they asked her i knew her and maybe that was just simply the reason why but i would think that on a matter like this you would want to have i don't know maybe a national security director secretary like i don't know somebody but that was that was essentially the messages how dare you no not only as a democrat but because like you're from the president's home state how could you how could you so publicly disagree with him on something oh that's right you guys should have been hawaiians but the thing was jaco is is nowhere in that conversation was the substance of the issue raised like hey here's why we think your opposition is misplaced or here's what you're not seeing or here's what nothing yeah nothing at all you know i wrote down while you were talking what's the commander's intent like what are we trying to do here because if you can't tell me what it is why we're going to do what we're doing then we need to talk about it more yeah that that's number one and you know as you just put it the reason why why are we doing something why are we doing it and by the way i tell people all the time if you work for me and we're doing something that you don't know why we're doing it you raise your hand and you say hey jacqueline why the hell are we doing this and i say well here's why and you say well that doesn't make any sense and i go please explain that to me then so that i can make a better decision because if if i can't get my team on board then i must be i must not be seeing something or i'm not explaining my perspective well enough that they can go oh yeah got it jocko thank you and we now understand that thank you that's number one number two so when you fire off this article is that a good tactical move for you in other words you know would it may may it have been a better move to say hey listen i need to talk to you know you tell your friend the the first lady's chief of staff listen i want some clarification i don't want to get crazy here but look i just got back from iraq a few years ago it gets bad it gets ugly we got to make sure we know what we're doing can can we have a further conversation because i no one seems to be listening to me right now and it's a problem i chose to take that public course of action because i had just gone through days of internal discussions q a expressions of concern and ex essentially expressed all of those same points of opposition internally to members of the administration and saw that nothing was nothing was breaking through and that the answers that they were delivering were pretty canned and set and that there was not real there was not really an interest of a discussion or a response like of introspection saying hey maybe we're missing something here and or maybe we're not communicating clearly or you know it was just like this is it this is what we're doing and the why like why what are you trying to accomplish well we need to send a message okay send a message and then what like you can like communication's a two-way street i can send you a message but if if i want that message to be effective like i need to anticipate how you might respond and so there was i i chose the course of action that i chose purely because i felt i had exhausted um internal or maybe kind of back channel means of addressing those concerns it seems like what did you also sort of had already done an assessment to think like these people don't listen yeah this wasn't this wasn't just one day you decided you know what that's it i'm gonna fire off this article it's a pre-existing condition that is when people say hey i got an issue with this we get told shut up get get on board with the program that's what we're gonna do so you had already experienced that yeah so i mean this this in this specific situation it was not so there were other democrats who who shared these and republicans who shared these concerns um and that were raising these questions within the hearings both both public and and closed um hearings so it wasn't like hey we expect everybody to like there was not a pressure coming from the democratic leadership in this example saying hey we expect you to toe the line on this and just support this because it's president obama so this was not that kind of situation there are other examples of that but yeah it just it was clear it was clear that the message that was coming from the administration was was really um it was kind of a one-way communication and and so i knew enough to know that when when they they're kind of locked and loaded in in their position the only thing that may cause them to change or to budge is public pressure and that's ultimately what happened it it the public pressure was bipartisan and and and reached such a volume that they never even brought the vote to congress because they knew it would be an abject failure and and the the the military action never happened and obama got criticized for that because i don't know if you remember but he this was like this was a red line right like okay and he got vastly criticized by republicans and i think some democrats like how how dare you not enforce your own red line um and i still you know i think this was one of um ultimately the final decision that he made i it was the right decision because because of all the reasons that i felt it was the wrong decision to to make in the first place but also it forced him to take a diplomatic path to resolve the issue that he was trying to address um which is you know hey like maybe that should have been your first first primary course of action yeah don't paint yourself into a corner yeah exactly just like don't don't put yourself in a situation in a combat scenario where you can't maneuver don't do that don't don't put your you know don't don't put your back against a cliff where you can't go anywhere else yes don't don't do that it's not a good move it's not a good tactical move it's not a good strategic move there's you know this this whole thing when i when i ask you these questions one of the things that well you're gonna i know i know you just told me you were reading about face right now well the crux of about spoiler alert in about face he ends up at the end of the vietnam war well it's not the end of vietnam war it's the end of his vietnam war he goes and gets interviewed and says we're gonna lose if we don't change the way we're fighting and of course he gets drummed out of the army in a matter of months you know it's all bad and the question that i always kind of consider is well if he would have kept his mouth shut he would have had you know he would have had a brigade he would have had a division he would have had the influence of all many many more soldiers and much more strategy and and could have perhaps steered the war in a better direction if he would have played the game more now there's an emotional component to it which is completely understandable which is that hackworth absolutely loved the army and he loved his soldiers and he was seeing soldiers get killed and wounded every single day and he got to a point where he it wasn't unacceptable to him we had a similar thing you know that you and i were talking about with general mattis and at what point you know if general mattis who's so highly respected and just smart and and and resolute in his beliefs and and kind of unflappable so it was really nice when he got appointed i was so happy i'm like okay we got some sanity going on here we got somebody that's that's rational right very rational guy and it's at one point it's over and then you wonder okay hey look i know it sucked and i know you didn't like it but don't you have more influence when you're sitting in the seat that's that's that's a an issue that people leaders have to deal with on all different levels you know i talk about a lot in leadership strategy and tactics not a lot but i write a section about it yeah if you're my boss and you tell me hey jocko i want you to do this mission here and i say well i don't think it's a good mission and i think you know it's going to cause casualties or i don't think it's got a good strategic objective or and you say i jocko you do what i told you and i say but hey you know ma'am it doesn't seem like a good plan to me and you say hey jaco shut up and do it now i can either draw a line in this hand and say i'm not going to do it and then what do you do you fire me you put echo in charge and echo goes it goes and does it because he's just a yes man so now but i've given up all my influence at that point which is not good there's a scene in band of brothers dick winters who gets ordered to do a reconnaissance it's the end of the war and he goes i don't really think that's a good idea the colonel says shut up and do it he goes okay he goes and does it they get a guy killed they come back the next night the the colonel says i want you to do another recon tomorrow night and dick winter says i don't think that's a good idea the war is almost over we lost a guy yesterday and he goes shut up and do it and he says roger that sir and they go to a basement and they drink wine what'd you see on the recon we didn't see anything okay good you know he he went along with it but he still had some control and this is just a hard thing and it's it's interesting to hear your perspective of you know at some point you make a stand and that's where you decided to make a stand and obviously you lose some influence after you did that you lost some you know i don't know how many invites you got to those dinners after you did that it's probably not a high number so you give up some influence but at the same time you're you're you're holding the line on what you believe in yeah and at some point you've got to do that i mean at some point you go look tulsi i don't care you want me to do this mission it's a bad idea we shouldn't do it and if you got to fire me fire me yeah and maybe that's me just trying to send you a message maybe you say oh geez jocko's really serious i must really have a bad i must really have a bad perspective of what i'm trying to get this guy to do because he's never said no to me and now he's saying no to me all right jocko tell me your reasons again and now we can have a conversation tough tough those are tough things for leaders to do yeah and that then they're if if you i would say this is especially true in politics but i think it's probably applicable across the board is if you know what you are trying to accomplish ultimately what's the greater goal and your goal is not about self-preservation if your goal is not selfishly motivated but instead um you know how how can i serve this this greater purpose that you're obviously there to do then um you're able to more unemotionally and clearly assess okay here i've got three different options here here's where this one leads here's where that one leads here's where that one leads and assess okay you know what what really ultimately what is going to help me get help help get me closer to that thing that i'm trying to accomplish and um i've i've gone through many many iterations of this as i've made different decisions that had very serious political consequences and that um especially the big ones were were very often the unpopular decision that people were kind of scratched their head like what what is wrong with her like she's she's she's going and doing things that nobody does she's going and saying things that nobody will say is she crazy or just stupid or what um but if you take a step back you know really uh who am i accountable to and what is my purpose if my purpose is to be a part of the um to seek the approval of of the elite in washington then i would have made completely different decisions completely from the from the get-go uh and i would have done very different things but if my accountability is to end it is and and has been to the people who elected me to serve if my accountability is to our brothers and sisters in uniform both those who continue to serve those who have laid down the uniform and those who have paid the ultimate price then i'm making my decisions through a different lens in a different context than folks are used to in washington and it's not to say like hey i'm just going gangbusters and i'm going to go run through a freaking brick wall no matter what the consequence and it it is being clear-eyed about okay here here are the here are the potential ramifications to this and sometimes they are known and sometimes they are an unknown factor but ultimately these major decision points that i have come across um do the right thing if you don't if you don't know and you're not sure and all of these like ultimately do the right thing because it's the right thing and even even as you may get you know um the you know the political fire or the the negative consequences or these other things like ultimately whether it takes a little time or it takes a long time doing the right thing is always the right thing and i'm you know i'm i'm [Music] able to know that wherever my path goes i've done my best to make that best decision when faced with hard right easy wrong the i used to tell my guys if you're doing the right things for the right reasons you we will win in the end exactly so if we're doing the right things for the right reasons we'll win in the end now what's interesting about this is you know you on certain occasions to some extent you didn't play the game right and as you just said you know you played the game sometimes and you did what you had to do and formed those relationships and then sometimes you didn't play the game and this is what's interesting and that this is where the future's unknown where does that lead if you were doing the right things for the right reasons which you were ultimately you'll win in the long run we don't know what that looks like yet right at some point i know it's like a big gamble right because we could paint an entire entirely different picture of tulsi that went to washington played the game said the right things vote the right votes nodded the head and you'd be in a different spot than you are right now you'd be you could potentially i mean from your trajectory when you look at you in 2012 is that when you showed up 2012 when you showed up in 2012 your trajectory was steep and like you said you checked various boxes that needed to be checked and if you would have played the game that whole time you could be in a position you know you could be president right now you could be president right now having conformed to what you were being told to do now we don't know where this actually ends up right because it's it's 2020. we don't know where this ends up maybe people will be listening to this in 2039 or whatever and they'll be going oh yeah jocko called it jocko called it you did the right thing for the right reason to look at how it turned out that could potentially happen but of course you know a bunch of other things happen too but it's it's something that we have to struggle with as leaders doing if but if i still believe this and i tell people this all the time if you're doing the right things for the right reasons you're going to win in the end in the end you are going to win it might take years it might take i guess it could take decades when you're talking about this these types of decisions but the other component of this is which i think in my just just from sitting here looking at you as you're talking about this you every day have to look yourself in the mirror yep and at a certain point you say i'm not going to do that and again look there's i always tell people play the long tank play the long game think strategic i i tell people i would say when people ask me oh i got some situation at work and my boss told me to do this all the time i'd give the i give you the advice play the game oh tulsi wants me to do this paperwork and she's been yelling at me to do it and it doesn't make any sense for me to do this paperwork i tell that's that's awesome yeah do the paperwork play the game build a good relationship with tulsi so you can actually talk to her in the future and explain why that paperwork doesn't make sense right play the game until you get to a point where you got to look at yourself in the mirror and you can't and then you're not doing the right thing and you're not doing it for the right reasons and you got to make a different decision yeah yeah i um that that's exactly right and in order to do that it's being able to have not lost your foundation and your groundedness so that you have the ability to be introspective and to know what actually matters versus the things that that don't really matter which help you determine you know which battles am i going to pick to fight and also um what is what it what is winning how do you define winning is it is it a specific title or is it a specific position or when you say do the right things for the right reasons and at some point in time sooner or later you're gonna win for me in my case that that's that is a hundred percent true i think what um maybe is not obvious to people is winning is not becoming president united states winning is not becoming a united states senator or a member of congress or an ambassador or whatever pick pick the job pick the crappy job [Laughter] you have a different perspective than most people in washington who live their lives from college to try to strategically plan their lives to get these jobs yeah except for the fact that you know winning you know look if you're the president you have a massive you have the most amount of influence that you could possibly have i used to tell that to these young seal officers it's like oh you're going to kiss ass to get promoted well if you kiss ass quote to get promoted guess what you can take better care of your troops which is why you're here right that's why we're here to take care of our team be able to accomplish the mission so sometimes it's like oh those are those are aligned winning when i'm a platoon commander instead of a e5 and a platoon i have more influence over that situation so i can do a better job of the mission i can do a better job attacking the enemy and i can do a better job of taking care of the guys that work for me that's all good and you know what i had to sit through some meetings and i had to nod my head and i had to support my whatever commanding officer or my master chief when they told me to do something that didn't make quite make sense but i did it why not so i could get promoted that's the big difference not so i could get promoted and i never did it was as you know for me it was such a it made my career so much easier because i never was worried about getting promoted i never cared if i got promoted and it actually helped it helped because i was doing the right things for the right reasons and my bosses would look at me and say like yeah this guy cares about the guys and he wants to get the mission done let's get him promoted yeah i wasn't doing it to get promoted it's just gonna happen if you're doing the right things for the right reasons so there's a weird dichotomy there no winning isn't necessarily getting promoted or becoming the president or whatever the case may be but if you're looking to have the most amount of influence that take care of your people and your troops and your country and your nation that's a really good spot to be in and that that the order of that i think is the most important thing because too often in politics people get so attached to the position or the title and their right their entire identity is wrapped around that whether they have it or it is their ambition to achieve that position or title that they forget that the real goal is being in a position of impact and influence where you can serve and make that positive impact and that's where for me even from when i ran for state house through the different political positions that i've had like i had no issue and no qualms about walking away from what was beginning what was the beginning of some would say would be an illustrious political career as a 21 year old elected of the state house when it came for that decision point are you going to stay are you going to go i went because i wasn't losing anything and like people oh you're gonna give up this political career you've only just begun i'm not giving up anything i am only choosing at this point to serve in a different way and i think that's when we look at when i've thought about okay well you know winning winning is being in that position of impact and influence and and maybe at some point it does take that form of you know serving an elected office in a high position where i can execute on that or maybe it takes a different form or a different shape you know for the time being or for whatever it is it's staying it that the order of that staying focused okay this is the goal and the position and the platform that i may have at a different point in time to accomplish that goal doesn't change the goal did you underestimate the power of the swamp maybe a little bit but i think even yeah i would say yeah i mean the the power of the political infrastructure and the party system and how much money uh in you know there are limits like if i'm well if when i ran for president ran for congress there are limits like if you wanted to make a political contribution to me you know the limit changes every election but let's say it's two thousand dollars that's all you can give there's no there's no real limit to what you can give to either political party so if you wanted to write a two million dollar check you could do that no problem and so if you look at the the balance of power that gives the political parties a heck of a lot of power to to leverage um over a specific candidate or specific incumbent and to use as using the power plays that are used so that that was something that that um i came into and i think was was unexpected so just to clarify this i can give two thousand dollars to tulsi for congress right but i can give two million dollars to the democratic next 200 million or whatever yep and therefore the party has that money yes and now they can dole it out to the people that are playing involved with the program that are playing the game yep and it's a little surprising to you it was a little surprising yeah that how much control they had and and seeing it play out literally on the house floor when votes or votes are happening or what is it about to happen it's like hey where is this member of congress i heard he or she is thinking of voting with republicans we need to find him and talk to them and uh get them in line and they say and there are actual jobs like i don't have you seen house of cards yeah you're fine don't don't worry about it but but it's featured in this show house of cards the the um the main character he kind of starts out he's a member of congress and he is uh the whip and the position is literally called the whip and um that's their job is they whip votes and so if somebody's so i go to you and i say hey tulsi i know you're kind of wavering on this vote but it looks like you got a tough race coming up there in hawaii could use some extra tv advertisement don't you think yeah it's like that like for real that's it that's how it is yeah kind of or that's how it works um it takes different sometimes it can be very direct like that uh i i th this is so this is something that that um i have not personally directly been the target of because they knew partially because i i got elected without any help from the democratic party locally or nationally um there was no fundraising help there was no hey we're gonna push you know it was a primary election and generally they don't get involved in primary elections it's not it's not a rule that's always followed but in my case it was and because it's such a strong democratic state generally they'll use their resources to help democrats get elected or re-elected in swing districts or republican districts if they're like ah tulsi you're good like we don't have to worry about you in my case then that also means there's no leverage from them uh but i have friends who i've served with who are in those positions where you know a re-election in a congressional race like they've got to raise 10 million 20 million bucks which is you know in my race i think i raised i raised about i don't know a little over a million dollars um so for them there is a lot of leverage and it's used it's certainly used to to try to get you as a member of congress to do what the what is best for the party rather than what you believe is the right thing to do based on your conscience and based on how you feel you can best serve yeah what's the percentage that they're able to wield that sledgehammer effectively like how much control i mean it's it's it's pervasive and so that that's one example is hey you've got you you're always you've got a tough re-election or a tough race or a tough challenge or whatever that's one approach and the other approach is people who are interested in climbing the the ladder and so you will either have a cherry opportunity placed before you or maybe you won't have that opportunity presented or it'll be taken away so you know it's kind of like you know they'll look at okay what does this person want and what do they need and how can we use that as a motivator to try to get them to do uh what we want them to do and so this is the imbalance that needs to be corrected in our political system where this idea of hey anybody can go and run for congress and i know that my member of congress is always going to go and act in my best interest as a voter has unfortunately become so twisted into this thing that is about one party versus the other party and it's always about the next election and how they can battle and who is gonna win rather than how do we work together and actually solve problems and pass meaningful legislation and i you know i again early on you know there were there were some republicans um obamacare right hugely divisive issue politically that's been weaponized by both sides issue of health care and there were some republic we found like hey here are some easy fixes this was this was uh when i was elected in 2012 obamacare was passed in 2010. and so i you know there were some democrats and republicans we started to say hey let's figure out what we can do together like we're this is we're here in congress this is why we are here and there were some easy um uh kind of very simple common sense corrections that we could make uh it through legislation to this bill that are no brainers like not not controversial at all common sense no-brainers exactly okay sounds good good set up i like it and have that work out it turns out that both party leadership um indirectly expressed opposition to this idea and what we were talking about doing on the democratic side because it would require that they would have to admit that the bill had some flaws that needed fixing and on the republican side opposed to it because if you fix obamacare then what do you run against what do you criticize the other side for if you actually fix it in a way that it it helps people and if people start to like it then you can't raise money off of it and you can't weaponize it for political purposes and that's that that was 2013. and unfortunately here we are in 2021 and it has only progressively escalated and gotten far worse far divisive to the point where as we sit here today you have the speaker of the house nancy pelosi referring to republicans as quote unquote the enemy within the enemy within and the implications of that like the actual legitimate implications of that were as when you make that statement that you do not trust people from the opposing party broadly she's not saying hey this one person i feel is a threat to our security and needs to be reported to law enforcement that's a different story if that if that were the case we have systems within our government to do that if you think a member of congress poses a security threat to their colleagues report it to law enforcement do it but to throw this out in a public setting i think it wasn't a press conference she said that that they are the enemy within uh and other democrats saying i don't feel safe around my republican colleagues what you're saying is that if any member and any democrat goes and tries to have a conversation with or reach out to or work with a republican they are working with the enemy they are collaborating with the enemy they are now traitors to who i mean to the country to democrats where does that then lead and how is there any possibility of healing and unifying and reaching out to get past the inflammatory divisive state that we're in okay so we got that going for us it seems like uh well i i didn't track every move that you made but certainly one of the uh if not at least from what i know the biggest kind of move that you made that was outside the system is when you went against hillary in 2016 for for president is that is that was that the straw that broke the camera it was a big one that was a big one um yeah and that was one of those that was one of those big decision points that i had um where i couldn't i couldn't map out what the actual consequences to that decision would be so you knew i knew what happened i i knew no i i knew i obviously knew it was it was a serious decision that would have serious implications but exactly what those implications would be i i didn't i didn't know um i had different political advisors and people who you know who knew washington and who knew me giving me very serious warning and just saying look tulsi this could be the end of the political road for you potentially so just know that before you make this decision and and just just to back up a little bit why the back story that led to my making that decision was i was still vice chair of the dnc at that point and as an officer of the dnc the rules say you have to be neutral in a primary election that the dnc's role is to make sure that the primary election process is um executed in a fair in a fair way so that voters have the opportunity to make their decision on who they would like to be the democratic nominee to become the president united states and so that was my like okay i'm going to make sure that i fulfill that responsibility and make sure that our democratic process works in uh in this primary and i had no plans to get involved in the race at all and there were you know there were a number of you know this wasn't the reason why i ultimately made the decision but there were a number of issues that started to um present themselves in seeing that the chair of the dnc at that time was making unilateral decisions about how the primary process would work that made it very clear that it would not be fair or neutral and that those the process decisions that were being made would favor hillary clinton over any other candidate and i and other officers of the dnc expressed privately and then our concerns in opposition a to the fact that like hey like we're officer the dnc you're asking us to attach our names to decision that you as the chair made but we had absolutely no discussion or input to it whatsoever and i'm not comfortable doing that and then when seeing there was no it was kind of like okay no like i don't care i don't care the decision's been made and that's it and then airing some of those concerns publicly for the purpose of trying to bring some accountability and transparency to the process and just two just two two examples one was um limiting the initial decision that that the chairman made or the chairwoman made was there would only be six debates in the primary election and to me that was ridiculous like there had never been so few debates um ever and why why that number of debates mattered was because of the second decision that was made which was if any candidate participated in a non-dnc sanctioned debate or forum they would be banned from participating in any future dnc debate so you'd be punished for actually seeking out opportunities to talk to voters um both of those decisions seemed pretty undemocratic to me while we're standing here saying hey we want we want high voter turnout we want people to engage in the process we want people to engage with the candidates but we're only going to allow six debates and if they do any debate or forum that's not one of our six then they won't be able to come and play with us at all because hillary had such good name recognition every one of these debates would be an opportunity for someone else to get more name recognition yeah and challenge her track record i mean actually god forbid have a real dialogue in conversation and a compare and contrast for voters on each of you know i mean obviously bernie sanders and hillary clinton were kind of the two primary candidates but there were a few others who were still running at that time martin o'malley was when he was the governor of maryland and and um so so that that was kind of already happening but ultimately as as this process um started to to begin i saw how even in these limited debate settings how little attention was being focused by the democratic party as well as their their corporate media partners on foreign policy and on the the qualifications that voters may look for in a commander-in-chief and what that responsibility meant um it was just not it was you know they were talking about a bunch of other things most most things that to me like superficial political drama and theater like not issues that really mattered a whole lot when you look at the implications on people's everyday lives but as a soldier obviously for me like this is the most well it's not just as a soldier the most important responsibility that that any president has is to serve as commander in chief you know our constitution very clear like i can have all the economic positions i want in positions on education and positions on health care as president i can't do anything of great impact without working with congress and that's i mean that that's the it's the check and balance that our our founders had in mind for us which is a good thing but there's only one commander in chief and it ultimately drove me to resign as by share of the dnc and and endorse bernie sanders over hillary clinton because i saw a huge um gap and difference contrast between the two of them and in hillary clinton's uh very interventionist kind of war hawk warmonger track record uh both as secretary of state and and as u.s senator versus bernie sanders who through his time in service had proven to have more of a non-interventionist leaning and be a little bit more critical in questioning of any rush to war and i you know on a whole host of other issues i i didn't uh you know bring i agree or disagree on a number of other issues but this was the singular issue that i made my decision on to to resign as vice chair of the dnc and endorse bernie sanders so that i would have a platform to start to push to be a voice to push this question and to challenge the media and to bring to voters here's the differences between the two major candidates in this primary you get to decide what kind of commander-in-chief you want and so um that was you know i i announced that decision on um sunday show meet the press uh there in washington went to the studio um didn't tell them really what i was there to announce it was you know i i intentionally kept this to myself very very close hold knowing how incestuous the relationships are between politicians and the media and attempts to try to um undermine my ability to deliver my message for myself and so there are probably like two people in my life who knew what i was going to do i went live television sunday morning shared my decision and why and then you know my phone started ringing off the hook literally i'm in the car rolling away from the studio but but the most stark response i got was um and they ranged from like tulsi that was a brave uh and righteous decision to like yeah exactly and that's what it was that was sunday and then i think it was either monday or tuesday we had votes and went back into session in congress and and um both democrats and republican colleagues of mine were kind of coming up and patting me on the back saying that like nice knowing you um have a good afterlife and even even some democrats who who had um like endorsed obama over hillary in 2008 early like from the beginning and who shared like hey like i i made that decision and i was on the clinton [ __ ] list for years before i was able to dig myself out of it and tulsi don't you know that she's going to win and you're going to be on the list and that there is a list and what that means in a practical way is you don't get your bill signed into law you don't get funding for the things that you need or that your constituents need in your district and that your efforts the reason why you are here and the efforts that you are putting forward will be will be blocked and so you're rendering yourself ineffective because she will be president and um that was that was the washington response basically you're politically dead um you you knew that though right yeah i took it to that level i i knew i wasn't working i was like i chuckled as people told me this i was there was nothing there was nothing that i heard the morning after that did that surprised me i knew that the race you kind of feel like a badass when you walked into congress on monday did you kind of i don't i'm not not badass or did you feel like no neither neither i i was i was um i was amused at like the hushed air for real yeah for real for real no joke and like the sideways glance is like is it okay to go and talk to her now or not and like i don't want to be you know like thought to be i don't know part of whatever she's doing like i don't know like there's all these different things and how about the fact that now like whoever told you hey now all the things you're going to try to do are going to get squashed you're not going to be able to make any progress here that's a real thing and so again going back to this strategic decision making if you're trying to take care of your constituents and you make the worst enemy that you can have in dc that's not good well what what i what ended up happening obviously is she did not win the election and some of those very same people who remain good friends of mine who were being honest with me then saying you're politically finished then came back to me later and said well turns out you saw something that nobody else saw at that time so you know kudos to you for standing up for your principles and what you believe in and listening to both your heart but also recognizing where people in the country are rather than listening to the echo chamber within washington and yeah so it so at that point you got a little clout back yeah yeah but it's all it's all not i have the beholder really i mean there there are there's unquestionable that a lot of the the challenges that i that i faced as i was running for president um can be traced back to that original sin and just how how deep you know yeah there there were certainly ramifications but also um it was i mean i had the opportunity to to raise the issues that i ran for congress to raise and to bring them to the forefront and to get conversations starting about you know the issues of war and peace and and when do when is it right to send our troops into battle and and um what questions should we be asking as leaders in this country before we make that decision and recognize like i'm not a pacifist i'm not a peacenik i i care and have dedicated my adult life to that that service to protecting our national security the safety of the american people i am just pushing to make sure that we have leaders in this country who recognize the seriousness of of of life and death of war and peace and when war may be actually necessary and warranted and knowing that our troops have volunteered to go knowing that that may mean a sacrificing of their own lives and all of the sacrifices that our loved ones and families make and don't think twice about it that's what we sign up for to serve our country but also knowing that sometimes the tougher decision to make is to not go to war the harder decision may be recognizing that even as there may be a problem that that we want to solve in the world that sometimes it it requires more strength and courage to recognize a it's a problem we can't solve b it trying to do so would not serve our national security interests or the interests of of the american people and therefore recognizing that the right answer may be to to not do anything so so really that's the other part of the strategic move is strategically it's going to make you harder and it's going to make your job harder in some respects after you execute this move on on hillary but at the same time it's going to bring these important issues to light so strategically there's at an advantage and a disadvantage yes and you weighed them out and said you know what if i don't bring these subjects to light no one is going to do it i could not i could not i was not okay with sitting on the sidelines and watch this every presidential election is important there's not a single one every every election this is the most important election of our lifetimes every single one is important and i could not live with myself if i had chosen to sit on the sidelines and let this whole thing play out without doing my very best to insert these most important questions and issues and contrasting of records into the dialogue and conversation so that voters would have the ability to make the best informed decision possible so then you decide you're going to run when is that that's what when do you figure that out when do you figure out when do you say to yourself you know what i need to run for president the the event that triggered um the event that ultimately led to my making that decision was the happened in january of 2018 and it was i'm sure you remember this echo but it was when on a saturday morning we got a text alert sent out to every cell phone in the state civil defense alarms sounding saying missile incoming to hawaii seek immediate shelter this is not a drill and the aftermath of that where immediately we're thinking like i've been working the issue related to north korea for a very long time for obvious reasons that north korea is continuing to develop their nuclear capabilities they're developing their intercontinental ballistic missile range capabilities miniaturized nuclear warheads that that not only could reach hawaii but could reach a significant portion of the mainland at that time in 2018 now they have continued to develop that and they can reach anywhere in the country but this is the scenario that's playing out get this message like north korea's is sending uh you know a nuclear missile to us which means we have 15 minutes to live i i was in dc when this happened um you know all my loved ones my family everyone uh is is in hawaii and what happened there was absolutely terrifying where um you know there was a video that came out after it was an iphone video that that this this father took as he lowered his little eight-year-old girl i think she was about eight years old down a manhole telling her that this is the only place you'll be safe and with the camera saying like if if i don't make it you know at least i want you to be okay um there were countless countless stories of people that i heard from after this event happened about about what they went through in you know there was a guy who he had like he had one of his kids that was in town another kid that was on the west side of the island in waianae and he was somewhere in the middle and in that moment got that message trying to decide which am i going to drive to town or drive to waianae which of my kids am i going to try to get to to spend those last minutes of my life with you know mother's going in the bathtub like seek seek immediate shelter everyone's like where do i go friend of mine he's got like a ton of kids i don't know six or seven kids he just started driving to the mountains like i just got to go find a cave somewhere and but but there was no shelter there's no shelter and so you got this fancy alert system and like okay it's blasting out see community shelter there is there is no shelter um what what ended up happening in those minutes that followed for me as soon as i got that notification on my phone i'm in dc i like holy [ __ ] what is happening i need to figure out what's happening and so i just started like going through okay i know that i can probably try to reach indo pacom like command sell i don't have they don't bring cell phones in the building so that's a problem i ended up uh the first person i called was our state address in general who i knew if something was happening he was going to be at that civil defense command and he would obviously know and so i called him and i said what's going on he's also my boss in the national guard so you know dual hat duel had there but i called him and i said what's going on and very quickly he said it's a false alarm i said i'm gonna put this out publicly you're telling me this is a false alarm and he said somebody push the wrong button false alarm so there's no missile coming in no missile coming in so i immediately hung up with him typed out a tweet in big block letters this is a false alarm i have confirmed with authorities there is no missile incoming and uh that tweet was the first public notification that went out um that let people know what was going on but you know i just started i was on the phone cons i was calling news stations radio stations you know uh people were calling me and i just literally i was just like false alarm click false alarm click just trying to get let people know what was going on and there's a whole other you know like incompetence thing like there was no official notification to the public coming from the state government until 38 minutes after that initial alert was sent out and that was a that was a whole other issue but the thing that led me ultimately to make that decision like to start thinking about i need to run for president is because of what everyone went through and realizing that you can have this fancy alert system and i'm sure the governor and other people are all bunkered down somewhere safe but there's no safety or shelter for anyone else and ultimately the fact that people the fact that this is a real threat that exists and there are others that politicians have created or escalated through political rhetoric of heightening tensions with nuclear-armed countries of of spurring a nuclear arms race and knowing like okay you know i'm sure there's probably some some mechanism or system in place to protect them and their families but what about everybody else in the country people who um i mean nuclear war ends and utter complete destruction of the world ultimately and having gone through what we went through i wanted to be in a position to do two things by running for president i could raise this issue and bring it to the forefront because nobody was talking about it maybe there was a day of of you know cnn coverage or whatever on what happened in hawaii but then it was it was completely dropped and forgotten there was no like hold on a second so wait north korea has these capabilities they're continually increasing this threat is real there is no shelter like if we get attacked then it's kind of it's game over what what's being done about this by the leaders and that none of that happened at all even in the aftermath of something that was you know terrifying and in such a real way and so so to be able to address these issues um and and the existential threat that we face that comes from that um continued advancement towards the the brink of nuclear war that that that we're on and if elected to be in a position as commander-in-chief to begin to walk us back away from that brink and to actually do something about it to de-escalate these tensions to actually work through the kinds of negotiations and treaties that previous presidents like you know reagan and jfk did when they recognized the seriousness of what happens when you when you are in a cold war and when you have nuclear armed countries who either intentionally or accidentally can spark a nuclear war that would result in the end of of humanity on this planet and uh that was that was the driver for me to make that decision um to run and unfortunately i very quickly found out that neither the media nor the politicians were interested in talking about it or anything that really mattered that it was it was about who's saying bad things about who uh which candidate is um you know who looks cool who's likable who's all of these superficial things but whether it was on the debate stage when i raised these issues or in interviews with reporters one on one or i mean i talked about i talked obviously talked about these issues every day multiple times a day town hall meetings that reporters covered or were present for at least with the intent to cover what happened there was no interest in in in talking about uh this specific issue about the existential threat of nuclear war and what how we got here and where we need to go to prevent it what to speak of of of other issues and that was that was the most frustrating um that was the most frustrating thing about about running for president was the realization that even as a candidate for president united states the ability to bring such an issue as serious as this to the american people was so easily squashed by the corporate entertainment media and um the politicians who benefit from them corporate entertainment media yeah that's a good name for the news it's it's more accurate than the news it certainly is so you said you realized very quickly that that no one wanted to hear about this stuff yeah like when you say very quickly how long did it take before you looked around and said wait a second because i remember hearing about you i mean maybe it was on rogan um i i forget but i remember thinking oh you know that's cool i and it seemed to me wow what a i said wow what a what a viable candidate that's interesting and i remember seeing some polling and you were at like two percent and i said oh that's kind of weird that's not a very big number at all i was kind of surprised and then maybe that was early on but at some point i you know you were on rogan again or i saw you in a debate or something and i and i remember thinking oh i'm going to check that out again she's got to be at 30 or 40 now because i the people that i know are kind of talking about her and i'd look and you'd be at 2 and i was kind of it was very strange to me that you couldn't get you you weren't getting any traction was that weird to you because i mean you did the whole hawaii thing where you were at 2 and then you went to 20 and then you won by 22. and here you are at 2 you're like that no factor i got this been here done that yeah at what point did you say oh damn this is a little harder than i thought it was going to be and was that the same realization as oh the media doesn't the media and the news and the entertainment networks don't care about this stuff the way i do there there were different signs of that the first of which started on the very day that i announced officially announced my candidacy as in build the event go up on the stage deliver the speech announcing my candidacy and why and i i talked about the very thing that we talked about as as where did you drive in hawaii what was it uh what where outside yeah it was it was outside at uh in in waikiki and uh you know there were local and national media cameras there to cover it and uh you know a bunch of supporters and people came out while i was giving the speech nbc news put out an article uh basically making the accusation that i am i am somehow a favorite of the russians or being helped by the russians uh they're talking they're saying nice things i it you know it was the article was so vague and baseless and lacking in any kind of evidence to back up the claim that they were making that it was just it was just so out there and and i i knew that they were doing an article because they had called and asked for a comment like a few days prior and had said you know without knowing the extent of like the the completeness of the article but they said hey you know what i what do you think about this and um and and they had said okay yeah we're going to publish the article probably sometime next week maybe wednesday or thursday and i think i think that my announcement was on a saturday whatever day it was they changed their schedule for when they were going to publish the article so that it came out on the day that they knew i'd be announcing my candidacy and and their thing is like the russians like tulsi that's the that's the general and you know like russian bots or like you know russian state-sponsored media the thing was is you know i think they they um said oh you know there are a lot of uh articles that are proving that the russians like her something like that but when you actually go and look at look at the articles they're citing it's it's not accurate first of all and second of all it lacks the context of like hey um they're actually just reporting that she's announced that she's running for president or lacks the context of well when hillary and obama ran against each other in 2008 the russian media reported much more favorably for obama than hillary and so they they chose a narrative and chose to launch it on day one of my candidacy that tulsi would be the the russian asset or the favorite of the russians and planted that seed on day one um you know cited oh you know she's gotten donations from her campaign from people who favor russia and you know one happened to be like a ivy league professor and specializes in foreign policy and has talked about nuclear war for decades and you know one was a woman who was trying to promote you know diplomacy and actually building relationships between um like at a grassroots level between american educators and russian educators or business owners or whatever i mean the the the it was just a it was preposterous and very transparent a transparent signal and move on day one so that yes when did it start that's when it started and then of course it it continued to progress and escalate and i started to see both on the debate stage as the debate started to begin as well as um you know you know you and i talked earlier when you know you know when you're going in to do an interview like a media hit it's probably going to be four to five minutes long and you know you go in there knowing what you want to talk about regardless of the question that they ask you because you know you got like you know two senses exactly and so this this was why i was running for president so i took every opportunity to raise it on every platform possible and there were no follow-ups there was there was no like oh hey like let's dig deeper into this issue which is clearly very serious no none of that it was like well you know what do you think about this canada what do you think about trump or what do you think about this like superficial drama um and a conscious choice uh away from actually talking about uh what mattered most and it you know hillary clinton uh weighed in on the thing when when she said that um i forget the exact words but basically the russians have chosen their candidate and uh without saying my name said it was me and that was then covered by the media incessantly which is like crazy it is it is and it was a signal in and of itself like why would why would the former secretary of state former presidential candidate former u.s senator former first lady go out of her way to place the target on me and why can't the russian bots do better than two percent distraction in the colts if the russian bots are so freaking powerful why can't they run up your numbers a little bit for yeah yeah not not so much but it it eventually got to the point where um not like the coverage that i got ended up largely being negative attempts to smear my candidacy or question my patriotism and my loyalties so out of the gate i mean is this is this a grand conspiracy where they're like oh yeah tulsi she went against hillary in 2016. get ready we're putting her down i certainly appeared that way and on top of that hey tulsi she's we can't control her this isn't gonna work we don't want someone that we can't control put her down it certainly appeared that way because um that was if you look at the outcome it was the outcome that that i think they were looking for and again it started from the beginning it ended up with a total total media blackout by the end of it um polling standards changed to make it so that uh you know it's like okay here they say hey you got to pull at a certain level in order to qualify for the debate and then qualify for the next debate and you know the polling standards often shifted based on where you were right like that's that's a little convenient to change it right when i start inching up in the polls a little bit more but it also just points to like the catch-22 that exists where in america we'd like to believe that anybody can run for president anybody can run for office and that it's up to the candidate to go and make your case to voters and voters actually get to decide well in these presidential races so early on you can have very well-known candidates that everybody in the country's heard of and you can have lesser known candidates that most people have like no knowledge of whatsoever well they start running these polls so early on that uh show a lesser-known candidate like myself at one percent or two percent whereas the better known candidates are pulling much higher and then make the determination well tulsi gabbard's not a viable candidate because she's only pulling at two percent so we're not going to really cover her very much because we don't deem her as a viable candidate and by we i mean the media and and the political party uh and so as a lesser known candidate then you're not covered as much as the better known candidate so you don't have the opportunity to get better known and and so it's this you know self-fulfilling prophecy yeah of we know who this person is we're going to keep covering up and it allows them to um it allows them to decide who who they want voters to be exposed to and uh who they don't believe deserves that kind of opportunity to be in front of voters and so it's kind of a pre-selection a pre-primary selection before before any vote is cast you have these very powerful people within the party and within the media who who make those decisions about who gets to be heard and and uh who doesn't and that that was what we experienced and it was it was such an incredible this was the thing i underestimated the most that i thought hey i can run for president i can bring these ideas forward and yeah i'm at a disadvantage because i'm not as well known as some of these other guys but as long as i have the platform to be able to reach people all i got to do is like all i got to do is do my best and trust that voters will make will make the decision i underestimated how uh very quickly and in a sustained way the media the decisions were made to to not even allow that platform to exist which left me in a pretty like a pretty helpless place you know i was yeah i can live stream my town hall on social media and i did i can reach it maybe a few more thousand people in addition to the thousand who were sitting in the room but when you look at the numbers uh in the country it you know when when they choose to not cover you and not allow you that platform uh then you know it's it's not only not only was i not able to to raise the issues and address the issues that that are not just important to me but important to our country um but also the the smear attempts and the negative coverage left me in a very helpless and and vulnerable position where i couldn't fight back i did not have you know did not have the means even if i were a billionaire which i'm not and i had a very very very skinny budget our art campaign was pretty much fueled by volunteers and i love them so much people who really believed and set aside school or jobs or life and when worked their hearts out to help me get my message out but even if i were a well-funded candidate or a self-funded candidate a billionaire that i could go out and purchase ads and i could go out and create buy my own platform essentially if the media makes a decision to either not cover you or or to smear you and undermine therefore undermine whatever it is you're saying and doing it's it's um it's difficult if not impossible to beat and and i think this is so important to talk about because it is a charade of the democracy that we maybe believe exists in this country and it's certainly a charade of the democracy that our founders set out for us in this uh incredible imbalance of power and influence that's in the hands of a very few who don't have the best interests of the country at heart so we also got that going for us yeah and just to illustrate that i mean this guy who was the ceo of cbs this is i think probably the most stark and direct example uh les moonves is his name and he this was this was um yeah i mean this this was in 20 this was in 2016 that he said uh something along the lines of trump may be bad for the country but he's good for business the money is rolling in keep it up donald trump keep it up and his very direct statement illustrates everything that's wrong because it shows that this corporate entertainment media it's about the money it's about the profits it's about the rating with no regard whatsoever for what the consequence is for the country and for voters and for our future and that is something very serious that we as people in this country need to understand and be aware of so that we can start to bring about kind of the culture and societal shifts that will ultimately result in um in change and making it so that you know these few powerful people don't get to usurp our democracy and our voices being the voices that matter most in determining who we want to serve as leaders in our country so with that you see donald trump getting the you know getting the nod from the republicans which many many many republicans did not want him to be the candidate at all uh never trumpers and and so that was a real thing they there was a lot of people that a lot of republicans that did not want and the republican party was not into him for much of the primary exactly like he was totally um and actually somebody when we were on uh rogan's together and i said something like wow you got really hammered more than i've seen anyone and someone in the youtube comments said hey idiot what about donald trump i was like that's a good point they hated him apparently as much as they hated you in the democratic party how is it that he was able to pull it off does it is the republican party less controlling than the democratic party i don't know the answer to that specific question but how is he able to pull it off he was very famous and he had influence they couldn't black him out they couldn't ignore him and they were making a [ __ ] ton of money off of him because with donald trump brought eyeballs to their screens whether it was uh fox news who was initially i think maybe cynical or even critical of him and then shifted to like full bore pro-trump or if it was cnn and msnbc who were i think initially kind of like how is this even happening to full-bore anti-trump um regardless in in all of these scenarios and from the democratic party's perspective and the republican party's perspective with trump came money democrats get to be the anti-trump party and motivate a lot of people to give money to beat trump or people who supported trump and members of congress or whatever and republicans got to raise a lot of money off of hey look they're trying to attack us and they're trying to undermine what is going on and we need your money and we need your help to be able to you know defend the party and defend the work or whatever it is so um that how i think that that's what ultimately ended up i mean it gave trump a lot of exposure and yeah some some of it or maybe a lot of it was was was uh was negative but you look at how much the public hates politicians and how much they distrust and hate the media you know you can kind of see how generally people who are frustrated and dissatisfied with the powerful elite whether they be in politics or the media would look at a guy and i have friends like this like they didn't really agree with anything that trump was saying they're like finally somebody is giving the middle finger to the media and telling him to you know shut up or whatever it was um trump had influence and uh he was very well known and could not be ignored so at some point does somebody come in to somebody come from the outside that's not as brash and not as offensive as trump and would that not be a pretty would that not be easier or was it because he's so brash uh and because he's so freaking quotable right good or bad you know he's just gonna run they're gonna put they're gonna put his quotes up all day long if somebody comes along that's from the outside but that is actually less brash and more calm and more rational do they say okay it seems like that would be the perfect candidate right now someone from the outside that can actually roll in and say look this system is totally screwed up we're gonna like the the idea of draining the swamp was a great quote that's got so many legs or so much legs and it you know of course it didn't really happen when you looked at his administration it was like oh yeah more people from the swamp more love yeah exactly right but but when someone does this in a more from a better from a better um like from a better position it seems like it's this is what i'm getting at because i was going to ask you well at some point does it reach a tipping point it seems like the tipping point's there it's just someone needs to step in and say okay we are going to actually drain out this swamp we're gonna actually get rid of this these lobbies are gonna get you know controls put on them we're gonna we're gonna do things that's gonna move this in the right direction it seems like as you said americans a lot of americans aren't looking at the political system going you got to be kidding me and look you telling me stories earlier today before we hit record it's kind of it's sickening it is it's sickening and so as that word gets out it seems like america's ready to go you know what we're done with this [ __ ] over here and trump was like the first guy that said hey i'll i'll help you out and so everyone went cool sounds good you go raise hell basically yeah if someone that says yep we're going to fix it we're going to change it i'm for change i'm going gonna make things it seems like we are right for that i was good that's what i'm saying i'm saying i was going to ask you will we reach a tipping point it seems like we're already there trump was the guy that got elected based on saying hey we're going to drain the swamp people voted for him to go and do that like you said people that you that you knew that didn't agree with any of his politics but he was changed he was different he was gonna throw it in the face of the system that's what we were ready for and it just so happens that the guy that threw it in the face of the system also threw in the face of everybody that was around him i mean just like a a grenade going off it's just people are getting hit and there's no direction to it so it seems like we're actually ready for that what's it gonna take to actually get someone there that's gonna run that's gonna that that's that that the truth will come out doing the right things for the right reasons is gonna win in the end someone who has the resources and ammunition capable of going to battle with the existing political infrastructure and the corporate entertainment media that that's that's the match up because i agree you know there are there are more people who identify as independents in the country today than there are who people who identify as either democrats or republicans really yes factually factually echo charles are we good to use that word yes sir thanks that's factually true we can look up i mean i've seen uh a variety and this has been trending in this direction for quite some time this is not a new phenomena but the numbers are consistently trending towards and and maybe some some of it's generational that that you know the millennial generation did not come up identifying like my daddy was a democrat my granddaddy was a democrat i got to be a democrat i think there's there's less far less of that in in the millennial and post-millennial generation so i think that's part of it people are looking more at issues than party i think part of it is is people recognizing and being disillusioned with with both political parties as not looking out for their best interests that it's more about the party than the people so i think there's a number of reasons for this but it is a fact that it's over 40 percent of the country identify themselves as independent and therefore lesser numbers who identify as one party another so are the people ready for a strong leader who will come in and speak to what's in the best interest of the country rather than what's in the best interest of one party or another i i would say yes without a doubt so then the next question is how what is necessary to execute on that what is necessary is is first of all recognizing you know where's the opposition coming from the opposition will come from the people who are benefiting off the status quo and that is the existing two-party system and the the um the the the entertainment media that that is in bed with them and it's not impossible it's not insurmountable but it's a pretty serious obstacle and you got to be ready to go to battle with some of the most powerful people and uh so it would take a lot it would take a lot and the third party thing is what do you think is that is that dead on arrival not dead on arrival not impossible very difficult because i think it was it was back and i forget i think was the first time that ross perot ran for president uh was also when bill clinton was running for president and i think george h.w if i'm not mistaken yeah i think you're right at a certain point well early on though early on at a certain point ross perot was polling higher than bill clinton and i i believe george bush as well and that like they're like what is going like how is this possible and had he continued his campaign at a certain point ross perot dropped out of the race and then jumped back in a little bit later and he took a big hit for that i don't know people probably like want like do you not know what you want or like what are you doing buddy um but there are political pundits who say that if he had continued on um he you know who knows he may have become president or he may have posed a more serious threat in the end than he did ultimately his numbers took a dive after he re-entered the race and he ended up kind of just being the perennial third party guy who stole votes right but it was after that election year that the rules started to change in making it uh with with agreement from both the democrat and republican party that made it much more difficult for a third-party candidate to get ballot access just to get their names on the ballot to be included in debates just the basic infrastructure of a candidacy um changed to the point where and it still it still exists today that the the bar is much higher for a third-party candidate to to be heard and to be on the ballot than it is for uh candidates who run under one party or or another so that that that just again not impossible but from a practical perspective as well as from a an exposure perspective it's a much much much heavier lift that again requires a certain strategy and a hell of a lot of resources to be able to accomplish that so how long how long were you in the race for total um i think i announced in february of 2019 and i withdrew from the race i think in march february or march of i think it was march of uh 2020. it was it was after kovid had kind of already started i was back in hawaii kovid had started to take a pretty firm hold maybe it was even later than that and it just it got to the point where like we're on lockdown at home in hawaii congress had shut down and uh i knew that the most effective use of my time at like the outcome of the primary seemed somewhat inevitable at that point and the most effective use of my time would be to focus on how i could best help with with the response of covid in hawaii and you know i was calling trying to get like n95 masks and just trying to help help with that local response in hawaii so you so you what is that called dropping out of the race is that what it's called is there some official word for it yeah no withdrew my candidates so you went through suspending that's the word they use suspending your candidacy and did you feel like what the hell just happened did you feel like wasted time did you feel like man because i again i remember looking at you in the polls and you know you might have gotten to three percent or four percent i could i i was really surprised i was really surprised you know that you just didn't get the kind of traction again as as joe said you're like such a kind of ideal candidate from like a box checking you're a veteran you're a woman you've been you've got experience you've got combat deployments you you're uh whatever not a white person you got these things that people are looking for hapa yeah you're hapa right so so you got those things and it just seemed like oh okay it'll be interesting to watch this she's going to climb right up this thing and you never really made that progress does that surprise you i mean in hindsight no because you because you see you you mess with the machine at that moment like going through it um it surprised me that i didn't even have the opportunity to earn it to earn the support to get that exposure i remember you telling me at some point you were like the number one most googled name after the first debate after the second debate what you didn't make the third debate for whatever reason yeah i don't remember which you know i think there was there was yeah there was a gap at some point where i didn't make one but then i made the the next i don't remember exactly what but in those first in those first debates um i was the most searched candidate of the night after each of those debates which was the whole point you know hey i can go on this stage a national stage the first debate i think had over 20 million viewers and this is the opportunity to introduce myself to the american people uh in the hopes that they might say hmm she looks interesting i want to know more i want to learn more and that being starting to kind of crack open the door to be able to make an impact there i think one of the other in addition to all the things that we talked about about how that opportunity really ultimately did not exist and it started with that first debate um you know in advance we had set up our google ads account so that when people went on google and said hey who is tulsi gabbard then you know our links would pop up and they would then go to my website and they could look at you know click issue x y or z what do you care about bio background etc um that was the hope that that would be i would be the most googled candidate and that we therefore were ready for it um google shut down our google ads account with no reason whatsoever at all given during the first debate it was not actually during the debate it was afterward but it was during that it was during that window of time that was the golden opportunity to capture and it was a limited window and they they just like your your account is suspended no explanation no here's what you got to do to fix it or get it you know whatever released and uh and to this day we've never gotten you know it was suspended for a certain period of time and then it was reinstated and it was not for lack of us trying to reach anybody who would answer us and tell us why and what we could do to fix it immediately so you know i mean there's i filed a lawsuit against google for that um because of because of the the impact obviously that it had on me but also but really the bigger issue that i i wanted to raise by filing this lawsuit was you've got this massive big tech company who has the power to um interfere in the public square of our democracy and you know who knows still to this day like was it some guy sitting at a computer who was like man [ __ ] tulsi gabbard i'm gonna punch this button and show her what's up or like who knows i don't know what happened but it happened and if it can happen to a sitting member of congress who's running for the highest office in the land it could happen to anybody running for office anybody who's speaking out anybody being critical of whether it's big tech or government policy whatever the motive this is the power that they have in their hands that's incredibly dangerous in undermining the the kind of core pillars of of our democracy of having a marketplace of free ideas and voters who can you know get the information they need and ultimately make the decision that they want to make are they allowed to are they allowed to mess with like google adwords from a political perspective so in other words if i was running against you and i bought the adword tulsi gabbard and brought it to a freaking russian uh newspaper article about how they're your favorite so when i google tulsi gabbard i click on the first article that comes up it shows me that you're a russian plant can i do that in the political realm because look they do it with like i you know i i have a bunch of companies and sell a bunch of stuff and you type in jocko you know the other companies pay for that word for jocko protein and it brings to their site right so if i was a billionaire and you were running against me i could be like oh cool i'll just buy tulsi gabbard who is telstra gabbard what is taos of gabbard where's chelsea gabbard come from and i'll just buy all those things and send them all to uh tulsi gabbers from russia or whatever else i'm gonna do is that legal in the polit i know it's illegal in the in the free market because they do it all the time is it legal in the political side as far as i know i i am not i have not come across any kind of like legislation against adwords in google there there are there are no laws or rules in place from a government perspective that that limit what these big tech monopolies can do with their algorithms and that's part of the whole issue here when we talk about big tech the monopolies the power that they have to either promote or push forward certain voices or people or ideas and silence others and they can do so while being completely legally immune from any kind of accountability through our legal system because they're private companies well because yeah because they're private companies but this section 230 provision that exists within the law that was was put in place to encourage innovation on the internet early you know decades ago when they passed that law it that gave them this legal immunity it said that they can they can remove content that they deem to be objectionable without any definition of what that is first of all whatever they want it to be whatever they want it to be and then it says whether or not it is protected by the constitution dang how i don't know who wrote that part of it probably the same bastard that clicked delete onto your freaking account for six hours but to have something in there that says you internet you know service provider company you can decide what speech you deem or content objectionable or not whether or not it is protected by our constitution this is the problem that needs to be fixed within our laws today as it relates to big tech and it's a relatively there's a lot of iv and i've looked at this a lot while i was in congress and then after for obvious reasons and you know there's a lot of different proposals and different ways to kind of bite this apple but the most simple and direct way would be to take out that objectionable content just take those words out and instead um you know you can say unless it is unless it you know you you can remove content unless it is protected under the first amendment and there's legal precedence in place through various supreme court rulings that provide very clear kind of guard rails towards what kind of speech is protected versus what is not and that way if if we make this legislative change it would alleviate the kind of pressure that these big companies are under right now coming from the left and the right because then they can just say look these are the guard rails this is speech that's protected and it's going to remain on the internet and speech that's not protected then it's up to us to make that decision to to uh to remove it that that's that's the that's the best answer that i have come across on how to um address this rather than allowing this you know i mean now we have like okay well we're going to cancel anything that's disinformation we're going to cancel anything that's misinformation we're going to you know cancel anything that um we don't like or you know i mean it's getting worse and worse and unfortunately the direction that i'm seeing from democrats in congress is not towards hey how do we protect free speech but instead it's we need big tech to do more to shut people up who are saying things that uh we deem to be misinformation or disinformation or that could mislead people into believing a certain thing or seeing a certain view and it's it's it is you know the the fact that this is happening and people don't see the danger of okay you're in power today you got kevin mccarthy who's the head of the republicans in the house saying i bet my house on the fact that republicans will regain the majority in 2022. what are you going to do when the tables turn and then you've got the other guys in power saying yeah you know what we don't want democrats to be misleading people on the internet so we're going to tweak the language a little bit and make sure that big tech silences those voices and pushes like it's it's so simple and clear dangerous of a position that we are in and that when you when you threaten the first amendment like freedom of speech a free press like freedom of religion um once you undermine that what do we have in america we don't we don't have we don't have the country we don't have our country yeah we did um we did a podcast and we recorded it before christmas but we did it on 1980 the book 1984. i listened to that yeah and it was really weird because we just you know it's just something that i was like all the same things that are going on and i and i you know read that book many many years ago and i remembered this one part of it was about the language and the importance of language and the therefore the importance of free speech and we recorded it and then like it was christmas time and that that podcast came out january 6th and it was kind of crazy that it came out on that day it just we had recorded it a month prior and you had scheduled it for that it was just that's when it's coming out so it came out january 6th then 1984 was trending and then the the tat the hashtag 1984 some some hashtag 1984 actually got shut down on twitter it was i don't know it was all it wasn't it wasn't because of that podcast but it was just very coincidental that all that was happening at the same time but the point of doing that podcast and this is exactly aligned with what you're saying you have to allow people to communicate with each other yeah and you know saying if you if if you say something to me that's misleading i can't just it's what i started off with i just don't say shut up you're not allowed to talk i say okay well actually tulsi let me show you some other information that might change your mind a little bit because by the way when i just tell you to shut up i don't move your opinion at all in fact there's a really good chance that i'm just going to make you even stronger on that opinion and that's what's happening in the country right now which is freaking nasty and and yeah and actually that again interestingly as all this was happening we we had had i talked to echo i was like listen man i don't know what's gonna happen in the world and i don't know what's gonna happen look we don't we're not on here making any uh inflammatory statements we're usually talking about history i said and that's cool we'll that's what we're gonna do but at some point people are starting to change history and i said i don't know what's gonna even happen with the platforms that we're on yeah like these platforms could change the way they do business and we started our own platform just to make sure that we have some place to someplace to go in the event that things take a turn for the worse and there's a bunch of other things that could happen i mean you could have some of these free platforms say all right we're going to start charging money and start inserting ads into the middle of you know here's jocko talking about a a battle in world war ii and it's heavy and crazy and emotional and some someone's gonna insert an ad in there like i don't want that i don't want people to have to put up with that so i don't know or do we just get someone to say look hey jonko you talked about this part of history which you know we don't really like we think it's misinformation and pull it down that's that's that's a reality that could happen yeah so we have to be wha that's why we made we made the the jocko underground just because of that uh so that's the platform that you guys created it's the platform yeah jacounderground.com and it's just a backup and look some people are like oh you want money i was like no we don't want your money yeah that's not what it's about but to not have a contingency plan is ignorant and so and again all that what's funny about all this is i had talked to echo about it he was kind i said hey can you build something figure this out he's you know working and figuring it out and eventually goes yeah you know i got it i mean this was before the end of 2020 this is before the end of 2020. it was a let's have a contingency plan in case something happened right and then i said you know what this is getting squirrely it's getting squirrely let's launch the contingency plan you know next month just to have just to get it out there so people know what it is in case something happens and sure enough january 6th it was like boom we had it was so coincidental but it was very it was like and i remember texting echo like well i guess this is why we had a contingency plan and thank god it launched today because who knows where it's going to be in six months i don't know i don't know it's crazy i remember um listening to that night so i i don't i have not listened like i have friends of mine who have listened to your podcast from number one and then uh those people are my friends too yeah but but like in in sequence like chronologically and like um a buddy of mine got to the the i think it was episode 99 as musashi 100 100 well he couldn't get past 99 because he didn't finish reading the book and i'm like hey jocko just did this new show on i can't do it because i can't listen to 100 until i read the book so check yeah spoiled so i'm not one of those people i'll jump around you've missed episodes echo is disappointing i'll jump around like okay what am i in the mood like what am i in the mood for wait am i in the mood for dark depressing war am i in the mood for human atrocity where am i at and i'll tell you a funny story about that in a second but um i went straight for that 1984 and i don't remember what actual day it was it was not january 6 but it was in in the days after and i i wondered then if when you had recorded that because it was literally addressing everything that we were seeing play out right right before us as far as the warning signs and the dangers of this is where this is where you end up uh once you allow for this kind of control and once we as people accept it um but a little sidetrack funny story and i'll show you the video after um because it'll take me a minute to dig it up but it won't surprise you to know that on the presidential campaign trail sleep was hard to come by for me and for two reasons one was just a factor of time in the day but also it was tough for me to um tough for me to turn turn everything off and actually just get like i'm not even talking about hours i'm just talking about just some a good a slice of good quality rest and sleep we were in new hampshire in the middle of winter and there was a rare opportunity where i got to take a nap and we'd like rented a like an airbnb or something like that and so i took a nap and my husband took a video of me taking a nap because he walked in the room and i'm i'm lying there and i'm asleep and i'm all bundled up under the covers and i got my phone sitting on my um on the top of the covers and i was listening to jocko podcast with a guy from the french foreign legion [Music] and i'll show you the video because i am dead asleep and uh my husband came in and he has the camera going picks up my phone looks at and the reason i remember this was because this was on february 11th february 11th 2020 and it just so happened that it popped up on my phone on february 11th of this year as like the memory thing or whatever and i was debating sending it to you and i told my husband i was like oh he doesn't get the wrong idea and think i'm like bored to death on this podcast and he's like no what it showed was like i was able to completely tune out the noise of of what was going on in my mind of the day to day and and be able to kind of be transported to a different conversation and topic and and all this other stuff but it was a great podcast that i did end up finishing but you gave me the gift of some really good sleep as well the soothing the soothing voice of choco talking about war can send anyone to sleep i don't know what that says about me and what makes me relax anyhow i remember when uh when you dropped out of the race and you you um endorsed biden yeah and i remember thinking because again i didn't know a lot of these things that you're telling me right now i knew them kind of but i still i i still had a some sort of naive sense in my heart that it can't be that bad and i remember i texted you and i said like hey are you gonna get the vp naught is this cause i was i was kind of surprised you endorsed biden i was like well you know what oh i said oh i know what's happening she's playing the game she's going to endorse biden bind's going to get her as the vp it's on and you were like you like you like however you laugh and text you're like hey hey bro you're a little bit uh you're a little bit lost there oh and then so so then you wrapped up your your career well you wrapped up this portion of your career as a politician in in that was it went out to dc for the last congressional session yeah packed up your locker january 2nd was my last official day we had to pack up the office before thanksgiving so uh no kidding you know we were there were obviously votes going into december there was uh you know government's gonna shut down if we don't pass a new appropriations bill and kind of the unfortunate usual thing that happens at the end of every year um but yeah i was working out of my car like parked in front of the capitol i had my computer and it's covered so you know votes consist of seven different groups of members of congress i was group two it's by alphabetical order where you're only allowed to have a certain number of people on the floor at any given time they decontaminate the whole floor between every vote and so when your group is called you go in cash your vote and then you leave and so that was like a park my votes are called sometimes they last for you know an hour or two hours or whatever and if you've got four votes in a series then you're doing this running in and out you know four times in that series and so yeah i was you know office office shut down before thanksgiving had to turn in everything so that they could um transition and start to bring in other members of congress and i should mention now that that um i made the decision not to run for re-election to my house seat in october of 2019 when it it got to the point where i had to make a decision where i would either continue my candidacy or i would suspend my presidential campaign and focus on running for reelection in hawaii and i couldn't do both legally i could have but just the constraints of of time and the tyranny of distance it was not i was i would end up doing a crappy job at both so that was the decision i made i i you know let folks and i wanted people in hawaii to know that um you know they were not some kind of fallback plan for me if this national thing didn't work out and that they would have the opportunity and the time to decide who they would want you know to to work for them and other candidates who who um who are going to run so and that was a decision i never looked back on um or regretted in any way but as a result of that yeah so i think things started quickly and having to shut down in dc but january 2nd was was the actual final day were you um heading home kind of stoked that it was over or were you heading home kind of bummed out that it was over mixed feelings really mixed feelings um again i made that decision without regret and so it wasn't any surprise that this was going to happen at this point in time but i mean i remember landing at dulles airport and on that last trip and as i was driving into dc like i'm not gonna make this drive again as a member of congress at least and uh even as screwed up as things are and as frustrating as things are and have progressively gotten it never takes away the awesomeness of that privilege of being able to serve uh in that in that way and you know there are grooves have you have you been inside the state capital the the the capital before the us capital when you go inside there are you know uh marble steps that take you up to the the actual entrance to the house floors on the second floor and then the visitors galleries on the third floor when you walk those steps there are they're deeply worn grooves where countless other leaders from our nation's history have walked those very steps and the the um it's an amazing thing to to never forget those who have come before us those who will come after and how special of a privilege it is that the people of hawaii allowed me that privilege to to do my best to serve them for the eight years uh that i was there and that was that was you know yeah i there's so much of the political drama and and just the theatrics and the all of the stuff that you just kind of gotta endure in order to try to do the work that you're trying to do and and i i've always hated all that stuff and had no no problem at all leaving that uh that behind but i think the the the mixed feelings and emotions part just came from um just that that reflecting on the time that i've had there and honestly wishing that there are a lot of areas and things that i wish i could have done more on that i could have you know um legislation that i wished had been able to advance farther or it's just different things you know assessing kind of what i was able to do what i wished i was able to do and um but but leaving with the sense of of peace uh in my heart in in knowing that you know i i did my best and excited about how i can find uh how i will find a way to continue to serve so you get back home to hawaii and i know when i came back from my last deployment to iraq i had um i was home for i was home for like a month and one day i just like woke up on a saturday and i kind of felt like this weird weight i i felt good right i felt good and i felt like the weight was gone and i was kind of thinking about what what wha why do i feel so good right now and i realized oh it's because i'm not worried about one of my guys getting wounded or killed right now because we're home from deployment and it took me about a month for that to go away because it's just your instinct every time every time you wake up you you're thinking about what's happening is is everyone okay you're thinking about that all the time and i never noticed it when i was on deployment because that's just how it was it was just you know you just wake up and that's what you're thinking and it's real well after a month of waking up and oh no it's not you don't have to worry about that oh oh no you don't have to worry about that and eventually one day i woke up and said why don't i feel oh it's because i'm not worried about that thing i've been worried about for so long when you got home i mean the how long did it take for that to wear off the pressure the the constantly thinking about all this crap that's going on and what you need to do and where you need to move and what's the next maneuver and who's mad at you and who's happy with you and all this other crap how long did it take you for for you like oh i hope i have oh wait do i have wax for my surfboard right now how long did that take not very long you were able to get i was ready man but it also you know i mean just this whole covid situation also um you know i i had been home a lot more than i normally would have been and working from home and having virtual committee hearings and a lot of other stuff that was just it was a strange lead-up to where the contrast wasn't so different um but it was it was odd for me like it started august is when our primary elections are in hawaii and i remember waking up on primary election day which is saturday in hawaii and i was like oh my gosh i'm don't have to go sign waving at six o'clock in the morning um i can i can go surfing like this is a weird feeling because i had held elected office for the previous 10 years i'd been on a ballot every single election for the previous 10 years and so that was that was strange that was a really weird thing that was felt unnatural uh to me and then and then you know similarly um with the general election but yeah i was um i had no issue with that transition and and yeah went on to to uh take full advantage of of being home and knowing that well really a lot of it was being able to regain control over how i spent my time and have to to to no longer have those very immediate political factors playing into decisions that i'm making and um just to just to be for the first time in a long time not have not been constantly jet-lagged that was something i didn't realize took such a toll for eight years i'm going back and forth two or three times a month between hawaii and dc five or six hours difference every time plane rides are long but that was not an ass whatever i can it's a plane ride um but you know like like i can actually like get a schedule happening and stick with it and not be up at two o'clock in the morning because it's eight in dc and then you know go to sleep at six cause it's midnight like it's just you know it was just just basic like simple life things like i i like to cook like i could act like hey like i'm like i can go grocery shopping and cooking and not have to worry like is the food gonna rot by the time i have to leave and then come back it's just like simple little things um it was it's it's nice so let's get into what you're settling into now the dust is settled and you're able to buy groceries cook them before they rot you're able to surf yeah train get on a schedule but obviously that's not what you're going to do for the rest of your life yeah what else is going on what else you got going on in the world so i am uh so i'm still serving in the army reserves i have i moved from the national guard to the reserves and uh transitioned my branch to civil affairs awesome which um is often called kind of the the warrior diplomat service and um yeah it's it's fantastic it's been a great move and one that's focused on building relationships and uh it's kind of kind of right at my eyes something i've been interested for a really long time that that i never pursued because it doesn't exist within the national guard for obvious reasons the national guard focuses domestic mission first but civil affairs is 98 of civil affairs forces in the united states army live within the army reserves there's the remaining whatever two percent is um basically lives on on fort bragg as part of the the unconventional um special forces community and so uh yeah i i'm appreciating the training the experience and also some of the missions that i've already been able to serve on there um i as as kind of a direct result of everything that we talked about with my experience with the the mainstream media and being filtered into you know or limited to sound bites their unwillingness to go in depth or even really cover any real issues serious issues and just the caricatures that they they create um i am launching my own show where i will have the opportunity to um really speak uh directly to people in an unfiltered way and an unlimited way um both both about a lot of you know some of these issues that we've talked about and have conversations with people who can shed light and bring their expertise or experience on them but also just be able to have a platform where i can take some of those experiences that i've had and i'm sure you've had the same because i've seen it in the military i've seen it in politics where whether it's traveling to different parts of the country or traveling to different parts of the world there's there's so much more that we have in common as people than um is often focused on or that we even we may realize and so i look forward to being able to to have that platform my show is called this is tulsi gabbard just because it is just me um and and use that as as a an opportunity to be able to fill that gap or or to provide what uh the mainstream media and the corporate media is not offering uh to to people and and that i found there's there is there's a lot of hunger for that for real conversation whether it's with people you agree with or or to have a dialogue you know i want to be able to have people on my show who represent different views on an issue and who are interested in having a respectful conversation about it and why you hold one view why do you hold the other view where is their common ground where is their irretractable differences where where do you draw the line and and i think being able to um provide this platform i hope will result in more people thinking like hey maybe i can start talking to my neighbor who voted for the other guy or the other party and we haven't really talked for like a year because of it but maybe we should just like start the conversation and see where it goes and that it's okay and that we in america should be encouraging civil discourse and dialogue and um encouraging when we talk about what we have to protect freedom of speech what does that mean well you know and how do you do it like let's start with um speaking sharing our ideas and not as you started this whole our conversation today not in a way that says i'm right you're wrong i have to be heard you don't get to be heard but in a way that that um that we don't see now where if you believe in something you hold a view that you feel is important strong and communicate that also recognize that not everyone may share that view for whatever reason maybe they have a different background a different experience and one that you may not have and that the more we can encourage this kind of exchange the stronger we are as a society that we don't lose by having uh great platforms for people to share them and that that's the biggest difference between what we're seeing today versus what i believe our founders envisioned for us where somehow we've come to a place where the powerful people in this country think that it's it's really a sign of insecurity where if those who hold different views are allowed to air them then somehow you'll lose which means maybe you're not confident yeah that what you're offering is going to quote unquote win or convince people that it is a superior idea yep it's it's so it it plays out leadership strategy and tactics i talk about this you know if you if i'm in charge and tulsi you say hey hey jonko i don't think we should do it like that and my response is shut up and do what i told you to do i don't look strong no i look weak yeah i look weak if i say well tulsi how do you think we should do it and i listened to your idea and i incorporate some of your idea into the overall plan because you were able to convince me because you had a different perspective than i did you'll see you'll look at me and think oh i really like working with working for jocko i really like working with jocko because he's listening to what i'm saying and all of a sudden we're coming up with actual better solutions by the way it's not like it's oh i'm doing this to appease to appease tulsi right now so she'll you know work harder for me no she's actually got a presentation to me that actually makes more sense we're gonna use it yeah so we're trying to get somewhere so this is a podcast your new your new show yeah it'll be uh you know available on all the podcast platforms [Music] we're also doing video it so i i i um so i i talked to you some time ago and asked some questions about how you launch a podcast and such and um one of the things you told me about was consistency is key both of you that's that's uncontrolled well the message was received and so what i'm doing is so so soon within within the next few weeks but i'm recording a number of shows to have in the bank to make sure that you know hey i got to go away to training for a couple of weeks that we're not gonna we're not gonna um skip a beat so how long is the show have you recorded somewhere i have yeah uh you know i there no no real time limit but right now they're about not like an hour and a half ish you're not going jocko psycho four hours i'm not opposed to it but no no no rules no rules and i i think that's that's the cool thing about it so is that the main focus of your effort training right now it is yeah you're gonna launch this show and uh i think probably by the end of this month is what i'm aiming for awesome so where can people find you uh people can find uh me at tulsi gabbard on all the social media platforms um and also on my website uh tulsi gabbard.com there's there's a few different things that that i'm looking to do there updates and and information and i've i've moved it away from what it was traditionally which is a political campaign website and and really focusing more on how we can um build communities and conversation uh in our in our society i don't care if you're democrat republican independent i don't care if you voted for trump or voted for hillary or whatever none of that should matter as we come together to to um rebuild bridges focused on how we collectively as americans can work together for the future of our country legit charles yes um that seems like a good place to wrap this this session i don't know maybe this a good place to wrap up this session sure tulsi's obviously been charging hard for well since you were 16 years old as a water woman which again we will be certain we will be scouring the internet for that she's been on the path echo charles and i'm thinking we should be on the path too what suggestions do you have do i have hey when you go to the grocery store do people like stop you a lot still in hawaii definitely oh yeah they do that foodland which is interesting because and i say i know you you're water woman i don't know where those kids are now hey billy how you doing i remember you where's your cape yeah exactly it's still there it's the same town yeah on on kauai like when you'd see the mayor yeah at wherever you know star market for sure um yeah you'd always stop and be like hey you know so i would imagine if someone had like some thing you know something they want to address they they wouldn't hesitate to stop you because you're right there it happened most recently um i was out surfing the reef near the mokulua islands and the east side of oahu and the surf there only goes off like it's only really good when there's no wind and there's swell obviously and it's it's a long it's it's like three quarters of a mile paddle from shore out there uh but it happened most recently there like usually it's like someone will paddle up be like where do i know you from and then and then like one as an advantage like oh yeah hi i'm tulsa oh my god that's what i thought and then word in the lineup travels pretty quickly and the last time i was a couple of weeks ago the waves were really stayed out for four hours and um people just like hey tulsi guys on stand-up boards looking down at me on my surfboard and talking stories like oh what this whatever it's so it's it's cool i like it yeah imagine so you go to sandy beach um i have been i generally stay away from i don't want to threaten like my life by body searching at sandy's short break do you uh yeah bowser that was our spot yeah for sure but back in the day back in the day all right how are we staying on the path okay all right all right we're working out we're surfing yeah snowboarding zombo are you a snowboarder i ski snowboard but echo charles has recently become highly engaged in snowboard shredding oh i like it it's true but we are working out and training for various things so i was pretty stoked when you were running and you put like um whatever videos of you doing squats yeah and i'm like come on go did we get a couple percentage points of increase on just doing burpees i was giving credit i was like yeah i kind of you know i'm leaning in your direction just see you do a burpee that's all good in the polls yeah watching that saying oh there's tulsi doing burpees hey let's at least throw a dog right come on let me earn it with some burpees it's freaking ridiculous yeah i didn't really see much uh burpees by joe biden or anything i didn't see yeah i didn't see joe biden doing any burpees nobody else nobody really else kind of got on the the fitness kick yeah crazy all good nonetheless we're going to stay on the path over here so through the path we may need supplementation i would suggest supplementation don't worry chocolate i believe in that it's true yeah true story 100 so here you go you got joints that need attention sometimes especially when we get older we're not eating younger is this the collective week as far as okay because i know i'm not yeah i vote against it stay in the same age i get it but for those of us who are you know we want to get something that helps in the routine supplementation for joints protein brain body all this stuff so what do we got joint warfare joints krill oil joints discipline and discipline go brain and body how's that discipline going this this is good i i this is the first time i'm trying the the discipline go jocko palmer drink very good tasty very good no sugar in that yeah see i use monk fruit like in my protein shakes and stuff like what's up yeah man too sweet didn't it to sweeten it yeah because you get you get you get the good natural like healthy sweetener without like the carbs of like maple syrup for example guess who just made the the clip of the wheat oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's my girl tulsa which maple syrup is my my go like i would only eat pancakes to have maple syrup really but you know i can't did you get any maple syrup from pete up in up in maine no pete come on man yeah he's out there and he used to do it himself but now you know it's just like friends and and it's real maple syrup you can go up there oh man that was and sorry echo i'm messing with your jam here man but it's your jam one of the coolest experiences well there were many but one of the coolest was when i stopped in freedom new hampshire and went to a sugar shack met with the three generations of family who have passed down from you know father to child uh and got to see the whole thing we went up to the trees saw the taps came down saw the whole process and then of course like sampled the goods i'm like maple syrup is it ever since i've been a kid like those little maple leaf candies and you're just done finished i was up in maine talking to pete and he's like a sugar addict he obviously can't eat it that's why but he he was saying he would take little um a pencil box you know the pencil box you had when you were a little kid he would fill that with sugar cubes and hide it underneath his bed and at night when he'd go to bed he put like a little crack at it he started like going into a different realm mentally and he goes he goes bro have you ever tried have you ever eaten sugar he's talking to me about yeah like crazy you were when were you you were talking about that right on like um a thing yeah one of the origin videos came out you showed me talking about that yes so it did sound crazy the way you were talking about but then i remember like we didn't just buy sugar cubes but every once in a while like you'd get the little pack right with all the sugar cubes and it and i'd eat those two they're like little candies yeah but it's like pure it's like main lining the sugar it's kind of good i i didn't hide them on my bed stealing those things from your own family and putting them in it's like a little psycho right that's different you know well monk fruit yeah no sugar yeah exactly that's not sugar monk fruit is good stuff it's natural and by the way we went the distance and i held out long the other thing that's cool about this drink is which was really hard to do is the way that you make it stay good on the shelf is it has to you have to preserve it somehow and what companies normally do is they just add chemicals to it right and they're called preservatives we've all heard of that right yes well instead of using preservatives which i didn't want to do it's it's pasteurized so it's like cooked so there's no but there's no chemicals in it but it costs us a ton of money to get it going and it took us an extra almost it took us over six months to get this all set up but then we did it now you can drink this and your kids can drink it my own kids can drink my drink it's something that my my mom always encouraged us and it's like a habit i got into from a young age like just read the ingredients before you buy it and if you don't understand half of the things that are on the ingredients then you know think twice about you know putting it in your body let me ask you if you understand these ingredients filtered carbonated water natural flavor citric acid monk fruit that's the ingredient list done and it has the vitamin b6 and b12 like it's got the other positive things right the actual the the food ingredients that's it that's incredible and more people are becoming conscious of this these days for sure really i mean more people are becoming aware and whether it's because of health like diabetes and or whatever else but i think there's just an increased level of awareness of like hey and and even more so with covid like i really should be healthy i should strengthen my immune system and i should know what i'm consuming i felt so bad the last time you visited so whatever three months ago something like that you came by we didn't have time to record i didn't have time to record or whatever but you just came by to hang out a little bit and whatever two days later i called you up and said hey hey or i sent you a text hey how you doing you're like fine i'm like got something to tell you you're like what i'm like i got covered luckily i only saw like 10 people yeah in that time period of whatever that week was where i knew i had well i had been uh tested positive for covet texted echo he's like yeah i can't smell anything this is a bummer dude i felt bad about that but um it happens unfortunately yeah but um yeah so there you go yeah you talk about the immunity thing yeah so come to find out giaco has that covered as well as far as supplementation goes vitamin d3 helps with immunity and a special supplement called cold war it was again this was crazy right like so i before covered i traveled all the time on planes on you know all the time and you know the nightmare of that and you're breathing in everyone's stuff and so i said you know what i'm gonna make you know a good immunity booster with a bunch of vitamin c and just things that and so i made it and cool and it was selling good and whatever but then covet hit yeah and the tooth and i also made vitamin d already made it this isn't like oh it's it's covered it was already in the system it was already it was already live because i only i take vitamin d and boom as soon as covet hit it was like we could we had to just we we sold out almost immediately and then we just had to ramp it up but luckily we had already had the formulas built so that stuff is awesome cold war and then and the vitamin d3 that's true all good for you i'm a supplement taker just in general but i was not taking vitamin d prior to covid nor was i really aware of how important it was until i started to learn and read more and see especially related to covid how most americans are deficient like vast majority of americans are deficient in vitamin d and especially people who have any kind of you know colored tone to their skin even more so um are found to be deficient in vitamin d so uh i am now a daily consumer well vitamin d yeah yeah i learned that when we had our daughter where everything you know you read for best development all this stuff vitamin d was always popping up with everything oh yeah vitamin vitamin d that's true but yeah so yeah got some get some vitamin d also don't forget about milk this is extra protein in the form of a dessert yeah by the way sometimes it's just dessert that has protein straight up yeah especially if you get your little formula down like some people they just go milk milk milk almond milk whatever cool good but some of us we we have our perfectly tuned formula yeah half a spoon of peanut butter one scoop mint chocolate one scoop peanut butter chocolate one banana damn wow give milk or two percent milk boom that's the formula in my household i randomly tried almond milk with peanut butter milk bro yeah legitimate what is up that's a freaking milkshake yeah that's a milkshake so that i added a banana like reluctantly like i was like okay banana because sometimes banana can jam up your whole flavor profile let me ask you this are they frozen or fresh both whatever because okay and then because the result is a little bit different it's possible i'm not that advanced to tell the difference and here dude here's why i know about the frozen banana when a banana is starting to get uh rotten a little bit pass right because the brown is taking over you can peel it and freeze it that's what i do yes i didn't know that sarah told me that she's like cool sure enough she has two of them frozen inside because i needed a banana so i put the frozen one in i was like man this works perfect yeah they get creamier when they're frozen check this out over four hours for you to finally drop this knowledge the secrets okay good we grew my mom used to make ice cream at home from frozen bananas and just like literally put them through the champion juicer freeze them put them through the champion juicer maybe add a little bit of like whatever something to kind of like put it up to the next level but like you have like homemade soft serve immediately so the frozen bananas i vouch for i i'm waiting for the plant-based mulk yeah to come out i don't know if i talked to you or pete about that but you may have talked to both of us [Music] but that's that's what i do is for for um after my workouts every day my first meal that's my first meal is a shake i kind of fast until after that but i i do the the protein powder the almond milk the peanut butter just a healthy healthy solid dollop someone's going to stir off got the frozen banana and then i throw in i throw in some chia seeds some pumpkin seeds and flax seeds you guys make me feel like the amateur is over i don't know i go i go milk dawn that seems it's true it's a hearty shake but then i'm like i'm good like i'm good until like you know i have like an early dinner that's it yeah yeah that's kind of the good thing you can use it for many different reasons you know you can do like a meal replacement or just a supplementation for the protein you said you said protein and flex double flexed your biceps we can get these things at many places if you're gonna be on the lookout for any of these places you can get all this stuff at first wawa east coast what was only on the east coast alright yes okay wawa um origin main.com jockofuel.com jacofuel.com kind of the same what do you call it trajectory yeah gold vitamin c i'm talking about and the vitamin c yes sir by the way this is important actually because shipping is a problem right financially it can cost a lot of money to ship something here's the deal if you subscribe to any of these items shipping is free wow so we're trying to look there's we're talking about tech companies there's obviously some big tech companies out there that are hard to compete with in fact we you can't beat them join them we join them it's fine you can get the stuff there because it's free shipping you know it's like a it's like sort of a that's a prime merry reason why people might order from this particular place which is cool we're down we appreciate it 100 that's fine but if you wanted to just go straight to the source but you didn't want to spend money on shipping we got you covered and it took us a while to figure out how we could balance it if you subscribe shipping's free on whatever you order so that's kind of kind of huge when you're talking about it's a very strange protein you're right yeah and echo no offense to echo sometimes he's not quite the pinnacle of organization when it comes i'm doing the best thing so diplomatic i love it look again look i prefaced it by saying no offense so therefore you can't be offended yeah hey i'm doing the best i can over here i'm out of mulch by the way there you go why aren't you subscribed uh well you got issues yeah is that issues nonetheless over there flexing your biceps nonetheless hey look this is where how and where we can get all these things also way to stay on the path do jiu jitsu or martial arts martial arts it's good for you let's go for your mind body i'm glad you're being diplomatic now well he's being diplomatic and like including being all inclusive of all martial arts he's never said anything like that before ever we talk about doing martial arts we're talking about jiu jitsu over here on our side i think that's what we're talking about you are correct but go ahead continue mr diplomatic thank you you've improved his diplomacy already today just hanging out with you he's got aloha that's true normally this guy has no aloha for other martial arts oh it's like that you're here okay everything's cool well either way whatever martial arts we're doing i say do that stuff in the event of you doing jiu jitsu you're gonna need a gui and or rash guard get those as well from origin how much did you do have you trained a little bit not a lot i mean at the most the most if you could i guess within the family would be the army combatives oh okay just legit yeah the army combatives is a great program yeah developed by jiu jitsu guys exactly i i early on i guess the the the martial art that i trained the most in was was brazilian capoeira oh that's right i was makes me laugh every time i hear you pronouncing english words with a brazilian portuguese accent oh okay i was like yeah i know what that's about although i talked i said earlier starting off this program that i'm very look i just say what i say when it comes to you know brazilian portuguese words like if you're going to talk to me about oh you train capoeira i'm coming at you like a pro that's what we do overall now well and because of that i took summer classes in brazilian portuguese in hawaii like uh like trying to learn the lang i was i was getting fully immersed in the culture and and started to do a lot of a lot of my friends who did capoeira also did jiu jitsu and met a lot there's a huge brazilian community in hawaii because of surfing and obviously most of them do either capoeira and jiu jitsu as well and uh but i just i was kind of um consumed i was training like six hours a day in capoeira and that was that was i was starting to teach and i was doing a bunch of stuff there um but yeah so so the most time i spent doing any kind of grappling was was army combatives which was fun well it's cool because now you're going to be on the journey of jiu jitsu we're going to get you a gear yeah i want i really i i want to learn and i'm a big mixed martial arts fan i have been for a long time and yeah you went up and trained with duke rufus right yeah that was an incredible surprise that i was not expecting but he was there to train um zhang wai lee and she was passing through doing a publicity thing so i got to meet her and spar i use that word very generously she's like come at me like kick me punch like do something like i don't know but it was like like getting to hit some pads with duke was freaking incredible yeah and uh yeah it was awesome i've cornered a bunch of fighters at ufc and and whenever duke rufus was there he's just like such an awesome guy super cool super nice yeah super i mean obviously he's a great trainer and everything but i just remembered thinking this guy's just freaking rad yeah just totally totally and he makes you know like he made us feel just great and um but what i was gonna say is the thing that i've always appreciated most most about mixed martial arts is you know yeah there are guys who are stronger in boxing or striking or whatever but this the strategery that goes into fighters who have a very strong ground game when you really watch it is i've just incredible and that that's what i've loved most about uh the sport is the strategic thinking that goes into like i'm gonna do this and set you up for where i'm gonna put you in you know six moves later or oh yeah whatever so yeah i'm now now that i'm a little bit more free um i i really do i've been telling my husband this i want to i want to learn we have connections yesterday in the hawaiian islands uh speaking of geese jiu jitsu geez and jeans and boots you went to the factory in maine right now i did visited the origin factory in maine and to say i was stoked is an understatement and we made a little social media video video about it and and you know got some footage of pete showing us around and talking about what they do um brought the local media with us and local media did a story on on uh on origin but my husband will tell you in the car ride leaving i was so freaking stoked it was it was completely unexpected because i've had the privilege of going and visiting a number of you know local businesses and shops but the thing that really like struck home for me like in a in a visceral way was awesome products but the spirit uh the spirit of origin came through loud and clear not just because pete's good at talking about it but because of what i experienced in the people who work there and the sense of pride and the sense of of ownership of the thing that says right there we get to do this and and how deeply you all have built the foundation of this american business in the fabric of america and that like i was like i left there and i'm like i told pete i was like um like where do i sign up like how do i how do i join this because this is freaking amazing and i talked about it and just shared that's why i wanted to share um that video and just the experience of being able to go and visit and it was not on the way like farmington maine is on the way to nowhere else i was going and it was literally like i i called an audible on my team and i'm like yeah we're in maine and i'm gonna take a two hour like detour to go and visit because the story of that you guys are sharing of origin maine is the story that needs to inspire america especially now in what what we can do what we can do here at home and that yes this is about supporting a local business it's about supporting america and american jobs but it goes so much deeper than that that yeah of course there are challenges and there as adversity and you know foreign trade and like all of these other things but just like um you know pete talks about how he started right in his freaking backyard and built a factory because there wasn't one where there's a will there's a way and when you're rooted in this foundation of not just hey how can we make a bunch of money but how do how do you use business as a means to serve and have a positive impact in your community in the lives of the people who work there in the customers who know like hey i'm not just buying a product that's cool i'm supporting a mission that's much greater than any one of us as individuals and will have a much longer lasting impact yeah if you were to take what you just said if you were if you and i were to look at each other and say hey let's make a business and let's make you know let's make clothes let's make apparel let's make shoes and let's make money the last thing we would do to make money is try and build a factory in america correct and source everything from america is absolutely sad and there's company upon company upon company that their primary goal is to make money that's their primary goal it's not to make a quality product it's not to be innovative with their products it's not to rebuild their community it's not to put money back into the community it's not to not to bring manufacturing back to america that's that's not even on their radar those are our primary goals now in order to do that we do we have to make money yes absolutely and we will but that's not why we're doing it if we just wanted to make money we wouldn't be there would be no factory it'd be it'd be a sweat shop yeah overseas that's what it would be we're not going to do that we're never going to do that and you'd be no different than most of the others that you know and and it would you wouldn't be you origin wouldn't be origin then ab absolutely and to be quite frank with you money could not drive me or inspire me or motivate me one 100th the amount that it does to know that there's people in that town yes that are working that are have a career now you know we're taking millennials and teaching them a a skill that was oh was so close to being lost you saw them i did millennials that their skills that were i mean our our guy lenny just died but he before he died he was able to pass on his knowledge that can be passed on because it's saved it's there yeah we're we're there and it's you also i was so stoked you know you and i were texting back and forth and i think i was trying to get you a pair of boots i was like hey we'll get you some boobs yeah we had somebody deliver you boots but for you to go up there was i was so stoked that you could go up there and you could see it and and you know it's very cool too like i'll hear joe rogan talking about origin and even though he's not been there like he knows it's very cool when i saw when i heard him talking about origen and he was just talking about it with some someone else that was was on his show when i heard him talking about it so passionately i realized this is people get it you don't just you look it's awesome when you go there and obviously when you go there it's visceral when you go there but even if you don't go there you know you know that some that pair of jeans that you're wearing those are those are american made the hands that harvested the cotton processed it every step that's the amazing thing is and i you know some of my some of my friends in the military especially when they got their stimulus checks they're like i'm gonna make a choice with this money and i'm gonna go shopping at origin because cool stuff but i'm supporting america with these dollars and that that's the difference and that's the impact and and i i i loved sharing the story of my experience there to help inspire others who may aspire to do something similar but feel like the obstacles are too great but but and whether it's business or whatever i mean that the point is the motivation and the spirit of getting back to not planning this but getting back to our origins of who we are as a country of entrepreneurs and innovators and people who are bringing different ideas to to um and the pride the pride uh that goes that goes along with that origin usa yeah originusa.com if you want to get any stuff from there it's made by americans for americans it's true also let me point your attention to jockostore.com this is where you can represent there's on the path there you go so yeah we have some some stuff that we have is from origin we got rash guards on there um also we have hoodies and shirts and you know discipline equals freedom this kind of stuff i'm saying if your seems to get uncomfortable and you start talking about him is it that obvious it is that obvious there's a visible shift here yeah in energy what's funny is it's kind of like a complimentary relationship because like my comfort increases when his discomfort increases so it's like cool that's why you can kind of sense some pride when i talk about the store store by the way anyway yes this will include shirts hoodies rash guards uh some hats on there some new stuff on there new design coming out soon oh really i'll let you know these are all things that happen decentralized command like i'm not over there pointing the finger and making things happen that's echo charles in his own little world well it's our world we have a subscription situation as well if you want like a new type of design kind of um is that where the is that where the run dmc t-shirt just came from yes that was legit that's good before they're done sometimes sometimes there is a level of decentralized command but i also some people in the organization will say occasionally need to get put in check so there is sometimes but occasionally these things slip by like he just made a run the md run dmc t-shirt but it says discipline but it it's ds what is it dsc pln yeah but it looks like the old school run dmc yeah t-shirt so it's freaking legit i thought so too there's also ones like the element you know the periodic table yeah the element yeah so it's element d and it has all the the atomic weight 434 nice layers anyway these are kind of offshoot designs but they're cool relevant and there's layers oh here's the thing that's jacked up now i just realized if you wanted that run dmc discipline shirt you can only get it if you subscribe if you're a subscriber to the shirt lock the shirt locker the shirt locker of echo it's true yeah once they're gone they're gone that's so mad so limited limited it's kind of a bummer yeah and by the way it seems like one person at this table does not have a subscription to this what's funny is i for real have a subscription i for real don't oh you were just jacked up brutal brutal i thought you were calling me out by not calling me out that's what i thought oh but okay there's two people that don't have a subscription apparently dang that makes two of us i guess or one of us whichever either way maybe i have some extra oh i'll hook you guys up oh man that'd be great is that cool yeah that'd be very nice if you could hook me up with my own stuff uh speaking of subscription subscribe to this podcast wherever you subscribe to podcasts also we have jocko unraveling which we're about to record somewhere this week awesome grounded

perspective than one you're getting uh in the news so um yeah i post those uh across youtube and across social media at tulsi gabbard psychological warfare is an album you did you know that i was an artist tulsi i did not i mean recording a recording artist so if you want to get my album um and it's the artist is jocko okay and the the album is called psychological warfare and there's a bunch of tracks on there that you can listen to whenever you need them is the wake up track one of them the wake up track apparently that was the sleep track sweet dreams uh flipside canvas flipsidecampus.com dakota meyer my brother he makes all kinds of cool stuff again american-made stuff that that is the highest quality puts all kinds of stuff that you can hang on your wall to remind you of the path got a bunch of books uh i got a book called final spin which is the novel not out yet comes out in september i've been tracking that yeah it's pretty crazy i just got the final or i just did the final edits it's it's freaking i was my daughter my oldest daughter read it i was like how can you review this and so she read it and you know your kids are always like gonna be harsh critics or whatever and my i said oh you know she got done reading it so you know how was it how did you like it and so she starts going you know i like this and i like that and then she she got to a point and she started because it's an emotional situation she started to cry oh my god this is not wall street this was after a day after she read it she started crying and she was like and and then i was kind of like oh i go i guess that's a good judge she was like just that that part so and i was like okay so it's very interesting so not the this is it's just not a sob story but it's uh you would want to write a book that moves people well i mean yeah i guess i guess if it's not going to have any impact or if it's going to have an impact that's a good thing to make people think yeah and it's a it's it's definitely even as i read it and i've read it now a hundred times because i have to edit it you know there's some parts where i'm reading it and it's definitely it's it's heavy it's heavy and it's got some really funny parts too a lot of the dialogue is really funny because i you know it's reflective of kind of the dialogue that i have with people even though it's not about me or is it i'm not sure it's open to interpretation yeah it's sort of an alternative anyways the book is called final spin and you can pre-order right now if you want to get a first a dish yes if you want to get a first a dish order it now and look thi this is going to be kind of a big deal to get the first edition of the first novel you know what i'm saying am i over hyping that is the second in the works this this book will have no follow-on okay um for various reasons it primarily includes it does conclude it is called final spin it is not like first spin so it is called final spin but also i it's it is it is complete sure in my mind it's complete and so i don't want to carry the story on but you have more novels than you oh yeah i mean i got 14 novels that i thought of during the last half an hour yeah awesome yeah it's um unfortunate for me it's always just people say oh i don't know what to write about oh my god i wish i had that problem so that's that final spin pre-order it leadership strategy and tactics field manual the code the evaluation the protocol display equals freedom field manual way the warrior kid four field manual that's out way the warrior kid one two and three mikey and the dragons i was listening to i was listening to jordan peterson okay yesterday and and he was just going off about the dragons which is sure a lot of what he does and interestingly enough i was like sounds like this book called mikey and the dragons so check that one out about face by david hackworth there's a forward by me and tulsi you've i just got it in the mail a couple of days before i left hawaii and i have read your forward okay and i'm just starting what's the impression starting the book um how incredibly impactful this book and this man has been on your life as a person but the thing that really um like spoke to me was how this was kind of um your go-to reference to help guide you through difficult leadership choices decisions challenges that you face in some of the most difficult environments i.e being in at war and and that you've never met the man and that was um that came through very clear kind of your gratitude to him um in having this this book that provided you with that place where you could find the answers that you couldn't find anywhere else or help you see things in a different way that you wouldn't have seen otherwise through his experiences and how he handled things or his perspective and then the the maybe the most important thing was that all of that came from the foremost concern being care for your guys his soldiers your seals soldiers who you were people who um you were responsible for and uh i i thought that was a really cool thing for me to come out i've only heard you talk about it but to come at this book and i'm really looking forward to re continuing to read it but to see that bridge in time and that that and conflicts and wars between a guy who served in vietnam and was a leader of soldiers in vietnam to you and the experience that you had as a leader serving in iraq and how there was such um powerful connection between two different leaders and two different wars and different places in different times that that's not something i've really heard of before it's weird because i as i read that book have you ever seen the movie the i think it's called the 13th warrior have you ever heard of this movie tom cruise no so anyways it's based on it's based on a book by michael crichton and i can't remember the name of the book that it's based upon but it's about this arabic person who gets somehow mixed up in with the vikings and there's a great scene and that the arabic guy is played by some famous actor god i can't think of it echo trump really wishes but they show they did they do this scene where he's learning to speak norwegian or whatever old norse whatever language you're speaking and the way that they cut it up they're speaking norwegian and then every once in a while an english word pops in which would have been an arabic movie or arabic word but it's a it's a it's an english speaking movie so every once in a while an uh an english word will pop in so it's like a mother mother tree and so and he starts picking up and it's probably a two minute scene where by the end all the words are in english the reason i'm telling you this is because as you were as you were talking about the book about face i feel like each time i read it like a little because it's not a book about leadership and you know you mentioned leadership it's not a book about leadership it's a book about a guy's life but it's like as each time i read it a little leadership thing would come through and then a little bit more and then a little bit more and eventually the whole thing i realized this whole thing is just about leadership and it's about how to take care of your troops and do the mission and it's it's i just had that thought as you were as you were describing the correlations between what he lived through and what i lived through which by the way just for the record not even close he was in korea in vietnam he's the he had three distinguished service crosses nine silver i mean just totally different but good book to check out the closest thing that i can relate to in my time in the military is you mentioned band of brothers earlier and i was a brand new maybe i was an e3 or an e4 by that point but i picked up the book band of brothers before ever watching the the mini series i don't even know if it was made at that time yet but uh i was brand new in the national guard i started reading the book just as we were about to go and do an annual training at fort indian town gap in pennsylvania and i'm reading the book i like can't put it down we go there we're there for 10 days or two weeks or whatever it was on the plane going back to hawaii and i finished the book and at the end of the book it says dick winters currently resides in fort indian town gap pennsylvania where he lives with his wife yeah and i'm just like why didn't i finish this two days earlier i would have definitely gone and knocked on this man and he was still alive at the time um that was but but i've you know gone on and watched i mean i've watched this year i don't even know how many times i've watched it um in ocs we had to write essays on different episodes from a leadership perspective leadership lessons good and bad and really analyzed um each episode of that and and so that's that's one and that's the only kind of closest thing i can relate to we're going back and looking at him and his leadership and i always forget the guy's name but the guy who's ross in france thank you um his his uh flawed leadership i would say and the lessons learned from that and as a specialist then and then a brand new lieutenant i i have often gone back to those leadership lessons including the ones of um you know some of the uh oh gosh i'm forgetting the name now some of the enlisted characters yep and uh one that was played by donnie wahlberg um one of the main e6's and uh and that was i had a chance to meet donnie wahlberg at a veterans event and like i don't i don't really care about celebrities in general but i saw he was there i'm like i need to go speak to this person about band of brothers and uh it was it was really cool he's a huge huge huge supporter of veterans i was on um a show called billions you were yeah and the the one of the main characters in billions a guy named axelrod uh yeah is uh he also played dick winners he is forever dick winners in my mind i don't care like he was in homeland too like yeah whatever you're dick winners but we you know he we were sitting around and talking and and he said something along the lines of like oh you know i was in something called banner brothers i'm like yeah i kind of know that i'm well aware yeah and so we talked a bunch about it it was it was interesting because in those i've never done any like hollywood things before i was like yeah he likes to throw that at me well when you do it you film the same thing 10 times if not more so like there's a scene where we're waking a guy up in bed and there's me and axe and wags have you watched billions before i've only seen one or two okay really it's a freaking fantastic show okay so me axe wires three characters and so we're waking a guy up and the first time we film it is like they're filming all three of us and we deliver the lines and then you stop and then they reset up all the cameras and then they do it again but they're just filming me and then they reset up the cameras and they do it again they're just filming wags and then they refill it again they're just filming action and then they refill it again they're just filming the girl in bed then they refill it again and then they do it from behind us and they do it so it ends up you end up doing this thing 10 times 15 times 20 and by the way if someone messes up doing it again so i was talking to him and i said how in god's name did you film like a battle scene yeah how the hell did you do that and he he said it's totally different because there's basically guys running around with cameras and they do it one freaking time and they just have to get it right and they're running through it because explosions are going off and like a building is going to get destroyed and it's only going to get one take yeah so that was pretty interesting no pressure right as an actor not only because of that just the the logistics of it but like the history and what you're doing and who you're representing like my gosh i can't i can't imagine he um so if someone messes up the director comes and like talks to him right he just reprimanded like i'm serious so if someone any maybe he doesn't mess up but maybe he's not putting the right right stank on it right you know what i'm saying like you're technically too little you know you're being too emotional and so it happened i didn't really i didn't know any of this were you playing a military person yourself i i had a real stretch of a role i played me okay all right yeah so i played me and i was whatever trying to i was trying to help a guy win a smoker's fight a boxing match and we're training him um but if you mess up or you don't put enough or you put a little too much or whatever the the director actually the first the assistant director is going to come and give you a little nudge in the right direction hey that was a little you know don't be so loud uh you know you're too emotional this isn't supposed to be funny or whatever something like that and so this actually happened to me i don't know if i'm not supposed to talk about stuff like this maybe it's off limits but it's done it's fine it happened to one of the other actors we were doing is just me and one other actor in a scene and we do it and i'm just doing what i do so honestly it's pretty if i have to get talked to it's a problem because i'm just being myself right so i'm doing what i'm doing and the the assistant director comes down first and it's like hey you know what you might want to back that down a little bit not talking to me but talk to the other guy and and he's like what are we going to do he said yeah we're going to do it again which is kind of a big deal like it's not it's not a small thing right we're actually because i remember saying wait are we going to have to shoot this again he goes yeah we're going to shoot it again so it's kind of so i realized that this was kind of a thing if you and then if you continue to mess up then it's not just the assistant director if the director is going to come down and try and give you you know whatever what do they give you [Music] and so i'm watching this going dude i don't want none of this and so i remember one time uh uh so now it's me axe and wax and they're the main guys and these guys and i didn't know anything about anything right but this is a very popular show and it's an incredibly well-written show the the writers i know the writers now and they're just so good and you understand so anyways they're we do a take right hollywood we do it and like you can hear you can hear like radios like you can hear something and you so now all you realize someone messed up right and then they come walking up and uh and he comes walking up you can he's behind us the director he pulls one of the other guys aside you know blah blah blah and i was like and i said axe i was like bro i thought he was coming for me even the pros don't like get the talking too so there you go um other books extreme ownership first book i wrote wrote about leadership and then the dichotomy of leadership echelon front leadership consultancy we solve problems through leadership go to salonfront.com if you want us to come to your company and help we got ef online it's an online leadership training platform to get your whole organization aligned not just a line towards a common goal but more important aligned in how they are going to lead go to efonline.com for that we got the muster 2021 a bunch of different dates we're going to be coming around the country check extreme ownership.com if you want to come to one of those they've all sold out every time we've done one these are going to sell out too so check it early we've got ef battlefield which is we've done one so far we're doing another one we go out and we walk the grounds of the battlefield at gettysburg oh yeah and you we sit there we talk through the decisions that were made we talk about general lee and longstreet and ap hill and and stewart and mead and hancock and reynolds and and and joshua chamberlain from maine we we talked through with their personalities decisions that got made egos that got involved hesitation being overly aggressive not being aggressive enough we talk throughout so many lessons to learn and this is a little tiny group of people there's 35 people that we bring to this event it's all day long um me the rest of the echelon of quite a few of the echelon front instructors walk in the battlefield we do dinner we're going to do a q a it's we will answer whatever questions you have and we will all learn about these lessons so if you want to go to that go to godaddlefront.com events to check that out did you take a note there i did um highly highly recommend i've had the opportunity to do that a few times one of which while i was um well we went we went to the battlefield of chickamauga when i was in ocs and we did that as a class incredible bringing history to life and making it relevant especially from a leadership perspective that applies whether you're in the military or not but something i found out pretty cool in the last year or so i was asked to be on this show on pbs called finding your roots and it's a show that features different people in in my episode they also had paul ryan and marco rubio but you know like oprah they've had different people on and and they dig into your genealogy and find stories about your roots where you come from who you come from and i found out that one of my ancestors on my mother's side of the family was 39 40 years old when he volunteered to serve in the union army and that he it was the and they had the documentation there of one of those battlefields where he fought that i had been to previously and visited and walked through and it was the most like it was the most incredible thing on on many levels to see like this guy gave up his life to go and and fight for what he believed in and that i had generations later not only physically walked through that battlefield where he was but also chose a similar path um with my life and so um it was just it was it was and i've gone back to gettysburg a few times since and every single time i go um it's an incredibly powerful experience incredibly powerful and to go to the place where of course lincoln delivered the gettysburg address yeah yeah it's when when because we basically we spend the two days walking and then we we when we wrap it up and you kind of now you clearly know and you've seen the low ground the high ground the trees the buildings and you're walking where thousands of men were killed yeah it's it it's just it's just unbelievable it's an unbelievable event it's an unbelievable place and it's an incredible way to learn and solidify those so that's ef echelonfront.com events if you want to go um it's in april so and if you want to help service members active and retired their families gold

my imposing interrogations or you want more of echo's quiet questions and pop culture commentary pop culture commentary i just so whenever i'm giving echo a hard time if it's a pretty good one then he'll say to me like you're real happy with yourself aren't you you're really enjoying yourself aren't you you really enjoyed yourself aren't you you think you're good don't you and i that's how i know i'm kind of getting there and as i got as when we got here today as i got out of the car i was i was responding to twitter or instagram and i had just made a comment and i got out of the car and said hey you know sometimes you say that to me because someone had said the the last woman that was on holly mckay someone had said oh did she does she stay for the support section meaning what we've dragged you into for the past freaking hour and i said uh no she was able to withstand you know isis interrogations but she couldn't hang with echo charles and the support so there you go yeah he's very very happy with that one good sense that the pride and the tone of the the comment there you go admittedly so guilty uh if you want more of us you can't you then then you can find us on the interweb and and that's including tulsi's way tulsi as well at tulsi gabbard echo is at echo charles and i am at jonko willink echo charles you got anything else are you running for president again ever or even possibly do you think i don't know i'm not thinking about it at all if you did would you ask about aliens remember how who someone asked about aliens right i think so i think it was like clinton or something um it's not on the top of my list i understand put it that way there you go did i say something about echo's questions earlier he saved the best for last point what's funny is when i first met you or whatever i was like i don't think i ever met anyone that ran for president before so then you know how you kind of think like what would i ask and then for some reason this is it what's this yeah this is the moment yeah all the rest of the stuff is like okay whatever but yeah oh man gotcha i have nothing else but thank you awesome tulsi thank you any closing thoughts i um it's great to be here and we've covered a lot and there's a lot more to come yeah awesome well um obviously thanks for coming on i know we try to make this happen for a little bit i'm glad you could kind of finally get on here and and thanks for your service in the united states government of course but also obviously thanks for your service as a soldier as a leader thanks for putting your life on hold and your life at risk to defend the freedoms and the way of life that we hold sacred and the same goes to the rest of the military personnel out there around the world on those forgotten barricades on the front lines of freedom thank you for defending us and to our police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and emts and dispatchers and correctional officers and border patrol and secret service and all the first responders thank you for defending us as well here at home and to everyone else out there well for one thing ask yourself is today the day is today the day

and help out other people and you do that you do all those things by first putting your own ego in check listen more than you talk praise more than you punish stand up for what you believe in while respecting other people's beliefs too and remember always remember that we are stronger together and until next time this is tulsi and echo and jocko out", "boNpiMyAMTg": "[Music] hey guys visit from

shirt picked it up from tank by customs we just doing it on box and check it out we're gonna do press it on the t-shirt just to see how it works out see if it actually works sticks and if you haven't already like comment subscribe man I see Paris I see y'all in a second so cotton swabs cotton sublimation transfer material pick this up from tag bar customs what it is Oh smart invoice was uh $33.80 410 cotton side sheets so there's a good price listening there chance she's 33 or a 30 she's 1996 50 sheets for 137 81 so he's supposed to be able to serve on this and the other sub on cotton dark 11 only ordered the team's just to see how it's going to work out I'm not even sure what it is let's see exactly okay so it's a sublimation material so polyester feeling tell it all so this paper says this revolutionary technology now allows printing directly unto cotton material great for both light and dark colors with the supersoft field to the touch application directions pre-press the garment which a professional-grade heat press for five to eight seconds and to eliminate wrinkles and moisture step 2 place the cotton sub with the rough side down on top of the garment okay so yes definitely this is the rough side so you will place that down step three mirror print a design on sublimation paper if using step four if using a colored shirt make sure your design completely covers the cotton sub or goes a little outside of the material so no white is visible after application if using a white shirt make sure your design says inside the material to eliminate ghosting put the printed sublimation paper over the cotton sub press at 375 at 385 degree for 60 seconds any temperature peel is fine if using that he sub sublimation paper a delay peel is best wait at least 24 hours before washing turn inside out when you laundry for longer-lasting best results hand wash inside out after application do not iron on top of the cotton Sun directly and heat wool from solid I got my glasses on reactivate the ink if you need to press it do it inside as out as well if iron it on top of the material put parchment butcher or regular paper on top of the cotton sub and hiring as needed we're gonna have to get us a Tesla [Music] just wanna measure this out see how big it is so the size is 16 and a half by eleven and a half whether we go with it so I said the rough side damn and you can clearly clearly feel it what size smaller size rock so I'll just cut more straight down a middle just to see how it goes y'all know is going to work out but this is just a print but it don't work right but for the sake of practice and so I say that do we 85 for 60 seconds see what I do it works stretching it's not too bad you can really tell is just a piece on top of it it's kind so pick that up at our tech by customs yeah that's not too bad get it down get the right print going stuff yeah homework it's right there man it's not too bad pulling on his stress tone and look like it's gonna stick you know we're gonna see how I do I didn't use the best print I was a print I messed up on because the one I actually printed out was too small so I just had that one a print that came out back but anyway we just put it down and actually sub down there the material actually he pressed onto the shirt so that I got it from tagged by customs check them out I got 10 of those for $33 per day like coming subscribed man see parents $12 per LM go", "NBj8G6pXgDE": "[Music] hey y'all welcome to my channel for those of you who are returning visitors welcome back and for those of you who are watching for the first time welcome and i hope you stick around so today we are going to be sublimating a black shirt and it's also 100 cotton okay so we know that for sublimation you need 100 polyester and you also need a light colored shirt okay so when people say that you're sublimating on black shirts or cotton shirts it's not 100 percent accurate okay so what you are actually doing is sublimating onto something else or another product and then you're literally pressing the shirt so today what we're going to be doing is we are going to sublimate onto this paper now this just looks like regular vinyl but it is actually easy subli vinyl that is made by caesar and we are going to actually print onto this paper and then we are going to press it onto the shirt okay let's get started all right y'all so now we're in illustrator and i've already designed the image that i want to place on the shirt um i simply found this apple online by doing a regular search for a an apple a teacher apple png file and it came up it was free and i simply just input um the pattern that i wanted to use inside of each letter okay so we're going to get ready to print and let's go look at our settings it looks like this is a little off there we go all right so you always just want to make sure that your print settings are accurate or onto the correct paper and this comes just with testing honestly because everybody's printer is a little bit different we're all printing from different computers different models so you do have to do a little testing um to make sure that you get the right settings for your needs i just want to go into the print settings and i'm printing on premium presentation matte and remember we are printing directly onto the easy subway paper okay and we have it's going to print high quality i am using borderless printing because my image is a little bit large and i don't want any of it to cut off and what's also important is that when you are printing directly onto the easy subli vinyl you cannot mirror your image so usually with sublimation we're always image we're all always mirroring our images but when you're printing directly onto the easy sublet paper you do not want to mirror your image and i am going to look at my color options and it's perfect so this is exactly what i want to happen okay so we are going to get ready to print are y'all so now that we are about to print our image we need to make sure that we are inputting the easy subli into our printer the correct way okay so on the easy subway there's a side that is a little bit rough it's more matte i don't know if you guys can see it pretty well there and then when you flip it over you have a shiny side okay that shiny side is just the backing okay so if you print anything on the shiny side it will not be able to go onto the shirt you have to print it on the matte side okay this side with the matte finish and you will be able to feel the difference so don't um worry okay and you can also see the shiny side has a glare so we're going to print it on this side once we print it um we are going to weed it and then we will well we're not weeding we're cutting if we were printing it on our or if we were cutting it with the print then cut setting on a cricut machine or another vinyl cutter then you'll read it but we are actually going to cut around our image okay so remember make sure that you're printing on to the matte side all right guys so we all right so we are going to just get any lint off of our shirt and we will be pressing the shirt just to loosen it up a bit to get out any moisture for about five seconds all right guys so the image is printed onto the easy subway and it is still wet so what you want to make sure that you do is just stick it let it dry or stick it under your heat press and let that heat just get onto the image for about three to four minutes two to five minutes and then you will be able to cut it out and place it onto your shirt okay so i let it bake a little bit and we are now ready to cut it out um sometimes if you do the print then cut setting you just put this in your cricut and it will cut it um but we did it this way today so i'm just going to cut it out and i love doing um teacher shirts for myself because my kids love when i wear them and when they have like positive sayings or if i say something about them they love to um see my shirts and read them and i also made it a little bit easier for me because i made the letters touch like i made everything touch so it's a little bit easier for me so it's going to be one piece so i don't have to worry about like placing it correctly or it being uneven that's kind of why i did it that way or that is why and i see some lines in my print but it's okay i'm just gonna cut this and then i will see you at the heat press so we're all done with cutting out our image and i tried to cut out as much of the white from around the image as possible because i didn't want any of the white to really show once we press it okay so on the back side remember that shiny side that i showed you before we are going to just peel that backing away okay and so i just want to try to snatch it off and just be careful it's a little delicate you want to peel you want to be a little careful you'll feel it's pretty tough but you just want to make sure that you do not rip the vinyl okay so we've removed all of the backing from our image and so we are just going to place the image onto the shirt [Music] and just like with any other image you want to make sure that you are leaving enough space at the top and it's pretty standard to have your image start at the three inch mark from the neckline okay so we are going to just measure i usually take out my measuring tape just to make sure and that's kind of low so we can bring it up a little bit so it looks like that leaf is right there at the three inch mark okay and let's make sure the sides are a little bit we'll move it over just a tad all right guys so we are going to press this onto our shirt for 15 seconds our heat press is at 315 degrees all right so you can make sure that you put your butcher paper down because you don't want this ink to go onto the top plate all right you can just peel a little bit and look how nice remember we started out it was dull um and now look how bright that apple is that's why i did the apple in a different shade of red like a little more brighter so that you can see the difference but look how nice and bright that apple is so we're all done with sublimating onto the easy sublease and then pressing it onto our shirt it looks really nice and what i like about the easy subway is that it's very light so once you peel it away from that backing it's very light you don't feel it's not as bulky as um regular heat transfer vinyl sometimes and it pretty much almost blends in with of course it's not sublimation because it's not sublimated into the shirt but when you feel it it it there's a nice feel to it okay so remember this is another way for those of you who may not want to do the glitter um backing for your heat transfer onto black shirts or dark colored shirts and or cotton shirts easy suddenly is an option for you okay so i hope you all have enjoyed this tutorial i will have the information below uh where i got the easy subleaf from and yeah definitely i would go with this method um again and again so thank you so much for watching um if you enjoyed this video you learned something new or you were inspired to try sublimating onto easy subling please be sure to like the video and also subscribe to my channel where i will continue to post crafting videos using either the cricut or sublimation thank you so much for watching [Music]", "PwBjLBkD8kQ": "[Music] this video review is based on price quality performance warranty brand trust after sales and service reusability familiarity and easy to operate let's talk a little about supima cotton after all it's one of the most important reasons that Lacoste's men's essentials undershirt is a cut above the rest what is supima cotton it's a superior type of cotton grown in the USA and also a very rare type since it represents just one percent of all cotton grown in the world the biggest difference between supima cotton and regular cotton is the length of their fibers supima cotton fiber is about a half-inch longer than regular cotton fibers shorter cotton fibers produce yarn that's rougher and more likely to pile up on the surface kindly see the description for this product link thanks for watching kindly like and subscribe you", "caUlh9mGySo": "[Music] hi guys its Cristo welcome back to my channel today we're going to be sublimating on 5050 so poly-cotton blend as well as a hundred percent cotton yes you heard me correctly a hundred percent cotton I've got a onesie and we'll talk about shirt that we're gonna do a hundred percent cotton on we're in a short with the 50/50 now I don't know if you guys have heard of this or not but there is a company that is called dye press now what they have invented this has been out for a little bit I've been watching some videos on it and I finally reached out to them a while back and asked if they could send me some of these to try out on the channel and they totally agree right away they had them in them in the mouth so we're going to be not only trying today's going to be cotton but not only are we gonna be doing cotton shirts or cotton material we're going to be doing poly gloss so this is going to be four glass metal marble stone ceramic glass acrylic white board and wood so we could get those Dollar Tree cups and coat it with this stuff and be able to use those in our press instead of have an order and then also they carry poly natural this is for coating wooden stone so you can get some of those nice wood you know to make some coasters and stuff coat those and be able to sublimate on those as well so any type of cutting boards so no longer having to special order anything you could run down to Walmart and grab some cups or shirts or whatever it may be and do this okay so let's start with today doing the cotton this is gonna work if you're working on white grey or colored shirts that is oatmeal she has created videos on this so I'll have those linked down below there's three different videos so you can check those out so you can learn what the Desai's are all about and all that I'm not gonna get into it just to save a little bit of time but if you have a white shirt a grey shirt or an oatmeal you're gonna want to put decider all the colors you're not gonna have to worry about this alright so first step on those will be the decider and then the next step is going to be the poly teeth this is what's gonna give us that coating like the polyester type coating and that's what's gonna make us be able to sublimate on a hundred percent cotton is we're gonna go in and I'm going to show you how to mix it up and everything walk through spraying it and we're going to press it today we're going to press it with the cricket easy press you can do the same thing with or heat press she sent me two bottles that are already just like this these are 8 ounce bottles because you want to mix 7 ounce water to each ounce of these so you need 7 ounce water 1 ounce this dirty has them so this bottle right here is the Desai's or hopefully you guys can see these so we're going to mix our the sizer in here and then the poly tea and the other one so let's get started so we need 7 ounces of water and you need to use purified water so I just I'm using bottled water from Walmart ok so I've got my bottled water and I'm gonna fill up my cup here so I've got a little measuring cup to 7 ounces all right there we go but it use a funnel these funnels come in like three in a pack I think it Walmart $4 where I got these long time ago so I'm going to pour my water in here alright just like so and I'm going to go ahead and Robert a date and pour the water in the other one do what we need to do now is I've got these little measuring cups even sent me the measuring cups into everything so I'm going to take some of the Desai's are here I'm gonna kind of mix it around just a little bit I don't think I need to but doing it anyway we need one ounce of each one so I'm gonna find where my once's are on here yeah seal on top so get that off and pour this in very carefully pour that over here all right and then what we need to do is put our lid on here and shake it up now she showed on her channel just kind of going like this a little bit and not just vigorously shaking it so that's what I'm gonna do just do this a few times and we need one else same thing we want to get this in here and then same thing she just kind of showed knocking it she just kind of showed going like this back and forth she didn't show lime vigorously shaking it so I'm just gonna kind of do what she did and if you guys notice this you guys probably noticed this right off the bat I put them in the wrong container because that's what I do so what I'm gonna do right away is I'm going to I was gonna fill that off but that's not gonna work I'm gonna have to mark them out I'm gonna have to just kind of you know scribble this I'll get some vinyl and vinyl this later you know me it's gonna be vinyl so I'm gonna go ahead and put poly T on it and then do the same thing because I already know I'm fixing me messing that up alright and then I'm gonna put D sizer there we go and all like I said I'll just put vinyl on them later but try not to do what I just did but just wanted to show that really quickly because you don't want to do these backwards obviously okay so let's go ahead and get started we've got my shirt ready to go and so I'm doing white so we need to use the B sizer so I'm gonna take a piece of cardboard I'm gonna protect my Cricut make her back there by the way so this cardboard is actually just from by those inserts that come in our chocolate or packages so I just been saving them for stuff like this okay so what we need to do is you need to spray around the area that you're going to be sublimating because obviously that's what we need to take care of right and in the meantime I'm gonna go ahead and get our keys II press ready to go I'm gonna move my design out of the way we need to get our easy press to three eighty five so I'm going to push the temperature there and go all the way up to three eighty five now this first press is not going to be timed we're just doing steam so I'm gonna have that ready to go so the first thing we need to do is the decider so making sure I got the right one so what we need to do is you want to spray about where you're sublimating so go bigger than the area hopefully you guys can see all this I may have to zoom out so you want to go ahead and spray within the area where you're going to be sublimating or obviously it defeats the purpose so I'm going to spray a big enough area is what I'm just gonna do to make sure soda size there so I'm just going to make sure so you want to make sure you're coating everything very well and then she showed just kind of patting it down to kind of get that moisture in there so just want to get it nice and wet obviously I don't think she got a drench so we're just making sure that everything is getting cutted because when you look at it in person you can kind of see what's wet and what's not wet so I'm just kind of pushing that in okay and I think I'm going to go over it one more time I'm gonna press that in there so now I'm just kind of going and patting that down a little bit just making sure everything seems pretty nice too wet all right so what we need to do in our easy press is almost there I'm gonna go and get my shirt off of this and kind of rub it as well and I think she only really showed that with the poly tube I'm doing anyway but it kind of helps get that you know even on there so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna spread this out now for this next step what you need to do is you need to take she said a piece of cotton but it has to be washed already it has to be used because if not it's got decider in it because it's no so you're just putting right on top so I'm using my husband's old white t-shirt ignore it because it looks really old and dingy so you can use a hand towel whatever it may be but you want to use a used so now what I'm going to do is we want to give that out of there so I'm going to go ahead and press until we see steam coming out okay good so once you see that steam coming out you can lift that up and move this out of the way go ahead and I'm gonna do it one more time just because sure that I'm coating the whole area where my stuff's going so I'm just going in the area where I haven't done yet so just over here on the side now if yours completely covered that area you would not need to do this again so I'm just kind of waiting for that steam to come a little bit just being super safe alright so now for the next step is we're gonna need our cardboard back Harper back in here and this time we're doing 385 for 70 seconds 385 for 70 seconds so before I forget I'm gonna change my deal over here to 70 seconds now what we need to do is spray our area and I'm gonna measure down three just make sure okay we're gonna spray our area where our image is gonna go once again so we're gonna take that poly tea this time so we're taking the poly tea and we're going to spray and coat where our image is going so we're going all the way around she shows kind of you can use your image to poop it over and spray around to get like a an area but I pretty much know I'm going to be right in here so that's just what I'm doing so I'm just making sure everything is getting nice and coated alright so that looks good to me in half like I showed a while ago and we're gonna go ahead and rub these rub this down to get that fully coated once we have it ready to go we're going to want to air dry this or you can dry it with your blow dryer or your heat press or your ez press the way that you're gonna want to do this is to get this dry a little bit I'm gonna go over just hovering over it with my iron so I'm just kind of hovering just to kind of help dry it a little bit I don't have it on there now you wouldn't want to sit here and do these one after another like that I wouldn't want to what I would do is I would a head of time Desai's my shirts and then I would come back spray em with the poly coke that way they're all ready to sublimate and then you're ready to go that way you're not back and forth back and forth with each one so now what we're gonna do is I'm going to put my image down where I want it and I'm gonna actually to kind of avoid these harsh lines I've showed you before is to kind of tear it like this I'm bringing it down so I can see where I'm putting my image all right so what I'm gonna do is come down three I know where I'm going here and you know me I can eyeball where I'm at all right so say I'm happy with where that's at she shows that you need to coat it with two pieces of parchment paper this time so we're doing 385 for 70 seconds so we're gonna go ahead and get this down remember you want to stay completely still when it comes to sublimation so I'm just going to give it some firm pressure and hit go you all right there we have it so now I need to carefully pick this up so we don't get our ghosting and there you have it so you can hear that kind of stick just a little bit and now you can see how vibrant that is now I've sublimated already before on 5050 so it's nothing new but you can see how much more vibrant that is all right so now for our last step is you want to go over this one more time with your poly T and that's gonna give it a final top coat so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna put this back underneath here to protect everything got my cardboard back alright get my shirt up here and we're going to spray it with that poly T one more time just coating everything so you're just gonna go over with a nice little thin layer just like that that's gonna help hold that ink in you need to do is just press this for 10 seconds at 300 she said if you press it again at 385 at a high temp you're sublimating again so what we're gonna do I'm gonna change the temp to 300 so we're gonna hit temp come down to 300 all right now while the temperature was dropping and I need to change my time hold on now while the temperature was dropping what she did was hover again don't stick it directly on there I'm just hovering on top this is how she was drawing it as it was going down except for she was using heat pressing obviously but you just take your easy press and you're gonna hover over it as that heat is dropping plead this dry before this finished I'm dropping and that's totally okay so I don't have to hold it the whole time so I mean that's gonna get heavy it only took me about 10 15 seconds to relieve that dry so I didn't take no time at all so this last press all we need is one piece of parchment paper and we're going to go down for 10 seconds so we're gonna hit go so I've got it at 300 for 10 seconds all right there we have it now this shirt is completely finished so it's completely done now the only thing that I do notice with this is whenever you do this whole process here hopefully you guys can see this there it is and it says this heifer needs a vacation this is an image from Etsy I will link you down below the one thing I am noticing is it's given like a almost like a different right here and it feels like now it has almost like a like this is just hopefully you guys can hear this now it's not like a thick plastic or anything but it's got a coating you can tell it has a coating there I want to say because she does have like a whole group and like a Facebook page and I'll have it linked down below as well as to where people talk about you know how to use this stuff you know just basically kind of like one of those like a Facebook gun like a cricket group so anyways but there is one for this die press where they give tips and tricks so I'll leave it link down below but I think somebody said once you wash this that that all goes away so we're gonna find that out I'm gonna do that before I sell this because I'm gonna sell this down at my booth so I will let you know how that works out so there's that isn't it awesome how cool is that and this is about 50/50 because 50-50 doesn't usually come out this bright so I'm really excited about that now let's do some hundred percent cotton this cute little tee here this is another one of those wonder tees I got from Walmart I told you guys the other day this is a hundred percent cotton and I'm gonna show you guys this is that one donation higher percent cotton I'm gonna bring it up hopefully you guys can see the information there 100% cotton we're going to take our cardboard once again I'm gonna get our cute little shirt down and the first step that we're gonna do is cover it with the Desai's or making sure I'm grabbing the right one and we're gonna cover the area so I know about where this is going so I'm just going to go over it again and like I said she was kind of padding which is just kind of pushing the the Desai's are into the material you know how if you get something wet it kind of wants to hover on top for just a second so until it soaks just to kind of speed that up a little bit pushing right in now like I said I'm probably going excess with the Desai's er you really don't need to use this much but I'm just making sure I want to coat everything so obviously I'll get the fill about the more I play with this stuff all right I cannot wait to play with the other ones and get some dollar tree mugs okay so same thing I'm gonna fold this in half and kind of push on that just a little bit to kind of really get that in there now we need to bump our temperature back up to the 385 all right and this one we're just doing the steam and this one we're just pressing until you see that steam I think it took about 15 seconds last time I had a cleaner spot so you guys aren't having to look at that ugliness of it all right so I'm gonna press and oh I don't know why I hit the timer I didn't need to hit the timer but I hit 10 seconds so let's see if it does it in 10 seconds I guess if not we'll hit time again I guess we could kind of figure out how long it takes I'm gonna hit it again all right so about 30 seconds is what that took to get that steam out okay you bring our cardboard back in all right just like so and we need to do that 70 seconds again I'm gonna take our poly tea and we're going to coat it so we need to coat it to where whoever our image is going to be all right so once we've got that coated I'm gonna fold it in half and rub that in and I'm gonna go ahead and move this out of the way rubbing a little bit easier and better try not to stretch my shirt obviously there we have it so what I've been doing to protect my my mat I didn't mention that before is I've got down a piece of just paper is what it is this is just butcher paper I've got that down and then we're going to take our image for this one here we're gonna do like a fourth of July theme so it's gonna be America alright so we need to make sure and cover this until that's pretty much dry you really would want to do this stuff just ahead of time so you're not sitting here having to individually dry these because you can air dry them and that way they're just completely ready to go and the last step you're having to do is cover them with the Polish brain one more time all right so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna get this down just kind of making sure it's where I need it to be I didn't do this on the last one but I want to try it on this one is I want to use that die trans pro-spray that's gonna help hold this down I know it's not going to shift and you can use the tape as well but let's try it and see if it works with this product are you giving it a second all right so just making sure and going where I need to be all right so say that looks good to me now I've got that in place I also mentioned and I want to try it this time she used a piece of just regular copy paper but I'm gonna use butcher paper and then she used her two pieces of parchment paper just to protect the parchment paper so you can use them more so they don't yellow right so or get the ink coming through so we're going to hit go 70 seconds all right pull all of our paper is here and now we're going to peel this off there you have it this is a hundred percent cotton so hopefully you can see that there it is sublimating on 100% cotton how cool is that 100% cotton so let's see if I can see the ring on this one I don't really see the ring as much as I do now obviously you can see where my press was setting but I don't see it like I did on the other one so I don't know if it's because it was a blend but this is 100% cotton and I'm not having that now you can feel the difference so this is you can hear and this is t-shirt and then that I brought you over to my mic so you guys could hear a little bit better so anyways but look how cool that is 100% cotton so you can go down to Walmart and get some of these t-shirts you can go down Target wherever it may be somewhere locally grab some t-shirts and make them and so wouldn't that be awesome to be able to have on hand so I'm really excited about this stuff and I mean look at how much I have less so far from doing two t-shirts oh really don't take much if you guys can see that there's still pretty much full it's hard to tell you but I just I've used a lot of decider I think I've used too much all right now let me go ahead and quickly the last step that we have to do is protect this with one more top coat of that poly tea but I'm going to set this aside and let's go ahead and do two baby onesies really quick so these are 100% organic cotton from Walmart and we're going to be 282 different design so I'm gonna go ahead and cut these down cut them in half just really heavy and then we're gonna start on our process really quick just so we have these I want to make sure they're gonna fit because I haven't double-check those you know I've already printed these once again all these images I got from Etsy and I will have them linked down below so that's gonna fit on there very well and then same with this cute little cat one okay so let's go ahead and get going so two little onesies and I'm gonna spray them at the same time so I can be do them together get our onesies and I'm gonna get both of them up here hopefully you guys with us and both and I'm gonna spray em both at the same time okay one is the 12 months 1 2 3 to 6 months so remind me unifor and over here cow cuz we're gonna forget you I'm already gonna tell you this size our first so we're gonna go over both of those so just kind of spritzing those just making sure wherever that image is gonna go that we've got it spritzed pushing that in I'm gonna go ahead move over to the next one and it's super hot in my she shed right now because I'm waiting to get my I'm still working guys another lot of you guys have questions what's going on that I have so much it's just been crazy we saw have everything to do basically I mean just well basically I've got to go to Ikea and we're gonna do that at the end of the month and I need to put my floors in and that's pretty much it but um my I've got to get my mini split you know my air conditioner but I can't turn on my fan because it's super loud for the video and I'm dying right so anyways I'm gonna finish spritzing these really well alright am I gonna fold these in half this I'm not gonna worry about it all right we're just gonna make sure they're spritz okay so what I'm gonna do well actually I'm gonna fold them in half I'm getting them off of here so there we go so you can see how we're protecting our workspace get this down now I could use my 6 by 7 and I think that's what I'm actually gonna do I'm gonna move this guy out of the way and let's use our 6 by 7 to sublimate all right now this one's gonna be the same thing where we need the cotton t-shirt as you guys can see me and my husband went out on the boat this weekend and I got super sunburned so it's been great we're gonna be pulling out the steam what we're using for this one is the cotton t-shirts I'm going to cover up our onesie and I'm gonna go ahead and press now this one there's no time we're just pressing until that steam comes out giving it firm pressure steam coming up so now I'm gonna pull this off and this one is ready to go let this one aside and press the next one we're ready to go so I'm going to spray it again now with a poly tea so we're gonna grab these cut down our cardboard here and I'm gonna spritz both of these with that poly tea so I'm gonna go ahead and get these on here you may not be able to see them both but they're both here okay well let's go ahead and get that poly T so for the pointy once again you're just spritzing where you're working all right so same thing you're gonna want to fold them in half fold them in half and I'm gonna move them over to rub them Medwin rub it so I can make sure that's nice and even try not to shake my camera everywhere for the 12 months we are going to have the unicorn right ahead and dry this I'm just hovering it over now this one I'm not going to use the spray I'm gonna do it without and so now we're gonna go ahead and get our image down about where I want it to be so say I'm happy with that I can see it you guys I think you guys can lightly see it so I can kind of see where I'm going with this just stick it down just like that I'm gonna go ahead and do the same thing where I've got the I've got three layers here so I've got the paper but put your paper and then the parchment paper I'm gonna get these down and then I'm going to go ahead and get my iron down on here so just like this and I'm gonna hit go 70 seconds all right with this out of the way movies and pull this up there we have it super cute 100% cotton organic cotton it's that if that it's 100% organic cotton look at that on a percent cotton how awesome it's hot so I'm trying to hold it here and with a crooked easy breast um once again I don't really see that outline like I did on that first one so I must have overdid maybe the desizing or even the spritz I'm not too sure but there you have it how freaking cute is that it says whatever I do what I want in that cute with that uniform we put this on that cup a while back okay so I'm gonna set this out of the way already got it ready to go so all we're gonna do is let's dry it just a little bit um same thing once again you wouldn't have to go through this if you pre did this and let them air dry I think that's ready to go this one is going to be new to the herd with these foot with cows I know it's backwards until we press it but look how cute so what we're going to do is line this up once again I can see through it y'all may not be able to and we're going to get this down I'm gonna go ahead and do the pro-spray again alright so I'm gonna go ahead and get that about where I want it so say I'm happy with it here making sure my shirt is flat same thing I've got my butcher paper and my three pieces my three pieces no two pieces of parchment paper I'm going to be making sure I'm staying right between where I need to be and just get this down just like so and hit go first so we're gonna pick this up alright and we're gonna put these out of the way now one thing I want to mention too with this spray as well as this because it sticks down you can always test so in case I didn't get over here over here you could always test it first and take a little peek so say you see how peaking like that I can actually lay it back down and go again and I wouldn't have to worry about ghosting because it's got such a strong grip on it now I'm going to kill this off and there you have it super cute look at how cute that is new to the herd Oh cute look at those colors 100% cotton organic cotton I'm gonna show you guys really quick um organic cotton is what it says Gerbert organic cotton there you go I don't maybe a little bit blurry this one's a three to nine months but look at how cute once again on this one I can't really see the difference on here you can see where my iron was but you have a little bit of that scratch hopefully you guys can hear that bringing it over and compared to the shirt not as bad I really think I just overdid it on my first shirt but there you are I love it so cute awesome okay so for the final step all we have to do is we've got these last three here we just need to spray them one more time with that poly tea now what you want to do is you want to air dry these first because know they need to be dry and then we're gonna press them at 300 for 10 seconds so I'm gonna go and change my timer but what I would do once again if I was doing a bunch of these at once I would go ahead and let them air dry and then come back later and get them all at one time so I'm not having to hover over these or blown with a blow dryer so I'm gonna go and bring my temperature my temperature I brought my temperature down to 300 now I'm bringing my time down to 10 all right while that temperature is dropping I thought I go ahead and talk about these one more time they're you know eight ounce bottles so like you could get them bigger though you can get them in bigger bottles like this like the 16 ounces and stuff but the 8 ounce bottles you're gonna need the decider and you're gonna need the eight outs now if you're doing colored shirts don't worry about this just spray it with the poly tee and then you're ready to go with that if it's colored but if it's white gray or oatmeal color you want to push the potion put the v-slicer but think about it this way with eight ounces it takes one ounce of this for each bottle and then the water so you're gonna get eight bottles each of this stuff right here so you can see how much I've used hopefully you guys can see that I've barely used anything hopefully I'm trying to hold it cuz if I hold it sideways it's gonna go this way so let me put right here so I'm only used to right about here where my thumb is on this one I've probably excessively used that I've went to right about there but you're gonna get eight of these eight ounce because each one's gonna fill up to eight ounces you're gonna get eight of these so that's how much clothing you can do I mean quite a bit and like I said I go ahead and and do all the ones that you need but you do not need the decider so if you weren't doing the on the colored shirts you're only gonna need this one bottle which is decisive but remember I marked it out and put poly tea crystals can a vinyl that so you would only need one of these if you're gonna be doing just colored shirts so it's pretty awesome and then like I said they've got other stuff too so you can do the poly gloss which you will be seeing very soon I'm fixing to be going and I might get some Dollar Tree cups I'm gonna get some Walmart cups and I'm gonna get maybe some like the glass cutting cutting trays and stuff like that and then with the poly natural maybe I'll do some tiles and stuff - I'll get several things because like I said it is for the gloss let's say it one more time it's metal marble stone ceramic glass acrylic whiteboard and wood so I will have a bunch of these items to try with that when we do that video very very soon with the wooden stone you can do it on those awesome pieces of wood you can do it on the cutting boards stone stuff like that and so I will have some of those to work with this so I'm pretty excited now with those two so the decides are you're gonna need this stuff here it is called catalyst I'm gonna take it out just yet but there it is by press catalyst and this is when you use the poly gloss or poly satin or the poly natural okay so you add one milliliter shippable of measuring things in there she's just like really I mean was a she made it perfect for me to be able to fill it up with the little measuring cups to display bottles gonna send a huge shout-out out to die press for sending these to me to try and like I said for the quick response and the fast delivery I asked and you guys delivered quick so I really truly appreciate that and so here we go so let's finish up these shirts last things we need to do is add the poly tee one more time lightly Kellie make sure everything gets its moist with it right this again protection everybody and everything alright alright there we go alright this time I'm going to show you just using your hair dryer to speed this up it's like that you're done it's really fast move that guy out of the way and I'm going to point this out it doesn't matter what drop blow-dryer you use this one's more expensive so don't go buy this one but the point this is just what I have it's just became my craft tool I've taken it from the kids my point is if you if yours has this nozzle or if you can make by this attachment separately super cheap I highly recommend that you use this nozzle because it it directs that air perfectly so when you're using this in the craft room it doesn't blow anything anywhere and it really directs that heat so highly recommend whatever dryer you get whether it's a ten dollar dryer make sure it has one of these or if you can attach one that way you can direct this however you want to you thing I'm gonna point out really fast is that I just now noticed when you spray that final coat of poly tea and don't over spray or you're going to make that bleed okay so you're going to end up making that blade you see where you can kind of see around that so don't over spray it with that poly tea now this one you can see nothing happened because I didn't know where spray that so be careful not to over saturate and I could tell you because this was really wet so just a tip alright so we just need one piece of parsnip for these and I'm gonna just go over it for ten seconds just like that so all the shirts completely done and ready to go toss that out of my way and bring in this one here cover it up here it go alright so there we have it's completely done so once it's not ten seconds you're good to go like I said be careful not to over spritz I'm going to slip it out of the way and we've got our last one here so America what I'm gonna try to do with this is turn it this way and put my press on there this way I'm gonna you can see I didn't know I didn't know where spray on that one either so I'm gonna hit go oh gee so there you have it so you have America and actually it looks like it did use so tiny bit there on the sea so just try not to over spray on that so there's booze and then here's this one there we go super cute love it and then while we're trying here's our first one we did and you can see how obviously did not overspray on that one I did really good look how vibrant that one now this is 50/50 so if you spray on 50/50 you're gonna get even more vibrant than before so basically when you're spraying on hundred percent cotton you can see that's a little bit lighter and I know there are two different images but you can see this is 50/50 so half polyester half cotton and before if I did it without the spray this is the color tone you would have had with this so basically these kind of are now like 50/50 cotton if you if that makes sense but before you could not sublimate at all on cotton and make it stay without washing it out but this type of color tones is what would have been in this but because this was without spray look at how vibrant it was like BAM so I'm pretty excited about that so huge shout out to die press for sending this stuff to us and letting us test it out super exciting about that highly recommend that you check this stuff out maybe we can sublimate on 100% cotton and so I'm really excited we can do dish towels all kinds of stuff possibilities are endless so stay tuned we got two more trials to do with two more different type of videos for the poly gloss and they're probably natural so I hope you guys enjoyed this I hope you found it helpful if you did please hit the like button down below and subscribe and I'll see you on the next one", "gqVEtRAV4jc": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so this is the first ever walmart haul i've ever done i just typically am so overwhelmed by walmart's app and also their website that i personally have historically found it very difficult to search for clothing but if you guys are familiar with my channel you know i'm in the process of flipping all synthetics out of my closet in favor of natural fibers namely 100 cotton clothing which can be very very tough to find at a reasonable price which is why i was like literally losing my mind when i heard that they came out with a new label called free assembly and not only are all of these clothes here cotton 100 cotton some of them are even organic cotton like to think that you can get organic cotton clothing at walmart prices like i am in heaven so the first thing i grabbed for the spring summer season was this darling little top here you guys oh my gosh this yellow gingham is so sweet love the little puff sleeve and then it has this darling ruffle detail on the sleeve it is so adorable it's got a nice little flow factor to it definitely runs big so i size down to an extra small it fit perfectly it's just the sweetest little top for the warmer months and i love the fact that you can not only wear this on the shoulder but if you want to you can also like take it off the shoulder too for a really breezy vibe i love tops like this like you can easily wear this with a pair of jeans a white denim skirt white shorts like whatever you want it's just so sweet for the summer months okay so the next thing i found amongst this collection was this shirt dress here and i have to say like historically i don't really work well with shirt dresses i don't find them to be particularly flattering on my body type but i love this and now this definitely runs way big so this is a small i totally need to size down to an extra small it is a beautifully breezy cotton fabrication you guys this even has a lining along the skirt that is also cotton sometimes what i find is that labels and designers cop out on a cotton dress and add a polyester lining which drives me crazy so i was so impressed to see that they went with a cotton lining for this one of course it does have the buttons that are functional entirely down the bodice and all the way down to the end of the skirt depending on how tall you are this is either going to be a midi or a maxi length now one word to the wise this is extremely see-through on the bodice area i'm not quite sure why they went with a gorgeous lining on the skirt and then kind of just forgot about it for the top because this is very sheer in fact i initially tried it on without a cami and was like whoa even with a nude colored bra you could totally see everything so i just went with a nude cami underneath much better this is such a breezy beautiful option this yellow color is so perfect for the spring summer season i cannot wait to get this in an extra small i love this dress so when it came to bottoms one of the things i was intrigued by were their midi length denim skirts which aren't always easy to find so i grabbed it in this gorgeous white tone it's almost like a bone color but this is so beautiful and guys what i love about this cut and the silhouette is how flattering it is namely because since they went with a longer pocket it actually creates like a slight flare at the hips which is super flattering because it makes your waist look really really tiny it's a very interesting effect again it is a midi length and this is such a substantial cotton skirt you guys like you know a lot of times white denim can be like really thin very see-through this is so thick but very comfortable not see-through whatsoever it's got the functional pockets on the back it's just absolutely beautiful so this next top here is basically another version of that yellow gingham i showed you at the beginning i wanted to get it in just a plain white because i have an obsession with wearing white tops with jeans in the warmer months just because i think it is so fresh looking now one thing i wanted to point out in terms of the detail that went into these tops so again not only are all these clothes cotton organic cotton like they did not cut corners even like the little like strings that are used to hold it on a hanger you know typically these are plastic these are cloth like what a great attention to detail and again from a brand that you find at walmart much like that yellow gingham top again with the puff sleeve the sweet little ruffling on the end of the cuff there and it just has such a darling little flow to it this actually is almost like a seersucker cotton it's so darling on i love these tops so continuing with my obsession with white tops and the warmer months i also grabbed this you guys like again walmart feminine details beautiful walmart like i cannot get over this this is such a sweet top with the ruffled collar i found that while it is high it's not annoyingly high it's actually really comfortable love that crochet detailing right along the collarbone and it does have a proper cuff with buttons that do have a slight puff to them you guys this is such a flattering top it does have the keyhole design in the back with a little button at the nape of the neck just absolutely beautiful fit and it is true to size so one of the big trends we're seeing are shirt jackets and i just personally am normally not drawn to them whatsoever i find that they're just oversized they're sloppy looking they're not flattering but i saw this one and what i love about this jacket is while it is a shirt jacket it is not crazy obnoxious oversized it's not sloppy looking it has like a very tailored again expensive look to it which is perfect when you're trying to look expensive on a budget now this is like more of like an ivory shade so it's not a stark white but again the detail of this jacket 100 cotton it feels so good on it has the perfect weight to it and also i love the fact that they went with the tortoise shell buttons just such a beautiful touch this is just the perfect coat again to get that elevated casual vibe so now when it comes to tops as you probably already noticed i'm a sucker when it comes to those feminine details that aren't like obnoxiously so like i love a puff sleeve i love a well-placed ruffle and so when i saw this knit top i literally like jumped on it because number one i'm so attracted to this periwinkle color it is absolutely beautiful and again just love the puff sleeve that's almost like a minimal puff sleeve nothing like obnoxious or crazy and again with those details love the fact that they went with almost a three-quarter length sleeve but then they added this extra substantial cuff to it to give the sleeve some volume this is so comfortable on it's a beautiful cotton fabrication again just a classic top that is so easy to dress up or down like literally tops like this i wear the heck out of because you can style them in so many different ways you can wear them with a skirt you can wear them with jeans you can even wear them with a cute pair of shorts and like a straw hat on a cool summer day so just love love love this style in fact i think i want to go back on the website to see what other colors they have because i love this style so much and finally rounding out this video i do have a couple more bottoms including two pairs of jeans now they did offer a super high-rise skinny which i pounced on mainly because look at this rinse you guys this is so perfect for the spring and summer season and what i totally appreciate other than the super high rise which is so flattering is the fact that the rinse itself has no like crazy whiskering on it it's this beautifully saturated blue all the way down to that clean hem you guys know i tend to hate like scissor hems unfinished hands this is such a classic now unfortunately these are slightly too long for me they're probably like a 29 in seam and i really need a 27 not sure if they sell these in a petite or not i'll have to go back onto the website but again there's no distressing whatsoever it's just a beautiful classic skinny jean now these are primarily cotton there is a touch just a touch of spandex in this to give them a super nice fit one of the things too i love about these jeans not only are they cotton but they also were really conscientious about how they constructed them the tag says the closed-loop water recycling allows us to treat 100 percent of the water used in making our jeans 85 of the water is recycled and reused saving up to half a million gallons per day i love that and another pair of jeans which i had to get was this retro flare you guys i am all about the flared jeans i have always loved flared jeans and literally like a couple weeks ago i was like oh i want to find like a lighter rinse with front pockets to really get like those boho 70 vibes and guess where they show up walmart it was so good these are also a high rise these have such a great fit to them and again that clean hem with the thicker cuff which i think is such a sweet touch these have like the perfect flare to them there's no distressing i love the extra wide pockets in the back love love love the fit of these i did go with my usual size four and they fit like a glove but much like that skinny pair again look at how beautiful of a rinse this is there's no crazy whiskering across the thighs or on the back or shimmying down the thighs towards the knee it's just completely uniform and that is so hard to find on a pair of jeans especially at a price point like this okay guys and finally they had a pair of cotton joggers which i thought would be like a sweatpant but these are actually like pants you would wear out in public and they are cute they are a little voluminous like in the hip area so i'm not sure if i'm gonna keep keep them but they're super comfortable on and they do have just like a traditional cuff it's not like you know cinched at the bottom like a sweatpant typically is so clearly these are meant to be worn out and about again for that elevated casual vibe the elastic waistband with that drawstring allows you to get the perfect cinch it does have one pocket in the back these are literally like throw on and go i love to wear pants like this with something just as simple as like a white tank top sometimes i'll throw on a denim jacket and you are out the door and they do have functional pockets as well they're just a really nicely constructed pair of pants okay guys so that is it for my first ever walmart clothing haul and again like i'm so impressed with the quality of these clothes like literally normally when you find cotton clothing and most especially organic cotton clothing the price points are three four sometimes five times as much as what we're seeing here so definitely let me know in the comments down below like have you checked out free assembly what do you think about this line i am going to be honing in on their website to see what else they come out with because i am just again so impressed everything i showed you today will be linked down below but in any event thank you guys so much for spending your time with me today i hope you're having a good one and i'll see you in the next video [Music] bye", "f4I0wJsCBNc": "[Music] hello guys welcome back to miss sugi lovecraft and today um what i'm going to show you is um how you could make your own spray for sublimation on cotton shirt and what i have here i use our 20 pound paper to print my image as you can see 20 pound paper to print my image i also got from the dollar store a bottle spray bottle um this is the mini wax poly acrylic um water base got this from amazon it's the eight fluid ounce i want to say it was eleven dollars i got some water it is eight ounce which is one cup of water and i got my tablespoon measuring um spoon what i'm gonna do is i'm go i'm not gonna put it in my um my measuring cup because this is what i use in my kitchen so i won't do that i mean you'd probably have to get one just for that but what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna pour let's first let's see let's make sure this fits in this bottle so here we go i didn't check that first but it does fit in the bottle then i'm going to get my poly acrylic let me probably shake it up a little bit get my poly acrylic and i'm going to put two tablespoon inside here all right two tablespoon inside there gonna close it up i'm gonna shake it up this is a way you could make your own spray for sublimation to put on your cotton t-shirt shake it up well okay i'm gonna spray the shirt and i'm gonna show you and i'm gonna spray the shirt here is the shirt that i'm gonna be using it's a hundred percent cotton okay a hundred percent cotton hopefully you can see it 100 cut okay i put a piece of paper in between because i don't want to have it soak through so i'm going to spray the area so guys i had to change the spray top on this dollar store bottle and i had another spray top so i kind of cut it because you want it to have a spray effect for you to spray out and the dollar store one wasn't working so i'm going to spray the area now and the white paper underneath kind of let me gauge to where i'm gonna spray okay so i'm gonna let it dry and then i will show you once i put the put my image once again like i said i um put this on regular 20 pound paper i kind of got a little bit of the the poly acrylic on there but that doesn't matter right now we just wanted to show you that it will work so you don't have to buy thirty six dollars for four ounce bottle you could get the poly critic mini wax poly acrylic and probably a dollar store spray um bottle a tablespoon to measure and like i said a 20 pound paper so all of this saves you a whole lot of money okay so i'm gonna get this and i'm going to once it's dry we'll be right back to show you the effect so guys here is the moment of truth remember 20 pound paper um printed um with sublimation ink and i am going to put this on the shirt you could um use your heat resistant tape and tape it down so it doesn't move i'll go ahead and do that smooth it out all right so i heated up my press to 385 and i'm going to press it at 60 seconds all right guys here's the moment of truth let's see voila well of course i didn't mirror the jamaica so it's upside down but guys the fact that it came out and it came out beautiful i love it um it worked so don't laugh at me i didn't mirror image the um the print i was so excited to try this out so

we're going back to our trusty old led 20 what these are 6000 kelvin so they give that more sort of white light rather than a yellowy light you might see on normal floodlights now since i actually made these before my wiring skills and electrical skills have improved so i will be redoing all of this wiring for it i've got some nice black wiring as well that will go nicely for it but then how are we going to fix it to the top so i'm just going to build a couple of brackets i've got some wood so i'm just going to go straight up with a bit of wood and then come across at 45 degrees they'll be black as well so you're not really going to see them and then we can have two nice spotlights decent height above the tank it'll be a good amount of light it works really well on my discus tank for that specific amount of light and hopefully we get really nice growth like i've got in there and this this tank could look absolutely amazing i've got a feeling guys that this tank is going to be my best yet click subscribe so you can see here i'm measuring out two pieces of wood one of 70 centimeters length and one of 30 centimeters these will act as the main frame for our lighting bracket make sure you cut all your wood nice and square and sand off all the edges to get a real neat finish we can then use the right angle triangle piece of wood we've cut off to lock the two pieces of wood into the correct [Music] position [Music] then all we need to do is slap some black paint on it and we're pretty much good to go [Music] so as mentioned i'm going to reuse these flood lights that i've used before they're 20 watt 6500 kelvin color temperature when i originally wired them i just used some spare stuff that i had it was gray wires this just doesn't look good does it so now i'm going to attach this black wires to it i can then attach them to the frames we've created and pin back the wire so it runs all neatly alongside it this should give us a really neat finish and to be honest it's so black all of this that's just going to blend into the background anyway and hopefully you won't even notice them i then bent the frames to the floodlights this means that they'll sit square on the custom brackets that we made i'm saying custom because it sounds a lot better than bits of wood i then attached the lights to the custom brackets and then proceeded to tape the wires to the frames i was going to use wiretacks but you know the ones i've got are too small and i can't go out and get any more so as i always say make do with the stuff you've got and get on with the job now to attach the lights i measured an equal distance from each side of the tank and placed each light bracket 30 centimeters above i always find that 30 centimeters above a tank is a really good place for lighting it kind of stops any algae issues it means you don't have like a high powerful light but then i don't really like to go for high energy setups anyway [Music] well there we have it guys i think that's looking really tidy and that's given us a really good base to start our hard stand so we've got all of our hardscaping from aquarium gardens guys we've got millennium stone in this top box and i've got loads of manzanita wood as well in that bottom box i've not even opened these yet because i wanted to open them with you for the nice surprise but the first thing we need to do is put the base layer in the aquarium so for that i'm going to be using the volcano mineral from jbl now this is supposed to be like super porous volcanic rock the idea being that the water can still circulate at the bottom layer and you won't get sort of like pockets of anaerobic activity i don't really know i'm trying to sound intelligent i don't know all i know is that porous rock allows for masses of bacterial colonization i do know that so that's one reason why this stuff is brilliant because the surface area of each piece is huge compared to say a solid rock now this isn't absolutely essential jbl would love for me to tell you that you have to have it but i'm going to keep it real with you guys you don't have to have it but like with most things in life you do get what you pay for this is a superior product and it will mean that we've got a fantastically biologically filtered aquarium if you imagine the amount of filter media you can get in your filter and then you could times it by about 10 for the amount of media we're going to be able to put in the as a base layer and still have the water circulating around through it and you know the more bacteria you've got the better you can't have too much bacteria can you so let's just get this stuff in so inspiration for this tank comes from fellow uk aquascaper george farmer he escaped one of his tanks a long while ago with a similar theme to what i'm doing here i'll be using his system for substrate and creating the general overall nature aquarium theme that he also went for there'll be a slight variation of course because i'm indenting the middle section to hopefully give a lot more open space at the front for the fish to swim in so i'm going to be using three bags of the jbl volcano mineral in this skate and as you can see i'm pushing it right to the back to bank it up this will give us the much needed height that we'll need to create the look that we're going for with the skate so let's talk about this awesome aquarium guys it's made by aquariums for life it's 100 centimeters across oh wrong way 60 centimeters front to back 60 centimeters in height it's a total of 430 liters i don't know what that is in gallons but i'll put it up on screen it's also got these really nice soft closed doors and the hole inside is lined with solid oak there you go i'm hitting it as proof that it's solid oak anyway the glass is opti-white glass 12 mil thick and the silicon work is absolutely perfect and flawless there's not a single imperfection in it anywhere if you're interested in buying one guys or even taking a look at their website i'll leave a link below they ship everywhere and the prices are really really good as well so i'm going to be using the hugo kamishi decorative sand this stuff looks insanely good and i really like using it on natural style scapes obviously at the moment it doesn't look fantastic just on its own but once we've got our rock border in there i've also got a coarser version of this stuff to really add some details in and amongst all the rocks that way we can get that really nice graded effect as we come towards the front of the aquarium also i might mix in a lighter sound of it at a later date just to give it even more texture you'll notice as well that i'm not adding a really thick layer to the front this is a technique that's used by many aquascapers and it creates a really neat finish it also means that cleaning a maintenance is a lot easier and you can even just remove the sand at a later date and replace it quite easily if you want to so absolutely granted it does look a bit funky guys at the moment i will admit that but this is the base remember so what we've done we've gone up a third of the way at the back with the substrate layer which is the volcano mineral and then the decorative sand at the front actually overlaps that now the reason for that is that in this whole area here we're going to be putting rocks that will divide the two types of substrate these rocks will actually act as a retaining wall because we're going to be putting the tropica aquasore that we've got here and i've got the fine grain stuff because it's my favorite i really like it it just locks plants in really well that's going to be going on top as well which means that by the time we've got our rocks up to about this level and then our aqua soil on top of that we'll probably be looking at having all the substrate totally to about halfway up the tank that's like 30 centimeters of height there which is brilliant just means that we're going to get really great height in our skate now you may be wondering why do we want height in the aquarium well height adds interest so the higher up we can create our focal points the more your eyes are drawn around the tank and it's a lot more interesting in my opinion to be able to look over the whole tank rather than just small areas on the bottom and obviously this is all going to make sense as we progress through the build guys so make sure you're subscribed for all the updates as they come and this stuff here next to timmy's tank it's the stuff i was talking about this corsa you can see there look how it sort of matches the fine grain stuff and i've also got some other sand as well to go with it to just get even more detail as we go along so what i'm unboxing here is a shipment of millennium stone now you might be thinking what's the difference between millennium stone and cereal stone so as far as i can tell cereal stone tends to have like white veins running through it and it looks more sort of rough and and not quite as smooth or rounded if you like millennium stone kind of reminds me of elephant skin in a way it seems to be a little bit more subtle than cereal stone and as you can see we've got an absolute ton of it here i would say there's about 30 kilograms of stone here now it's important to get a large amount of hardscape basically the more you have the more you can choose from and there's nothing worse than looking at a large tank that's got a few bits of rock in it and not a lot else it will completely ruin your aquascape if you don't have enough hardscape to begin with and as you know hardscape is the skeleton of the whole aquarium if you don't get this bit right you're really gonna struggle to get a good look as we progress let's get skating right where to start where to start i'm just gonna pick stuff up start chucking it in and just chat to you whilst i'm doing it and just explain what i'm doing why i'm doing it if it can be explained i mean a lot of this is all kind of random making it up as you go along so let's just get on with it [Music] all right so so far on this side we just got oh yeah so far on this side we've just got a really big sort of section if you like it's quite a sort of impactful area it's going to be even higher as well so what i'm going to do is put even more of the substrate behind these rocks here and then it means we can come up probably about to this height with the rock because i want this side to be boom and then this side to be boom using silly sounds to describe that hopefully you know what i mean there like a big side and then a lower side so it's not all on one level if you like and then that means we've got the two key focal points and we can focus our wood arrangements around those two areas just a quick disclaimer guys i don't want you to think that just because i'm talking in a confident way it means i think i'm some sort of expert or anything i'm gonna let you into a little secret i make all this up as i go along and that is the truth of it i that's how i like to aquascape i like to make it up i don't plan anything i know there are some aquascapers out there who plan it down to the tee and spend like a month on their hard skate i mean as you've just seen then i've just chucked stuff in and thought it looked good does there really need to be anything more than that for what i like doing then no there isn't i appreciate that there's some like competition people out there that like to go above and beyond with their escapes that's not me their stuff looks amazing don't get me wrong but as you'll see as this progresses i don't think there's any need to go to masses of fine tuning and tweaking constantly by all means follow a shape and make it fit but like tiny angles and that on the rock i don't think i'm gonna make a difference because one it's gonna be shaded because i'm gonna have so many plants and wood over the top of it and two it's gonna be full of anubias i've got so much anubias to ram into all these nooks and crannies you won't even be able to see much of the rock i'm now placing a rock into the right side of the tank this side will be a lot shallower than the left and this is deliberate because we don't want to just make it like a solid wall nature doesn't really work like that you can also see we've got a bit of an s shape going on with the position of the rocks this means that in a deeper section we can also add a separate little island if we want to keep that nice and low it will just add a really nice interesting area in the foreground when you're creating an aquascape you want to be picking lots of little points that draw the eyes in and keep them traveling over the whole aquascape if you can do this then you'll end up with a fantastic result in my opinion so it's the next day now guys as i said i want to take the time of this one and you can see i've got all of these rocks still to be able to put on top of this section oh i haven't put the lights on whoops hang on there we go yeah so i want to put these rocks on top of the rocks we've got but in order to do that i need to start building up this layer at the back a bit more i could just use aquasaur only but the problem with that is it will have a tendency to creep through any gaps that we've got here so if i build up the lava rock at the back the volcano mineral if i build that up close to the rocks a bit more and then put the aqua soil on we should be alright in terms of it you know falling into the foreground some of it will that's just how it goes [Music] i then spotted there's a little gap at the front here in this section and i thought it would look really good to block it with another piece of rock [Music] adding in these little pieces of rock in the foreground can really add more detail and give better sense of scale to the larger rocks [Music] so that's all the base layer of substrate and the first layer of rocks in next job is to start building up that background with a bit of our tropica aquarium soil powder stuff this is the fine grain stuff like i said before i like to use it it's really good at just sort of locking in plants if you get nice and deep into it and with the amount of depth we want to create here we can have a really decent layer in there to be able to plant nice and deep so we're now at the stage where we can add our aqua soil in well at least i thought we were and then as i started to pour the aqua soil into this corner i noticed it was creeping through a small gap in the left-hand side stop everything we don't want to continue with it like that i then remembered a method i've used in many of my other tanks to stop this happening what you want to do is take some spare filter floss go around the back of the rock and you can push it into the gaps this means there's absolutely no chance of anything coming through not even fine grains of sand or aquasol or anything which is absolutely perfect and then i thought i might as well go across the whole aquascape and plug everything after that's done we can then start adding in the axle again place it in nice and carefully i like to stick it to the back first and then gently push it forwards with my hands again just seeing if there is any gaps and then if we spot anywhere we can add even more filter floss so that's all the aqua soil well not all of it i've actually banged it up at the back there just to show myself the level i actually want it to be at but by putting in what i have already that's allowed me now to see any gaps that would have fallen through but also it's now enabling me to play some more rock on that level there to be able to raise the height even more in these sections and then we can put even more soil behind that so i know that seems a bit extreme i mean there's quite a lot there already it's about half the aquarium in height but the front bit isn't there's only like an inch there of soil i want more than that especially as there's going to be all crips in this sort of area because that will be the shaded points so now it's a case of just building up a nice big layer of rock there and then in another area sort of here as well not as high because we want a high area and a low area it's just really good for the eyes if you have that and that's what i want to do so you might notice this section here is slightly different so that one at the back there was right forward coming along and it looked like too much of a flat straight wool to me so i set it back a bit which exposed a little bit of the soil i put in some more of the filter floss and then just put a couple more rocks on top you can see this one and this one i didn't film that because it was a bit of a sort of gut reaction to doing something and i just did it thinking that i could film it again afterwards but now it's there it looks good i don't need to change it but we've got some really nice sort of flow going on now we've got like a whoa which is what you want you don't want everything flat do you the next job though is to start adding lots more detail on the front here because at the moment it's looking way too clean for what i like so what's the method then for laying down the detail stones so what you need to do is take the maximum surface area of one portion i'm just kidding you just chuck it down like literally the best way to get this looking as natural as possible is just to throw it in there one thing i will say though is to condense the amount of stones closest to the rock wall as you can so it sort of grades out as it comes forwards this tends to be how stones lay in nature on a river bottom or something like that but again don't focus on that too much just let it sort of happen i'm also using the stone to sort of fill out any deep cracks and crevices as well this should stop any detritus or any grime collecting in those areas at a later date see forward thinking and planning that's the result of doing many scapes now i can think about the long-term cleaning and maintenance aspect of it as i'm building it which is really really useful okay well that's turned out absolutely brilliant i'm loving that look it just instantly transforms it doesn't it and i want to take it one step further as well so i've actually got a load of the rio zingu left over from another project and this stuff's going to add even more of a really nice aesthetic to that sort of border area so as with before guys be random in your placement i'm being a little bit different with this stuff because i'm just chucking it directly onto the stones by doing this it'll fall down and create its own placement it'll look kind of more natural and as if it sort of flowed down a river and just fallen into place i then got bored of doing it with my hand i just started chucking it on with the tub well i think we've absolutely nailed it guys i'm loving that look grading looks so natural but i think we're kind of missing something in this section or we're not missing it but i'd like to see a small little outcrop if you like of rocks something i can add a few little plants to like a little island if you like separate on its own keeping it shallow of course i don't want it to be impacting the main view of the whole aquarium i just think a little bit of detail down there might be quite good so we've got a couple of rocks left over i'm going to put them in that area and just see how it goes might not work but hopefully it does i know i know i know i know you're probably thinking that looks awful why have you got that random bit there it doesn't go the flow trust me it should come into its own when we start planting but overall guys i have to say i think this is the best hardscape i've ever done hopefully you'll agree with me and i think the reason it's been so successful is that i've been able to take my time with it like i said doing the videos for you in this way more of a vlog style as it happens and it just means i can take a lot more consideration with everything i'm doing and making sure that i'm 100 happy with it before moving on to the next stage this is something that you should all try and practice when you're building your hardscapes [Music] oh baby look we got some insanely good pieces of manzanita there so this is like the gnarled man's anita they call it so it's the bigger chunkier pieces look at this piece here it's a big old piece that's going to look awesome isn't it look i mean obviously it'll be further back than that but [Music] manzanita is an awesomely detailed wood from the western parts of northern america it's perfect for plant aquariums and it does not leach any tannins or color into the water it's also really good for attaching plants to like java fern anubias and mosses just to give it that really mature look straight away now it is very buoyant and will try to float so you can either soak it in some water for a couple of weeks or you can attach rocks to it to make sure it's weighed down straight away i just want to get started just jump straight in [Music] so you may have seen many other aquascapes on youtube following specific lines with their wood and i do do that some do do there's that again i do do that sometimes but in this instance what i'm trying to achieve with the wood here is create a framework for all the plants it's going to be placed amongst it i'm trying to create a skeleton if you like and then we can place our plants all around that skeleton and condense them into the areas that i actually want them to be so as i said to you earlier on in the video i'm going for two main focal points with this one well i think that is looking insanely good guys i don't know about you but come on let it look especially when you walk in the studio hang on just watch this and don't forget guys if you are interested in joining behind the scenes club then click the join button below for loads of additional content so we open the door and then boom look at that high impact that is i think so yeah you can let me turn off these lights behind quickly there we go right look so look at that like you can see i mean there is kind of a flow i went with you can see the angles sort of coming in diagonals you don't just want straight up stuff because it doesn't always work but every now and again like this piece here it does work to do some straight pieces but again so i was talking about the two areas so the area is going to be here and then also over this side will be our two main focal points this one should be a little bit higher than this one but overall in the end it's all just going to be like just one big jungle that noise again was [Music] but i'm absolutely loving that guys but the problem is well not a problem but what we've got to do now is make sure all that stuff stays where it is when we go to fill up with water because if i was to start planting now and you know like getting some of the moss on the wood and the anubias fill it up with water the whole thing would just float every single bit of it so what i'm going to do down here is aquarium silicone specifically designed for aquariums so i'm going to use some of this which is not really a method i've actually seen others use really but i'm just going to do blobs of it in certain points where the wood touches the rock and if i just do that and then i would touch it a bit of wood afterwards you can go and cover it with moss or bits of gravel or whatever but yes you're just going to do that now and then by the time it gets to the morning that should all be like stuck down and it actually means it's going to be really easy for us to start applying all the different plants that we want to the wood so yeah i'm just going to crack on with that now and get that silicon on those different points [Music] right so i've gone round and basically i put a little dab of the black silicone on anything i didn't actually know it was black until i started squeezing it out but to be honest it doesn't really matter because you can't see it now and you won't definitely won't see it when we've got all the plants all over it but yeah i've just done one sort of big blob in all these little key areas so basically everything is actually locked down and hopefully by the morning will be secure and then i can just go along and just put on a bit more and even more key areas and just get it absolutely solid now the good thing about silicon is if i don't like it or i want to change escape at any point i can just peel it off it like takes two seconds it all comes off as one big lump as well so it doesn't damage the wood or the rocks or anything and it's perfect really yeah i think a really good option to you know stick stuff together that we don't see very often i suppose it's because it takes time to set i wouldn't want to be touching any of this till the morning now anyway if you are going to do this make sure you use the aquarium safe silicone because some of the other silicons have like anti-algaes in and stuff like that which is actually harmful to your fish potentially so yeah just make sure you're getting the right stuff what you want to get is a hundred percent silicone that's it well it's just the next morning let's go and have a look and see if the silicone is dry okay how we looking right touch test that's not moving anywhere perfect solid i mean you don't have to it doesn't have to be like completely solidly on but as long as if you tap it it doesn't move like that like i could move it and it does move a little bit but it's not going anywhere and this main piece here that's on solid this bit all connected everything's connected together now which is perfect that's what we want there's no way it should be able to float up i'm really loving this little island i've made as well really happy with it i've got a little tiny piece of manzanita here as well i might do like a little island tree or something might look a bit tacky but you know what i don't care it'll be quite cute when it just have a little like a little manzanita tree or something coming over the top i don't know whatever but the good thing is now that all this is secure we can start plating some plants onto it i think it's a really good idea to get the detailed front areas done first before we then move in to the back area where we can put our stem plants and anything tool or like valve that they'll sweep over yeah we'll do that so for our plants i've got a nice mixture of different things i've got tissue culture plants and i've also got like different mosses and things as well so this is weeping moss this one's come in a little pot i don't know why then i've got taiwan moss which is grown in like a gel and you know you just wash the gel off and then you can put it wherever you want and then i've got my kramphum monte carlo and i think that's how you say it as well yeah i finally got one correct so yeah monte carlo this is like sort of plant that is it's in a liquid in there nutrient liquid it can be placed in substrate or it can be placed directly on things it works both ways actually quite a versatile little plant this is tiny little textures as well so it should look really good and then we've got tons and tons of anubias that you can see all in here loads of bucephalandra as well or bucca philando however you want to say it got that in here as well being stored we've also got loads of bolbitis and tons and tons of java fern and also i'm going to be using this hydrocarbon japan hydrocarbon japan as well little trimmings of that can just go in all these nooks and crannies again because that doesn't actually need to be planted it will pull nutrients from the water column which is ideal so basically there's going to be like a solid wall of green effectively there and then even more green behind it and because of that and because of how amazing this wood is i don't want to put any moss on the wood itself it's beautiful it doesn't need to be covered in moss in my opinion so what i'll be doing with the moss is attaching it to small stones and pebbles and placing it strategically around the scape and then it will sort of fill in those areas as it grows and should look absolutely awesome why am i talking like this so here's everything you're going to need to make some awesome moss rocks super glue cotton scissors mosses of course paper towel water mister and rocks start by placing moss on the rocks and when you have a good amount on you can wrap the rocks and moss in cotton thread it helps to have everything wet at this stage it just helps it stick better to the rocks once you've covered the whole rocking moss and wrapped it in cotton you can then add a dab of glue it helps to have the gel form of super glue for this but you can still possibly do it with a normal kind of super glue you then place a tiny piece of paper towel on top of the super glue press it down gently and allow it to stick the point of this is that it's just much less fiddly than trying to tie knots having to undo and oh it's pain such a pain this is so much easier now obviously as you can imagine with the amount of rocks that we need to wrap in the moss it's going to be quite time consuming so if you place down some kind of tray put some more paper towel in it and spray it with the mister we can then place each moss rock in there as we're doing it and cover it back up with more wet paper towel this just means we don't have to rush anything and we just take our time and get it looking really good [Music] right so we've got our mosses all ready everything's stuck down everything's good to go make sure you've got your mr handy because mosses will dry out quite quickly they're quite forgiving so it doesn't matter if you know you're not perfectly soaking wet but you want to keep them as moist as possible [Music] [Applause] i mean i actually prepared more moss there than i thought but wow i'm really loving that look how vibrant it looks that's gonna look amazing even like that that looks pretty cool didn't it but obviously we're not gonna stop there nothing like stopping there because next we need to add some of the anubias and booster phylandra that we've got in this tank so i'm going to take it out prep it all and then we've got a whole load just to place wherever we want so to prepare your plants is pretty simple but i do know a few little tricks and tips that might help you along the way to start with just remove the basket from the plant and you'll see that it's surrounded by what's called a rock wool and this is just something that absorbs minerals from the water where it's grown these are actually grown in little tubs and then the top part is out of water the bottom part is in the water so the roots can take nutrition from the water itself the reason they're growing like this is because the atmosphere is full of co2 and there's better lighting and everything out of water effectively but anyway once you've split your rock wall in half and pulled away as much as you can with your fingers you can then use your tweezers or a fork or something spiky and just start prying bits of it off it's the most effective way to do it without damaging the plant or the roots so that's nearly all the rock will remove we've got loads of plants there we've got booster philander wavy green and we've got anubias nana barteri barteri one of those so now let's get it in the tank [Applause] [Music] right so obviously i've just noticed this big eyesore here that i've not really done anything about yet so what we can do for that is this mist it down a little bit to get a bit of moisture on it just like that let that drip off for a second or soak in and then we can apply some super glue directly to it look just like that and then we can take our anubius as well as our booster philandra and just attach it directly to it and that will stick very quickly it doesn't harm the plants and this superglue by the way guys is i think it's like cyanoacetate or something like that it doesn't harm the fish or the plants at all and as soon as it actually touches water it becomes inert and goes into sort of like a solid plastic there we go look that's that one there you can't even tell there's a bit of wood there perfect [Music] right so that's all of the anubias in and the mosses i think for the booster philandra i actually want to attach some of that to the wood it doesn't sort of cover the wood or detract from it anyway and it's a really sort of subtle plant that doesn't grow massive so some key little areas like here maybe and on this little branch at the front i'll still keep it low because it doesn't like too much light but you know like here would be perfect as well so that branch that branch and then around this section i think would be really nice [Music] right we're all ready plants are moist they'll be okay for a good while but now we need to select our plants and where am i going to get them from oh i'm going to get them from there perfect so i'm going to be placing the java fern and the bolbitis in and amongst all the wood you can see here that will then leave us the space behind it for all the planted plants that need to go in and then i'm going to stick a load of crips in amongst it all as well in the shaded areas some of the crips can actually not be planted i just i've found that some of the best growth i've had with some of my crips has been just random in between gaps in the rock like who'd have thought that would be a thing but i've done it before because i didn't have any room to plant and it grew so well and ever since i've done it in a few other places and looks really good i'll show you an example later in my discus aquarium but for now we need to just concentrate on this one in which case why am i still talking let's go so being that i'm a content creator tropico provided me with a boatload of plants to be able to create awesome videos for you guys but if you're looking at this amount of plants thinking i can't afford to buy that many don't worry you don't need this many you can create exactly what i'm creating here with a third of the amount of plants probably even less the only difference is that your setup will probably take about three months before it's fully filled in whereas i have the benefit of being able to make it look full right from the start which really suits me because i'm so darn impatient anyway darn that's not a word i use very often but what i will say guys that you should always buy as many plants as you can afford you know obviously my plants are supplied now but before they were i still spent a lot of money on plants because it's so important to give yourself the best chance of success you want to buy a lot of plants from the start i recommend putting back a good third of your budget just for plants alone i know that can sound like a lot but with a lot of plants in the tank from the word go you massively reduce your chance of algae and any other headaches water quality is top notch from the word plants plants are just amazing they're just amazing just get as many as you can put them all in so here i am prepping plants again wow i've prepped a lot of plants in the last few days but you know what an awesome problem to have take off the rock wall scrape off the wrestlers and tweezers job done [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the stage is set now i'm going to start placing some stuff in i'm going to work on the biggest boom area first this one over on the far left i'm just going to start placing stuff in i'm going to build forward to the back so that they're not blocking anything smallest at the front tallest at the back same with stem plants but just with java phones obviously we've got three types of java ferns we've got like the normal one which is big then we've got narrow leaf then we've got trident so we get smaller as you go anyway i'm just going to get them in and then we'll talk about what i've done afterwards so you guys can understand [Music] right that's looking fantastic so far but it's still not quite boom enough for me like i want it really big so i've just found another couple of pots of the well i'd say i've just found they're not exactly hidden but another couple of the biggest form of the microsorum patera survivor the java fern yes it's the biggest type so i'm going to put that right in this section here i want this section filled out even more you see and then it will come into sort of a negative area of stuff or stems at the back or whatever and then the smallest java phones will be in this sort of gap here trailing on leading your eye onto the smaller boom section but anyway let's get that big section of java phone in there [Music] yeah there we go that's better now it's boom loving that that's brilliant next job is to get that ow that really hurt so the next job is to get the smallest version of java ferns in which is this really narrow leaf stuff is called trident because it sort of comes apart in freeze but this will be good details to put around the rocks you see so like that gap in the middle there would look really good you don't want to overdo it i still want other plants in there as well but that's why i didn't get too much of the stuff because it's just good for a little detail so let's get that in as well right that's boom done now we need to work on boom um i ran out of plants well i've run out of prepared plants i need to prepare more go [Music] right so plants don't oh i've turned the lights off just whilst i was prepping those plants to stop them drying out for longer to stop me dry out quicker is what i meant to say there there we go oh that's so good right prep plants all for this side but like i said i want to keep that sort of negative space in the middle because that creates a really good look the narrow leaf going through the middle and then the tall stuff at the back so i don't follow many conventional aquascaping rules guys i just sort of put stuff in and go by what i think looks good but one tip i did get from josh sim on the green aqua channel was that if you use one plant on one side you tend to want to use it on the other side as well and it just creates a really nice natural balance so i try to stick to that where possible which means that as you can see we've got bobitus on this side and we've got bulbitis on this side bubbatos it's a really nice word to say uh so we want to have on this side as well i'm thinking in this corner and on this corner here the problem is if you've got somewhere behind that hasn't got anywhere to sort of lodge in anything i could put it underneath here see but that wouldn't look good just in that little area i want it here and if i lay it down there it's not going to stay it's a good tip get the barbitus in and then you can just lay a stone on top of it and that will pin it against the wood and then we're all good to go all right let me just take you in oh this is difficult take ah took you in right can you see there there's the stone that's just leaning against this whoa that's awkward but yeah you get the idea so now that'll stay there without having to glue it pin it doing anything with like string it's just there and you can't see the rock and the rock's taking up barely any space as well so perfect carry on right so that's all the epiphyte plants in so when i say epithet i mean stuff that doesn't need to be planted into soil and you could to be honest just stop there couldn't you and that'll be it but we're creating a jungle so if you look at the back here we've still got tons of room behind for loads of planting and that's the beauty of this tank so i think i've already mentioned 120 centimeters across 60 centimeters back and 60 centimeters down it's from aquariums for life guys go to their website it's in the description have a look really good price amazing amazing tank 12 mil opti-white glass and an oak stand i mean you can't get better than that but it's the depth that is really really doing it for me because look at the amount of foreground space we've got tons of rocks tons of plants in already and there's still so much room at the back for plantings basically i want to keep the planting short in the middle so like low stuff like crips that don't grow crazy fast and then we can go for stems and val at the side i've got that valescenaria nana which is like the thin stuff so i think they just look so much nicer when you've got big tapes of normal jungle veil going over the top i think that spoils the scale a bit this stuff should look fantastic though also got the hydrocodone japan but i'm going to be adding that in at the end in a few key areas because that stuff grows crazy and overtake everything so yeah let's get some stems and valleys so apologies for the complete lack of being able to see what the hell i'm doing here but there's a really really funny angle to try and get filming in but you get the idea stem plants come right behind the java fern they're going to grow taller than that and look really cool and they can be trimmed in a way that banks them backwards and then the valescenarian nana behind that as well so that will grow even taller it will reach the surface and then it will sweep all the way along the back just like in my discus tank eventually that will reduce the lighting overall but it will give a really cool greeny naturey effect kind of like a jungle [Music] so now it's time to prepare our crips that will be going in the middle section we've got cryptocriney wendy patchy and tropica variety as you can see some of the leaves have melted a little bit just peel them off they're fine they're old all the new growths coming through anyway so that'll be perfect now in this immersed sort of state as they're growing out of water they're quite green but once we put them into the water and they've been growing a while all the new leaves coming through will give us a really good variation of color in the middle section we'll get like ready brown tint you know just a bit more variety to the already green sections that we've got now these are all classed as mid-ground plants they grow similar sort of height i'm not planting them with any sort of structure i'm just kind of going for a random look i think that looks really good with crips and should give us a really cool focal point in the middle of the tank [Music] we then need to fill up the left side of the tank in the same way that we filled out the right rotala rotunda folia just behind the java fern and then the vallasinaria nana all the way across the back so i just remembered guys i've got some of these like nutrition capsules from tropica i'm going to stick those in the soil as well because why not i've got them here they'll go at the back i'll just take the tweezers take one put it into the saw well the roots are the plants at the back [Music] right guys well i think we're there last thing we need to do is just give it a massive massive spray down and then that'll stop any crud just floating up into the water when we fill it up i mean it doesn't matter because it will get filtered but you know let's just spray it anyway okay we've got all of that looking great everything's where i want it to be i'm loving it but we now need the filtration the filtration what's the filtration it's in here we got one of was a two was it why the hell am i singing yeah so we got two oraze filters guys we got the thermo 600 and a thermo 250. why the hell do you need two filters so the thermo 600 is gonna be doing the brunt of the filtration obviously it's gonna have the most media in it and everything like that obviously combined with all of the volcano mineral that we've got belief beneath all the escape as well but the 250 is going to be sort of like a support one just for extra flow so i'm going to connect the outlet and the inlet of course to this side at the back so it'll just create a gentle flow over the background plants because stems they don't really like high flow plus the vowel is going to look much nicer just gently like you know sweeping across in the gentle flow and then you'll come to the front side and i've got some nice glass lily pipes as well i don't know why i'm looking down there they're not down there i've got some nice glass little pipes i need to clean up because i've had them out of a tank for ages and they look horrendous and here they are waiting to be clean we've got rust we've got grime oh so these are filters are the best i've ever used the plastic quality is really high grade there's no chance of anything snapping off here now why are they so good well first of all they've got this extra little compartment here it's called a pre-filter basically this takes all of the grime out of the water before it goes through the main section and the best thing about it is that you can just remove at any point clean out the sponges put it back in and you're good to go again now the second thing i really really like about it is that it's got a built-in heater obviously that's not essential but it looks so much better not having heaters in your tank i can just about cope with inlet and outlets for filters but if we can take the heater out the equation that's brilliant heater is also removable as you can see in case it needed replacing or anything like that so this particular model comes with four baskets of sponges and then two baskets of the media this is way too much to carry all at one time it also comes with all the pipe work clips and suctiony things and all that other boring stuff that i don't need to go into details on you've all seen all that before pretty standard stuff on most filters so we just need to cut the pipe in half we can feed it through the opening in the side of our aquarium plug it into the inlet and outlet taps and then all we've got to do is attach our inlet and outlet and as i said for this one i'm using the glass lily pipes not provided with the kit they're bought separately but they weren't expensive they're just a cheap version that took four months to arrive from china a while ago i might add oh okay thank god that's over with we got all the pipe work clean eventually you might have been wondering or looking what the hell i was doing with this thing i didn't have any pipe cleaners and this is way too big and rigid to go through it all so i just found a load of these things in my kids craft area just flashing this really long piece of it all rolled up oh it got the job done though see make do the stuff you've got and get the job done [Music] well that guys is everything set we've got the glassware over there if anyone's wondering i'll put a link in the description hopefully if i can still find it but it's just a cheap ebay set like and then obviously this side we've got the standard oil fittings that's fine you won't really see that there's going to be loads of stuff growing up in that area anyway at some point but a later date okay so the moment's finally here let's get some water in it boom [Music] okay so that's the beauty fill up with water let's get those filters primed and running we should get a nice shimmer effect on the surface once we get that water bubbling away [Music] well guys the tank's now been set up for about three days i actually delayed releasing some of the videos for you because it was going through that horrible misty phase that all new tanks go through anyway that's cleared now and here it is look at that i think it's looking awesome it's completely clear actually and how if i turn off all the other lights wouldn't it right there we go all the other lights off but look at that look at that density we've got exactly what i was looking for i'm glad i waited a few days to show you guys this because all the plants have gone sort of up towards the light as they should do lights being these awesome little led flood lights that you can buy just link in description guys really cheap from amazon brilliant little things look look at the light we're getting on for just 220 watt leds i think they're like 20 pound or 25 dollars something like that look really cheap good color inlet as well so what we've got here we've got all of our java fern all where we wanted it and boom and then we've got lesson boom and then we've got our crips at the back hiding in we've got the val over there look that's eventually just gonna it's gonna swoop over like an arch all the way across that middle section and it'll make sort of like a tunnel as well which would look really good but i'm really happy with how it's turned out and also i love the shimmer effect look that we're getting in the studio now like if i come back here you see you don't really get it with a strip light there is a little bit of shimmer in that you can see on the top but that's what you get of a spotlight and some decent surface movement that's also why i've lifted up the outlet there so that it can create that sort of rippling effect all the way along the surface i've also done it a bit over here with the lily pipe as well but the little pipe does it automatically you don't actually have to lift it out but so the first fish to go in the awesome buenos aires tetra these guys school really well they actually get quite big as well for tetra but an awesome addition to the tank [Music] next up is our angels i went for a mixed bag of angels here because i just want to add a bit more character rather than just a single colored school i just think it's more interesting to look at we've got one black one diamond two gold marbled and one altum style and not to forget two awesome emerald corydoras and stir by coridora [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] so [Applause] [Music] you", "athYDVmzZWc": "- Two dudes.\n- Two tummies. - 52 ice creams.\n- Let's talk about that. (upbeat music) Good Mythical Morning! - Welcome to our 1700th episode! - What?\n(clapping) - One thousand and seven\nhundred, that's what that is. - Crazy!\nThank you, sincerely, thank you so much for comin'\nalong on this journey with us and making us a part\nof your daily routine. - Yes, and to celebrate\nthis very special occasion, we're going to eat a lot of ice cream. - Oh, yay. Y'all may not be aware of this, but we are not the only old\nguy buddy duo in the world who like to eat strange things. There's another duo that's been concocting a plethora of sometimes strange but always delicious ice\ncream flavors for decades and that's Jerry and Ben.\n- Yup. So today, we're sampling all 52 pint size Ben & Jerry's flavors to one, make us happy--\n- Uh huh. - And two, to determine the best. - And three, to celebrate!\n- Not a sponsor. Not a sponsor.\n- 1700 episodes! - But you're welcome, anyway, B and J. It's time for Gut Check:\nBen & Jerry's Edition. Okay, 52 flavors is a lot,\nso we're gonna have to taste every single one\nin rapid succession. This is gon' get crazy. - And B-T-dubs, Ben & Jerry's also has a whole bunch of frozen\nyogurt and non-dairy flavors but today, we're just dealing\nwith the ice cream pints. It's plenty.\n- Yes, okay. We're gonna be spoon\nfed every single flavor and then, using our initial gut instinct, we have to immediately score each one on a scale of one to 100 and then create an official combined score,\nwhich, when calculated at a rapid speed by our very own CPA, that's our Creamy Public Accountant. - Hi, thanks so much for hiring me. Tax season is not the most\nstressful time of year for me, so this is great timing (laughs). - After we've tasted\nand scored every flavor, the top four flavors will\nreceive a closer taste inspection until we're left with\nonly one, the official very best Ben & Jerry's ice\ncream flavor in the world. - All right, Stevie, help\nus kick off our festivities. - [Stevie] Gentlemen, if\nat any point you feel that you need your palates to be cleansed, you have access to the ultimate palate cleanser, a salt lick. There's nothing scientific about that. I just really wanted see you lick those big pieces of salt.\n- Thank you. - [Stevie] We shall begin\nwith the chocolate category. Are you ready?\n- Yes. Here we go in three, two, one. Chocolate Fudge Brownie. - Ooh, ooh, that's good.\n- Oh, that's good. - Especially with the brownie. I'm talkin'--\n- 81. - I'm talkin' 72.\n- Chocolate Shake It. - Shake it, what? - Oh, there's somethin' chewy in there. - Oh, I like that.\n- I like that one less. I'm givin' it a--\n- I like it more. 82.\n- 58. - I think I like--\n- Chocolate Therapy. - Mm, it's a richer chocolate. But it's--\n- Oh, it's so dark. - Kinda boring, 43.\n- What? 72.\n- Oh. - [Stevie] Glampfire Trail Mix. - Mm.\n- Oh, it's like a Rocky Road. - Ooh, but it's somethin' different. - Little crunchy. (stuttering) 77. - Um, 69. - [Stevie] New York Super Fudge Chunk. - Mm, I've been to New York. - Oh, once you get to that fudge. - Got walnuts in it, not a fan. - Yeah.\n- 53. - Mm, 29. - [Stevie] Phish Food. - Ah.\n- Oh, like the band. - Not a fan of Phish.\n- What happened to, maybe too much.\n- Not my favorite, 58. - I don't love this one either, a lot, 21.\n- S'mores. - I've been campin'.\n- Oh, I can actually taste-- - This is pleasant.\n- I can taste the campfire. - I'm back up in the 70s, 74.\n- It's 71. - The Tonight Dough.\n- Ah. Shout out to Jimmy Fallon.\n- Our friend, Mr. Fallon. I love all the doughs,\nthat one went down quick. - It's nice, it's simple, it's-- - 80s, 89.\n- What? I, yeah.\n- It's not that, sorry Jimmy, it's not that good, 76. - I like that dough.\n- Minter Wonderland. - Mm.\n- Eh. - I love mint in my chocolate. I know he doesn't like it.\n- I don't love mint in my chocolate.\n- Yeah. I'm gonna give that one,\nI'm gonna give that one an 83 'cause I know he's\ngonna score it really low. - (laughs) Yeah, I gotta give that a 19. (Rhett laughs) - [Stevie] Okay, now it's time for the vanilla flavors category. If you haven't licked your salt, which, I saw you do it, Link, I really-- - I'll do it again.\n- Yeah, thank you. Please do it now and we will begin with Vanilla. - Oh.\n- Oh. - I'm white.\n- That is a good-- - I'm just, I'm just, I'm just trying to-- - Trying to connect?\n- I'm trying to connect with it on some level. - That's a good, it's good\nthat it's that simple. Man, I gotta give it a 50.\n- I'm gonna say 45. - [Stevie] Vanilla Caramel Fudge. - Oh.\n- Mm. We're gettin' better. - I feel like a baby\non his birthday every. \"Mama's gonna feed you.\"\n- That's good, that's pretty simple,\nI'm gonna give that a 61. - Too much caramel. Yeah, I'm gonna give a 32.\n- You gotta be faster. - [Stevie] Americone Dream. - Mm, 'cause it's got cone pieces? - I don't even know what's\nhappening in my mouth but I like it.\n- It is fun. - So good.\n- I didn't know that I would love it.\n- 78. 78, that's good.\n- 59. - [Stevie] Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. - Did I get some of your thumb in my mouth with that one?\n- Yep. Sorry. Mm.\n- How is that happening? - That's a classic.\n- I like cookie dough. I'm not a huge fan of it in my ice cream. - 57.\n- What? I was gonna give it higher than that, 61. - [Stevie] Chubby Hubby. - What--\n- I was a chubby hubby, like,\none year into marriage. - Now, there's some peanut butter in this and a lotta crunch. - There's a very crunchy wafer-y thing that I'm not liking in my ice cream, 41. - Yeah, that's a struggle for me, 34. - [Stevie] Ice Cream Sammie. - Okay.\n- That just tastes like an ice cream sandwich. - But it should be an\nice cream form, three. It only works in its form.\n- 74. - [Stevie] Milk & Cookies. - I've had both of these.\n- This is like Oreo but they can't say Oreo. - It's cookies and cream. Yeah, that's cookies and cream. It's solid but there's a much bigger world of ice cream out there. I'm gonna give this one a 55.\n- I'mma give this a 55. - [Stevie] Salted Caramel Almond. - Um.\n- That's a good ice cream. - Tastes like hard candy if\nit was cold and not as hard. - 68.\n- 27. - It seems like you guys\nmight need a little pick up, so we're gonna switch to our next section, which is the coffee section.\n- There's a coffee section? - It's true.\n- Just like a grocery store. - [Stevie] Here we go in three, two, one. Brewed to Matter. - Oh, there's a punch to that. - I like that. - 80. - I don't feel that great about it, 78. - It's exquisite.\n- Chillin' the Roast. - Has, like, an amaretto thing in it, really not liking that.\n- Frappuccino. - 28, that's the worst one for me so far. - Yeah, what is that amaretto thing? - Amaretto. - 12.\n(Rhett laughs) - [Stevie] Coffee, Coffee, BuzzBuzzBuzz! - Hm, not as good as the\nfirst coffee, by a long shot. Not bad, though.\n- 47. - 53. - [Stevie] Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch. - Same coffee as the last time. - But with toffee, me likey. 82.\n- Mm-mm, I don't like the toffee. 22. - [Stevie] Cold Brew Caramel Latte. - They like to put\ncaramel in a lot of stuff. - You don't like caramel? - I don't think I like it in my ice cream. - That's subtle but not\nenough happening for me there. I'm gonna say 57.\n- 43. - [Stevie] Okay, boys, we're moving on to the fruity category. - Oh, we gotta really lick. - Get that fruit. (Link groans) - Here we go.\n- Are you having fun yet? - In three--\n- Oh, I'm having tons of fun. - Two, one.\n- Gotta go. - Chunky Monkey.\n- Chunky Monkey! - I love banana. He doesn't, surprise. - I'm sorry I don't like\na lot of things, I mean-- - 84, that's one of my favorites. - 33, Patrick Huey! - [Stevie] Cherry Garcia. - Another one of my favorites. We got cherry, 85, that's good. - 17. - [Stevie] Pumpkin Cheesecake. - Now, I like pumpkin\nand I like cheesecake and this is really, oh, that's smooth. - It's good, but the\npumpkin spice is just not, 78.\n- 68. - [Stevie] Red, White & Blueberry. - That's weird.\n- It's almost like a strawberry shortcake theme. - That's surprisingly good. It's got a crumb to it. - Too fruity.\n- Ooh. - 61.\n- 88. - [Stevie] Strawberry Cheesecake. - That tastes exactly like\nstrawberry cheesecake. - But there's a little\nbit of a graininess. Like a graininess. - 64. - 66. - [Stevie] Okay, that\nconcludes the fruit round. - Okay. - But do you have--\n- Wow. - [Stevie] Room for a round of legumes? 'Cause it's the peanut butter round, boys! - I thought you were\ngonna say bean ice cream and I was getting excited.\n- [Stevie] Here we go, in-- - All right, I'ma be tough on these 'cause these are my fave.\n- Three, two, one.

Very rich, 67. - [Stevie] Everything But The... - Oh, that was it.\n- What? Too many flavors trying too hard. - [Rhett] 33. - 31. - [Stevie] Sweet Like\nSugar Cookie Dough Core. - Oh, that's weird. - Something's not working in there. 45. - 32. - [Stevie] Cinnamon Buns. - Mm, I freaking love Cinnamon Buns. Ice cream, even better\nthan the cinnamon buns. - I like cinnamon buns better\nthan Cinnamon Buns ice cream so I'm gonna give this a 52. - 94! - [Stevie] Half Baked. - I love a Half Baked. - A lot of these are tasting similar now. - Starting to blur.\n- That was good, 71. - 82. - [Stevie] Oat of This Swirled. - Oatmeal cookie. - This is not one of my favorites. 49. - I really like this one. 86. - [Stevie] Salted Caramel Core. - 29.\n- 73. - [Stevie] Triple Caramel Chunk. - 75, smooth. - 22. - [Stevie] Urban Bourbon. - Urban Bourbon? - Not a huge fan of whiskey\nflavor in my ice cream. 17.\n- 7. - [Stevie] Boom Chocolatta!

(upbeat music) - All right, in honor\nof our 1700th episode, we're honoring you with this super limited Mythical Crew Honorary Member tee. This thing is only available for 17 hours at mythical.com.\n- Today. The timing has already started, the counter is counting\ndown at mythical.com. Go over there and pre-order this T-shirt to be a part of history and\nthank you, again, so much. All right, let's find out\nwhat are our top four. Don't give us the rankings, so it doesn't. We're starting over in\nterms of ranking these four. - [Stevie] In no\nparticular order, we have: Peanut Butter Fudge Core. - Of course, peanut butter,\nbut with the fudge core. - That makes sense.\n- Peanut Butter Half Baked. - Peanut butter?\n- Okay, I see it. - Half baked.\n- I see a theme. I sense a theme.\n- Okay. - [Stevie] Peanut Butter World. - We love peanut butter. - [Stevie] And the other\nthing that you love: The Tonight Dough! (both laughing) - Now--\n- Shoutout to Jimmy Fallon. - But I will say that The\nTonight Dough does have peanut butter cookie dough in it. - Okay, so now we gotta figure out-- - Let's taste that one again.\n- We gotta rank these. I'm coming in on The Tonight Dough. - Yeah. - [Stevie] The Tonight Dough has caramel and chocolate ice cream with chocolate cookie swirls and gobs of chocolate chip cookie dough and peanut butter cookie dough. - It's a very good ice cream. It's a very good ice cream. - Two types of doughs? That's good. Let's go in here. - [Link And Stevie] Peanut Butter World. - [Stevie] Milk chocolate ice cream with peanut buttery swirls\nand chocolate cookie swirls. - I mean, it's got actual peanut butter. - I love the way they put peanut butter into their ice cream. I like this better than this. Because I know the dough is good but the real peanut butter swirls, yeah, it just does something for me. - I don't know yet. I think that those may be our top two. So let's go into these. - [Stevie] Peanut Butter Fudge Core. Chocolate and peanut butter ice cream with many peanut butter cups\nand a peanut butter fudge core. - What the crap. - Yep, so, that core in the\nmiddle is softer than ice cream. - It's got peanut butter cups in it. I don't like it as much.\n- Yeah, me neither. The peanut butteriness of it,\nbecause it's within fudge, it's just not as pure.\n- Yeah, yeah. So these two are better than\nthat, I agree with that. - [Stevie] Peanut Butter Half Baked. Chocolate and peanut butter ice cream mixed with gobs of peanut\nbutter cookie dough and fudge brownies. - It's good but I'm missing\nthe straight up peanut butter. - Let's get rid of the\nPeanut Butter Fudge Core. - Okay.\n- Now, let's confer a little bit. Do you disagree about number two? - Okay, I don't disagree.\n- Okay. - This is not as good\nas either one of these. - All right, so we're\nplacing this at number three. Half Baked. - But I'm still torn. I'm torn on these.\n- Yeah. I know what the deal is. - Are you just trying to get invited on \"The Tonight Show\" again? I think--\n- Absolutely. - I think we can just go back if we have something to promote. - I think we agree. The Tonight Dough is second place. And--\n- Officially the best, in my\nestimation, by a long shot, now that I've compared these top four, ice cream that Ben & Jerry's has to offer is Peanut Butter World!\n(clapping) - Peanut Butter, oh, crap! (producer laughs)\nWarn a guy! All right? - We did it, man. We did it, we came, we saw, and we determined who had the best--\n- Ate a bunch of ice cream.

Pre-order it for only 17\nhours at mythical.com.", "BE4Ddg_1_FA": "Today we're talking about the Canvas\n100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt. Now this is one of our favorite ring-spun\ncotton t-shirts. One because of how many colors it's offered in, love it that it\ncomes in so many cool colors. It's also great because it comes in a lady's\nversion too, the Bella 100% ring-spun cotton shirt. It has a great fit, love this shirt so much. It actually, I think\nover the course of a lot of washes it maintains that softness which was a big thing for a hundred percent ring-spun. Instead of just telling you though, we do have our model. He's gonna come over show it in action. First thing you're gonna notice is just that tailored fit, partially\nbecause of the side seam here. The side seam makes sure that it just kind of hugs the body. It's not going to be too tight, but it is gonna tailor in a little which is just flattering. Everybody wants now kinda that nicer fabric but also the nicer fit.  The next thing you're going to notice is the neckline. We love this because it's a great dip here not too tight either, has some flexibility. That ring-spun cotton has a little more tug to it than just a regular, 100% cotton. The sleeve length is also awesome, super flattering it's a little higher. It's not going to be baggy, which is great. Now you might be  wondering though, we've talked a lot about a hundred percent ring-spun cotton, how does it, how does it wear over the course of life? Is it gonna shrink, anything that way. With this garment\nyou're not really gonna have to worry about shrinkage over the first few washes. A year or two years down the line, it could potentially if you're gonna nuke this thing in the dryer but it is pre-shrunk and very true to size, so we love this. Again, like I said though it does come in a ladies version, the Bella 100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt. Overall, great shirt, love it, a ton of color options and you look great in it too. Thank you.

\u266a \u266a But now I'm back to back I'm ory \u266a \u266a Reborn yeah everything blessed \u266a \u266a Bring the ashes brings a new story \u266a \u266a Sure don't tell imma ace this test \u266a \u266a Last year 100k on the Ad Sense \u266a \u266a Your channel aint even got ads yet \u266a \u266a Now I'm suited up like I'm \u266a", "1P5-Lni5TSI": "a lot of people view fashion as like a very exclusive thing and it's only for like a certain kind of woman but that's not true we all wear clothes all the time and fashion can be used as a wellness tool it makes us feel good when we look good and it doesn't have to be like these really intense crazy looks it's just wearing stuff that makes you feel comfortable it makes you feel you yeah I want to bring that to different [Music] [Music] we are not sisters we like 10 we are both of our moms names are actually Debbie Miller but we have you guys yeah we actually met at school we lived on the same floor freshman year yeah and that was that and the rest is history where did you go to school are you from we went to Indiana University and we're both from Chicago yeah but we just didn't meet until college but we live ten minutes from each other so it's really funny yeah I love that were destined to be Frank wait I also forgot to tell me what you guys both do for a living so I'm a photo producer at her such as how we know each other yeah you styled so many amazing shoots for us so I work on all the digital co-branded content for Hearst I don't know what do you do so I am a buyer at cath and I buy all the men's multi brand apparel so fun is that what your style is kind of sporty so that's why yeah my style Lewin's I've been influenced heavily but I think in a good way okay Hanna how would you describe your personal style I would say mine is a mix of casual pieces with something a little more feminine and wear a lot of dresses because I just think that's so easy in the summer but I also love just like a vintage denim with a white button-up like I just love that love with like cool jewelry it's like depends on my mood but I wear a lot of like miniskirts and sexy yeah sexy girly how would you describe your style so I think my style has really evolved and still is but I would say very sporty but mixed with some very feminine pieces so I love wearing like bike shorts and then with like a cute little mule so I really like to just add in different genres of my style and mix it all together funny because you are different style wise but you guys are so similar you're the exact same height you have the same last name your mom's have the same first name but totally different body types totally different styles but I want to try on a bunch of different white t-shirts and see what works for Hannah what works for Lana and just kind of understand why and what's the best way to shirt for each of you so I feel like that's a great thing to have in everybody's wardrobe yeah yeah for myself that's the hardest thing for me to find and that's still to this day cannot find a way to shirt I like so good challenge hypocrite as a good challenge great do you wear a lot of t-shirts always okay always wear a t-shirt to work okay perfect I need to find a good white bun alright great so let's try on some white t-shirt stay let it do it I feel like the white t-shirt is like a blank canvas in which to portray whatever you want put a white t-shirt under like a blazer or a sweater or sweatshirt or any kind of jacket it's just like something to reflect your personal style and how you're feeling so that being said I want to try some weight shirts on you guys and I want to because you guys are both the same height but totally different bodies I want to try the same shirts on you both and then see like what works on Alanna what works on Hannah and why and sort of talked about that the first step t-shirt I want to try is the Madewell whisper cotton t-shirt and I'm gonna give Elana is small and Hannah a medium and I think this is an amazing one because it's a bit of like that burnout style it's a little bit see-through I think it's gonna be cute and I think the neckline is good we're anxiously waiting let's see oh my god my little twinsies I actually love this you've never really Miller sister sisters yeah there's a lot looks really good on you both I would you like a little front tuck or maybe a - yeah aren't you guys usually tuck yeah I usually talk about okay let's hide this little tag wait hem I actually think this one works really well for you and you can't really see the bra even though it is like that see through sort of textured fabric you can't see the broad what are you wearing I'm wearing Natori I have a little lacing here but you can't even see it no it looks perfect and I think that with people with a larger chest if it's really high necked it doesn't look good and this is like it still has the illusion of being a crewneck it's a little bit lower and it's also a drop shoulder which is helpful cause it's not necessarily like a long sleeve but it kind of gives the illusion of the longer sleeve and I think this looks great on you too I love it how do you feel in this way I like it it's like comfortable you're they see your bra more than you yeah I feel like you can and for you since you are what size are you Ches 32 a 32 a I think for something like for you if you can see the bra through I would just go for something like lacy so if you can see it it's like just give them something nice to look at I guess so I would try it actually for you with like a black lacy bra underneath as opposed to something with padding I think this works great for both of you yeah okay great okay next I want to try something that I think will probably be really nice and a lot I'm not sure about Hannah this is has a higher crew neck it's the Hanes by Carla I think for somebody like Hannah or I with a bigger chest it might be less flattering because it's higher and I think it's gonna be good on the Lana but let's try it and see what is these for Barbie yeah it looks okay so come on out I think I think I was right I think this is good for somebody like Alana I would actually even so Alana is in a size small and Hannah's in a size medium I would even put along in a size medium so in this shirt I would size up one something if you have larger breasts like or I something high-neck it just it's not flattering and it's definitely more form-fitting which I don't like in a white tee like I want it to be very loose and comfortable exactly this is like made for a Barbie I like how thick it is and I like that a super opaque like you can't see your bra or anything but it's just it's not it's not the right fit for something with a larger chest I like this but it's just like tight in the armpits but other than that I actually like it but this this looks great on you Alana thanks so for somebody with this smoke yeah there's nothing you get this smaller chest I think this is a great option because the fabric is really nice yeah it's like that like optic white it's like a really white white which I kind of like so I like to mix that with like a cream or other like light colors yeah next I want to try this t-shirt from and other stories it's another crewneck all the shirts that we're trying on by the way are crewneck short sleeve shirts like nothing being actress all crew I think this one will be a cute one it looks a little more sheer than the by Carla one because it's a bit softer and not so stiff but I don't know let's see I like this already do you like this one yeah I like this one too so this is actually kind of similar to the Hanes by Carla it's not so thick so I think it is a little bit more flattering for people with a larger chest looks great also in a lot ah thank you it's very comfortable what do you guys think of this one it's so comfy and I like that it's not as snug fitting mm-hmm and but it's still a little thicker I feel like this is a good one if you want like the classic like higher crewneck shirt that's like it's a little bit men's II I like this seam right here it's like extremely flattering and the longer sleeves are cute because then you can do a little roll which I like to kind of make it like a little styled a little cooler I don't know I think it's nice when it's kind of like your regular but I do like when t-shirts have that longer sleeves to them and you see it I mean this seam right here is it's a flattering it looks really good I would you like a little front tuck I'm really like I think this is a really good one this is from and other stories I actually want you guys to try while we're on on it they make a linen tea which for me personally I sometimes find a linen to more flattering because it's a little bit more structure and it doesn't cling as much for somebody with like a larger chest so I think let's try this other and other stories okay come on out let's see this one this is also cute so this is the and other stories linen this is really cute you see what I mean by wearing when you have like a bigger see I like this better on Hannah then Alanna actually because I know when you have a no offense but when you have a bigger chest I think that the structure of linen or just like something about it is flattering have you ever tried on like a really like Jersey or like something like super stretchy white t it looks offense I wear it then it kind of clings unit sort of makes you look bigger than you are yeah I think this has like a nice texture and nice structure it gives the illusion of being sheer but it's actually not you can't really see your bra and what do you guys think they're going to eat but I like the way it looks and I think that it adds a little something with the fabric we can make some yeah I'll put it a little more safe yeah I also just like that it's very thin but it's not like when you look at it you know you can't see through it yet it's very thin like to the top yeah and it feels nice it's always nice there's something nice touching your skin yeah yeah okay I love that one next I want to try this is a favorite I feel like a lot of people on Instagram when I like posted a white t-shirt story a lot of people were talking about - ever lame t-shirts so I tried them and I feel like they're super good they're like 100% cotton and they feel really nice and just like a nice normal t-shirt this is the cotton Fox cut tea medium I heard somebody scream winter winter this is my favorite weight this it is so soft this looks so good on both of you it's so soft this is really really add and talked to and it's so it's called the boxy cut tee box cut - that works I feel like because it's it's not cropped necessarily but it's a little bit higher the sleeve is the perfect length on both of you it looks so good I was actually when I went into this video I was expecting like some t-shirts to look like way better on Milan or like way better on Hanah honestly this looks amazing on both of you so far this is my favorite yeah it's just like things simple casual if you feel super yes yeah so it feels super soft you cannot see your bra through at all it looks really smooth yeah so flattering and the neckline is the perk it's not too tight it's perfect yeah so comfortable it's so soft and it's been and I'm very much like I like them thin yeah and I love the way it looks oh yeah I think every white tee I own right now I hate the way it looks and I just never wear them for this I would like totally wear okay I love this one so far this is our number one right yeah okay I love this one the next one it's kind of similar this one's a bit thinner so we're gonna see how that goes this is um oh it has like a little bit of distressing which I don't love but let's try and look see how the fit is because sometimes you can forgive those kind of details oh it's a good fit yeah you know let's see it's a little tough what are you doing so this is the new favorite yeah this is a new one this one is similar it looks great I actually don't mind the distressed I feel like that's what I actually like about t-shirts when they have later yeah like when they have something different or like a little bit off about them this one looks great on both of you I think again what's good is like the boxiness and if it's a little bit cropped because some I mean I think we all like do like the front talk or like the full tuck around so when it's a little bit crop there's like a less fabric in there especially if you're rain like high-waisted jeans you don't want like that punchy yes so this you know this looks amazing yeah ever really short torso so then something cropped is very important for me yeah so this really works yeah I love this one okay now look at um I think maybe will not work as well this is from Zara and it's not cotton it's like that kind of stretchy jersey material let's see that's it guys okay not loving not loving it's a very sheer not loving for either it's so sheer and it's that clean but it's not like this sexy kind of cling it's like the so much background it's and it's stretchy this is not good and you for once can see both of your bras through yeah this is a no-go and it's very long oh yeah yeah even tuck cuz because there was a lot of fabric that's what I'm saying like sometimes there's too much fabric to talk yeah this is not a good one sorry Zara you lose so they both actually like the other Lane and the amo I put Hannah in Neverland which is sixteen dollars and Alana and amo which is $95 I think they're very very similar so if you're like kind of on the fence I would go ever lane the box cut T guys let's see cute they are very similar I think you guys are both sort of attracted to the same thing which is like a little bit cropped a longer sleep I mean they look so similar I actually I say so this one's 16 this one's 95 I prefer the color of that one that's just me you like the more distressed look this is cute it's like a little bit boyish it looks great I love this I really do like that one on you I think this is super flattering I love it I'm very hot we'd love to the maid well let's find that yes the middle one actually was great for both of you it was sheer but not too sure you weirdly couldn't see your bra through and it has like sheer burnout texture this was a great one for us oh the one that we didn't love sorry Carla but it's just a bit the idea is there because it's nice and thick and like super white and like very structured is that neck was a little bit too high it was just like a little too loose and but if you do like something like this and if you have like a smaller chest like Alana I would size up in this one as we liked the and other stories the classic tea this one was also really good on both of you I like this I think this was sort of a good compromise if you wanted something like that by Carla but just a little softer and a little bit less stiff yeah this was a big shock see but this looked great and the sleeve is really good yeah cuz it has like that nice shape that makes it look longer than it is like the drop shoulder and then we also tried on the linen one from and other stories which I like too I liked this one for you Hannah I like the linen like the texture of the linen yeah never tried a linen and I definitely want to start wearing them on I feel like the collar for this one is like flattering it's not too high but it still kind of gives the again like the men's II like cool relaxed boy style we did the ever layin which is I think this is like a great just classic white shirt you can like throw anything on over this and it's I'd rated this even with like a skirt yeah yeah tucked in perfect this is great it's a little bit crop so you have too much to tuck in the sleeve is a great length it's like that bright white which I also really love and then the AMA one which I also like to has like a little bit of distressing on the collar and on the sleeves but just wait it's a similar boxy I think these two are actually very very similar and again this one's a lot more expensive so if you're not sure I would try the eberlein when we didn't love so much is this one by Zara it was like just a little bit too clingy and it was SuperDuper long and the sleeves were also too short for this one so I think the winner like we said for Alanna is the amo and the winner for Hannah is the overlaying but we also love the and other stories this one for both of you yeah and I think the made bow okay and the meatball yeah we did really good this wasn't really this was really really really fun you guys I love this so help me and now I have a way to know actually where and like yes and now I know which one's better and which ones don't I love this this is so much fun thank you guys so much for doing this yeah are there bloopers [Music]", "i9owQ5gh168": "what's up guys my name is Dan

the Gildan G 5000 this t-shirt is made out of standard cotton it's affordable it's got a boxier fit and it's got a ton of color options to choose from the next t-shirt is the Gildan soft style G 64,000 this shirts a little bit nicer than your G 5000 it's got a semis fitted feel to it so it's not as boxy shirt was made sure where it still has a ton of color options and it's a little bit softer and more durable because it's a ring spun cotton next we'll move up to the anvil 980 this t-shirt is also made by Gildan who owns anvil this shirt is a comb ring spun cotton t-shirt it's a sin I fit it as well it's very similar to the soft style but it's kind of in-between the soft styles and then the later shirts I'm going to talk about alright next I would like to talk about the next level 3600 this is definitely one of our most popular fashion fit t-shirts the next level uses the combed ring spun cotton so it's a very soft durable t-shirt this shirt is going to cost you a little bit more it's also got less color options and the other shirts we're going to talk about today next level they run a little small you definitely hugs me real a lot tighter than the other shirts so this shirt I would maybe consider going up a size another fashion fitted t-shirt that's very popular is the Bella canvas 3000 one one thing that's really nice about the Dahle canvas is although they are also manufactured overseas like all of the shirts were talking about today the dialogues where they actually dye the colors of the shirts are done here in one factory in California this helps them keep a very consistent color between all their t-shirts the Bella canvas is another fashion fitted tee they come out with all kinds of great colors all the time they're very soft it's a cone ring spun cotton or they call it an heirloom combed ring spun cotton and it's another great option if you're looking for a fashion fitted t-shirt and finally we'll talk about the American Apparel 2001 they got two options one of them is made overseas the other one is made here in America which will cost you extra with American Apparel you're paying for that brand name even though Gildan now owns american apparel american apparel is another fashion fitted teeth it's a combed ring spun cotton supersoft they've got a lot of color options so of course they're very nice shirts as well the point is there's a ton of different options to choose from so you've got to decide what's right for you it depends on your fit what kind of feel you're going for and of course your price point and if you're looking to

when you're not here you stupid stop", "8ZUyLBQDl3g": "today I am testing my subscribers favorite white t-shirts basically I asked you guys on Instagram to tell me the brand name and the style name of your all-time favorite white t-shirt and then I dumped all that information into Excel I tallied up the top five and I bought one of each end of my size so we're gonna go through each one I'm going to talk about price size fit quality I'm even gonna see if it shrinks after I wash it and the goal is to just help you guys find your perfect white t-shirt so let's get started okay let's start off with the fifth most popular t-shirt the fifth most popular t-shirt according to you guys is this James purse vintage little boy T James purse is a luxury basics brand so this was the most expensive out of the top five the price of this is $75 it comes in five sizes from zero to four which kind of mimic like extra small to extra large and I got this t-shirt in a size zero and I'm just gonna read the description off the website like an old favorite from the first we're at this lightweight cotton Jersey t is garment dyed with extra softener and silicon for a lived-in feel and this one is a hundred percent cotton just like my previous video I'm going to be ranking each one on three things which is fit quality and value they're all gonna get a total score and then at the end we'll see how my ranking compares to yours so let's try this bad boy on and see what I think alright here it is the James purse t-shirts I really love this I have a mirror right behind the camera that I'm kind of like referencing the fit of this is so nice though like especially like the sleeves and the shoulder seams I feel like just lay really perfectly like this area is just so seamless and nice it's very boxy but I feel like it flows and lays really nicely on the body like it's a little bit tighter up here and then it's a bit looser down here but do you see how like if I kind of move like it it's not too stiff the fabric almost lays like this it's so flattering I also really like the Vivat this is a really good kind of like semi cropped length I love the sleeves they're like perfectly short this is what the back looks like it's so soft too like uh it's just super cozy and soft the material feels really nice and lightweight but it's not sheer it's like the kind of perfect opacity and I really like the weight of it how it's like kind of thin so that it floats on the body really nicely but it's not too sheer all the like stitching and seams on this are flawless I honestly think that this one deserves a five out of five in terms of fit I'm just so pleased with how it lays on my body I feel like all the details are just really perfect the length of it the neckline the sleeves the shoulders like everything just is perfect so I'm definitely gonna give this a five out of five in terms of fit I'm also gonna give this a five out of five in terms of quality just the softness of it and how it's nice and opaque but it's like a nice lightweight material and how perfect like the fit is constructed and everything I think this deserves a five out of five but value I'm gonna bump it down because it's so expensive I'm gonna give this one a three for value because I do think that you should expect higher quality when you're paying more so it kind of makes sense but not everyone can dish out seventy five dollars for a t-shirt so the total is thirteen so this one got a total score of 13 out of 15 which is pretty good I just knocked it down a couple notches in terms of value just because it's so expensive and there are definitely high-quality white t-shirt options at a much lower price this is a little sunlight test for this James purse t-shirt I wanted to see how sheer these looked when I kind of put them up against a window so this is what that looks like and then I also ran each t-shirt through the washing machine after I did my initial trial and just to see if they shrunk so I did a warm wash and a tumble dry low which is a pretty standard wash and dry I feel like and so this is what the comparison is okay let's move on to the fourth most popular white t-shirt according to you so before the most popular pair was the Zara basics white t-shirt this is what she looks like the price this is $17.90 it comes in four sizes from small texture large it's 49 percent modal 33% lyocell and 18 percent linen so let's try this on and see what I think all right so this was the fourth most popular t-shirt it's so interesting trying all of these white t-shirts on at the same time first impressions is it already feels a lot of scratch here then the James purse one like it's just like I don't know the fabrics kind of interesting but I could see why you guys like it because it has that kind of same like it's thin ish so it gives that kind of like casual laid-back vibe you know I feel like in general this is a slightly more fitted t-shirt than the James purse one that I just tried on especially in this sleeve area like the sleeves are very tight and I can kind of feel that as I'm moving around my shoulders and stuff the body is fine and it has a bit of like give to it but the sleeves are definitely a little tight maybe I should have gone with a size medium lengthwise this is a more traditional length so it's not as cropped I do really like the crewneck line though it's a nice light comfortable a little bit more open than the James purse one this one is really sheer though like it's very very sheer like I don't know if you guys can tell I'll do a window test for all of these but looking in the mirror like so I'm wearing these high-waisted jeans when I put the shirt over them I can see the blue in the jeans through the shirt and I couldn't also see like the details of my bra and I'm wearing like a nude bra yeah I just don't think this fits very well I'm gonna give this a 3 in terms of fit I also don't love the quality on this like the stitching isn't great and it's pretty sheer and just the fact that this like fit issue is happening I'm gonna have to give this a 3 in terms of quality as well I'm also gonna give this a pretty low value score because this is seventeen ninety which is on the pricier side of like the lower end brands that you guys recommended and I don't think that the quality of this matches that price tag and I know for a fact that the other t-shirts that I'm about triune are less than that and I think just from feeling them not even trying them on I think they're gonna be higher quality so I'm gonna give this a three let's see how it does tomorrow when I wash it okay this one didn't do so hot this ended up with a total ranking of 9 out of 15 there's just something a little bit off about this one I also want to mention that this one shrunk the most after I pulled it out of the dryer I wasn't sure how these interesting kind of fabrics we're gonna handle the tumble dry if you want to take extra good care of your clothing I would recommend hang-drying items that you're really concerned about but I wanted to give these like a good realistic test of putting them in the dryer and seeing if they shrunk so that is the Tzar one a little bit disappointing but let's move on to it the third most popular t-shirts the third most popular t-shirt is the one I'm wearing right now and this is one from brandy melville so this is called the Haley t-shirt and it's $16 on brandy melville it comes in one size as is pretty typical waste brandy melville stuff and it's 100% cotton the description is that it's a soft and stretchy cotton tee with a crewneck collar alright so let's cut to the Tryon portion and I'll tell you guys what I think ooh interesting okay this is kind of fun because this is a totally different style and silhouette then basically all the other white t-shirts which are more boxy this one is a nice fitted option which I actually think it's good to have like a more fitted tight option and a looser fitting option I really like the feel of this right now but I'm a sucker for brandy melville stuff because the materials they use are just so soft and comfortable I actually really like the way this fits you guys always choose the best stuff that's why I love these videos is because it like opens my eyes to all these amazing options I mean there's a reason that this stuff you know floats to the top if you're really pretty I think this is a great option I really like it when sleeves have a bit of like a gap here I just think it's nice and flattering and I also really like the length it's like a pretty cropped length looks good with like high-waisted stuff this fabric is ever so slightly ribbed which is kind of interesting it gives like a different texture than the others the other ones are just like kind of a straight-up cotton II feel this one if you look closely you can see a bit of ribbing to it which I think helps it with that stretch it is also pretty opaque like since it's tight you're kind of seeing a little bit of my bra here but like you're not actually seeing the color and like here you can't really see like my jeans or anything so I think the opacity is really good on this okay I actually really like this brandy melville one fit wise I'm gonna give this a 4 out of 5 I think this one fits really well for the look that it's going for which is that kind of like tighter white t-shirt look okay obvious con is that they only make this in one size and while I think like tiny t-shirts are good like this for petite sizes obviously it's not gonna work for everyone which is a bummer quality I think this is definitely better than the Zara one but lower than the James purse the stitching looks decent but it's not like pristine like the James purse one so I'm gonna give it a four out of five and then value-wise let me check the price really quick yeah this one is $16 so a dollar too cheaper than the Zara one but better in my opinion even though it's a very different look so it's hard to compare but I would give it a value of four because for sixteen dollars I think this is a really good option okay so Brandi did pretty good this one got a total score of 12 out of 15 I actually really really like this one and I think a lot of you guys will like it too if you're similar to my size this one is shrunk a tiny bit after I washed it but it is kind of like a ribbed material that kind of stretches out as you wear it it's kind of like jeans they kind of stretch out as you wear it and then you wash it to kind of return it to its original form okay let's move on to the second most popular t-shirt the runner-up most popular teacher according to you guys and it is this one from H&M this is called the slump Jersey t-shirt so this t-shirt is $9.99 it comes in sizes extra extra extra small to extra large it's 50% cotton and 50 cent mote doll and the description says t-shirt in slob Jersey made from a model and cotton blend with a round neckline and a straight cut hem so let's try this guy on and see what I think okay this one is hmmm very similar to the Zara one very very similar interesting it's interesting how the Tzar one and the H&M one the one I'm wearing right now they have kind of longer sleeves I feel like it gives a slightly different look I kind of have preference towards the cap sleeves that are a lot shorter and more slanted I think that gives off a more stylish vibe this one's also longer the sleeves are longer it's a longer length it has kind of an interesting texture it's almost like a cooling fabric I feel like this is very breathable it's slightly less sheer than the Tzar one but it's still one of the more sheer ones like it's I would say Zara so far has been the most sheer and then this one's runner up I also feel like the quality's not good like do you guys see this it's almost like slanting I don't love that and I also feel like the sleeves are having this weird bubble thing happen because this hem is so wide this like little trim part here that it's almost like bubbling over and then the neckline is also kind of flappy I noticed that when I was putting it on yeah I'm not loving this honestly the fabric also it it feels cottony but it's a little bit like a slick cotton it's almost too smooth it's like when I wear cotton I want it to kind of feel like it has a bit of friction to it this one is very very silky almost yeah I don't know if I like that I almost feel like it looks kind of pyjama hmm interesting fit wise I honestly don't like this I think I'm gonna give this a 2 the sleeves are too long the neckline is too big and it's kind of flappy this is weird I'm gonna give this one of three quality wise because the stitching is fine but like the fact that it looks basically like an asymmetrical hem even though it's not supposed to look like that is concerning and then I also just feel like some things are off with the construction value-wise this is the cheapest option out of everything that I am trying today so value wise I'm going to give this a three I don't think this is like anything amazing for the price I almost feel like the price should be lower this one was not good the total score for this H&M t-shirt an 8 out of 15 womp womp my biggest problems were with the fit I just thought it fit really weird it almost looked like I was wearing pajamas there was also some funky stuff going on like how be have mine looked like it was asymmetrical even though it wasn't supposed to be and the weird bubbling of the sleeves it was just it was just weird so this one got an 8 out of 15 all right let's move on to number one the number one most popular white t-shirt by a landslide this one t-shirt had more than double the amount of votes than any of the other t-shirts and that is the unique low you crew neck t-shirt you guys seem to love this t-shirt and I was really excited that it made it so high on your list so let's cut to the Tryon section and see what I think about your guys is number one white t-shirt choice ok this is the most popular t-shirt according to you guys I think this is like a very good super classic white tee option it's just a straight cut down it's not cropped it has a nice like inbetween sleeve like you can see you had a little bit of that slant that I like but it's not as like much of a cap sleeve as the James purse one or the Brandie one one interesting thing about the fit that I'm noticing is like when I was kind of just like holding up all these t-shirts in my hand kind of holding them up in front of me and feeling them before trying them on I noticed that the James purse almost looked like it flared out at the body but this shirt which when you lay a flat is completely straight down you can actually see that it's a lot tighter around here but looser around the waist area which can kind of create a weird like bunching up effect and make your stomach look bigger than it actually is and the James purse one the way that it's constructed kind of prevents that from happening just an interesting thought I feel like this shirt is like meant to be kind of tucked in and cropped a little bit like this looks perfect basically but this one is just super thick and high-quality like it's not sure at all it's completely opaque and this is the same price as the H&M one right now cuz these are currently on sale and they do sales for these like literally all the time it's usually the same price as the Tzar ones like 1790 I think right now it's like 990 but this one is like clearly a level up from the Zara and H&M ones in terms of quality so definitely a good one you guys picked a good one state wise I'm gonna give this up four out of five I think this is like a really good classic t-shirt fit but it's almost so straight that when it actually goes on like a body I feel like it like I just don't like how it's tight here and loose here you know quality wise I think this is definitely like up there with the James purse I'm gonna give this a five in terms of quality this is the thickest out of all the five t-shirts it's also really really soft and the stitching and the seams are just really good for this and it's very symmetrical value-wise I have to give this a 5 out of 5 because value wise this is just like one of the best so far since they do sales on this all the time this actually ends up being one of the most inexpensive of the five different t-shirts and since it's so high on the quality bar like I think you really can't go wrong with a t-shirt like this so this one gets a really high score for me and I totally agree with you guys alright guys the unica one was pretty darn close to perfect and the total score I gave it was a 14 out of 15 so these are how the rankings compare I think you can't go wrong with the Uniqlo one that's the one that I would absolutely recommend and then if you have the budget and you want to splurge a little bit more get the James purse one because it's really good so that is it guys that is testing my subscribers favorite white t-shirt please let me know your thoughts in the comments I really want to hear your opinions and give me suggestions for what you want me to do next because I love it this series and I think it's really helpful ok and that is it I love you guys so much and I'll see you in my next video bye", "sqpSN9CiCbE": "[Music] hi there welcome back to another video my name is Monica of million Monica and I'm a full-time clothing a reseller on both Poshmark and eBay today's video I'm going to be showing you basically a haul of items that I have tie-dyed and bleached ID I know it's so popular right now and these items are all going to be for sale online on both Poshmark and eBay so if you are interested in purchasing any of those items you can head over to those platforms to check the items out and those are all linked down below but if you are at all interested in resale related content selling clothing online of course making money online please consider subscribing to this channel if you haven't already and of course give this video a thumbs up it really helps me out here on YouTube so why bleach die why tie-dye well you know I know it's popular people are seeking out those type these types of items but to be honest I wasn't going to do this I didn't really have a desire to take on this type of project until I realized I had a good amount of clothing that was damaged it was stained it had some sort of flaw that I couldn't sell the item as it was and so I thought you know I can't really go into the thrift stores right now I have this inventory basically that I can't read o\u00f1ate I might as well use it and so I started with the bleach dye hence this shirt it's been bleached I'd if you want to have an example right away of what something looks like that's been bleached I'd and that was really easy this is not a how-to video on how to actually tie dye and bleach tie it is just a haul of the items that I have have done but I will be selling them online and so if you have items that are stained or somewhat damaged that maybe you can redo and give them a new life this might like spur some creativity or give you some ideas of what items you can actually possibly still resell that you have laying around so hopefully that's kind of more of the goal of this video and of course as mentioned you see something you like of course you can send me an offer but these items truly were items I was just going to discard and re donate but first stores are not open for donations currently in my area so I have been holding onto them and here we are I actually really enjoyed this process I haven't tie-dyed anything since I was in high school as a lifeguard and so it's been many moons since I've tie-dyed anything and yes I'm probably older than you think I just had my birthday a couple weeks ago so actually not a couple weeks ago literally like a week ago but here we are and I have items to share with you you may remember some of these items if you've watched any of my thread up videos or maybe just older thrift towels because I might have missed something and that's why these items ended up here several of these white denim jean jackets came in a thread up denim box it was supposed to be a DIY box and that's exactly what I ended up doing with them they were very stained all of them I thought I was going to be able to sell them as they were a couple of them after like stain treating and stuff but it just didn't work out they were very kind of yellow discolored in several areas and so I just went ahead and tie-dyed them actually the jackets were probably my favorite items and so I kind of tried to go with the jackets and stick to kind of a color theme so this one's like the purple pink jacket it is an express jacket it's a size medium it turned out really really well and I use the ice dye method I will link some videos down below I would highly just recommend if you're interested in tie-dyeing watch a bunch of YouTube videos on how to tie-dye come up with like a method there's so many different methods that would work for you maybe you want to try several methods but I'm extremely happy with how this turned out a lot of the colors are more muted on the pieces that I picked up because of a lot of the fabric types so natural fibers like cotton are going to do better this one is a cotton spandex blend and it still turned out nicely this jacket was actually a jacket from my personal closet and once I pulled it out I realized it too was pretty stained so this was my kind of blue-green jacket and again this turned out nicely to maurices small and it's kind of a semi crop style jacket which is super cute and I believe this too was kind of has a little bit of that spandexy stretchy Lake material so it's not a hundred percent cotton 100% cotton we'll take the colors butter and they'll be more vivid and bright this one I loved I really wanted this one to be Moody and it's a Chico size - if it's kind of like a large XL maybe because they have vanity sizing but it has this really cool zipper and I had talked about this in the thredUP video when I received this jacket that I thought the zipper was a really cool feature this one was incredibly stained around the collar and unfortunately I couldn't get those stains out so this became a really fun kind of moody colored tie-dye and I love how it turned out I used blacks and purples and blues and it turned out really really well I think the color is showing up more brightly on camera right now because of the ring light but super love this one and this was the last jacket that came in one of my thread up boxes again this was pretty stretchy had some stretch to it it is a medium petite and this was kind of the orange pink I believe I used some reds and yellows in this one and I love again how this turned out the colors are just fantastic in my opinion and I love that they're not super overwhelming and in-your-face but just kind of a nice subtle pop of color I've really enjoyed doing this cardigan and I would definitely do more cardigans in the future if I can come across them a friend had gifted this to me to sell and it did have a few stains so tie-dyed it it is 100% cotton so I took the color really well and I just wanted a pretty solid color on this because I thought that would make just a nice little statement piece and that's exactly kind of how it turned out so just pink on this I think there's a couple of splashes of color in here or maybe a blue got splattered on it but otherwise it's pretty much a solid pink tie-dye this was a piece I was super excited when I found this originally because I love its kind of a pink chambray splendid piece but what I didn't realize when I picked it up is that it did have a bleach spot on it so I tie-dyed this piece now this piece didn't take the color extremely well but it kind of has like this ombre tie-dye effect where more of the colors towards the bottom which i think is really fun and unique but again it's also kind of more of a muted color so it's not extremely overwhelming and I really think that's just a nice little staple piece for summer these shorts came in a thrown up box they originally my first like look at them first glance I thought they were in really good condition which they were but they did have a couple little spots on them I didn't even try to stain treat them because this was 100% cotton and I just decided right away that I was going to tie dye it I thought it'd be a really fun pair of shorts to tie-dye and I was correct they took the color really well they have side pockets they have this smocked elastic waist and they're just super cozy there this brand label that I've never heard of I could not find much in doing research other than you know they're made in India they're basically a size small that's besides zero but they have that smocked waist and yeah I mean they definitely look like they'd be cozy for lounging or just a day at the beach over a swimsuit etc this piece was just this beautiful white Chico's cowl neck kind of waffle knit sweater but it did have some like oil spots and stains on it that I wasn't able to get out I did wear it a few times myself and then once I realized I was gonna do this project I pulled it out of my personal closet and tie-dyed it so really excited that I can now sell this as a beautiful tie-dyed piece and yeah you can really tell the ice died and how the purple had melted and that's really fun and then it has a front pocket just a great little lounge piece perfect for summer I can see someone just lounging around in this going for walks early-morning walks or evening walks and ice so cute it is a Chico sized one and to me it fits like a small/medium this was a fun piece this is an express medium this had some weird yellowing to it like in the mesh air which is why I chose to tie-dye it and I think it turned out really well of course like the embroidered sections took the color better than the mesh which you know was expected and I do really like how that turned out that would be a really cute swim cover-up as well this is actually a linen piece this is Elsie by Lauren Conrad this is a piece from my personal closet and it had I wasn't the original owner it had this like muted I'm using the word a lot it had this really faint pink color to it originally I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be white but I think it was washed with inappropriate colors and had some color bleed and so I never had tried to sell this before and I had personally wore it a few times and didn't mind but again when I was looking for items to tie-dye this really stood out to me as a piece that would would tie-dye well because again in said natural fiber linen and Cotton's are gonna tie dye really well and this did turn out nicely and then it has the kind of the lace trim here detail at the hem which I really like it is an extra small and it definitely can fit a small easily so I love how this one turned out here is an old Navy sweater so this was actually new with tags but it had some like marks on the front I was going to have to wash this anyways and take the tags off because of the markings on the front just from either store wear or the bends where I found it whatever so I took the tags off and just decided to tie-dye it was originally a pale pink and so this is kind of how it turned out it's an extra extra large and it's kind of the purple blue yellow and green and it I really like this piece as well a nice cozy summer lounge piece this is another piece that was new a tags and so it really didn't have any flaws but it was kind of boring and so it's a Topshop and it is just a strappy long kind of bodycon dress and I think you know you could wear this so many different ways you could wear this with like a chambray top tied at the waist or you know layer this with another top underneath and a belt it'd be so adorable and maybe some sneakers like the white chunky grandpa's sneakers that would be adorable definitely a look so this took the tie-dye incredibly well I love how it turned out with the ice dive to used purples and pinks and reds I believe on this one and yeah it was really fun just to kind of work with the different colors and see how they blended and turned out if you're having a hard time getting a hold of a tie-dye kit I would highly recommend checking your local Michaels ordering online and just doing a curbside pickup that is what I did I was able to do a curbside pickup and they just popped it in my car and I drove away and that was really really handy I had ordered a kit on Amazon and it was going to take like two and a half three weeks to arrive so I'd cancel that order and just did the Michaels pickups so that worked well for me maybe you can find tie-dye that way yourself ok so those aren't the tie-dye pieces the pieces that I actually use color on now I'm going to show you the pizza that I bleached I'd such as this shirt which had come in a thredUP box and I decided to keep more for myself because I truly love it it looks so cute with a pair of overalls and it's slightly cropped and it's this ribbed kind of knit so anyway here are some other pieces that I bleached dyed so again I'll link a youtube video down below to show you more of what I'm talking about I don't necessarily have a great setup for showing processes like this um so basically bleached out you do it very very similarly to regular tie-dye you're just pouring a bleach water solution over it instead of the color and you just wait for it just to hurt doing its magic and every piece turns out a little bit differently so this next piece is an LL Bean I did do this to some denim pieces such as this kind of jumper dress that has buttons all the way down the sides which is really fun and unique this was honestly a cute piece prior it was kind of boring and I wanted to spice it up a little bit and make it a little bit more trendy this piece has been altered so it has bent the seams here at the shoulder have been taken up and the hem has been taken up as well and it's just a really cute fitting piece buttons down the side can just add a little spice to it as well but I really love how this kind of bleach wash gave it kind of the acid wash look so really loving how this turned out and yeah if you want to see more you can always check out my closet where everything is listed this next pair of shorts I was the first pair of denim that I actually believed and I did this because this pair actually had some color bleed from a red item when I picked this up at the bin so they had like pink and red like all over the front I had tried washing it out soaking it and it did not work so when I bleached I did it actually came out and gave it this really fun again kind of acid II wash which I really appreciate it and I think just kind of goes with the overall distressed look of the shorts so they are a vintage Levi's and I love how this turned out and that's what I'd aspired me actually to do the other piece okay this is a piece from my personal closet that I just wasn't wearing and again just wanted to spice it up a little bit and see how the bleach dyeing work so it says coffee days whiskey nights and it's just a racerback tank and you definitely pair this with a fun skirt or denim of course and it just kind of came out with a gray at black tie dye I guess and a few more pieces that are kind of just basic they were just super basic like vintage pieces that from like the 90s late nineties that we're solid colors and I just leach dyed them so this turned out really well the original color was this dark purple so the whole piece was purple this is just a tank top and now it has this really nice pink purple tied I love how it turned out and this is a very similar except this piece was just originally pink and it has kind of a peter pan collar button up front and then a little bit of the eyelet lace trim there at the collar and so that turned out really really cute as well oh this was a piece that I tie-dyed I forgot to show at the beginning this piece is an example of a piece that was more synthetics material is and it did not take the bleach as well so although it came out very pale pink it it's that for quite a while and just didn't take in the color as well as the other more natural fibers did so this is polyester only it's 62 percent polyester only 33 percent cotton so if you're looking at some of your items and you're noticing they're more synthetic fibers and less cotton they're not going to take the colors as well so that's something to keep in mind I still would have tie-dyed this piece because it was so badly stained and now you can't see the stains you just have this really nice pastel pink but if you wanted something more vibrant it definitely wasn't taking the color as well so that's something to keep in mind I absolutely love how this next piece turned out this is one of my favorite pieces this isn't free people like ribbed top and it's kind of oversized boxy flowy tunic like fit like classic Free People top what I love about how this bleached itok turned out is still has like a classic free people feel and overall look I feel like this is definitely a design that free people would come out with themselves this is a piece that was in my personal closet because it had some oil spots in the front I bought it to resell realized that I couldn't and here we are and this piece is now very sellable and I just love how it turned out I really wasn't wearing it anyway so it was originally this green color and the stitching actually stayed that's original green color which I really like that as well and then it turned to this orange pinky color which I just loved watching it turn because it like was immediate as soon as I dumped the bleach on it it just started turning and just kept turning and this turned out really really nicely this was another piece from a thread up box this was a black shirt and this had no label it just says it's a size medium it kind of had a leg and look raw edge layered look and I tried bleach dyeing it to give it a little bit more pizazz because there has no brand there's like no kind of distinguishing factors other than it was just black and now it has this fun kind of gray heathered black tie-dye and I think my last piece here is this vintage another just late nineties vintage tee it was this purple color and it tie-dyed into this nice pink purple design so this piece has actually already sold it I had woke up to an offer this morning on it so I listed it last night woke up to an offer in a bundle this morning and I happily accepted so this was a piece that I really wasn't interested in selling prior it was gifted to me and now it's something that was sellable and going up to a new home so that's really exciting I hope you enjoyed seeing these pieces again I'll link some videos on how to do this yourself down below and if you're digging through your closet and finding stuff that's too stained or maybe stuff that you've set aside to donate later maybe you can go back through those items and see what items you can potentially save thanks so much for watching and as always I will see you next time", "hsDbQ05k5gE": "what is up everyone i hope you're doing well spring is just around the corner so i thought it was about time to start getting some basic tees in place for the warmer weather you probably all know by now that uniqlo is my go-to when it comes to affordable basics what you get for the price is unbeatable in my opinion so for this week's video i decided to pick up the most popular and most talked about t-shirts i'm gonna try them on and talk about what i like about each one and what i don't like about each one i'm six foot and about 73 kilograms and i picked all of the t-shirts up in a size medium which is my true size i'll let you know which one's my favorite and which ones i don't like so much at the end of the video i've also measured each of the t-shirts just to give you more accurate information on how they differ in size but anyway without wasting any more time let's get straight into the first t-shirt so the first t-shirt that i've got is the crewneck supima cotton tee in white the first thing that i noticed is the color seems to be a bit more of an off-white than a pure white which i happen to like but it may not be what you want when ordering a white tee the quality feels lovely and the tea is so soft just what you'd expect from cp mccotton this tea comes in at 27.5 inches long a width of 20 inches from pit to pit and a sleeve length of 9 inches so let's have a look at how the tee fits the first thing that i noticed is the neck opening is a lot wider than i was expecting apparently they've updated this tee to have a slightly more relaxed fit so that's probably why i usually like a tight-fitting neck with my tees but i actually don't mind the wider neck here and i think it will look decent underneath an open shirt or a jacket this tee in the white is also slightly see-through not enough to the point where i wouldn't wear it but it may be for you if you don't like this then maybe opt for a darker color in this tee all in all it feels beautiful the quality is there but for me the fit is a little off i think i could have probably sized up with this tee for a more relaxed look but i'd still wear it as it is the next t-shirt we've got is the airism oversized u-range tee in black this is a very soft feeling tee and actually a bit thicker than i was expecting the quality feels really nice and i already know this is going to be comfortable this tee is made from 53 cotton 30 polyester and 17 elasto multiester this t-shirt comes in at 12 pound 90 and i think that's a very decent price for this tee this team measures 28 inches long a width of 22 inches and a sleeve length of 10.5 inches the tee is so soft and it has a decent weight to it this one may be even more comfortable than the supima cotton t2 the quality feels great and this tee fits me really well for an oversized tee the sleeve length and the body length ratio is perfect for me sometimes tees can have massive sleeves and then too much of a crop in the body which some people do prefer but for me this is the perfect balance for an oversized tee the neckline is really soft just like the rest of the tee and it fits snug to my neck this tea also has a drop shoulder for an even more relaxed look and i really like this feature on this tee all in all i'm really impressed with this t-shirt and for the price you may not find anything better for an oversized tee however we do have another oversized tee coming up next so maybe that'll beat this one next up we have another oversized tee from the u range that i picked up in this petrol blue color it features a pocket on the front and a split at the hem which are nice additional details this one is made from 100 cotton but it feels a lot stiffer than the other teas on the list i don't actually mind a stiff tee when it's in a heavy weight material and i actually prefer that so it's not a problem for me this tea also comes in at 12p90 which is an absolute bargain for a tea like this due to the split hem there's different lengths at the back of the front of this t-shirt the t mesh is 27 inches long at the front and 27.5 inches at the back it's got a width of 23 inches and a sleeve length of 10 inches so now moving on to the fit the tee has a generous boxy fit oversized sleeves and a slightly shorter length in the body i'm aware this tea is designed to be a bit shorter at the front in the body but for me i'd like an extra inch of length so maybe sizing up a size would work better for me it's nowhere near as comfortable as the airism tea but that's not really surprising the neck is softer than the rest of the t-shirt though so that's a nice touch and you don't have to worry about it rubbing i'm in love with the colour and the details of this tea but for me the tea doesn't sit as well on me as the airism tea does the final tea we've got here is the ut this is a classic tea and one of the first styles i ever picked up from uniqlo the ut is made from 100 cotton and it has a bit of a heavyweight feel to it like the previous t it's got a bit of a rough feel to it too and although that doesn't bother me it's definitely worth mentioning this one also comes in at 12 pound 90 which seems about average for a u-range t from uniqlo the team meshes in at 28 inches long a width of 22 inches and a sleeve length of nine inches like most of the u-range products this tee has a slightly relaxed fit which i really like i feel this tee fits me perfectly and sits well on my body i've had a few of these tees in the past and i feel the material is slightly thinner on this newer model for some of you in the warmer countries this may be a good thing but i always prefer a thicker tee the neckline is ribbed and it has a nice tight fit to my neck which i really like the thicker neck also means you don't have to worry about the neckline getting misshapen in the wash the length and the sleeve length is spot on for me although the sleeves are a little floppy all in all this tee fits me really well and i'm really happy with the way it looks so for me each t-shirt serves a different purpose if i wanted to wear any of these t-shirts as an undershirt then the one that wins it for me would be the supima cotton t-shirt for an oversized tee i would go for the airism tee the fit on this t-shirt is lovely and it's so comfortable too i love the color and the details on the oversized pocket t-shirt but the fit on me is just not quite right and i do prefer the airism oversized tee over this t-shirt and last but not least the best all-rounder in my opinion is the uniqlo ut the fit is spot on with this tee and although it's not perfect there are a couple of things that i would change i don't think you can beat this t-shirt for the price and it's probably the one that i'll be wearing the most in the spring and the summer months but whichever t-shirt that you go for you can't really go wrong they're all great for the price so choose the one that suits you best but i hope this video has helped you out and help you decide which one you want to get maybe just pick up all of them if you can't decide like i did and let me know your favorite down in the comments but anyway as always thanks so much for watching please do give the video a like if you enjoyed it hit subscribe if you're new and i will see you next week see ya", "-6ZJhE-kmiY": "[Music] what's up guys it's Koide from gentlemen but then a channel dedicated to helping men dress better and feel their best and in this video we're talking the best white t-shirts for men stay tuned in this best white t-shirts battle I'm gonna be showing you how the shirts wear and fit on my body in addition to design shirt sizing thickness and more as always if you want more details on the shirts you can head on over to my blog I'm gonna link that down below first up is the brand ask it now they offer minimalist basics ferment and so their shirts are made in Portugal and they offer three different sizes and so they have short regular and tall extra small all the way to double XL and so this is great for shorter guys like myself and so I got this short and so let's talk about the fit now putting the shirt fits are really well it's perfect on the sleeves it ends right where the shoulder bone is and it hugs the bicep nicely it's not too tight not too loose and even through the body if there's some room here to breathe but at the same time its fitted and I'd say the short length is pretty on point ending around a little bit above mid crotch so I'm really impressed with the fit of the shirt from ask it and the quality is really nice too it's 100% Egyptian cotton and so it feels really soft but there's a little bit of a thickness as well and so I believe it is 180 grams and then they offer a lightweight version which is around 120 grams the regular t-shirts come in at $45 which is quite pricey for a t-shirt it's more expensive than all the other brands on this list but sometimes you pay a little bit of a premium for high quality products in terms of quality and fit I've got to say the ass t-shirt is quite flawless and I love the ribbed neckline as well it's not too tight around the neck not too loose it's just perfect and so the asket shirt gets a high grade second up is Yoona clothes supima cotton t-shirts and so you close got a reputation for having a really nice quality best bang for your buck t-shirt out there and so I have this white shirt I have two grey shirts and a navy shirt from Uniqlo and they are just great t-shirts for everyday wear and they last for a really long time so I've been wearing my Uniqlo shirts for quite a while now at the white shirt here it is the neck and so the neckline is nice and I feel like it's the perfect neckline is not too tight not too loose the sleeves are also good where they end around mid bicep not too tight not too loose again to the body same thing so similar to ask it in the previous round it pretty much fits the same except it's a lot cheaper and so does that cause come with the price well I mean you know clothes supima cotton tees come in at under $10 at 990 and for me I've had this shirt for quite a while now maybe two three years has gone through a lot of washes and dry cycles for the most part I like to wash and then here dry my shirts and so that's just what helps it to last longer in terms of weight it's a little bit of a mid weight it's not thick it's not as thick as the asket shirt and it's not all that thin either but for a clean and classic aesthetic Uniqlo shirts fit really well for me I'm a shorter guy and around five six and I feel like the fit is pretty long point and so can't go wrong with a you know clothes - pima cotton tees I've done a previous video on the best fitting t-shirts and Uniqlo is also included in that and so I think really highly of the unit clothes - pima cotton tees there's no secret all right next up is banana republics authentic 100% supima cotton t-shirts and so just like the other brands on the list Banana Republic has their own supima cotton tees it's cool about PR is that they offer a tall length so if you're a taller guy they got you covered and this is their regular length which fits me really well it's just on your mid fly it's a little bit longer than a skit and yoonah Club but it's still a proper length in terms of the fit it's a little looser than the other brands just a little bit though it's not loose to the point where it looks too sloppy and so also the sleeves are a little bit looser as well and so you can actually cuff them up if you want them to be a little bit tighter to wrap around the bicep even without cuffing it still looks good I personally do like the looser fitting aesthetic especially as in the warmer months sometimes you don't want your shirt to be like skin-tight sticking to your body and so the looser aesthetic is nice in terms of the thickness of the shirt it's about the same as a skit and so it's a little bit thicker and it feels good the neckline like Uniqlo and ask it is good it fits perfectly around the neck their shirts are made in Jordan and I gotta say the quality is quite nice I have another Navy a v-neck from Banana Republic it's held up really well through many washes and so feel be our t-shirts are quite reliable and a good value they're around twenty six fifty regular price but often times you can find them on sale for forty to fifty percent and so at that price it's just above Uniqlo and a killer deal next up we got another mall brand and this one is Express and so their shirts are a little bit tighter than all the other shirts they're pretty skin tight it fits more like an undershirt the shirt is there slim cotton shirts they also have a flex stretched shirt which is even a little bit more tightness but in terms of the fit fits really well around the neck and around the biceps it really hugs your bicep and it follows up our ground mid bicep which is good a good length the length of the shirt is a little bit longer than all the other shirts it's a little bit too long for my liking so if you're a skinnier guy and that's a little bit taller Express slim shirts are perfect for you as for me if I really want to show off any type of games that I have then I'll be rocking this shirt because it's really form-fitting on your body price comes in around twenty six fifty and oftentimes you can get them on sale for 40 to 50 percent off just like Banana Republic as for the weight of the shirt it's pretty thin it's thinner than most of the other shirts on this list but it's definitely super soft and pretty lightweight and so a great value again if you're a taller skinnier guy next up we got mutton bow not a mall brand but an online brand their shirts are made in Peru and similar to a skate it's got this rhythm neckline that's a little bit thinner and as for the weight it's a little bit thin but it's I think it's wonderful for tee grams which is somewhere between a skits regular t-shirt and their thin t-shirt and so it's a nice weight it's on the thinner side but not quite as thin as the Express from the previous round the shirt runs a little bit long it's a little bit long on my frame but if you're a little bit taller every guy maybe five eight five ten it's gonna fit you perfectly as for the sleeves it's a little bit looser but I kind of like this looser aesthetic of the fit of this shirt I think overall it fits quite well and it comes in at thirty dollars which is fifteen cheaper than a skit and it's about around the same price as banana and Express and this other brands and then you know you know clothes of course the cheapest I do like the fit and feel of the shirt it's a little bit long for my liking but overall it's a good fit that's certainly not least we have the brand Laurel and birch they are a new brand just came out recently shirt is made out of 100% Peruvian pima cotton it's a hundred sixty-five it grams and so it's not lightweight and it's not super thick it's somewhere in between a skits regular t-shirt and their light weight shirt in terms of the fit it fits well through the body it's got a nice looseness to it but not loose sloppy the sleeves hit perfectly around mid bicep it's a little bit wider than some of the other shirts in terms of the length it's also a little bit longer and so it's a little bit better of a fit for taller cuts the neckline fits really well it's the perfect neckline just like all the other shirts and this around up then there's a little detail down here at the bottom which is the Laurel and Burch logo since they're a new brand they offer four different versatile colorways white gray navy and black and then they only have sizes small through extra-large and so there's no extra small or you know smaller or shorter guys but I'd say the small does fit pretty well but an extra small will probably fit me better now I've got another video for you right here if you want to take a look at some other best fitting t-shirts alright it's all I got for this video if you liked it please give it a thumbs up if you are new here please consider

growingyourgreens.com today we have another exciting episode for you guys can see I'm in a Microgreens farm right here right now and where I'm in the world. I'm here in Baltimore, Maryland at City hydro This is city hydro vertical farm because they're growing things vertically up the wall We're literally sitting now in a 10-foot by 15-foot room. This is not huge and this farmer here literally makes $100,000 a year That's you know, gross Income not revenue here a year And if you guys wanna learn how he does that and how he grows microgreens here check the link down below actually I was in this very without this very farming one year ago just about at this time in that video now has over 650,000 views it's one of my best watched videos by the number one video on microgreens and when you guys watch it You'll know why it's the number one video because we go through the gamut. I mean this guy Larry has got it all worked out. He's basically come up with a system to grow microgreens so that anybody could do it It's like Mel Bartholomew guys know Mel Bartholomew. He's like, you know, the guy that is credited to making Square Foot Gardening He came up with a method for gardening for people at home. So it's really easy so I mean that's what Larry did he basically systematized things uses certain different pads and certain techniques so that you guys Have success when grow my cream. So once again check the link down below to watch that video we did here I mean I call it an award-winning video, but I didn't get no worse for it. But anyways, uh-huh, right? It has lots of views We're not going to talk about like how to grow microgreens in this video. That's the last video below We will talk about today are the 10 biggest mistakes You guys can make when you're growing microgreens, you know, Larry's been doing this a long time. I've been to many different microgreens Farms and growers and I've seen the problems. I've talked to people growing my greens I've heard about the problems and I don't want you guys having any of the problems and I don't want you guys to make any of the mistakes to have to throw out your seeds throughout your batches when you think they're bad when they're not You know some we're gonna literally get Larry that expert to show you guys the ten, you know Mistakes that most likely happen to you So if you make sure you don't do these things you can be success from mic routines and I want everybody out there watching this No matter what time of year It is no matter where you live in the world literally apartment in New York City or you know in Hawaii nuts condo in Honolulu you guys can grow microgreens because you don't need a lot of space and these are the most Nutritious foods on the entire planet and what you get a system established to grow the microgreens You literally have one tray a day you could be harvesting on a Continuing regular basis and you want to bring different kinds of my Korean so you get different Nutrients in you and your family so you can basically do anti-aging to yourself. These are the most anti-aging foods on the planet They're also going to help you lose the weight because they're also about least amount of calories and they also have the most disease Prevention properties like oh my god. Let's not talk about them broccoli microgreens. I mean they've done amazing research on those So let's get it in this episode The first thing when I ask you Larry is Larry How has it been since I made that video for you last year. I got your farm like what's happened? Oh, it's been amazing The amount of people that we've trained the amount of people that have come in does this city hydro just to learn how to grow We've probably done a hundred and twenty-five people plus so far this year with our free training then come in for two days They learn how to grow the the response to your video has been phenomenal It is in the amount of people now that are growing pure microgreens using just water is a skyrocketing. It's just unreal Yeah my career. So the easiest thing bro You're like I want to put out a garden outside right gardening outside takes a lot of time Hey, you got a to get a tomato? You got to plant the seeds you got to make it make the plant grow up Then you got to make sure the flowers turn into a fruit maybe 70 days you're harvesting tomatoes Maybe if you're lucky if the bugs didn't get or the birds, they need them and the microgreens it's it's indoors You control everything literally it's just water some seeds and in literally two weeks about two weeks You're having some food to eat. So once again my greens you everybody should be growing microgreens. Alright, Larry So what is the number one biggest mistake that people make when growing microgreens, right? so the number one biggest mistake I find is people get mold in their microgreens and mold is normally caused from over watering and Too much water in the tray or they're spraying the top of the microgreens with water when they're in the vegetative state So here we have a rule of thumb in germination the only water from the bottom when in vegetative Sorry when in germination your water from the top water from the top when we spring you get a glass seeds there exactly and when it's in Under the lights or in vegetative state your water from the bottom Both of those two things will help you curtail the amount of mold that you get in your tres. Also. We don't use any fans Don't use fans. We don't use any fans on our microgreens A lot of people say oh you got to blow fans on the microgreens help try them out and stuff like that We found that putting the fans on it actually blew the mold spores into the other trays Because we grow so close together and we're such a confined area. So we actually figured it out It's fixed the watering, which is your issue once you fix the watering You don't need any fans. You don't have any mold well So what about like, I guess we're gonna talk about this in a minute But what if there's like more humidity in the air in certain locations then will you get more mold? Because even though you're not necessarily Watering the plants or getting your own moist, right? So we keep our grow room between 35 and 50 percent humidity The lower the humidity the better because there's less humid in the air mold love's humidity Right if there's more humid if it's more humid in your grow room Then your microgreens are going to get nice and damp on the top and the mold. That's what they're attacking They're going after the dampness in that and we keep the growing between 68 and 72 degrees right prime prime growing temperature prime growing for humidity cool, and so what so how did this mold up here on the top like white buzz and the top of the microgrid actually dip Here in the root zone or how does that work? Right most of the mold that happens happens on the top of microgreens So you'll see like it looks like a fish Spiderweb on the top of the mic Green's that's the mold most of the mold that happened that people call mold and in the bottom or root hairs and and the root hairs People actually confuse root hairs a lot of times with mold They don't have any mold issues But they have root hair issues and we're going to talk about the root heresy in a little bit. Alright, cool so yeah, number one is mold and get your watering down right when you're when you're Germinating them water from the top because the seeds need the water They they don't have the root hairs to pull up with the water yet And when they're already in vegetative, they sent the roots down then they'll suck water from the Thompson, but don't spray them directly You're just asking for it It's like don't water your garden in the middle of the day You know top water just feed them at the root zone or the plants literally need the water. Alright, Larry So what is uh, the big mistake number two that people make biggest mistake number two is root rot A lot of people get root rot and root rot happens when there's too many seeds or seeded too densely So we see it on these pads here if you see too dense, and you got big clumps of seeds like this you know, you should have a nice and Smooth out and so the seeds should be out like this nut in a clumped area like this what happens when they're in a clumped Area like this is the seeds on the top Will start to germinate in the season the bottom will start to rot And so it'll cause a root rot in this area and you actually pick up the microgreens like this and they're all Rotting and everything on the pad because they're just too dense. You want a seed like this? our recommended amount of seeds is a little more dense at most microgreen growers seed we recommend a hundred of Milliliters per four pads, right if you're just starting out in your newbie, and you want to learn about it Probably drop it down to about 75 milliliters per floor pads and then work your way back up to a hundred milliliters Four four four pads and make sure that you're pushing the pet the seeds out So it's not to cause root rot or what they call dampening down dampening off dampening off. Yeah. Sure So basically what you want is you want single-file only please right you want one seed in the area Maybe it's kind of touching its neighbor, but they're not like stacked up on top of each other That's definitely a no-no So it would be true to say Larry that on The you know root rot issue would be better to under seed Versus over seed which can then help your issues, even though you might not have a nice lunch tray of my creams no snow So Mike repeats, but at least you're not gonna have a root rot, right? And so it's so we tell a lot of a lot of our clients that come her to learn how to how to grow that Are having issues with over seeding cut it down to 75 milliliters put less seeds on but you still got a really nice pad of microgreens with with even 75% amount of seeds on it versus 200 hundred milliliters of seeds still a nice pad of microgreens cool Cool. So yeah, that's that mistake number two. Don't make that mistake Make sure you see properly not too many right and it's better to do under and over So Larry, what's that third mistake that people make third mistake Ruud Harris using root hairs with Mold I'm trying out and I'm gonna tell you when I first started I was throwing out tray after tray after tray I was looking at the trays and they all had this white fuzzy stuff down by the roots It looks like mold it's white and I was like, oh my gosh I got mold and I'm sowing tray after tray out and my wife comes in and she says what are you doing? Larry and I said all these trays have mold in it She said Larry that can't be so you've got to be doing I said no I said seed guy He's selling me moldy seeds Like so I called up the the guy over at Mountain Valley seeds or truly seeds about it and said Larry get a magnifying glass Take a look at those things and hit them with a little bit of water and they'll jump back because it's living Those are root hairs. They look exactly like mold if you would you like to see some. Yeah, let's see some get some out So this is basically a whole tray that just got seated and is now growing if you guys look closely You'll see these are all here. So I'll show the camera while you talk about it. So those are root hairs So actually what it is is the roots sending out little feelers to get more nutrients in it. They're not mold It looks like mold because it's white It's actually root hairs. They'll dissipate some of them get pretty dense and But they don't cause any other issues or not. They're not bad for you. You can eat them. They're part of the plant they're fine Cool, so how can somebody determine if its root hairs or not? So if they got like a micro maker magnifying glass to look and then what you you pour so you Pour some water on on and they move or what happened to me to make sure If you're concerned that you have mold and you have these root hairs the root hairs are in the entire tray it's not just a little section of the tray the entire tray has root hairs in it all your pads all your Substrate that you're growing on even your soil will have a little bit of root hairs in it Not just a little spot. If it's mold, it's normally in just a little spot on one or two pads It's not towards the entire tray. The entire tray is covered with some kind of white fuzzy stuff Nine times out of ten his root hairs. I see so then when that once the microgreens get taller, right Can you still see root hairs or at that point if there's some white fuzzy stuff at the top, is that mold? Yeah, so as the microgreens get taller the root hair stay down towards the bottom. They don't migrate up the plant They're only at the very bottom They're normally about a quarter inch to a half inch deep at the very bottom of the plant and it covers the entire plant If it's mold and it creeps up, it'll be up near the top near the leafy part Not too much towards the bottom now if it turns grey That's root rot. And now you're getting root rot from some other pits eating too dense or whatever but if it's just staying at the very bottom It looks like cotton at the very bottom little cotton balls and you hit it with some water and it jumps back Those are root hairs I see now is what mold always be white or does mold coming different colors on the microphone so mold comes in white and it comes in black or Grayish color, so it's gray or black then that's bad for sure for sure and if it's white creepy root hairs if it's into the bottom if it's up near the top Like on the stem or on the leaves that's definitely mold, right? So if it looks like a spiderweb on the very top that's definitely mold, right? I've never seen green mold in microgreens I've only seen white and black cool so if you have microgreens are starting to mold like I would take them and Put in my garden outside to see if they'll just grow because it doesn't matter once the Sun hits it it'll kill and all this Stuff now the other question I have for you Larry is like if somebody's not selling the Mike Greene's you notice for sale and they just wanna like somehow still utilize the Mike greens Like if we eat the mold of that bad for us mean what cheese is mold right that blue stuff? Can you just take them like greens and and cook them up? And that's gonna kill the mold then we're fine if we eat them. I mean, what's your take on that? So, I personally I would just if I had mold and in a certain area here I would just pick that moldy spot off and throw it out and then I would take some hydrogen peroxide and Spray it around the microgreens and spray it on the lid maybe as well as they're still in termination and kill it and That way they with this rest of the nice elated area You would totally kill removed get rid of and then you would let the rest of the flat continued out to first row, right? And some if your if it's root hairs It normally happens in germination most mold issues happen in vegetative state under the lights every blue moon though You get some mouldy seats from the grower or from the seed guy that then as soon as in two or three days after your growing you'll start to see a spiderweb coming out of the before the roots start to come out you actually see a spiderweb starting to come out of the seed that's moldy seeds from their Seed cellar and you need to contact your seed seller and tell me I found mold in my trays I found mold in my seeds What do you think and he knows I mean it because you're not the only one reporting it probably yeah so he'll know and in an RC guy is really great about fixing that issue for for people that have issues with moldy seeds and it does happen It does happen. Yeah, I mean the thing is get proper seed but we're gonna talk about that mistake in a minute So alright, Larry So what is mistake number four and that Mike your greens growers make? The biggest one did biggest issue that I have in the grow room is fruit flies I have a lot of fruit flies off and on Because I have a lot of guests and a lot of people come in and another grow room They might have been at Whole Foods before they came here They might have been at their farm and one of those little critters got on him at the grocery store at the farm They came in here and they thought they died and went to heaven I mean, there's so much greener in there and so much sweet just sweetness happening is fruit flies I don't have any other issues with gnats or aphids or any other big big produce when I call big produce issues I have fruit flies and we have a really good way to get rid of the fruit flies wheel a shot back that we actually vacuum out the trays with as we get the fruit flies and we also set up a fish tank aerator thing with some Redd's Apple ale so you put a Redd's Apple ale in here with some dish soap and two cups of water With this fish tank type area. Tur Bubbler and hook it up to a fish tank pull this down and what it actually does It creates a Tower of foam from the Redd's Apple ale Read sample label is the stuff they sold as a liquor store. It's Apple ale that smells like rotting apples I think that you probably some apple cider vinegar you could add some cider vinegar as well The only problem with the apple cider vinegar is I it might cut the bubbles down that you get some powder See, it's right a bubble Yeah So the bubbles the Redd's Apple ale really makes a nice almost like an ice cream cone effect and those fruit flies fly right in it and They get stuck and they can't leave. It's great. We actually have a video on how to make this. Oh cool. Yeah I'll put a link down below to uh, Larry's YouTube channel. So you check out all those videos there So and then what would so fungus douse? It's not an issue for your growth because you're not using like a coconut core or a soil Medium you're using it pads that actually we'll learn about in a little bit cuz choosing the right Medium to grow your things a but what would people do about that? So so a lot of people they grow in soil and instead of sanitizing the soil after every time they use it They just keep reusing the soil over and over again Well, you should be sanitizing because if you have if you have a gnat and he lays his eggs, or she lays her eggs Sorry she lays her eggs in the soil and you don't sanitize that soil by heating it up and Killing the the larvae in the in the eggs in that soil the next plan you give out they come again So you're fighting a losing battle you need to keep on top of it Athens I don't have any if it's I've heard of people have an Athens in the room I think they might be growing other larger plants and they're in the grow room. That's attracting the Athens Yeah, I mean have clean and sterile conditions, you know basically otherwise and Follow Larry system that he's devised to minimize any problem that you guys are gonna have in the first place. All right there So what's the next biggest mistake that Birds make? Under watering and over watering. And what does that bring? Also that goes back to the mold and a root rot over watering under watering. So we have this system of watering It's it's a basically we use this nice wand. I called the arrow scribe pink job girl Shrive Yes, and I was like God you could get any paint any car for 99 dollars or something exactly So it's like painting or a car so it's back and forth back and forth Right like this for 30 seconds 30 seconds 30 seconds giving a full coverage up and down up and down and It's the only when their keys are germinating and they're only it made the roots into that pads exactly. This is only in germination You're watering from the top and we use these lids also So you would also spray the lids for another 10 seconds making sure you create a nice moisture barrier inside the tray now when you're watering from the bottom and In the trays on the rack make see what you do is you pour those you're poor you take the tray And we turn it around here a little bit and you tilt it and you see some water building up in the bottom down here The water builds up in the bottom if you can bring the water up to your first knuckle, right? That's plenty of water in the bottom of the tray. You don't need to add any more water But if you needed to add more water Basically how I do is this pour a cup of water in here? Swish it around a little bit So this is on the side of the tray where it just goes right down to the bottom of the tray You're not actually watering it on to it, right? Exactly. And that's why we left this opening a border Yeah, me and the trim rollers don't actually do that because you want to maximize their space, right? So we actually opened our pads that only fit There's eight pads per tray and they you but them all the way up against the one and they leave about an inch Gap in the bottom here that's to be able to check the watering There's a rhyme to our reason a reason to our rhyming or whatever deal So somebody wasn't using your system like Halladay control so that they would so they would control watering Basically the same way you're still with when you're watering in soil and everything like that You want to make sure that you don't mist from the top? When it's in vegetative state that that's the biggest issue that most people have is they thinking these a little foliage spray on the top? Full of spray on the top of a micro green when it's so dense what happens is a water gets down between the stems and the stems are together and The water will get down in here and start to cause the stem to rot because it's creating heat in there Never never do a folded spring full of spray on your big plants is great They love it, right your tomato plants and although this stuff microgreens. Now you want a water from the bottom They're taking all that nutrients up from the water in the bottom of the tray And I guess the amount of water is depending on how much is already in there So you don't want to put too much not too little right? So it's actually just something you're gonna have to learn Yeah It's just a rule of thumb and I and I use a finger method that you stick your finger in here and when it comes up to the first knuckle when You tilt it at about a 45 degree angle and it comes up to the first knuckle here. That's plenty of water So your finger is a dipstick now that you're basically study on sand make sure that you're right at the right little point Exactly just like on a car and a dipstick make sure you have enough oil in it. All right, cool Well, you're making things really easy for people if they follow your exact system What's a six mistake that many growers may make when growing microgreens Larry so they think the room should be nice and hot They think it should be like a greenhouse high humidity in nice and hot well, not for microgreens because again They're really dense And so you don't want the high humidity because you don't want any morning dew Filming on the top of the microgreens in the morning and stuff like that You want the temperature between 68 and 72 degrees that also keeps the bugs out Because the bugs don't propagate the bugs start to propagate when the temperature gets above like 75 degrees 80 degrees in there They'd like it nice and warm they like that sauna effect going on and you keep the humidity down 35 to 50 percent is what we recommend the humidity to be in the grow room also keeps the smell of the grow room down and bein square in our house Zana my wife if she if she smelled microgreens downstairs in our house and everything as guests we're coming in and people be like What's that smell in your house now? There's no smell you keep that humidity down. There's no smell The other thing is you got to empty the humidifier. So we empty about two To two five-gallon buckets a day worth of water out of this room Wow, yeah We dumped a lot of water. We dumped a lot of water out of the air So you think two does ten gallons of water a day that we're dumping Wow So do you rent if you get fired 24 hours a day here we run the humidifier 20 we run the humidifier dehumidifier 24/7 we run the air the standalone air conditioning air 24/7 in the summertime and in the late fall early Fall and we have a duckling. We have a ductless air conditioning unit up on the top that we run year-round I see there's no heat on in this room So in the wintertime the temperature in this room might drop to 30 to 40 degrees but it's okay for the microgreens because the microgreens are creating enough heat and the lights are creating enough eat and The power boxes are creating enough heat that they won't they won't freeze So, I guess you may not need to do humidifier depends on where you live right If you live in Las Vegas or Phoenix where it's really dry, that's like the perfect conditions. Don't add a Humidifier to make it more humid. You're good there But if you're in Hawaii somewhere, you're like Baltimore East Coast, you know, it has to be more humid than it It'd be a really good idea. Right right, and I can tell you some of our best growers are in the more arid areas, likewise like Las Vegas Arizona, New Mexico Those areas were so nice and arid it just seems like the microgreens really grow break down in those areas. Awesome All right. So what's the seventh biggest mistake that growers make when growing microgreens? Using the wrong substrate wrong substrate or soil or soil that already. It's a technical. Jargon, right? So so soil the issue was growing with soil is soil can't be taken into the kitchen So if you're selling to a chef you have to cut the microgreens and bring it to them You can't sell it to them living So you can't take soil into the kitchen coco coir a lot of a lot of Health Department people Look at coconut coir and they think it's soil. So therefore that also can't be brought into the grow room And the other thing is is what are you going to do with the coconut coir in the in the soil after you get done? Using it each time. I've got a big compost pile at back I don't know because you're gonna have to be cutting it to sell it to the restaurants Also, there's hemp. So this is another substrate but the problem with this is too flimsy You'll put your microgreens on this you put it in the tray you wet it down Pretty soon you go to pick it up and you can't pick it up. It falls all apart and Some of this is certified organic and some of its not it's kind of hard to get hemp certified organic in the States Especially if it's growing here because of the legalities of it It's a nice product, but it's just too flimsy for us Right if you were if if you put it in the Train You'll put your seeds on a little bit of water You have to use a spatula to pick it up and put it into a container. Whatever The other thing is is there's flex. This is bio straight. I don't know what's in this I Mean I had a guy give me some stuff to grow and he called it Cambodian swamp grass and it looked like this and I can tell you I put it in the tray and the microgreens Oh my gosh, they were huge and I called open I asked him I said, you know what's in that Cambodian swell grass you've got I said what kind of fertilizers you're putting in that to make or grow like that? Oh nothing I'm not adding anything and I'm like, alright, you got to be adding something to that we grew up here We only use water. We don't want any fertilizers. We don't want any secondary Chemicals or anything coming into our microgreens, so we're not using that The other thing you got to be careful is the coconut fiber that you bind So this is what we grow on we grow on coconut fiber where microgreen growers Right, we grow microgreens. We designed micro green. We designed a substrate to grow microgreens. We don't make shoes We don't make bricks. We don't make anything out of coconut coir we make growing pads If you smell that All right. Yeah kind of smells like a rubber tire. Yeah Way way too much Latex, and I'm not sure You know, I don't know the manufacturer of this stuff. I'm not sure what's in the latex, right? There's there's what was that a seam? It might not be beaten for those you guys are a vegan that are worried about that It's like a protein they use it as like a glue right so they add that to soften out the latex They might be using synthetic latex. I don't know All right I do know what's in our pad and I do know it's a hundred percent natural tree gum, which is very concerning to me You don't know what's being uptake into your roots. You don't know what your you're eating Hence why we use food-safe plastics and everything else right? It's all the way down to the substrate. Yeah so the growing medium you're using whether that's a coconut core or Soil potting soil or you want to use some kind of like soil as substrate basically? Which is an acre and it's going to hold the seeds on you know, Larry only recommends using the right one that he's researched He's developed. He's worked with manufacturers to get the right, you know, consistency the right to you know, gums that hold together That's like non-toxic all vegan doesn't have any casing in there And if you're getting you know ones just randomly on Amazon because it's five cents cheaper, right? It's um, you know, it's not the right one. It may not work. You may hold too much moisture And it also may not break down. Also, you know smell yours. Oh wow Yeah, yours hasn't more much more mild, like like since like this one's a lot stronger So what can happen is somebody's using like say coconut coir, right? So so coconut corners are good I'll use a lot. I see those people are using that right so coconut coir is good I mean, I'm not knocking the coconut core, but it you can't grow hydroponically with it You can't grow you have to grow in ten twenty trays or even grow in these trays that we have But there's no there's it's not a hydroponic operation it's a traditional growing method where you're putting the seeds down inside the coconut coir right or the soil and And we decided that we wanted to grow Hydroponically and that we wanted to control the amount of nutrients going into the plants where we just feed it water and that's it Don't know what's in a coconut corner that you're buying don't know what's in the soil that you're buying the potting mix that you're buying I know what's in this and I know what's in the water that I'm giving to the plants. So therefore we're going 100% pure Yeah It's just basically taking out some of the issues because I mean I've ran across people that have been buying coconut coir from one source They're using it successfully their period of time and then all of a sudden they're even though they order from the same place Their grow fails because the the product is inconsistent. There's inconsistencies Coconut coir could not be washed properly can have too many salts So basically what Larry's noticed once again create a system, so it's just getting to work straight every single time. You're gonna be successful So yeah, I mean I would definitely encourage you guys to use but what Larry knows works and what he's designed To work instead of one that might look like the same thing, but it's totally not Alright, so Larry, what's the next mistake that many growers can make seeds seeds? Oh that's you by buying the wrong seeds buying not certified seed men right so You got to make sure that when you buy seeds that they have this nice label on it that talks about the germination rates When the seeds were harvested all that stuff lot number number active tractable exactly because if somebody gets sick for your microgreens and the health department shows up at your farm and they want to know where you bought those seeds from I Bought them from Johns City hydro right now, that doesn't work They want to see a tag like this and you could be held liable. Who knows, right? Yeah I mean if you're going on for yourself just for personal consumption, right? They may have mold or contamination issues They they may not grow properly You just you just don't know. So I always want to encourage you guys to be safe rather than sorry I mean some seeds could be have Ecoline. I know some seed sellers when they're selling sprouting seeds They test those and they go out for microbial tests before they are sold for growing sprouts The other thing is treated seeds so you don't know if you're buying from Some eBay channel or or Amazon where the guy is not a USDA certified seed man You could be buying treated seeds now treated seeds aren't so bad if I'm a farmer and I'm planting a seed Here in a seed here in a seed here Treated seeds it's going to dissipate the fungicides and everything else that are in there soon I'm gonna do a big plant didn't ever you know It's not a big problem because you're not cutting small any a lot of them, right? But if I'm doing this and I'm putting thousands of seeds on this pad and these trees are seated I mean, sorry, these seeds are treated You're gonna get a lot of chemicals down inside the water that's going to get up taked into the roots The other thing is is all treated seeds are marked and they say poisonous not for human consumption That's because you're not supposed to be eating them Now, you know I've had people contact me about flower seeds and the guy who was selling dirt cheap and I was like wow That's amazing. That's an amazing price. How are you getting that price? And he told me you know, I go down to the Walmart and I buy the birdseed and I said you do what he said I go down to the Walmart and I buy the birdseed I Repackage it and I sell it. He said that's how come I can sell it first so cheap and I said Do you know those seeds are treated those seeds are not for human consumption? If you look right on the bag of your bird seat it says enough for human consumption There's a reason for it, you know Even some seed companies that I've contacted they asked me because I'm buying so many seeds They said are you're not eating those seeds are you even though they're not treated they're still concerned about? People eating large quantities of raw seeds. So the seed companies where you're buying from you need to make sure that they're certified Mountain-valley Johnny's mums all those guys are certified seed providers Some of them aren't just buyer beware Yeah So make sure you get the proper seats for growing microgreens and if they're labeled a sauce now just some random seed seller on Amazon Or Ebay what you guys like? Oh, I'm saving so much money like Yeah, you just don't know you could have issues contamination treated Do yourselves a favor get the right seeds? All right, leery, so what's mistake number nine that people make when grow my Theory's growing in non food safe plastics? Why does that make a difference? Leaching leach leaching. Hi, it's Steve. This is that black tray. This is that famous player. Everybody uses those Oh and the whole battery the industry man, everybody does in fact I can tell you so we're working on some new plastic so the plastic lady came to talk to us and she was telling us about these trays and how bad they are and Especially if they're made in third-world countries Where there's no regulations of what they're putting in the plastic What they're putting in for fillers in the trays. These are plastic trays they fall apart PVC has been proven to leach the lead into water systems, so Fertilize if you're using fertilizers corrosive, right? So it eats into the plastic piece in a plastic it draws all the chemicals out you need either into your water system that you have that you're feeding your plants or to the soil itself if you're using fertilizers, even if you're not using fertilizers letting water sit in a tray That's non-food safe. Plastic will still leach things out. So this is non food safe at all I have no idea what this is made of I know it's blast but I know what's in it. It's just really bad This is another tray now This looks better man. It's like nice and hard cloudy. It's got this flexible junk right, but it's AVS plastic Okay, so it's non food safe. It's not certified food safe. Even though some people out there say hey my trays our food safe I ask Oh your trays our food safe. Are they certified? FDA food safe if If they're not certified food safe, I won't use them we don't use any non certified food safe plastics in this room and off for our bus tubs to our Water buckets or anything got to be certified food safe And so what what problem will that cause do the grower grow my greens? I mean my trees no fighting here right go find in here. You're not going to get sick tomorrow if you eat them It's a residual effect, right? You keep eating stuff that's grown in non food safe plastics It's a matter of time before you develop either cancer or something else from the non from the lead I mean children take children It takes a grain of salt The size of a grain of salt of lead when they're in development when their brains in the development stage to have issues Right, they don't have issues that day. They're not drinking some water with let in it and getting sick that day It's years later down the road Toxic buildup. I would look at glipizide glyphosate, yeah All right. Yeah, so use the right trees guys Any if you're using these guys now, hey, you know upgrade yourself your lives, you know to the nicer trades I mean they cost more money, right? These guys are cheap you got if you can get these at growth stores and all this kind of stuff super cheap those guys don't Set you back But those guys I mean literally the ones that I saw last year when I was here they're still in circulation is still working They lost like years and years. They're all out last these guys buy like a hundred times easily They actually have a lifetime guarantee one Wow lifetime guarantee. So you use it forever Until your until your life ends You'll be growing in these boots eight remove trays. All right now there so I think we're dad's on the last Mistake that people make when they're growing microgreens and I think this is a pretty big one, right? Yeah Yeah, so like everybody when I first started growing microgreens, I thought I had to grow every kind of micro green I grew 80-some plus different kinds of microgreens. I thought it was fantastic Caused me a lot of issues Because some seeds are much harder to grow some seeds are much easier to grow I was trying things with chefs chefs to call me up and say, you know, I really didn't much care for that red ton That's something yeah red tone is actually a mahogany tree of the Tibet Oh, I got some see facts out there, you know one day I like to eat those. I wanna see what tastes nice 225 dollars a pound for the seeds it tastes like Fried onions Wow, that entry is amazing flavor But at 225 dollars a pound for the seeds the return on investment for that tray Isn't there growing amorous? Amaranth is a really nice looking micro green. It's really difficult to grow it Everybody has issues growing amaura though that are growing in soil coconut coir on our pads and hamp There are also always kinds of issues with with cameras. Why grow it I can tell you our chefs don't much care for amaranth It's just doesn't look good on a plate. It tastes great has a nice spinach flavor to it, but it's too difficult to grow sunflowers This year was a really bad year for sunflower seeds lots of mold in the sunflower seeds people were getting a lots of moldy trays of Sunflowers because the previous year was so wet this year's even wetter to me I mean, I don't know we've been getting rain every freaking day here. So Lots of mold in it, so it's a difficult plan to grow I can tell you if all I had to do was grow three kinds of microgreens I would grow three types of microgreens. I would grow leek peas and ranch Those are the easiest ones the easiest ones to grow and the best return on investment radishes are cheap peas are dirt cheap right leeks a little bit more expensive but seed wise you know People amethyst is an expensive seed Basil's an expensive seed if you lose a tray a mereth or a tray of basil You lost a lot of money if you lose a tray of Peas You don't lose so much money So the mistake is don't grow the wrong Kinds of microgreens choose the ones that are the easiest to grow especially if you're a beginner, you know If you've been growing my greens for five years like Larry you want to experiment some some harder ones to grow? I mean he has the skills now to do that if he wants to But I want you guys to start off and follow up what he says I mean he's been doing this running this business now for five years successfully so the the leeks the radishes and the piezo and what kind of Peas because I know there's different kinds of you know radishes and they're all pretty much gonna grow fast Just like in my garden random, but what kind of piece specifically because I know some peas may do better than others, right? Sure So we grow we grow one kind of piece. We used to grow a bunch of different kinds of peas we found that the green sprouting peas or the afina peas were the best ones to grow because they grow to a certain height and they kind of start to slow down like Australian field peas or dumb peas or or Those other piece they just keep growing pretty soon. You've got a tree Coming out of the tray with with the Fila peas that are sprouting peas they don't get bigger than seven to ten inches and they get a lot of nice tentacles on them and People the chefs love all those little tentacles coming out because it looks great on the plate Plus they have a really sweet pea flavor to them Radishes we grow we grow Rambo red or sorry Rambo radish with China rose mixed So we use a mixture of seeds there because we get a nice purple and green texture in the tray oh and the leeks what kind of needs to grow so leeks we grow American flag leek and we leave the little Black seeds on the top. It kind of gives it an oniony bagel flavor to it And it's a really nice looking black and with a black little nib on the top with a nice green base Yeah, it actually makes me hungry one's gonna eat some more leaks right now actually Wow, so Larry's there. He has it He's share with you guys a 10 biggest mistakes when growing microgreens, so now you guys can avoid doing those mistakes you guys be successful and growing my cream So literally before we go to have any other final tips or comments or words of wisdom You want to share my viewers today about growing microgreens? Now have fun it. It's amazing and don't give up So a lot of people start doing their trays and maybe the first two or three trays don't turn out right Keep going keep at it if it was easy Everybody would be doing it, right III keep up to it I just keep after it and go after and go after I can tell you the amount of people that have come here for training And its successful amount of people that we have is amazing because they kept at it. They didn't give up Yeah, I mean, that's what I want to encourage you guys to do, right? There's always a way you will figure it out, you know, don't give up I like to say, you know, if you did it unsuccessful you're made a mistake That's a success because you wouldn't successfully how not to do something Right, and if you want to play around and watch videos to grow my community, that's great I encourage you guys to do that start an experiment today start trying to grow things See what happens if you can't afford the expensive food safe ones Okay, you know try to get some kind of trays and whatever you guys can to start growing microgreens, it's bad It's better than nothing when you get some money then you know Then get the upgrade but here's the thing right if you guys are really serious about growing microgreens Right. You want to learn from an expert, right? Learning on YouTube is great. But you know Larry has an amazing deal then for $1,000 You literally get a gross set up just like this you see behind him, right? You'll get the setup But also he's gonna give you two days of free training here That's only if you buy the kit, you can't get the free training without the kit there and You're gonna come here at the Baltimore in this very room that I'm sitting at and you're gonna go for two full days of learning how to grow the microgreens so that you're not gonna make any mistakes and you will be successful at growing microgreens and in my mind my personal opinion is that It's probably the best thousand dollars if you want to grow some food that you've ever gonna spend because you're going to be set up With with the rack with a proven success Strategy that toy works. Plus you're gonna get two days of training Like hands-on with other people that are learning with you at the same time so that you could go home and literally feed your fan for life with the training and the supplies that Larry will be providing you. So yeah, check the link down below how to grow macaroons and make $100,000 a year that I did here with Larry that pretty much explains the whole setup He's changed a few things since I was here last but that's pretty much it for this episode right microgreens I will say are probably one of the most nutritious foods on the planet I believe everybody should be growing them.

if you knew the cheaper one would shrink after one wash would\nthat affect your decision we're about to unravel the truth behind what makes a\nt-shirt last for the long haul in this episode of our series ask first them but\nbefore we get into it hit that subscribe button unfortunately shrinkage is common with\nfabrics containing cotton unless manufacturers like bellick canvas take\npreventive measures against it the reason natural fibers like cotton shrink\nis because the fibers want to return to their natural state during the fabric\nmaking process when fibers are spun into thread there's a lot of tension put on\nthe fibers and they stretch out beyond their natural length then when fibers\nare warmed by warm water or a hot dryer during the drying process they try to\nreturn to their original state and in turn cause your clothes to shrink the\nreason that more expensive preshrunk cotton does not shrink in the dryer is\nbecause of a process that takes place during the fabric finishing process\nwhich basically gets the fabric to return to its natural state before the\ngarment is sewn with us you want maximum shrinkage of 5 percent while the cheaper\nbrands out there can shrink up to 10 that's basically a hole size we've\ninvested in top-of-the-line equipment that sets the industry benchmark for\nminimal shrinkage first we over stretch the fabric width wise to compensate for\nall the length tension it had in the previous processes next it goes through\nshrink drying chambers in which air blowers tumble the fabric and heat\ntriggers the cotton to revert to its natural state as it shrinks and dries\nthe fabric kind of like a super fancy industrial version of your dryer at home\nthese shrink dryers are a million dollars so it's no wonder mini\nmanufactures skip this step or do their own subpar version of it next the fabric\ngoes through compactor which compresses the length of the fabric using steam\nmaking it physically shorter since the length is where most of the shrinkage\ntends to occur this ensures that when a tee comes to you the fabric has been\nshrunk both lengthwise and widthwise we guarantee a shrinkage rate of five by\nfive meaning the absolute most it will shrink is five percent in both the\nlength and the wet it's always good to leave a little room for shrinkage so you\ndon't have the opposite problem which would be the tee stretching out have you\never had a side seam tee where after a wash that side seam isn't quite on the\nside anymore this happens but non croissant fabric returns to its original\nstate pulling the seam along with it through a\nshrink drying process by stretching and shrinking the fabric\nprior to sewing we eliminate any torque or twisting of the fabric after it's\nbeen washed at home I'm sure if you have a belly canvas tee at home\nyou notice how little it shrinks compared to other brands in your drawer\nthat's because we are the only manufacturer that is invested in\ntop-of-the-line preshrunk dryers like we've just shown you with us we want\nwhat you see to be what you get with no surprises when you take our teas home a\ntea like ours that looks just as awesome after multiple washes as it does right\nout of the box it's just one of the things that separates us from them next\nweek is our last episode of this series and we're talking about

Now this t-shirt is the t-shirt that\nstarted the entire soft t-shirt revolution. I say that because this was the first shirt\nto be soft. Back in the day, it's hard to believe, but we all grew up with shirts that\nwere stiff. It felt like you were wearing cardboard. This was the first shirt to actually\ncome out and offer a soft fabric, and not only a soft fabric, but a great fit, tailored\nfit. \u200bAs we talk about this here today, just\nthink about that. It dates the shirt a little, and it makes it one of our favorite shirts.\nInstead of just telling you though, we do have one of our models coming over and going\nto talk about this on him. \u200bYou can see, right away you're going to\nnote this side here there is no side seam on the side because it's perfect for this\nwrap logo. This is only one of the only unisex t-shirts, besides our 100% cotton t-shirt,\nbottom of the line, standard economical t-shirts that doesn't have a side seam, so perfect\nif you need a wrap. \u200bThe next thing you're going to notice though\nis though it does have a great fit, it's not boxy, because this shirt, although it is one\nbig wind, it's one fabric, it doesn't have that boxy feel. Love that about this shirt.\n\u200bThe neckline is standard crew neck length here, the sleeves, mid to high bicep, awesome\nplacement here, very flattering, great statement shirt. 100% ring spun fine jersey t-shirt\nmaterial. This shirt breathes great, feels great.\n\u200bIn terms of the price point, it's a little more expensive than the Next Level and Canvas\n100% ring spun, and just that top of the line 100% ring spun material. If you're getting\nthis, you know you're getting the top of the line 100% cotton, made in America as all American\nApparel is. We love this shirt, it comes in a ton of colors, also comes in a comparable\nladies style if you're looking for companion style. If you have a big group of people that\nwant to order ladies and unisex, this is your shirt to go with.\n\u200bAlso, if you're thinking about care instructions, we're talking 100% ring spun cotton here.\nOver the course of its life, we're talking a year, two years down the line, it could\nstart pilling. 100% cotton, we always like giving that disclaimer that if you're going\nto dry this thing on high every wash, it could start shrinking, or just distorting. We don't\nrecommend washing it and drying it on high temperatures. Keep it on low to mid, and it's\ngoing to last a lot longer. \u200bIf you are looking to order for a staff\nat your business or restaurant, or volunteer organization that they're going to wear on\nweek after week, definitely bump it up to the 50/50 or 50/25/25 blend, it's going to\nlast a lot longer. \u200bAs you can see, it fits great, it feels\ngreat, we love this shirt for so many reasons, and I guarantee when you try it on, when you\nexperience this, just like I literally think millions of people have done since the early\n2000's, you'll know why this one t-shirt started the entire soft t-shirt revolution. You're\ngoing to love it, Tyler you look amazing in it, thank you. \u200bOn the Coed Monkey soft scale, we rate this t-shirt a 2. Thanks for watching this\nvideo, please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, soft\nmatters, and so do our customers.", "MZrv1rhd1eM": "Hey guys it's Megan with BELLA+CANVAS in\nthis video we're gonna cover everything you need to know about fabrics whether\nyou're brand new to the industry or if you're an industry vet I'm sure you've\nwondered what the difference is between Heather CVC and tri-blend or what the\nheck slub or poly viscose means today we're gonna break it all down for you let's start with the basics\nthe most common tea in the printable market is 100% cotton a lot of other\nbrands out there use carton open-ended cotton this is your cheaper or heavier\nscratchier or price point t-shirt at bella canvas we use only 100% cotton ring\nspun cotton what this means is we take the raw cotton and we comb out the\nimpurities and then it's ring spun to create a long strand of yarn so that\nwhen we knit our fabric its a tight weave and it's the best surface to print on\nthis is our style 3000 one the singles are like a thread count the higher the\nsingle the finer the fabric in the industry singles range for about 18 all\nthe way up to 40 your carded open-end cheaper tees are going to be in that 18\nto 20 single range our 100% combed and ring spun cotton is a 30 single and it's\na 4.2 ounce so 3001 is your go to basic hundred percent comb and ring spun tee\nit's great for discharge printing and direct garment printing we're going to\nget into all the details with printing tips for all the different types of\nfabrications down the line to keep your eyes open for that video to come another\nsuper popular fabrication is Heather CVC our Heather CvC is at 52% combed and\nring-spun cotton 48 percent polyester blend it's a 30 single at 4.2 oz\nHeather CVC basically means and it's a poly-cotton blend and CVC stands for\ncheif value cotton which is a fabric term to indicate that there's a slightly\nhigher cotton content than polyester the incredible market is trending towards\nHeather CVC because that polyester blend gives it that nice texture that nice\nsubtle dimension and the polyester blended with the cotton gives it a\nreally nice soft hand so you have other hundred percent cotton that's more of\nyour price point basic and then Heather CVC is a step up when it comes to\npricing now we're going to take a look at tri-blend tri blend is a unique blend of\ncotton polyester and rayon so you have the comfort of the cotton you have the\ndurability of the polyester and you have the drape from the rayon rayon was\noriginally developed as a substitute for silk that's what gives it it's super\nsoft hand with our tri-blend we have a 40 single and we're the only ones to do\na 40 single in the market I realize I'm bias that we have the best tri-blend in\nthe industry similar to Heather CVC tri ones also have that nice subtle texture\nand the reason for this is that the natural and the synthetic fiber\ntake the dye differently so that when it's knit you have that really nice heather\nlook one thing that's unique about bella canvas tri-blend is that we've also\nengineered our dyeing process so that the natural fibers and the synthetic\nfibers will take the color in a way that results in a solid tri-blend we're the\nonly ones in the industry to offer a solid tri-blend so you get that same\ngreat hand that silky drape but that solid color that sells so well in the\nindustry slub is more of a specialty fabrication\nthat you might not be as familiar with slub is basically the leftover fibers\nand it's a cotton poly rayon blend that's knit in a way that gives it this\nnice tonal texture so when you're screen-printing you get that dimension\nbut it's tonal so that it's approachable from a decoration standpoint people are\nreally into slub because it's something you see prevalent at retail right now\nand it's got that great vintage look to it if you're familiar with Bella\ncanvas you're probably familiar with flowy but you might not know what that\nnecessarily means the flowy collection is made of our poly viscose fabric it's\n65% polyester 35% viscose it's a 30 single and it's is 3.7 oz what's unique\nabout this it's got a really soft silky and it's an elevated fabrication that\nyou would find at retail for women's apparel\nit also drapes away from the body so it's slightly oversized so no matter\nwhat shape or size you are you're gonna find something in the flowy collection\nthat's right for you for the past seven years flowy has only been available to\nwomen but we recently added a poly viscose unisex tee to our fast fashion\ncollection and that's awesome for those sublimation printers out there because\nit's perfect for that type of printing last but not least we have our\nmarble fabrication marble is another one of our signature textures that gives you\nthat great dimension but it's awesome for graphic tees it's 91 percent\npolyester nine percent combed and ring spun cotton it's a 30 single and a 4\nounce so it's got a really nice soft tan to it and again that great texture a lot\nof other brands in the industry have Heather CVC and tri blend options for\nyou but no one else does dimension like this now you should all be fabric\nexperts but if you still have questions leave them for us in the comment section\nbelow it would have been too much to cover printing tips and the difference\nbetween all the fabrics so keep an eye out for our new video that will cover\nall of the different techniques for these fabrics right here Be Different", "LI3GpG3STDk": "hello everybody my name is Jennifer maker tonight we are talking about infusible inks and what kinds of t-shirts so what kind of fiber content and what colors we can put them on I'm the great maker show and tell so ever since crickets and fusible links came out folks have been asking me what we can put them at now Cricut has a lot of official blanks they have t-shirts and they have tote bags and they have coasters but what if you are a different size than the t-shirts that are available because this the sizes I believe are small to 2x so what if you're a larger size or what if you like a different style of t-shirt but what if you want a different color or a whole lot of different things what if we don't want 95% polyester and you want in 5% spandex which is what the Cricut shirts are what if you need a little bit more cotton content right so tonight we are going to look at over 15 it's actually 19 different t-shirts that I have already tested and already washed so we're going to look at them we're going to look at them in some cases we're gonna be able to see what they look like before they're washed but we'll be able to compare what they look like after they've been washed so you can see how they held up and how they look in the first place and everything like that now if you have questions please feel free to shut your question now and I will do my best to answer it my team is here thank you guys so much for being here and we'll help out with questions to the best of their ability and I actually have a blog post that has links to the t-shirts that I found on Amazon and actually it's a list of all the shirts that we're testing tonight it's over on my blog at jennifermcguireink.com I tested and then show you what they look like before we wash them and after we wash them so let's head on over to my workspace and I can explain what I have done for you and also I can love them to check the screen and look for questions as well all right so let's head on over there and take a look okay so here is my stack of white t-shirts there's quite a few of them here they've all I have already put them put the image on I have used the exact same image and every single one so we can compare and look at the color transfer and everything I picked this rainbow transfer sheet that comes in this is the Shaylee infusible ink box so it's this one right here and I put this wing tart on every single one of these 19 shirts to show you and so this one here at the top this is the cricket shirt this is the one that is sold at Michael stores right now exclusively it's at Michael's stores and this is the one that Cricut guarantees that they're a fusible links will work on but as you can see there's a lot more shirts here that I tested with so we're gonna find out what else works especially in terms of the fiber content for these because these are all white which is like really the perfect color to use in fusible links on because in fusible links are not like vinyl where it just sits right on top of the surface it is instead an ink it's a kind of sublimation ink that actually infuses into the surface of the t-shirt so there's nothing here it just feels like t-shirt so it's really very awesome if you're not familiar with in fusible ink technology I have lots of videos I have an ultimate guide to it we did we've done several play tests on how this works in fact here's the quick little preview of me creating all 19 of these t-shirts using my Cricut ez press 2 and infusible ink now this is sped up a lot as you can imagine but you can see here how I am putting the in fusible ink transfer which is the heart with the wings that I created on my Cricut onto my t-shirt know that I'm using the paper underneath to protect my mat as well as two sheets to put your paper on top of my shirt to protect from scorching and that thing it's also important to note that I am preheating each of these shirts before I put my design at I am using crickets instructions so we are heating me my ez press is at three hundred and eighty five degrees Fahrenheit and I'm doing it pressing for forty seconds but do exactly what the Cricut ez press guide tells us to do now of course it doesn't know that I'm using all these different kinds of shirts so I'm simply following the same directions for all of the shirts so all the shirts are three hundred eighty five degrees for 40 seconds I also want to note that normally you want to wait before you remove at the transfer for the shirt you want to wait till it cools down I edited this video so you weren't just watching nothing while it I wait for it to cool down so it's just important again if you're not familiar with how to use infeasible ink please check out my tutorials I had a great tutorial on how to do t-shirts that shows you step-by-step exactly what to do and then putting that link for you right here on the screen so you can head on over there and check it out now let's look at each t-shirt that I tested with Cricut infeasible ink up close this is the cricut shirts this is what we're gonna compare everything to so this is the one that guaranteed that cricut guarantees will work with it's in fusible ink transfer sheets and markers okay so let's compare how this looks to the what it looks like before it was washed so we move that over there we go okay so here we go on the left you can see the pre-washed version and on the right you can see it washed and you can see it looks identical there's no difference at all okay next shirt so this is the one that hopefully everything will look as good as this this is I mean this is our goal it's not going to happen guys but this is what we would like okay now remember infusible ink really needs polyester or polymer to bind to and that's why it's so important what our shirt content is all right so here is 100% poly sir this is what look like before we washed it and this is what looks like after it looks the same to me and this is a shirt that I found on Amazon it is kind of feels like an athletic shirt it's sort of shiny rather than being soft right but it takes the infusible ink really really well and there's a link to that if you want to find this shirt there's a link to this in my blog and then my blog post okay so next one so this is the 92 percent polyester 8% spandex still looks the same to me 92% polyester is really really a high current polyester so this looks good so again the one on the left is the pre-wash and this one is after it's been washed okay so this looks great this shirt is a No Boundaries shirt and I got it from Walmart for I don't know like five bucks or something very inexpensive okay next shirt is 90% polyester so and this one didn't quite like something happens I've seen this happen once in a while and I haven't figured out what it is it's possible that it's just not a good shirt to start with I don't know so this is a Tara and Skye's shirt that I also found at Walmart 90% polyester 10% spandex and it's the color looks the same to me as I did before I washed it I don't see any difference in color just we have this kind of faded spot here again I don't know if it's because of the quality of the shirt which is certainly possible or if it's just a user error alright next shirt so this is an eighty percent polyester twenty percent cotton and now I think that we can see just a tiny little bit of fading maybe maybe I'm just seeing things they actually look really similar to me so this is a Fruit of the Loom shirt and it came like a pack for it was really affordable I got this on Amazon I believe and I had the link to this one in my blog post and but it looks really now the only thing that I see like looking at it with my naked eye which you guys might not be able to see like I I don't know it does look a little bit so tell me a bit faded you can see the fibers of the cotton kind of peeking through but it's not bad or anything it's it's not bad alright next shirt is a 65% polyester 30 percent cotton George brand and this comes from Walmart and I think it looks really similar to the one that we just saw just a little bit of fading not so vibrant and let's just to compare it let's get out the cricket one over here so you can see so this here is the cricket one you see that you see how it is a little bit more vibrant know if you see that right it's definitely the green and the yellow they're all popping just a little bit more but that bad and these shirts are really inexpensive now I want to note that the Georgia actually has two different polyester cotton blends one has a lot of polyester and one has a lot of Cotton's so you'll want to check the label and don't just assume if you go to Walmart looking for George that you got the right one okay so this is the 65 polyester 30 percent cotton alright so this here is now I can you guys can definitely see a difference here right so this is the 40% polyester 60% cotton George brands this is also from Walmart and there these are like based I found them really close to each other and they're like in the men's section by the way I didn't really find any of these in the women's section but but I think this is a v-neck yeah this is a v-neck so I mean it still looks like a nice shirt but you can see that fading here right you can see that that it's just sort of more washed out right now note that how it looked when you first did it and how it looks now right so thing is is that even though it looks really good when you first make it if you're putting it on something that isn't able where the inks not able to bind with it you're gonna get this fading okay maybe you're okay with that but this is after one wash I don't know how it's going to look in Ted and washes or 50 washes it could get really light okay so keep that in mind and let's look at the last one which is 100% cotton so this is a huge difference I mean this is like pastel now so this is a hundred percent cotton now on the Left we can see that it came and faded it started to faded right which it kind of looks nice it has a like a retro look right it's totally cool but this is after one wash okay this is like super pastel now this is almost like something a baby might wear but the thing is is that after I feel really confident that after a few washes we're barely gonna be able to say this it's just gonna look like a mistake at that point so 100% cotton is not going to be a good choice to use with an fusible ink even though it might look okay when you first put it on after washing it it's just going to be a disappointment I really recommend that you pay attention to your polyester cap the higher you go up the more vibrant it gets and the longer it's going to last when you wash it right I mean look these look really awesome I mean this one I have no okay it's amazing I mean look at how that look that good in fact let's just compare this one to the cotton I mean look at the difference here guys that is a huge difference this is they're both have been washed exactly the same they were washed together so big big difference the more polyester you have the better it's going to look so hopefully that helps you guys and of course you can see that there's a lot of different shirts because the thing is is that I know that the cricket shirts aren't going to work for everybody they don't come in all the sizes they don't even have they don't even have sizes for like kids right now they just have the small through 2x in the women's and the men's and at my Michaels I couldn't even find it to X's so if you can find them I mean I think these shirts are the cricket shirts are really really amazing because they're stupid they don't even feel like polyester this one feels like pilot this one here this would definitely feels like polyester this their cricket shirts don't they're very soft there's something about the way that they're woven and the type of fibers that they're using it's making a difference so if the cricket shirt is available in your size and style get that and if it's not then use one of these alternatives okay alright so do you guys have any questions about these various white shirts before I switch over to the colored shirts because I did all of those and I would love it to show you those ginger says can we use 100% polyester yes totally this is 100% polyester this is right here it looks amazing it looks great it will work I believe it's going to work just as well as the cricket shirts too and really add just a little bit looks amazing it's very vibrant Peggy says I have a 100% polyester sheet that's too big for my bed I'm gonna have fun playing and you know something Peggy that's a great idea I thought about going to the fabric store and just getting a bunch of fabric in different sizes to test but I wanted to be able to show you actual t-shirts that you could purchase like whatever store because I know that you guys are looking for t-shirts alright so I think that OH Alex asks where is a hundred percent polyester shirt from this comes from Amazon this is the Hanes cool dry and this is a woman's shirt but they have them in this woman's v-neck so it's really nice fitted shirt but they also have them in men's and stuff I really like this this I've gotten this brand several times it is polyester it's like it has very very smooth rather than soft finish but hey maybe that's okay with you okay cool all right let's move on to the colored shirts here is the stack of colored shirts I got a whole bunch of colors now you'll note that they're mostly pastel because this is eight it's not vinyl it's ink and it's transparent ink it's not going to look good on like a navy blue shirt and we're gonna talk about that later don't worry it's going to look if you're gonna put it on to a colored shirt because you don't like white or whatever it's gonna look best on these light pastel colors okay otherwise it's just not going to be visible because it's transparent ink alright so we're gonna start with them 100% polyester shirt this is a 100% polyester shirt it's the same cool dry Hanes shirt that I showed you in the white one okay I got this from Amazon exact same shirt v-neck women's shirt can you see this white outline here this is where my piece of transfer me see if I have one that can show you so this is the fusible link transfer so you know it was on here like this so see the marking here so I've seen this show up on a number of people's shirts that they posted and I don't know why it does but it's there even after we washed it so you need to watch for this because maybe you're okay with this maybe you're not okay with this right but the color looks pretty good you can see how the blue basically is there's like no blue because it's not a blue shirt everything that's significant and also because this is transparent ink a lot of the colors are changing from what we would see and white to you know like this is supposed to be yellow but it looks green right so that's something to take into account right this should be pink and it looks like it's purple right but it transferred pretty well and it washed really well okay so this one has that box around it all right this one oh my gosh I really dislike this shirt this shirt came from Walmart and it's a very vibrant color don't wouldn't you say so I did this let's see if I can even show you I can and you know when we do in fusible ink we need to cut me to cover our mats so that the in fusible ink itself does not bleed through onto our pressing mats well look what this lovely shirt did it was it's so vibrant I washed these by the way it was so vibrant that it transferred its own ink to my pressing pad and now I will forever have to be careful this yeah so this one this is not sure that I'm gonna recommend to anybody but I found it at Walmart and it's 92 percent polyester 8% spandex and it's got this annoying box around it again from the transfer sheet I don't know what this is cause fraud by but I personally don't like it I don't like the way it looks at all so I would say this is a no-go yes yes Alex they were all pre-washed okay so here is the 80 percent polyester 20 percent cotton Athletics work shirt I found this at Walmart it was in the clearance section I don't even know if they still saw this but whatever it's like actually a tank top or a racerback shirt or something so I can't really see a white box around this one of course it's got a different texture to it actually came out really well you know it doesn't look like it faded very much maybe just the tiniest bit but not much it's pretty good and the colors are vibrant and amazingly the pink still transferred to this one I guess it was light enough I know no it's interesting but this one was actually pretty good so this one came from Walmart again so Rhonda says maybe the design can be cut closer to get rid of that scare get rid of the square and apply heat and use it beautiful heat tape yeah I think that's a possibility you would have to cut all the way through or trim around it and that might be a lot of work but here's the thing is that you'll notice that on other shirts you can't see it so it's something about I'm thinking it's something about the way this shirt is colored but I don't know for sure just taking a wild guess here this here is 65% polyester 35% cotton this is the same George brand that I showed you in the white shirts which i think is actually pretty a pretty good I think he's pretty they're really inexpensive and I don't know I think four or five dollars per shirt and they come in a lot of different sizes a lot of different sizes and different colors so I like this this has a tiny bit of fading but it's it looks really good to me still so I think this is a winner and I actually got a bunch of these so we could look at how the color transferred to these so that's the purple one and I'll slide these over see we can compare this is a blue one same exact shirt just different color so again it looks a lot better on this purple than it does on the blue the blue is definitely changing the transparent ink in a different way and that's significant if you are you know what color you're trying to decide I actually this isn't pink this is purple I don't know what color I said this is purple just that's clear and this is like a light blue the George brand is from Walmart and again it's important to note that they come in different they have some that have more polyester and some that have more cotton you want the ones with more polyester it really is going to make a difference here is another one and this is a it's kind of a orange a pink color I guess salmon we would call it call that and it looks you know I can see fading here it might be hard to see in the camera I'm looking at it from a different angle and I can kind of see it like at a 45 degree angle so I could see the fibers of the cotton shirt better still looks really good though I think that looks really good I think this is actually a good shirt so after testing it what six times I think I tested it six times okay so here so this here is a totally different shirt this is a Gildan shirt that I found I believe at Michaels maybe it was at Joanne's it was at one of the craft stores and it's 50% polyester and 50% cotton and it's blue so the design didn't transfer as well as it might have done in a lighter color a more Pinker color but it did transfer pretty well hard to say how long and I'll contain a hold up in the wash but it looks pretty good right now all right so here is the George brand that is less cotton less re less polyester and more cotton and while this looks this design it looks pretty good because this is such a light color it's pretty faded I don't know if I have one I could compare we can compare it to this pink one over here set these aside so here is this is a 80% cotton sorry 80% polyester and this one here is the 40% polyester and you can see that this is quite a bit more vibrant than this right so you know I mean but maybe you're ok with it maybe you're ok wearing your shirt for a few times and it's not that big of a deal maybe it's a special occasion shirt right I mean there's always possibilities here nothing is ever really you know if you really really like cotton more you know just wear your shirt a little less or you use it as a save it so this is I think this is actually still pretty I think it's gonna fade a lot more as you wash it though just so you know all right and let's look at 100% cotton that's been washed it looked a little better when we put it put it out initially this is what it looks like when it's been washed you can't even see the color at this point it's just kind of like some green and some brownish colors and I think that if we wash this like five five more times I bet it would be just barely a shadow something that was here once ginger says a solid and fusible ink would probably look good on the Gildan blue shirt you know so they're all they all of the in fusible links they're all transparent so if we had used purple it would look like this right if we had used green it would look like this so you can't this is actually sorry this is pink that purple sorry right so this is orange this is pink this is like red this is purple here and this is blue so you know I mean it's still going to take on the color underneath it so remember our color wheel and when we mix colors we're going to get these we're going to get a different color than what you expect when you put it onto something that's got the base color is this dark so keep that in mind okay alright so let's see yes so someone mentioned the black shirt so we're gonna talk about that because of course we tested a black shirt guys I said I would here is our black shirt mm-hmm and yes I put in fusible in cactus when I move this so this is got the design let's see if we can see this at all it has been washed you can kind of see right yeah the guys probably can't see that but I can kind of see a rectangle there gosh it's not even focusing it's like just black let's put this back on and give it something to focus on there truly is feasible in care we show you about where it went it's probably right about I'm gonna match it up to this rectangle it looks like it was right about here okay this is where I put it the thing is though infeasible and gets transparent so what happens when you put transparent anything I'm black we get this we get nothing this is what it looks like just don't even bother don't do this because it's a waste of your infusible ink it's not it's there literally is infeasible in canvas but because it's transparent you cannot see it okay but if anyone saw my preview image then you saw that I did have something on a black shirt okay and by the way this if you're curious this is a George shirt with 40% polyester okay alright so let's flip this shirt over so I can show you now I tried some different things first off I tried white flocking vinyl that I got it's like a so you can find that yes here it is I tried Caeser strip flock Pro HTV just I don't know just for the heck of it just see what would happen and I put the white on first and then after the white was away I applied it normally but you would normally apply heat transfer and then over the top of the white I put my infusible ink and as you can see it did indeed transfer right it's not go in the dark now but it did transfer and this has been washed it's still there guys it is still there so that was my first test to see if we get this in fusible ink on a black shirt now you might be wondering why on earth would anybody care just use vinyl and I agree you probably just wanted you to find out but if you just love the use the feeding patterns you just really want to put this on a shirt of your choice then these are our options so this is using the strip flock Pro HDTV that I found this at Michael's by the way I think there's actually a better product I think it's called sub flock and I think it's actually better at absorbing the sublimation ink so I haven't I don't have my hands on it yet but I have heard about it okay so this is um flocking HDTV but then Miranda who is my Miranda is my customer service angel she said that she saw i'm youtube that people were using glitter a heat transfer vinyl so i got some of that and this is what happened so this is white glitter heat transfer vinyl Julie says that I spray that know that this this is heat transfer vinyl this is vinyl so is this these are both vinyl and they come white like this so here is the white glitter and here is the the flock the flocking is like super like soft stuff right from like this seven days right you know the wallpaper that kind of [ __ ] so this started as white glitter heat transfer and I cut out my heart in the same mean of the same heart and I put it on to the black shirt in the normal way that you put on heat transfer nothing special and then I took my my infusible ink transfer and I put it right on top of the white glitter heat transfer and I did I follow the normal directions for pressing it so I believe I did this at 385 degrees for 40 seconds which is what I did all of these shirts at by the way and this is what I got and doesn't this look amazing so this has been washed and it still looks to me as good as it did when I put it on it did not fade it on this one faded this one did not fade this one looks really really good I think that this white so if you really just really want to put invisible eight onto a black or navy blue or a dark purple shirt then this is what you should do put some white glitter heat transfer vinyl and by the way this is the cricket brand this is um we just got bought this down at our Joanne's that's five minutes from a house I actually said Greg a prank I need some white glitter heat transfer vinyl he's like okay he did it for me thank you Greg and then I put this on here and it worked so this is not my original idea I think that this existed long before we had infeasible ink because I bleach I went and looked it up on YouTube and people have been putting doing this for sublimation ink for years okay so this is not I'm not taking credit for this idea but thank you Miranda for letting me know about this so yeah so if you really want to use a dark shirt Becky says did the glitter show through yeah you can tell it's very pretty actually let me show you I said we can get this closer and then light here can you guys see the glitter see isn't that pretty I think it's really pretty is it really the glitter actually makes the colors pop a little bit more so and someone had concerns that it would wash right out but didn't for me the flocking did but not this this looks great so there we go alright so I'm gonna switch back over to me and I'm gonna see if you guys have questions okay alright awesome so let's see so Stephanie says I just joined this live stream and I've tried the infusible in kind of mint green shirt and it came out beautiful awesome I'm super glad to hear that I've been seeing a lot of people using pastel shirts that looks great remember the key is the higher the polyester count the better is going to look and one thing I want to note as we move down from into the higher cotton shirts I noticed more scorching going on the cotton does not like that super high temperatures at the at the links that we need to go to for in fusible ink and when I did the 100% cotton shirt I saw weird brown marks show up on my shirt and I want to see if they came out in the wash okay so this is a hundred percent cotton shirt you know doesn't really I don't really see looks like a lot of it might have washed out it doesn't look too maybe just a little bit I can kind of see on the sides just a tiny little bit if I wasn't looking for this I wouldn't be able to see any scorching so it actually would have the discoloration did come out when we washed it that's good so if you're seeing discoloration in your cotton shirts which probably shouldn't be using guys but if you want to use them anyways try washing them to see if you can get that out just keep that in mind so if it scorches it's too cotton just doesn't like it that hot for that lot Lutie says do you think it would work better on cotton with the glitter first yep yep if you really want to use have a hundred percent cotton shirt in but you really want a fusible ink because you love those patterns put that white glitter HTV on the shirt and then put your fusible link transfer on it one tip I have for that is I noticed that as we heat the fusible entry four sheets they shrink just a little bit so if you tape it down in the exact spot you want it to go your shirt kind of been shrinks along with it instead of it shrinking without the shirt and then it looks at mal matches up better and it stays in position better so definitely use the cricket heat transfer tape when you are putting the in fusible ink transfers on top of the white glitter htb yes I washed all of these shirts first because we don't want to worry about whether we have sizing in them or anything like that just it's so they're you know there's kind of like differing opinions about whether you should wash them first cricket by the way doesn't say that we need to wash these first for infusible ink so don't think that matters but you know it helps with like shrinking and stuff the only time that you might not want to wash a shirt forces if you're playing to sell it because it never looks new after you washed it right so instead of get ones that are pre sized you know so they're already black preshrunk and then but don't wash them and then you know it looks better that's what I hear at least I don't sell my shirts or anything like that necie says is there an easy way to weed the invisible ink I think it's actually really easy to weed I did all of these hearts and there's like Oh a lot of them superfast if you use the bend and crack method you know so you're just kind of bending it and making sure all the edges are lifting up it actually comes off really easily and if you watched my other videos you can see me actually weeding the the transfer sheets and how it's different right it's different than how we weed vinyl and I like it a lot better Vicky says does the glitter after the imputable ink feel like vinyl nope it feels like glitter it feels like um I mean just touch it again it feels you know so you know the way glitter feels it's got almost like a kind of like sandpaper II feel because it's got all the little glitter parts embedded in it that is what it feels like Janet says what time and temperature did you use for these shirts I used that I used crickets easy press heat guide for all of four bases you know I used it for cricket shirts so only when it gives me a time for so I use the exact same time and temperature for all of them which was three hundred eighty five degrees am i easy press two for forty seconds you could also have done your easy press one at what would it be three hundred and sixty degrees because it's the highest it goes up so probably a little longer I just don't happen to know what that is but Cricut has an excellent heat press guide that you would just use to determine what that would be thank you Joe I'm really happy that you like my testing I'm checking for more questions to see if you guys have any more questions before I wrap up tonight this is a great time to throw them out there for us Lori says what do you do with a different heat settings for vinyl and then infuse oblique so I simply followed the heat transfer settings for vinyl and once it was in place I let it cool a little bit so you know it was more you know wasn't like still you know in fact you have to wait until the glitter is cool to even pull off the backing anyways and when I put I didn't had no issues it worked I simply used the same settings for them fusible ink that I use for all the other shirts when I put it on top of the glitter so I didn't even worry about it because it was a test right it was okay to try it and if it didn't work then oh well we just try it again so but it worked so I used the normal settings for glitter heat transfer vinyl and then I use the normal settings for infeasible ink on top of that white glitter Megan says do we use the butcher paper so I made a lot of t-shirts I did not use two sheets of butcher paper for brand new sheets of butcher paper for each of these shirts so I found that my butcher paper wasn't transferring nothing was getting transferred to it I was having no issues and I I think I only ended up using like four sheets for all of these shirts so I reused it I always checked it to make sure that I didn't see any anything being transferred to it that would then transfer to one of my new shirts but it didn't so it was fine Ginetta says I was hoping it would test depends my experience there's no difference between how the pens and a transfer sheets go on to materials if you are curious about how the pens I have a whole video on that right so you can just watch that video but I've seen no difference and how they transfer they transfer the same it's the same ink it's just ones coming out of the pen and ones on a transfer sheet but it looks the same once we transfer it it acts we transfer it the same way it looks the same so it wasn't necessary to do all of the testing Gina asked if the white transfer the white glitter was stiff like final yes it is because it's white it's white but it's white glitter vinyl that's there the white cleared of metal doesn't go away so it has that same it's not super stiff but there's definitely something there it's not like the awesomeness that is in fusible ink where it's totally weightless right you still it feels like vinyl with that's been colored that's basically what while we're doing here all right let me just get that at the bottom let's see someone mentioned parchment paper no do not use parchment paper parchment paper has a coating on it what your paper does not if you use parchment paper or wax paper you can transfer that coating to your shirt I have seen it done and it looks bad don't do it guys don't waste your shirts use butcher paper you can get it on Amazon very inexpensively I have a giant roll of it let me show ya I will put a menu remember my team can put the link this is my big roll of butcher paper it's gonna last a really really long time it was really inexpensive you can get it pretty sure her people say they got theirs at Walmart or their local grocery store but you want white butcher paper don't substitute in this case it's going to be a disappointment it's not freezer paper either guys it's not freezer paper put your paper freezer paper has a coating at it in fact the most famous one has a plastic coating on it you do not want to transfer that to your shirt what's your paper it doesn't have the coating you want that yesthank right ginger says put your paper parchment paper and freezer paper are all different it's important that you use the right one because that coating will transfer I've seen it happen okay I think I have gotten everyone's questions just double-checking Ossie says can you use a heat press yes you can I just don't have one so I use my easy press so we use an easy press Mary says where would I find the video about the Pens well I'll tell you what if you go to my youtube channel at youtube.com slash C / Jennifer maker all of my videos are there tons of them and that's where you'll find my video about the Pens as well as my video about that fusible link tote bag and the infeasibility t-shirt and infusible inks in general like I have I think I have 5 or 6 videos on a fusible links at this point yep I mean that's I think I got them all so I want to remind everybody that we're still having our summer maker giveaway so we are giving away a Cricut

ideas and I love hearing your ideas for things and oh one more question Stephanie says did I use dryer sheets nope you're not supposed to use any dryer sheets Gregg did the washing and drying did you use dryer sheets nope no dryer sheets because that's what the instructions say the instructions say to turn them inside out wash them and cold inside out and then tumble dry low no dryer sheets no bleach and no fabric softener and that's what we did so Mal detergent right yes Gregg says mild detergent okay I think that's it thank you everybody for being here tonight thank you for your questions for putting up with our technology issues I always appreciate it and I hope to see you next week and I think that's it thank you so much for joining me remember if you can tell me what you'd like to make I can show you how to make it until next time you [Music]", "QkOiffXudZI": "[Music] [Applause] hey guys I'm Tori with Bella canvas heat press is a really easy technique you can use on all of our products so today we're at stalls the leading manufacturer in the heat press category to show you how to heat press on a few of our top-selling fabrics so we've been doing our YouTube channel for about a year now and get a lot of questions about heat press so can we go back and talk about just the basics of what it is the press is basically a vinyl or a substrate that has a adhesive on the back then you're able to use a heat press and press to a garment so who's most likely to be your heat press customer when you're doing heat press you need to keep in mind that you're going for a low quantity quick turnaround he prefers vinyl doesn't really replace screen printing there so to speak but it does give you that capability of turning around on the spot or within a matter of a couple days what's the difference heat pressing on different types of fabric keep in mind time temperature and pressure is key cotton very resilient so you can use a lot of different times and temperatures with your synthetics you have to make sure your temperatures are on the lower side so you're not scorching that garment are causing and breathing it back so this way and you guys actually did a lot of testing for us on our different products and our different fabrications and we have a whole resource on our website which will include so today I have our 100% heirloom cotton our tri-blend and our Heather CDC so will you take me through the process of how each one keypresses differently absolutely okay so what we're gonna do today on this one on the hundred percent cotton is we are going to quit fashion come on but we're gonna try to keep the lightweight feel of the garment and the light no feel of the application in place so I'm gonna sleeve the garment get it lined up make sure we're on here straight which with the bell of canvas not being tubular sewn it's fantastic it helps us get it lined up there that's better so after sleeve in my garment I'm gonna go ahead and give it a quick press make sure that my temperature is good get all the wrinkles and stuff out of the garment I'm gonna place my fashion film on top make sure it's lined up correctly and what temperature are you doing so fashion film goes on at 320 for 15 seconds and it's a warm peel it will feel hard so next we're gonna do our Heather CDC which is 52% heirloom combed and ring spun cotton and 48 percent poly so how does that different than 100% so here we're gonna put Premium Plus on your product which will enable it to stretch as much as as the garment does and not hinder it it's very lightweight goes on under low temperature and we're gonna keep from scorching the product and can you tell me about the difference between this premium plus versus a fashion faux the fashion film is your all-around product your all-around products gonna go on just about anything and you know not give it a real bit stretch but the price point is correct your premium plus still out a great price point as a premium pride allows the stretch capabilities of the garment we're gonna give this one a couple of seconds before we peel because it is a peel warm to cold I'll peel it off and we're done so again great product stretchable with a good feel so finally we have our tri-blend which is 50% polyester 25% heirloom comes in ring spun cotton and twenty-five percent rayon so can you tell me what is different about this yes your try blends are very very popular and kind of taking over the market so to speak because of the soft feel you get with the synthetics and the rayon in the garment it's it's a fabulous product so with the rayon in in it as a tribal and it makes it very very difficult because the rayon burns and scorch is easier than anything else it gets that soft feel but then again you know we worry about decoration so what we've done today is we've added a lower heating element so we're gonna actually heat it from the lower side or the middle of the shirt and just kind of touch it up on the top so if we do have any scorch you know we do have any problems then it would be on the inside of the shirt and not the outside of the shirt so to speak the temperature on the top we're gonna do it at 250 to prevent that scorching on the bottom we're gonna go up to a full 300 degrees right we're gonna use Premium Plus which is our premium product of course premium shirt premium product this is a warm - a cool peel so I'm just gonna pull it off a little bit because again lower heating element and peel it off so to summarize on our 100% cotton lose the fashionfilm we applied it at 320 degrees for 12 to 15 seconds on the Heather we use our premium plus at 275 degrees for 7 to 10 seconds and on a tribe lens we use our premium plus 300 degrees on the bottom with using our lower heating element 250 on our top heating element for 7 to 10 seconds don't forget to subscribe for more content like this we come out with a new video every week [Music]", "Byxu8t88O4k": "what's good youtube today real quick video i know i wanted to go ahead and make me a a shirt little halloween shirt or whatnot and uh i wanted to do sublimation but i wanted to do it on black cotton so but today what i'm going to try to execute is the cotton subs box uh tack down method i believe that's what it's called uh shout out to techbot customs and er thing like that i checked out his video you know i mean so it's a little different way to do the uh cotton sub so you want to see that sit back throw your seat belt and hold on to the wrap baby and we'll be right back but first go ahead and like comment subscribe for your girl yeah i'm gonna get right back with you y'all [Music] i believe that's a good little city let me turn off some light in here get it nice and bright all right that's good right yeah so check me out y'all real quick like i said um what you're gonna need for this method you need some spray adhesive got that tomorrow we came ready um i got um my image a little scary got jason um a texas chainsaw i believe freddie and uh michael over there they dangerous all right we gotta get the cotton too i ain't even prepared see i just wanted to show you all this i should have put some lotion on my knuckles while i came in here um bear with me one moment let me find my concept i just had them all right so got my cotton sub here my whole sheet make sure this ain't gonna cut because i cut don't join you know you gotta cut it say that on tremendous because you can use them yes you come all right um boom so what you want to do we're going to spray this paper right here this paper right here i'm going to spray with this right here you with me you're picking up what i'm throwing down baby but yeah i like miss y'all nothing heavy and then what you want to do i'm gonna get i got this box of uh trash under here a box is a better to have like when you're doing vinyl and something make it use a bunch of paper and carry your sheets and it's just better but anyway so over here spray over my box don't be too close to it though like miss y'all don't snap do not snap do you hear me all right all right i think i'm good all right i might hold these you don't understand the first time i did this um because i have tried it i messed up because i guess i missed it and like globs of the adhesive came out but you want to put this smooth side down now this part you got to be really patient with you because it's tacky so it's going to want to grab it so he's got to be quick with it once you get it up there you just kind of smooth that baby out you don't smoke but you just want to make sure it's flat y'all get all your creases out you got to be patient on this part trying to hurry up because i don't want this to be a long video i want to be like oh hey watch out uh you did video she got there for three thousand years i mean right now all right this isn't even this is looking more promising than i did the first time all right so once you got that smoothed on there like that got this move great yeah what they call i believe is the guillotine guillotine cutter also with his head yeah but um then you just cut your touch your image straight image boom i come down a few more times with the cotton so just to make sure i got any straggles see i got a straggler right there but if that happened i just i just cut it man no big deal you know i mean i can admit that cutting some can be it's very um fragile so it can be difficult to work with but once you get your little method going you'll be ah you need [Music] this one boom all right so i got a little bit of white up there that i need to get i don't want no white no way to that's why i like these guillotines all right oh i ain't get it it's hard to cut fabric though unless you get actual fabric scissors all a right stragglers i just chop chop chop chicken chop chappie choppy baby all right so that's what i got y'all that's the cotton sub stuck to the paper face up cotton so you need so we're going to see y'all get the heat press go ahead and get my little middle line going and what nizzle this uh technique with the cotton subs you know what i mean the only thing is we just gotta find a better way to to cut the cotton subs without it um fraying yeah you know what i mean other than that i still love the product still going to support tech but i like what they doing over there love let's see my foot was growing yeti all right so get my ruler y'all know me lay that sucker down but we got to make sure she even on that thing come over this way actually look good to me y'all i said we pressing and see how it goes i'm gonna press um i'm gonna do my heat press not even ready this heat press take forever to heat up audio smear all right give me a minute i will be about to get a phone because i'm gonna press this because it's it's a dark image i'm gonna press it at 460 seconds for lighter garments i like to go a little less time than that i've learned but we'll be back once all the heat presses that you want to come out and play or whatnot i'll be right back all right y'all it's close enough we had 395 which is fine we're gonna go for 60 seconds see how this dude gear did [Music] but hold up wait you don't think i might i want to go ahead maybe some socks to match it man at least to go away to keep up with the thing i'm gonna do that too all right here we go one thing i do love about this heat press is it opens up like effortlessly alright mom with the truth y'all mmm okay okay okay okay now me i like to uh i'll be overkilling it so i like to do another little just frost the top of it a little bit so just make sure it's on the shirt good not too long [Music] okay okay y'all can't see it it's too dark i'll tell you what let's make these socks right and then i'll show y'all i'll show you how to finish product now i did see that's what i talked about the cutting it you can be left with stuff like that i mean you can easily take a fabric marker today you know what i mean but that's the only problem i got with it other than that man it the outcome is dope it's super dope but let's make these socks real quick and then i'll show you how the shirt these my little my practice socks see i i got a little little plug on the low little socks the practice jumps you know what i mean but when i usually go i usually go sickly socks when i for my customers when i'm just testing out my socks i do these i mean these are good socks too get me wrong but my customers used to the silky side so but y'all know it's like i love making socks if you ask me what's my favorite thing to print right now oh please believe what will say soft please believe that i like pretty songs all right i want the people that always got a song in my head it's probably annoying for some people but you know [Applause] i like his own okay all right i probably should have backed off my pressure because i got my sock jigs in there but what was this um while that's cooking i'm gonna go ahead and take my fabric marker and hit these little points right here i better than my first one all right there'd be so much smoke i don't know why they always do that on the side like that all right so y'all know y'all got to flip it flip and roll who they're gonna be hot though prepare well see don't do this at home kids you know i'm just dangerous you can wait till they

discuss fashion and tech here and today we're talking about or rather on a journey to discover the perfect black t-shirt now if you already know this channel you know my favorite color to wear is black especially when it comes to my basics and over the years I have tried the hell of different t-shirts and I feel like I'm getting really close to find the perfect one but I would love your help in deciding so in this video I have six different teams from my closet from my drawer he's all been washed and dried from $5 all the way up to 95 I'm gonna try them on for you we're gonna go over talked about fit weight how things feel and the quality points and then hopefully by the end of the video we have a verdict [Music] now first up we have the unique little dry package teeth this is gonna cost you about five or six us and it was my favorite shirt up until recently now starting with the good things the price point is good the weight is great it's kind of like a poly-cotton blend so if you're really hot and run hot like I do when you sweat it dries up really quickly but for some reason recently they've been getting a little sloppy with the sizing like this is supposed to be a large on me and usually again I've been buying these charts for years but for some reason this one fits like a medium and a half like when I first put it on it was a tiny bit sluggish but it was fine but after watching and drying it it shrunk up on me so you see it's too short the sleeves are hella tight right now and it just doesn't fit me comfortably so I haven't really worn this shirt in a while but it used to be that you can wash and dry this and then fit fine so I don't know what's going on with these but they definitely are being replaced coincidentally by another shirt within the same company and that leads me to our next t-shirt the UT from Uniqlo it's gonna cost you about $10 USD but it's a total upgrade from the t-shirt from before the weight is amazing I love how this shirt feels when you have an on is very substantial you can tell a huge jump in quality from the dry package one from the previous shirt - this one right here the banded collar right there on the tee is a great touch you just like a fold over piece of fabric that makes a world of a difference as far as the collar goes it's nice and tight but not too tight and the only feedback I have is that the sleeves are a little bit loosey okay even when I cuff them there's still a little loose for me but I think this is a good trade-off to have a way heavier tee way more substantial tee and I would also say it's a little long ish but again not a big deal for me this is a great shirt everything's being consistent so far I've been buying these for the last few months and all the sizes are consistent and it stays black for a long time with the color fastness is really strong so thumbs up on this t-shirt I'm liking it so far now moving on up the price here we have this texture t-shirt by Zara now this is gonna be something you'll find here throughout the year they have different ones all the time and they'll run you around like 30 bucks and I love these t-shirts because they almost add a sophistication to your outfit so if you do want to wear a t-shirt but you want the same appeals like having a thin sweater or something a little bit more refined on then throw one of these on it's gonna look perfect and a little bit more dressy winter time I put an overcoat over it and it looks great or the spring summer when it's too hot for a jacket I can throw that on with like a pair of chinos or some slacks and like some minimal sneakers and have a great smart casual look that again it's a little bit more sophisticated than a regular t-shirt now I would say right now after watching like it's barely long enough before I actually watched you like the first where they fit perfectly bend is shrinking a little bit after washing and hang drying it but the sleeves are the great lip you don't have to really roll them but also it's a great t-shirt off the rack I suggest you look into them if you want something a little bit more elevated now this next t-shirt is in the premium category and it's by a brand called a sketch this is gonna cost you about 45 bucks but in my opinion for a premium t-shirt it is worth the price one of the first great things about a sket is you can pick a various sizing when you pick your size meaning that when I got a large I can pick a short a regular or along it since I am 6 1 then I have a long one and it fits me great now the sleeves are a little bit longer than I would like but I'm already asleep rolling guys so that's fine when you roll them they fit perfectly as far as like looseness and width around my arms it's great and if you look at the neckline I have that same overlapping hem similar to the Uniqlo you t-shirt but it's a little bit thinner and again it makes a shirt feel a little bit more substantial and elevates it in my opinion the fabric weight itself is kind of uh I would say medium heavy kind of a medium and a half as far as weight not super heavy and thick like I would like it like the Uniqlo $10 you shirt but it is very substantial and it does feel like a premium t-shirt so when you spend 45 bucks us on it you don't feel like you spin it much money so I will at least try one of these if you have Tim t-shirts in your closet maybe these are like two or three of them but I do recommend that this would be a good staple to have now as you move up the price tiers in the premium category we have a brand called Vince with your t-shirt coming in at $95 and the reason why I put premium in quotes is because the only thing premium about this is the price point this is a regular shirt it doesn't fit any different from any other insurance this list the weight is similar to the five dollar Uniqlo one it's like kind of a light medium ish weight so it feels a little I don't know not ninety five dollars it's kind of faded now and it's more of a gym shirt it's not really special everything else on this list right now I recommend way more than this t-shirt so now that we're double all the expensive shirts you're moving on to the very last one that I really believe belongs in a category all of this home it's from a company called lot it's more of a like a subscription service what I love about the subscription services you not only give me clothing you're getting accessories you're getting self-care items and everything is black black tees black crude names black pants black shoes and even black tutu brushes but as far as this t-shirt goes one of the best things about it that I love that is personalized with my name on it look at this it's a beautiful thing and the quality of the t-shirt is also very awesome I would say the weight of this t-shirt is probably the same as a premium weight from the skin team and I will say the only thing that I don't like about these is that I get it only once every other one instead of every month because I really love these t-shirts I wish I got I can give more I can get them in bulk but I just can't only can get one every other month but as far as thing and everything it's very comfortable I'm a big fan of it so I had to put it in this video but I would love to know from you what do you feel like is the best one on this list I would love to have been asked it cut but in the Uniqlo UT weight I love the heavy team but I would like a less Lucifer arm and more customizable when I pick it if you enjoyed this video please hit that thumbs up button it

me to do a tutorial on how to sub on cotton on glitter and that one so that's why I'm doing this video today if you want to learn more about my group please check us out on Facebook it's called Brown girls crash with cricket and on that group and in that group we just do so many things together we talk about the tutorials that I make here on YouTube we discussed our projects if they have any questions if I can help I help out and everyone in the group helped out awesome so if you'd like to join that group you would like to join that group go ahead on Facebook and look for us this called Brown girls crafts with Cricut and only thing I actually do is so please answer the questions after the questions and then I will approve you to the group okay let's get started with this shirt I am on my macbook air and for this project you will me I'm gonna be use a scissor sizer glitter this HDTV vinyl I'm going to use some black 100% cotton t-shirt I'm going to be using the image that I bought from Coco twins are you gonna do the heat press put your paper transfer tape I think that's it alright let's get started I'll go ahead and go to design that's Cricut I'll try to get some to look at while I talk that's quick website to show you two new little mini aren't they have which i think is gonna waste some money well it might be good for um hats I think that'd be a good but I'm sure T real quick what I'm talking about it but it's $69 I have the smart I have all three of the presses I mean I have all three of the easy presses and it's the mini one and $69 and it's good for hats and um probably bowtie I mean Bosley beekeeper bows but I don't think I'm getting that let me know about low if you have it I rating what you think about it and then um comment below okay let me go ahead and push these I new project okay all right be not my project I'm already have the item that I want to I already have the image that I want to use let me go back to my projects click on that and I already got it I didn't do anything to it I just uploaded it some go here to push customize like I said own thing only step I'm missing is when you go to basically upload and you go into your files and define your own SVG or PNG whatever you want to use and I have another video on that also how to upload PNG is how to change your colors SVG's and videos are all that so I'm not gonna go below okay I have this beautiful woman right here I love her I love her and you reach my chose reason why I purchased this SVG is because of the colors except the mission it's all about the colors to me well it's also because sublimation when you really can't feel it and your shirt so I love that because if I know you can feel it but something mission you can't feel it so I really love some elimination because of two things you can't feeling on your shirt you don't feel like anything else and then plus the colors are so vibrant so when I seen this on Coco twin attack comics I have I gotta have her I gotta have her the colors are vibrant they're pretty this colorful and I've been doing lot of sublimation not my civilization being really like black and white and a few colors I want to show my colors out on my cell emission printer that's why I purchased I'm gonna put her on everything I'm gonna do this shirt today I'm gonna do another video of me putting her on a mug yeah she's gonna be on everything I'm thinking about putting her in the bag too she's beautiful I love the colors I need to find more color more images with colors like this they have a lot of cartoon colors a lot of cartoon characters with a lot of colors but I love to find my african-american women with different colors and I can change the colors on this SVG you could change colors like I said I have a video that shows you how to change the colors of SVG's so I'm not gonna do all that today I don't think I'm gonna do today is size this up and put on the show you got to put on the shirt okay first of all let's go ahead and do this the sighs wood creaking to cut and print which is caught we have to do a cut print for sublimation with Cricut so we have to go by the size and the size is just 0.75 by 9 okay I'm gonna do 6.75 go ahead and go across like this right here 6.75 go over okay that's the picture right there i know ii said i just don't like i hate that I have to cook with um that side I wish I could do a bigger footprint could but I'm still trying to figure out how to um I can do it you can't print bigger on um silhouette but I don't have a cutter to cut my glitter bigger you know I'm saying so I have to do this size because my glitter has to be good okay on my Cricut so yes that's it like you say you if you want that you can't print this bigger if you're just doing to the mission but since I'm using glitter I might just use that size right now until I figure it up to figure out the other ways of doing it then put the words I'm going to make it bigger I'm gonna make the words vital okay this is my shirt since my own pictures that I'm gonna make my words I'll stay in my picture so I can have some my picture so my shirt can be evened out let's see okay everything said now I have the UM the width six point seven to seven and then um the height is seven point seven three eight I like the way cuz if I go any I could go down to nine but it's gonna it's not gonna look right so I like the way it look like like that then I have her on the words this is gonna be my no on black and this is gonna be glitter one black okay so I need to do is go here so I got my size everything together I need to go ahead and duplicate her make sure you have everything situated before you duplicate it cuz you do not want to change you okay so now this is a cutting print files I got a highlighting right here it says cut and print okay and then this one also says cut and print but I do not want this to be a cut and print I want this to be a cuts okay just so right here it's flattening and you sit down here she's flattened and she's ready to get cut pretty cooked just right here now I'm siding her and I'm going to go ahead and go to see it's print right there I'm gonna no field I'm go ahead and wheeled her see how that was just the UM cooked so it's gonna cut around her butter arrange and sent to the front so you can see just what I'm gonna do when I know my shirt this is how it's gonna be okay cannot sub on 100% cotton or dark colors unless you put it on vinyl first on white glitter vinyl okay I tried to so I tried to do the super fine it was a little bit too dark so just keep it with the white vinyl the white glitter vinyl okay look at like I said before this is gonna be my white glitter I'm it's red but it's this color I wanted to do it you want me to put it white I can put it right someone be confusing imma go ahead and change the color up here to make it white okay okay but this doesn't matter because I'm whatever vinyl I put in my cutter that's what's gonna cut out okay for all you're a newbie still all the ones that you know just started couldn't using the cookie get kind of confusing so now that you see over here you have the cutting print for her and you have this is um welded and she's flattened you have to flatten it to cut and print or to something mate you hit the flattener okay so now I'm gonna work with this down here this is just a cut so you see this this um go here so make sure that this is ready it should be welded and it's just a it's a cut so let's go ahead and see um this is this was already image so it's not words that I made this was a SVG already so it's not really ready to cut okay let's go ahead him to make it as you see right here she's on a white sheet of paper because this is going to be sublimation printer I have two printers you can use both print you can use the same printer for each you gotta have one sublimation printer if he does information you have to have a regular printer if you do a regular cut and print okay we're just gonna be sent to my sublimation printer and then you see this mat this is gonna be cut on my silver glitter I think this is gonna be cut when you know what I changed this to white I'm gonna change this to white because I'm going to be using um black shirts when you go ahead and cancel that and go back and change this so even though I could have left it black cos might like I said doesn't matter but I won't let you so you won't be confused I'm gonna change this to white I'm thinking about putting your own white glitter also okay cuz I'm using a black shirt okay go back to this okay so everything set this is one to my printer this is going to not both of these are going to my cutter and they're sitting on the same mat so I'm gonna worry about having two different mats with these to make sure it even so I won't um it's good over since we want I can say be some vinyl cuz Rhino ain't cheap y'all I know is not cheap okay so you have to mirror because you're putting this on heat you have to mirror both of them so it's clear to mirrored this cuz you're something mating and this is on heat two side mirror that also okay all righty so let me go ahead and get my sublimation everything printed out and I'll be back okay I just want to show you something real quick I got my image RVD cut up I mean print it out from my printer from my own sublimation printer and then I'm gonna show you this when you put down the UM vinyl the glitter bottom make sure you put the shiny side down on the mat okay I'm gonna show you how to yard first so y'all know make sure you put it the shiny side down on the mat make sure it's straight make sure you have a nice sticky mat so will not be moving by from the printer I want to show you that real quick okay and then why this is cutting my to me just cutting their words and then the body parts of the mayor the bottom layer of her I'm gonna go ahead and cut her out besties I'm gonna take this to the printer also I had the printer cut this out also okay and these black registration marks is what keeps the UM Cricut let you know how to print it out so let me go ahead and show you this real quick I already sent it to the printer and I was talking to send it to the cutters it actually where you want to send it to and they already noticed it right here number one it says it's already been printed okay so now it's time to cut it and I'm going to go ahead and send it with paper instead of cardstock I'm gonna put use paper okay and there's a paper I just basically took mine went to my finger and I turned my knife to paper okay so now you know the sitting thinking that that I put loaded into the mat after I put the paper on the mat downloaded then it's gonna cut it out alrighty there she is I got her on a mat this mat ought to be that sticky cuz you know with the paper tears really stands we're gonna show you all the process so you can know how to do it I was gonna skip these process and just go straight through it but I'm gonna show it to you because I already have this process already done I'm one of my printing cut videos but I'm go ahead and go through it again okay I put it on this kind of say I put on paper settings the arrows going because they're telling me go ahead and push the arrow catch they don't push the button [Music] it's so busy you think I'm doing a pretty cook but I'm not well I am but I'm gonna be doing some of the mission also okay so are you thinking this is a prank oh okay now I get the image out of the UM cutter it's cut and it's the same way deal stickers and everything else to cut and print okay that's it out now I'm going to discov I know it's the second step you have to do okay so I make sure this is on a mat upside down like I said it's shiny side down I'm good to my computer okay so now that we've done this already which is it's done today check your stance it's completed it's print and cut so now we got to go down to here to the cut and I gotta change my settings back over to vinyl you know what this is winter vinyl so make sure you change it to glitter vinyl so that's custom because it is tougher you need to get a tougher cut with vinyl okay and I have my I have my binary little already favorite some way to push glitter okay then I'm gonna go ahead and push the button and it's ready to cook and I was always home I met it to give it a little tug so after that now I gotta push the see here like to see my computer southern is dead is cutting and I back at this when this pretty everything cook I just have to read everything I'll show you that real quick to already have a video on how the weed I'm go ahead and show you again so you can all see you just be one quick process for you I'm gonna take my little scraper thing and just trying to pull on the paper pull it up okay now you just go ahead and poke around a picture how about I do it this way better huh hold it down with the best way you can I really want to test the ink on the other side and they put it would be much more vibrant when we um to be sublimated okay a little earring out of here so now I'm just gonna cut around the image stuff to stay with with my nose I can okay and I'm also gonna separate the image from the words okay okay so let's go ahead and read out this glitter Whedon glitter is not too hard so let me go ahead and do this with y'all to see me do it you can't see the camera because it's white for the best way to read glitter it's a good go from the back of course just pour a little part closer to the ears and just pour it all around it you can certainly be tough with glitter cuz it's so deep you keep on pulling that pieces of it all I like it I like this image because it's not too many cuts in it it's just not a round surface but it's not too many you know cut better to do this when you trying to even it up on the arm Matt it's gonna be better to do it this way let me go here to lead out my words my phrase around it just start from the corner get your little piece wrap it and put yankees you can be able just tear it off okay you said your perfect setup is he ever seen the camera with a pen john wetton is by now but I'll try to make sure I see the full effect in the camera so sorry about that okay and I go down and I'm gonna go ahead and see some spots again take over here the little letters and Gert y'all I was right on the money I almost thought I had to cut these this bird over again but I didn't make sure you have enough I know very sticky in here don't thing I don't like about I'm simply made known by no because you can feel it you can feel the vinyl on the bottom on the back of the arm sublimation it's like a patch patchy feeling like a vinyl of course regular glitter vinyl and some permission is just so much is so soft and you'll have to worry about me feeling anything but guess what you got a do if you want to do it on dark colors and tighten tighter percent cotton shirts you have to do it like this you gotta get that patchy feeling on the back of it okay back Lord and still worthy I'm gonna get my he pressed together situated I did this shirt for my son and I use my mini press on that my Cricut easy press on this so I let me go ahead and just try to do this new one then just this project on my impress this is my first time using my heat press before so the mission on black uncle later okay I made this with my son and I like it I just my first one time doing it it's been a while and I see what you can tell when you um don't have the eye and a half together right here under the shirt so it kind of faded a little bit which is fine steel you see how down on glitter yeah outlined in that it's his shirt and this vinyl that's just regular vinyl oh my shirt today I'm going to be using the UM glitter vinyl okay so let's want to show you how that and not it's prepped his shirt first thing we need to do is go ahead and press it no first thing we need to do is go ahead and get the lint roller you got a little flip it based you can see a lot on black okay we'll see all that and I ever see that out here I'm glad I did that um shake it and press it get all the heat and moisture out of it using a medium shirt and skilled skilled in 100% cotton go ahead and get more straps with about five seconds sorry I got the window open like I said I had to let the fume dust in his heat press and it's kind of loud outside from the highways right there okay when you just have the mission you supposed to put butcher paper in between a shirt but I'm not gonna do that because we're stepping on top of glitter so it would not bleed through the glitter I'm not gonna put any butcher paper between the shirt okay well but I will put the foot put your paper on top of the shirt okay the first thing we gotta do is go ahead and set up our glitter always do three inches below for them a little ruler right there a bit more now you see how the glitter paper if you're your first time using literacy how it's already have this contact paper just ink paper on there and you don't have to even use whichever when you good or you can just use that but I'm gonna use anybody's to protect my heat press that's perfect I feel good now put the words down right here and make sure when you put the word down do not let the plastic touch each other so I want to give you kind of close to the body so I'm gonna cut around here so you can get a little close to it on the right when it works too far from the image okay now I have it on the heat press I'm go ahead and put my put your tip on top of it I'm gonna go ahead put my boot up camp on top of it and go ahead and press it for like ten seconds four hundred to ten seconds if you can um just to get that glitter to stay stick one for little eyes oh I don't do I just do ten seconds just get that glitter down 400 for ten seconds I'll do 15 400 for 15 seconds now let it cool for a little bit I'm gonna bring it over here on table because I want the cool before I put the picture on there because I don't want the picture to fade off one the ink on the glitter before I put it on the heat press okay bring it over here let it cool off a little bit see I just pull it off there's the glitter I'm gonna lift that one the word but if so won't do to gonna put that back on the top of the word when I put the ink on here okay so it's cooled off a little bit I think it's good yes be cooled off real quick and I'm going to put it on sublimation on top yeah he's gonna do the same thing my son shirt did it on paper is going on top but the shirt which is going to show so next time it's got to cut the glitter a little bit bigger cuz it does shrink and I heard getting a few videos to that it does shrink but oh well there's a tape of beer so I won't move I'm gonna cover this back up on the heat yeah it's gonna all righty let's see really do y'all I know that the goof up when I'm on YouTube I'm now on YouTube it's all good so hopefully just come turns out

sublimation on t-shirts not Polly t-shirts but gah so you don't come back right after the intro [Music] [Music] hey Tom the father's workshop screen-printing and we're here again and we're making another video and I don't know if you like him or not if you like to mother to that we made but anyways we're not real big on videos but anyways we're gonna we're gonna do something today we got some stuff from a company and we're not advertising unless you want to sanitize for you but we we got some stuff and it's it's from a company called Dai France and we we bought some stuff because we're curious about sublimation on garments now it's nice when you can put a nice graphic on garments by just using your heat press because I mean I have I have I have other graphics and stuff that you can actually heat press on to the car but this is something that we can print with our printer with the sublimation ink and be able to have a nice graphic and hopefully it would come out nice on shirt now I have heard that it really worked good now this is a little bit of a process because first of all you've got to use the the Desai's are on white and gray shirts to get the decides are out of it that they put into it it has to do with something when they when they're doing this church when they're making the shirts knitting the church or whatever it is it has something to do with with with with that process but they take the D sizer out it is it's removed when they put the ink in them so your your blue shirts and your yellow shirts and your orange green all your colored shirts don't have the D sizer and I'm so you don't have to go through this process but then once you've done that once you if you're gonna do a white shirt once you gather these sides are out of it then you have to use the the other chemical that you spray on there let it dry put in your heat present cure it spray it again cure it again and then you can put your sublimation graphic on to the garment onto the cotton garment so this is sublimation ink on cotton shirts and I have supplemented on cotton without you know without without this stuff and I know what it looks like and you got to be particular when you do it you can do it you still put that on yours on the shirt but it's it's it's it's really kind of blurry faded it comes out but it just it's not crisp but you know hey that you want say a nice clean crisp image it's not like that if you don't use this stuff I guess because I haven't used it yet and what I say haven't used it yet is is it's this stuff right here still on a package haven't even open it yet now this is the B sizer this is what you use on the white and gray shirts you put that on there and there's a process to make sure that you do that then once you've done that and you finished that process then you use what's known as this and it's the poly tea spray anyways just a bottle without a sprayer but this is a probably teach spray anyways and this is it's as concentrated so it'll make up as it's eight ounces should make up to 64 ounces I think it's seven ounces per ounce so that's the way it works what we're gonna do that so come back let's see how it does let's see how it works [Music] [Music] [Music] everything's gonna go [Music] it drops of spray on there now today we're back in this morning time and my Chinese food was great all right we have the heat press getting warmed up and we've went ahead in time to 10 seconds because we need to press this shirt now now that we wet it last night we let it dry overnight come back out here to the shop and I'm going to do now is let the heat press get hot when it gets hot we will press it I think it says for 10 seconds then I've got my he press yet for 10 seconds once it goes down and then we'll bring it back up and we'll take it back over to the platen over here and spray it again and maybe we'll go throw it out in the dryer and let it dry quicker so we can get that second coating on there and you know going to get the second Curie and then we can go ahead and see how this stuff works we're gonna print some up on our printer [Music] only say what said sure did you do yes last night I didn't do front of the back battle I'll just press both sides and I'll have to spray both sides I'm just kidding [Music] [Music] way and then we know that we've sprayed all of this so we'll take these depressed and it is set 385 degrees and we depress it for 10 seconds [Music] offensive ten-second charity thing not again anyway I went a little funk see that smoke I'm assuming that that is the D sizer not the sizer for that is the puck I seem that the smoke there is quality I don't want a bunch of spots all over my shirt [Music] that means we have to [Music] now we're gonna take the shirt we gon spray it again again now what I need to do now that I've done the two cures I've sprayed it let it dry now I'm doing then I did two cures what I'm gonna do now is we're going to put our picture sublimation ink and I did this I run this put together there on the computer there is we gonna put it on the shirt and it says to use butchers paper I'm I don't get that yeah I know I know I need to put something in between where the shirt is here so when you open up the inside of the shirt because that's what's gonna happen is it breaks into a gas so it's naturally gonna go through the material now I don't know if this poly tea is supposed to stop that but I'm gonna put something in between there anyways just to check and see maybe that's why the butchers paper for I have I have some Teflon paper I have up sheets that I put on and so we'll go that route on as far as put it over the top so anyway let's let's just go ahead and work with this thing and see what it looks like so I'm dying to see how it's gonna look now that I've got it it sure twice let me take these glasses off now I can I can see them reading glasses okay so we're gonna go ahead and put this on on the shirt put it on the shirt I think all we're gonna do we're not let me let me let me get the camera set up and we'll come back just hang on okay we're back you had to get the camera set up I hate that's over the cameras and and I'm using a cheap camera anyway so anyways what we've got here now me let me direct down here [Music] [Music] [Music] now this says this says we're supposed to [Music] get our feet press in a 385 degrees and we're supposed to press it for 70 seconds so I'll get that ready in just a second what I'm gonna do open this up [Music] [Music] I went to break into a gas it doesn't bleed through and [Music] [Music] thanks but when you got pictures like this it's kind of crooked anyways so if you put it on there little bit crooked it ain't gonna make any difference [Music] try to get a straight from cans [Music] I do what I need units I need to set this 70 seconds [Music] [Music] here we don't put it on there upside down set it up on shirt [Music] [Music] drop this all for 70 seconds [Music] I can notice temperature dropped you see that [Music] and that's gonna happen who says 70 seconds is up that seemed awfully quick only a few more seconds because the heat dropped and when it did it didn't maintain that no that's really why I set the temperatures a little higher can see it still it's 372 degrees and so it we didn't exactly press at the temperature so normally I set my temperature is higher so one actually is it cools off but it still does all right here we go [Music] when they say 385 and I'll tell you what man I normally go about 400 degrees [Music] not a real of course it could be mine my friend maybe I didn't turn it out as perfectly as I shut it that was treated [Music] treated a couple of times and like I said it's not supposed to be straight it's supposed to be crooked like that his head supposed to be straight got a nice feel to it where you can feel the regular shirt here the softness this is 10 of May today yeah that's pretty good like I said the purple see this one's got left over after after all that it could be the either idea I left it too long and the purple started to burn which is what your red and stuff will do that they'll actually start turning brown and this did turn a little brown instead of purple so maybe I'll do it again on another shirt and see what happens with that because yeah my my Reds turned a little but I mean I got the donut here but I think that dome that was supposed to be pink and it's red so I think it got too much heat for too long so seventy seconds and the thing about it is now these presses are not always accurate either something else too I wanted you to notice that remember when we put the paper in the middle and put the paper in the middle there because we worried about bleeding through [Music] you look after treating it twice it didn't even bleed through so that's good and actually that's my my purple turned brown and I think like I said because of too much heat but actually I kind of like the brown wool over there because it Ronnie coffee coffee face that's your coffee face I got the face so that's pretty neat I think what I'll do is I'll treat the back for Manila face on now put donut faizon sir that's uses sublimation ink and using a product called poly tea by company : Die Presse and next time next time what we will do we will and this is it this stuff here mixes one ounce with seven ounces of water give you eight ounces of spray and I imagine you can do a lot of stuff with that that's a lot of spray and [Music] stop father's workshop screen-printing and there it is who is what you think get the product spray on the cotton t-shirt let it dry cure it with the heat press doing it to do this repeat that over again and then put your picture on there I'm only experiment with some more I'll get them and sell em on eBay I'll experiment the ones that I experiment with you're still good-looking shirt I'll sell them on eBay so be looking father's workshop screen-printing TF w is screen printing I think it's pretty neat anyway that's that's all for this video so thank you for tuning in and yeah we had to little naughty sometimes but that's just where we are some folks say that we're handicapped from the neck up maybe they're right this is Tom the father's workshop screen-printing and thank you for tuning in and again god bless so until next time [Music] [Music]", "LFyRo7ycDxU": "Hey guys I'm Summer from Bella + Canvas\nand we've spent years educating customers on the different types of cotton. Do you know\nthe difference between carded open-end ring-spun and heirloom combed and ring-spun?\nIf not in this video will be extremely useful for you. We're gonna compare how a\nscreen print and DTG print perform on these three types of cotton. Cole from\nShirt Agency is gonna show us how these different types of cotton print\nbut before we get started we just want to explain the differences in these\nqualities of cotton. So first you have your card at open end, your card at open\nend is your cheap scratchy heavier t-shirt? Yeah and then from there a lot\nof our retail customers have moved on to ring-spun because it has a much smoother\nsurface. And the next step up from ring spun is your heirloom combed and ring\nspun. And with ring-spun you can comb out one percent and still call it combed and\nring spun. But we actually comb out about 25 percent of the cotton that we start\nwith because it contains impurities that we don't want in that finished product.\nAnd we also only use long staple cotton which has a huge effect on the final\nresult so you end up with the smoothest printing surface possible. Yeah we\nabsolutely love printing on your guy's garments we get a really nice hand and\nfeel and our prints are really sharp. Today we're gonna show the comparison on\nthese three types of cotton that we talked about with a DTG print a plastisol print and discharge print so let's go see the results. So we have our\nplastisol prints hot off the press what are we looking at here? Well the\nmain thing good check out is on the carded open end when you look through\nthe loop you can see all the different fibers affecting the texture of the last\nscreen printing. And then obviously when you touch it with your hand it's got a\nrougher finish. Yeah you can definitely see some of the red fibers coming\nthrough mm-hmm. And moving on to the ring-spun one it is a little bit better but\nit's not necessarily like the best it could be. There's a little bit of\nfibrillation still happening and that's causing a little bit of a hand feel. And\nwhen you move on to the heirloom it's basically just a completely sharp\nfinished surface and on your hand it feels extremely smooth. So next we'll\nlook at our discharge print how does discharge differ from plastisol?\nSo with discharge instead of putting the ink on top like plastisol. We're\nactually removing the dye from the garment. So this to be honest isn't so\nmuch about the fibers anymore. This is about the quality of the dye and the\nquality of the base garment. So you can see with the heirloom we got a pretty\nclean sharp result with the discharge and then moving on to the ring-spun it's\na pretty similar result but we got a little bit more of the blue staying\nthrough it doesn't look like the true discharge. And then carded open-end\nnormally means that it's like a cheap shirt so we got a really nasty color on\nthis one which was a bit of a surprise. And I think that comes down to the\nquality of the dyes that they're using. Yeah how you dye the shirts is just as\nimportant as how you knit the shirt. So at bella canvas we dye everything in LA so\nwe can main that level of consistency and basically match all of our colors so\nyou have this quality when you have your discharge print. Alright and the third\nprint we did was a DTG or a direct to garment print. So what do you want to\nlook for in a shirt when DTG printing? Well the problem with direct to garment\nfor us pretty much all the time is with brightness. And so we had a pretty great\nresult with the heirloom cotton compared to the carded open-end. I think a lot of\nthat has to do with the tightness of the weave and the ink kind of falling into\nthe fabric. So with DTG it's more important than the other types of screen\nprinting to have a super tight knit weave since the ink lays on top of the\nfabric. Yeah and you already have such a high ink cost what DTG that your product\ncan't be sold for very cheap. And since you're not gonna be doing promo with DTG\nI would think that it makes sense to almost exclusively use a nicer ring spun\nor airlume t-shirt. Hope you guys enjoyed this video.

a bunch of different things and in the end we actually came up with this series together so thanks Marissa this is literally all you like I never would have thought of this series if it wasn't for you thank you and yeah I'm pretty hungry I haven't eaten breakfast yet so let's get right on with the video ok guys so for the first recipe I'm going to be making a smoothie bowl so I'm going to give you guys kind of a guide of how to make your own smoothie bowl and then i'm going to show you guys but I put it in mine and so you guys can really follow whichever recipe you want so for just the basics you'll need any kind of liquid so coconut water almond milk regular milk a hundred percent real juice basically any liquid is the first step to any smoothie bowl then the second step is to pick out your fruits I suggest the reef route you can have more fruits you can have less fruits I just think three is a really good number when it comes to a smoothie bowl and lastly your toppings so you gotta the little fruits on top of your smoothie bowl you can add almonds you can add chia seeds you can put whatever you want I'll just get right into making it after that's done we're going to just add our coconut water because this is the liquid I chose to use I've never actually tried coconut water i usually just put juice or almond milk a lot of my favorite youtubers have been using coconut water lately so I'm going to try it it's like die and then I'm going to put it inside my smoothie bowl I'm not sure if I'm going to like it like I like coconut I don't know if it actually tastes like coconut I'm kind of nervous it's actually really hard to open this okay my god it legit tastes like the inside of a coconut I honestly don't hate it I don't hate it I don't think I'd like drink this by itself as like water I know like people do love drinking it myself like it's like juice or something I think I'm gonna love it inside like smoothies and stuff but by itself I'm no I added a little too much coconut water so I'm just gonna put it in the freezer until it thickens up a little and then I'm gonna add my toppings Louisville is fully a thickened up and it's ready to go I'm gonna add some chia seeds some sliced almonds and some blueberries and I'll show you guys what it looks like what I'm done but this is what my smoothie bowl looks like i'm a looks really pretty like this unfortunately soon it's gonna look like a huge magic this is gonna be amazing I've done smoothie bolts before with blueberries and chia seeds I just never put almonds and coconut water and I think I'm gonna love it so yeah this is what it looks like oh my god I love this you can also change out like the blueberries like Kiwis or more bananas or do whatever you want I just really really like this dr. taste of this movie bull tastes like coconut water which I'm actually really doing okay so the second breakfast that I'm making is a breakfast wrap so basically what you're going to need for this is a tortilla eggs spinach baby tomatoes and an avocado so basically I'm gonna get all my ingredients ready and then i'm going to show you guys how exactly i make my breakfast for this next recipe we're going to be making overnight oats which if you guys have been with me for a year now you guys know that I do this exactly almost a year ago and i love this to make it the night before you wake up in the morning you grab it out of the fridge and you run it's literally amazing it tastes really good so yeah I've added a little bit more ingredients this year then I had to last year's and I think I've improved my recipe a lot it just has a lot more flavors that it's so it's a lot more sweet so I'm going to show you guys the ingredients they each put in it and I'm not sure it's how to make it and that's it for this video the main ingredient right now is oats you need like any kind of oats would make oatmeal with then you need milk you can have regular milk or almond milk I chose regular milk then honey is a really important one in this recipe as well I really love honey I just think it's like sweet and it tastes so good then a vanilla extract is another thing that you will need I like to add cinnamon for extra flavor and some brown sugar none of these you like need to have in there you can kind of whatever you want this is how I make mine and yeah I'm just gonna get right into it I'm going to make it how I used like how much I usually I do not fill this whole mason jar like I've all maybe a quarter of it I just like using a mason jar and I do have like a lid for this so what I'm bringing it to school it's great if it has a lid on it so i'm going to show you guys how much i fill this up and what i put in it burn you you're just gonna leave this in the fridge overnight in the morning can take regular oatmeal it just can be really sweet which is what I love so much in the mornings i usually do add more honey on top so i have honey on top mix it and leave with it or you can add more brown sugar to it or you can even just leave it like that I just usually just add something else on top in the morning but yeah this would usually fill me up and I'd leave it in the fridge and in the morning and one more thing on on top of it and I'm ready to go and I run to the bus stop with this eat it really quick so I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to

"[Music] every one so a lot of you guys have been requesting a update on my armpits how they're doing if I changed my routine did I add anything remove anything so I'm going to sharing all of that with you guys today so before we get started if you guys haven't seen my previous video on how it lightened to my armpits in a month then you should definitely check it out I'll leave it linked above and also in the description box for you guys so this is actually two months later I didn't realize that I filmed that video so long ago so I just wanted to update you guys on what my armpits look like today today is July 19th 2017 so this one my armpits look like today still pretty light not as light as before but I'm just the reason for that I'm not sure with you guys in a second but still pretty light they're definitely not as dark as before I started doing this whole armpit routine thing before my art prints were very very dark they're rough they were dry because I wasn't exfoliating I wasn't maxing in a sense I was kind of abusing them so yeah this is what they look like today pretty good I'm pretty happy with them I have a little bit of a new routine so I'm sure that with you so let's get right into the video one of the things that I'm still doing still using I'll never ever ever ever stop using is my spin brush this is my spin brush for anyone that's new to my channel I talked about this thing a lot because I absolutely love it I do have a 70 percent off coupon code for you guys so instead of paying a hundred bucks you guys get this for 30 bucks I highly highly recommend for you guys to get one everyone who's purchased one loves it I always get positive feedback you guys are seeing improvements with your armpits and other areas for example you guys were saying that you used it on your elbows and your knees and your inner thighs and your necks and you guys really love this cream brush because it's been working so I love this it's right now I have the body brush on and this is what I use for my armpits and it comes with two other smaller brushes and I use that for my face I actually don't have any makeup on right now because I want to show you guys how clear my skin has gotten with using my spin brush for my face obviously not the big brush but the face one so yeah I use I spin brush my face as well yeah my skin has cleared up so much because I'm exfoliating removing makeup making sure to take that old top layer off this is still part of my routine also I've been waxing I do not shave my underarms anymore because shaving can cause discoloration cuts bruises redness irritation all of that stuff so I've completely stopped shaving [Music] as from my soap I'm still using the pure castile soap I actually found a bigger bottle thankfully I actually found this at a local Marshalls so if you guys are looking for this try Marshalls the two things that has changed is my deodorant so one is my deodorant and the other one is my lightening soap so first is the deodorant so you guys know I was using the soft and dry aluminum-free deodorant and I told you guys that products that contain aluminum irritate the skin can cause darkness and you know other things so I started using this and I actually guys to recommend a natural deodorant because I want to swap out this and you know use something natural because I believe this book contains like harmful ingredients I never really googled it but I know it's not natural so it probably will contain harmful chemicals and stuff like that so a lot of you guys recommended tom's and so many other awesome brands but I decide to go at Toms so I'm now I'm using this one and it did take about a week for my body to get used to it just because it doesn't contain any chemicals for example this one and other brands that contain chemicals and aluminum those chemicals actually stop your body from sweating which is not good your body is supposed to sweat a lot of deodorants have chemicals that stop us from sweating and some of those chemicals can cause cancers the number one cancer that they can cause is breast cancer and other health issues so I completely swapped out this and now I'm using this one so it has no artificial fragrance preservatives no aluminum and then the scent that I got just in case you guys are wondering I got the honeysuckle rose and I like it it's a very light scent and smells good but like I said it took me about a week for my took about a week for my body to get used to it because I was used to all those other chemicals stopping me from sweating and you know stuff like that I will say the first week I felt kind of you know sweating and I felt icky and I felt like the deodorant wasn't doing the job but then I realized that I am no longer using a chemical I'm using something that's completely natural and it's allowing my body to do what it's supposed to do so it will take some time for your body to get used to it another thing I added to my routine is that I'm drinking more water now in my first video I wasn't drinking much water now I'm actually drinking a lot more water so I believe that has helped with my skin overall so finally the last item is the lightening soap so you guys know that I actually purchased this online either on eBay or Amazon I can't remember and you know I was using this it's supposed to be a natural lightening soap made with like natural ingredients so I was using this every single day on my armpit but I actually completely stopped using this and not because I was seeing any bad results or I had allergies reaction or anything like that I actually went on vacation and forgot it in Toronto and yeah so when I was on vacation I didn't have it with me so I went all entire week without using it and when I got back to Toronto I decided to kind of just leave it out of my regimen since I wasn't using it for an entire week I decided to continue that and not use it and it's been a month and a half and I haven't touched this so as you can see it's in a plastic bag I haven't been using it so and this is what my armpits look like without using the soap so not as light as before when I was using the soap but still much lighter than before this routine so for anyone who was trying to get their hands on this you don't need it proof that you don't need it wax exfoliate use a natural soap and switch out your chemical deodorant for something natural and you should be good don't need to use the soap and you don't need to use the natural aiding soap anymore I may put it back into my regimen maybe three tonnes a week or something but right now I don't need it my uncle's have been doing very well they're not I start this before they're still very soft because I am exfoliating them a few times a week there's no irritation because I'm not shaving anymore they feel nice and soft because again I'm exfoliating and I'm using a natural soap my routine now is pretty much a hundred percent natural now everything that I'm showing you guys is in your reach you can go to a store and grab it the only thing is the spin brush is online but it only takes about maybe a week to arrive and it's thirty bucks so I mean you can't go wrong with my coupon code you guys get 70% off so that is pretty much it my update on my armpits it's been two months and this is what they look like pretty good this armpit is still a little bit darker than this one I think that's just naturally how it is no matter how many times I you know try to exfoliate it still is dark I personally think that's just how it naturally is but I've been keeping up my routine I've been doing pretty good with it and I completely cut out that natural lighting soap so you guys don't have to worry about trying to find it online yeah you guys can definitely try out this new regimen let me know how it works for you also if you guys have actually purchased the spin brush let me know down below if you like it how your routine is going if you're using it for your face and also like I said you don't have to use it just for your face you can use for your elbows or your neck your knees inner thighs bikini area wherever wherever you have a dark area that you're not happy with try exfoliating with this brush I should definitely help soften and smooth skin and lighten your skin so if you guys have any questions definitely leave them down below hopefully you enjoyed this video if you did give me a thumbs up if you're not subscribed make sure you are subscribed and I see you guys in my next video

even throughout the sleeves they just hug the arms nicely there's no excess fabric it or not standing off it's honestly an incredibly versatile t-shirt that we're starting with you're gonna see the other ones are a little bit more specific when it comes to the styling this doesn't have any particular styling there's no pocket no special seams no nothing straightforward it's a little tiny bit see-through it's a 2 to 1 cotton to polyester mix while pullies not considered one of the most high-end fabrics this is where you get your low price point and it really still feels comfortable I actually prefer this over the regular supima cotton t-shirt at unique Ledet I think a lot of you guys love I think this is more affordable for one and it fits better and feels better in my opinion let's put it to a quick test and see how easily it wrinkles if I do something like this right now we have some wrinkles but if you kind of just shake it up it works really well which is something I am looking for in a white t-shirt because I want to be able to like sit down and Ike not have to worry that it's gonna be super wrinkled because the fabric is a little bit too stiff but this I think is already in terms of versatility really really far ahead just because of the styling the quality of the field and cost so a great start with the first one but let's shake out number two this t-shirt that I'm wearing right here it's from H&M cost me $9.99 and it's from their divided collection the divided collection is the one that's a little bit on the lower end of the hmm quality but I personally really like this we're gonna start talking about the styling with this one because it is a little bit more special than the first one we have a pocket on the left chest and then the sleeves are actually rolled up and stitched up which is look I really like I don't have to worry about ruling them up I don't have to worry about making it look clean or making sure that they stay up so that for me is a big big thing the fabric itself has a little bit of a pattern to it so you see like a little bit of a stripe like a Marling I like that it is definitely a more particular look so this shirt is a little bit less versatile I think then the first one from Uniqlo that we looked at but if your style is a little bit more casual and you're planning on wearing this with a bomber jacket or a leather jacket then I think this might be a great way to go it feels really nice it's a little bit more breathable than the first one and nice and stretchy the fit just like the first one is awesome it's a little bit longer than the first t-shirt we looked at also playing back into that casual vibe but overall for me this is another great option but you see that there's just different t-shirts that might work for you better and that's the point of today's video so I'm excited to show you the rest of it t-shirt number three and back to Uniqlo I was throwing a little bit of shade on that supima cotton t-shirt the regular supima cotton t-shirt that is but this is a pima cotton t-shirt from their unique lo u collection back selection plays a little bit more with silhouettes and there's a little bit more fashion forward rather than your basic basics so this fabric is a little bit of a stiffer feel to it which makes for a nice and clean look but it's a little bit rougher against the skin I personally don't mind it or having that added hmmm I don't know ruggedness of the t-shirt the cost is $14.90 which i think is reasonable for a high quality t-shirts the pima cotton is amongst the best cob and you can get and the fit like I said is a little bit more boxy a little bit less slim you see that the sleeves are a little bit more roomy first Uniqlo or ii am sure that we had looked at which is fine because this fabric is stiff i won't have any trouble rolling up the sleeves and actually not having to worry that they stay up there because it's a little bit stiff and it keeps up nicely I actually have this t-shirt in my closet and I love it I wear it a whole lot and I think from a versatility standpoint it works just as well as the first one there's a little bit more fabric and it feels a little bit more rougher which is great for those days with maybe just a little bit colder outside so you actually get a little bit more warmth from this the color feels a tiny bit more natural so not like a bright white but a little bit more relaxed which actually makes it a little bit more versatile in my opinion easier to combine with other pieces the fourth t-shirts were back at H&M at a price point of $14.99 this t-shirt has a lot more surface interest it's a little bit like a sweater I believe this is called a pique knit I don't know don't quote me on that I did go to fashion school but it's been a while I like this it's definitely more of a choice it's not as easy a white t-shirt to just wear with everything this to me feels a little bit more elegant just because of the structure of it overall the fit is a little bit more roomy for me personally for this fabric I wish it was a little bit more slim more like a polo shirt but without the collar the sleeves feel nice against the skin it feels okay it's a little bit rough I would prefer to go if I'm going for a rougher t-shirt I prefer to go for the Uniqlo you honestly but I want to show you guys this so you also know that if you are into things that are a little bit more special and a little bit more elaborate you can also get a white t-shirt that is more interesting than just a white t-shirt and that's what I wanted to include this guy today from H&M s collection wait I keep forgetting about the wrinkle thing so let me wrinkle this up really quick ooh that's that's looking deep deep wrinkle it's a fairly structured shirt so that will happen so this is not ideal like it might wear out a little bit but even then you see that the fabric is a little stretched out and let's do the same thing to the Uniqlo shirt from before not too bad you see a little bit of it but it's better it's very better I think than this white t-shirt right here moving away from HTM and unique little we're at Urban Outfitters now where you have this t-shirt for $29 this is what we're having a big difference in the styling of the t-shirt it's a long line t-shirt with an asymmetrical hemline which means that it's longer in the front than it is on the sides that is a very particular look if you're into that that's awesome I think underneath the hoodie I always like this look because it Peaks out and makes it a lot more interesting that's why I like long line t-shirts in general the feel of it is nice the quality doesn't feel super-high I feel like the I feel that seams on the shoulder rubbing just a little bit and for me the one thing with these t-shirts has always been that the sleeves I don't love the way they look they're just a little short and the fit doesn't particularly work for me I usually have to end up rolling them up a tiny bit and then it works better but this for me I like these t-shirts for particular looks but it's not super versatile in my opinion even the neck is a little bit more of a scoop neck so you're showing a little bit more you guys know urban outfitters and you know the vibe they're going for so this is their in-house line which is obviously reflective of what the brand's aesthetic is so this is just a little bit more casual and a little bit more extreme wrinkle test [Music] yeah not that great I think it again it feels like the fabric stretched out a little bit you barely see the fabric but like from my point of view you see a little bit of like the stretch off fabric which makes sense because there's a lot of stretch in here and like I said the quality doesn't feel that crazy high so that makes sense to me next up we're back at H&M but this time we're looking at H&M edition one of their higher and collections and this is an entirely linen made shirt which I really like what that means it's gonna be a little bit more see-through because it's linen has a little bit of a rough feel against the skin but like the good kind of rough feel that you'd expect from linen that might sound a little weird but you know there's differences in linen and sometimes it feels comfortable just like you feel it a little and sometimes you're just scratching your skin this does not it feels nice the fit is somewhat relaxed but this is a relaxed t-shirt I think for the summer this is amazing something for the beach and more beachy look something more relaxed for your everyday usage obviously it might not be ideal since it's not cotton and cotton is one of the best fabrics for like everyday wear the color of it is also just a little bit more natural because you'll often find that with linen fabrics you don't get that clean white which i think is beneficial it just works with the more natural look of linen and usually we know Lynn and wrinkles pretty badly so yeah you can kind of still see it it's not it's not ideal but for a linen t-shirt it actually works out pretty well so that's oh very out there option I think this is the most out-there option that we have in terms of fabric today while looking at these 12 teachers almost halfway through but stick with me because I went in the stores and tried all of these shirts on for you so you don't have to all you have to do is watch this video seventh tee shirt is from Topman but not from the top man brand it's actually someone rents that they stock that's a European brand called selected home and ironically it says on the back of this t-shirt the perfect tee you know what in my opinion like I'm giving away a little bit of like the rest of the video in my opinion this this really could be when it comes to straight-up versatility it's 100% cotton t-shirt price at $35 we're getting into like a steeper price range but this is where you really want to look out for quality so you can justify spending that much money on a t-shirt it needs to hold up over a while and it needs to feel great and this feels great the fit is phenomenal the shoulders are hitting for me exactly where they're supposed to we once again have the nice and slim arms and a nice slim fit throughout the body the fabric is just a tiny bit see-through but it feels amazing it's just a very it's not a clinical white it's just a tiny bit off but it feels phenomenal and this is I think to me the most versatile t-shirt that I've had on so far I've probably also will have on it is very close to the Uniqlo t-shirt the very first one and that's a $30 price difference so depending on your budget I say you could probably go for this because there's not a big difference but I really really like the small tiny little differences in this one for me personally last thing wrinkle test at this point I don't even know anymore I feel like you've looked at so many wrinkles what do you guys think all right I can still see it a little bit just imagining if I was sitting in a car driving for a little bit it's not that bad obviously what I'm doing with them with my hands is also pretty extreme but I feel like it'll bias not because I like the shirts I'm trying to say it's not wrinkling that bad now we're moving into the $45 price range and we're inside of cos stores at that price point you're going to want to see something that's special about the t-shirt that justifies that extra money going towards a simple basic t-shirt in this case it's a cotton t-shirt 100% so the fabric is not what makes it special but costs it's focused on basics but then it's taking a little bit more of a contemporary spin on them so in this case we have heat bonded sleeves and a heat bonded hem which take away two seam that's one thing that you're gonna notice but also because it's double layer you see like a little white blocking around here and around here which is a cool little feature if that's something you're into another thing it allows for is rolling the sleeves up really nice and neat because there's a certain structure to that heat bonding that allows for that to look clean the fit is a little bit more boxy again in line with that contemporary vibe that cost stores has going on I personally don't think it's gonna be one of my favorites just because $45 is pretty steep and the versatility with this is a little bit limited in my opinion the feel is interesting like the cotton feels a little bit more dry than the other ones which is not necessarily a great thing our last thing I feel like that's worse than some of what we see isn't it maybe it's just because the rest of the fabric looks super clean so when it is steamed or ironed it looks great but the wrinkling I'm not personally super convinced about just because it stands out against the other cleaner parts of the t-shirt but I have one more from cause that I want to show you guys right now and this is it it's also $45 and it's also 100% cotton but with this one you can probably easily detect that it's all about the fit so looking for the perfect white sheet this one is for you if you're into a larger silhouette if you like oversized things and if you like a little bit more of a non-classical so hood a modern silhouette that sounds way better than non-classical we got really nice and roomy sleeves and obviously a roomy body as well the length is not as long as I thought it may be for something that's literally denoted as oversized or I think it's called the long t-shirt on the cost website but the quality of the cotton feels great it's heavier than the first one that I showed you guys and very similar to the unique loss of pima cotton t-shirt and last thing with this one yeah similar judgment as with the last one I think the rest of the shirt looks so clean when it's properly aren't that this will kind of stand out once again a little summary for me it might not be my everyday t-shirt but for you it might be if your style is a little bit more relaxed three more to go on the next two are gonna be from all stains both of them priced at $60 this shirt is surprisingly similar to the shirt that we just saw from costs the color of the white is a little bit more natural which I once again think makes a little bit more wearable the silhouette is a little bit less extreme as the cost one I think this is easier to pull off than the one I was wearing just before is it worth fifteen dollars more I don't necessarily think so if it's right up your alley and great for you then that's awesome but I wanted to include it because I do like it I do like the roominess of it I do mess with the fit like I I think it's fun when you have a little bit more fabric you can also have more fun with the styling and I'm about to release a video coming up really soon styling a white t-shirt we're gonna focus on a simple one but if you guys need some outfit ideas for white t-shirts I got you covered it's coming up really soon after you find your perfect one I'll teach you how to style it as well but again back to this t-shirt I like it it's also not the one I would go for if I'm going for versatility for my personal style before we take a bite of this one first pretty well on the wrinkle test the fabric does feel nice against the skin it's a little dry but comfortably so it's fine by me let's take a look at the other All Saints t-shirt and this one to me is a lot more classic All Saints it's slimmer a little bit elongated nice and slim sleeves we got a slim neckline and I've seen a lot of people with the alsace t-shirt with the logo on it I like that they also have a clean version I don't like any logos on line t-shirts personally it's just a preference but the fabric is super soft it feels great it's a little bit more see-through which also goes back to that All Saint's aesthetic of being a little bit more rugged and rock and roll I think like it just works great under a suede trucker jacket or suede biker jacket I think that we or a biker jacket can also be leather this is all surprised at $60 and like I said $60 we're like in a price range that for a white t-shirt really needs to be worth it if it's you're selling you are a little bit more rugged and you can't swing it because you love All Saints brand then that's great otherwise I think we have a couple options in here that I might opt for before I spend $60 on an All Saints shirt finishing up with a big note on comfort that's what you're paying $69.95 for with this Tommy Bahama t-shirt I walked into that store because I had a Tommy Bahama t-shirt in my closet that I loved I was trying to find it if it's still available but I found this instead and this is the only t-shirt I would actually prefer to have a size smaller than because it's just too roomy I decided to include it anyway because you have no idea how good I feel right now in this t-shirt it's ridiculously light it has a cooling technology in it it's a mix of 42% pima cotton 25% Modell 25 percent poly and then 5% spandex spandex just means it does this and it feels amazing now the the size medium can definitely work support some more grungy or street wear looks because it's definitely oversized the like you can tuck it in a little bit but I would for this t-shirt go for its size small that's really where you guys have the choice to make whether you want to spend $70 on a t-shirt because it's amazingly comfortable and it might keep you cool also I again I bought this yesterday I don't know how cooling technology works in this t-shirt that they apply to the fabric but I'm excited to put it to a test and even for a beachy t-shirt like it's almost like an active wear t-shirt a little bit in terms of the styling the shoulder seam is just dropped about an inch board so you see it a little bit more prominently also adding to that more active wear aesthetic and then we have these little finishes on the side of the seam which I honestly could do without not gonna lie to you but I wanted to show you guys this because it's just it feels amazing so great wrinkle test with this yeah that's what I figured with this fabric you can almost not even see that I just wrinkled it which is amazing so this is definitely about comfort a great teacher to be traveling in a great teacher to just be hanging out and if you're you know worried about feeling phenomenal and that's it man that was a mouthful just talking about white t-shirts for I don't know how long this video is by now but I hope you appreciate the effort that I put in for you guys I went through all the stores and tried all those shirts out so you don't have to and I hope you found whatever is perfect for you like I said all the links are down below for you guys to shop let me know in the comments section which ones you didn't like the most you know what you're looking for in a white t-shirt I would actually like to know because like I said I have my two favorites yeah but I want to get a conversation started thank you guys so much for watching I'll see you very soon with the next video until then stay doctor bye", "8LV0Tic6Cuo": "hello guys and welcome back to my channel so the perfect basic t-shirt is something that can be quite hard to find and especially if the perfect basic white t-shirt there are so many different fits qualities and price levels in this area so I hope this video will help you in the search for the perfect basic t-shirt so in this video I am gonna show and compare no less than five different white t-shirts and what all of these t-shirts have in common is that they are all from brands if you guys have recommended to me also they are all either responsibly made so they maybe come from a responsible brand or they are made in organic cutting so this was one of the criterias for me to do this test going for a sustainable basic item is one of the easiest steps towards a more sustainable and intentional way of consuming fashion and I think it's something that everyone can do because the price difference between these t-shirts that I have found today and the ones that are conventionally made are not even that big the way that we consume fashion in general today is very selfish because the cost for you yourself is much more important than the cusp of our environment or the people in the production and that's where I think that the industry desperately needs a change so again going for the most responsible alternative on the market is a great way of starting this journey and to support initiatives like organic cotton or more transparent production and other things like that moving on so I've gathered five of the most important criteria in this area and let's just go through them I'm so sorry about my voice is still a bit scruffy after being ill last week it's just not going away so the first criteria for the perfect basic white t-shirt is that the quality or the break mustn't be too stiff but it mustn't be too slinky either so it kind of has to be in between those two so I can slip the flapper got the t-shirt I definitely prefer cutting above anything else so everything in be scopes or polyester which are both not very sustainable ways of making fabric for a t-shirt it's just a no-go for me I prefer something that is at least 95% cotton and preferably organic cotton so let's move on to the third criteria which is all about the fit personally I like to go for probably what you would call a boyfriend fit so it has to be slightly boxy slightly oversized and it has to have this crew neck like the one that I'm wearing today so no deep scoop Knicks or anything like that the crew neck is definitely the number one type of neck when it comes to basic t-shirts for me so the fourth criteria is that the basic t-shirt should wash well so the seams should stay at the sides at all times they shouldn't move to like the center of your belly after washing them one or two times if the seams tend to move when you wash your t-shirts lettuce happen a sign of poor quality and it's something that I myself have experienced when I buy t-shirts from very cheap high street brands finally one of the most important criterias and also one of the things that you guys are very frustrated about when it comes to especially white t-shirts is that it shouldn't be too see-through and that leads me to the nude bra because a nude bra is an absolute must-have in your underwear collection in general because it's just great to wear underneath like a very see-through button-down shirt but certainly also your white basic t-shirts it is almost impossible to find a basic teacher that's not just a tiny bit see-through and going for a nude bra it's just a great way of dealing with that if you're not into the hole peeking through underwear situation so I actually tried one out from a brat called organic basics which is also one of the brands that I ordered one of the t-shirts from it's a basic triangle problem no wires or anything like that and it's just super comfortable and I'm loving it already also the cutting quality from organic basics are often made in what you would call long fiber cotton which means that this fabric is just a lot more durable than conventional cotton and it will also look like new for a lot longer time okay so with all that in mind let's have a look at the five t-shirts that I'm going to show you and compare to each other today now as always everything that I show you in this video is going to be linked down below for you guys also I haven't tried any other t-shirts on yet because I kind of wanted to give you my full first impressions besides the teacher that I'm wearing today which is about six months old now and I'm going to compare this to the four others as well but that's just because this one comes from a responsible brand so I thought I just wanted to put that in together with the others I am gonna watch that just to see how well they wash and then I'm gonna give you my final verdict and then hopefully be able to pick out a favorites so that you guys can also pick out here on a favorite so yeah let's go so this t-shirt is called the cutting crew and it is from ever Lane so when it comes to the fit of this t-shirt it is just right up my street it has kind of a straight slightly oversized v and it has this crew neck as well when it comes to the quality it is quite thin also I can't seem to find any information on this t-shirt whether it organic cotton or not so I'm guessing it is just in conventional cotton but it is made in supima cotton which is kind of a quality March for Eveline so it is definitely better than the conventional alternatives out there when it comes to good quality but I would have liked it to be an organic cotton as well so that it was being made with fewer chemicals in the production as well also the fabric of this t-shirt is very thin I don't know if you're able to see it here but you can kind of see my jeans through the t-shirt and yeah it's just a bit too thin for my liking other than that the fit and the hand feel it's very soft and it feels great on skin and like I said it washes really well as well and also it comes from a responsible brand where transparency and good conditions in the production is something that's very important so so let's have a look at this one from organic basics this is the same brand as the nude bra that I spoke about earlier in this video there's just so much plastic waste in the fashion industry so it's great to see someone taking a bit more responsibility in that area all the teachers that I'm showing you today is in a size medium just to get that out there I'm also going to put that information down below but just in case I forget to say these are all in a size I mean you and I deliberately always choose a size medium just because I really like that slightly oversized fit so here is the one from organic basics I am not really fond of the finishing here at the neck it kind of looks like the fabric has been stretched a bit too much in the production so it kind of has these small wrinkles down here at the neck I think you'd be able to remove it by ironing at the t-shirt which is gentle something I really enjoy to do especially after washing my t-shirts is just give them a quick iron because it makes them look completely like new again so I hope this is something that you can remove by irony the t-shirt and it was made in a 95% organic cotton and then five percent ill estate and I can definitely tell when I move around in the fabric and I kind of I'm stretching like this that it's a bit more stretchy than the 100% cotton ones probably Everland so overall I really like this t-shirt I really like this very thick quality and the fact that it is hardly see through I bet you could even wear like a normal white bra underneath this t-shirt and you wouldn't be able to see it so that's definitely a plus but yeah it feels like a very proper great t-shirt oh yeah this is what I'm talking about when I say crewneck this is a proper crew neck in my opinion it just goes all the way up to the neck and it looks great with when you layer it your necklaces like this and yeah that is definitely a plus the one from organic basics is definitely a lot bigger than this one no doubt about that but it is definitely thicker than the very thin one from every lane so far this could actually be a favorite of mine I really like the neck I like the sleeves the perfect slightly oversized spit the sleeves are not too big they're not too long or anything so kind of has that boyfriend fit but not too much and yeah like I said it is made in 100% organic cotton so if you are to go for a sustainable basic from a normal high street brands and all the stories is definitely a great way to go so moving on this one is from weekday and kind of has a more corrupt and boxy fit than the others the others kind of went down to here that is definitely an individual matter but I definitely like my t-shirts to be slightly longer especially if I'm wearing boyfriend jeans like today where the jeans kind of sit low on my hip I just don't feel like there's a lot of fabric to kind of do this health tuck because it's so short if you're wearing high-waist jeans on the other hand there's not a lot of excess fabric so if that's what you prefer this length is perfect I guess also there's something odd about this color this one is what they call white on the website on weekdays websites but it is not white it is kind of like an off-white almost like a cream color I don't know if you can see it but I mean compared to this one from and other stories it's just not very white this one is also made in 100% organic cotton so again we're dealing with conventional brand that has kind of made an initiative to go for more sustainable basics the thickness of the fabric is great as well I don't really have anything bad to say about that I can see my bra I almost can't even see my jeans through this fabric as well so it has a great thickness so that is the fourth t-shirt take a good look because I'm gonna switch to the last one so here we have the final t-shirt this is from a brand called armed angels and it's a brand that I only recently discovered I've actually so ordered a pair of skinny jeans from that brand I'm gonna test out yeah this is 100% organic cotton as well and as you can see it is kind of more fitted than the other t-shirts so I guess this is what you would call like a woman's t-shirt so the sleeves are a bit more fitted and the body is a bit more fitted kind of sewn like a woman's body and like I said in the beginning I really prefer this kind of straight oversized fit so when it comes to the fit I am not completely sold on this one however I will say the length is really great at this t-shirt and also I think it's perfect to be wearing underneath Blazers because it is that fitted but to be wearing like this on its own it's not my favorite oh yeah I am gonna return once I have watched all of these t-shirts [Music] so it is now the day after I spoke to you last and I'm out back with a final conclusion to these five different white t-shirts so the conclusion is that all of the five t-shirts did really well in washing after a bit of ironing when they were dry they all have a very smooth surface and there doesn't seem to be a problem with moving seams or anything like that but obviously it takes a bit more than just one wash and also a bit more wear to really tell a difference but it doesn't seem like the surface will be peeling or anything so they're all super smooth still looks great and they did really well in terms of washing so one thing to think about in this process is definitely that cotton isn't just cutting you can really feel a difference in softness and weight if you turn to brands who are concerned about making cotton items in supima or pima cotton or cotton that are made from long fiber cotton so the reason why a long fiber cotton and supima cotton is so great is because you just get a lot thicker cotton a lot more durable and a lot more soft cotton as well they all have some pros and cons but if I have to pick out my own favorites it will have to be the one that I'm wearing right now which is the one from organic basics or the one from and Other Stories which is closely followed by one from every Lane so I really wish that you could feel the hand feel of this t-shirt from organic basics it's just so incredibly soft and I think it has to do with a tiny bit of stretch it just sits so nice and soft on your body and I like this kind of stretchy hand feel and also the thickness and the weight of the fabric and then after washing it and ironing the neckline I managed to smooth out these little wrinkles that have had right here so I think it will look great after countless times of washing and wear as well so if we look at both the t-shirt from and other stories made an organic cotton 100% organic cotton and then this one from organic basics they both kind of fill in the criterias that we made in the beginning of this video for the perfect basic white t-shirt so that was that the fabric shouldn't be to slinky but not too stiff either this one is definitely a lot more soft than this one because this one is after all 100% cotton and this has a tiny bit of stretch so there is definitely a difference in the softness of the t-shirt but the weight is quite similar to both of them then they both have this slightly oversized boxy fit with a classic crewneck that I like so much they wash really well both of them the surface is still super smooth no moving seams or anything like that and then finally none of them are too see-through but like I said in the beginning of this video it all starts with a great nude bra I really like the one from every lane as well like I said in the beginning I've had this for a while I've had it for around six months and it's been worn a lot washed a bunch of times too and it just keeps looking great the surface hasn't start started to peel or anything like that it's still super smooth the seams are where they should be in the sides of the t-shirt so this is really in my top three of all of these t-shirts because it just lasts so well and that is because it is made in soupy McCubbin so that just shows that cotton is not just cuttin you have to pick carefully if you want something that looks nice in the long run and that's really durable as well but the reason why it's not my absolute favorite is because it is just a bit too thin compared to these two this one and this one so my absolute favorites the one from another stories and then this one from our basics [Music] when it comes to caring for especially white t-shirts we all know that through time you can kind of get these yellow stains in the armpits which is just totally unsexy but it happens you can actually easily remove these stains by mixing a bit of baking soda with water so that it kind of creates a paste and then kind of scrub that into the surface or where the stain is and then leave it there for at least one hour you could also leave it overnight if you're dealing with a very rough kind of stain and then wash it normally and then that should take that yellow stain right off your t-shirt another thing you could do to avoid these yellow stains is going for a more and natural deodorant so stay away from antiperspirant a crystal deodorant or maybe make your own I'll make sure to put a link down below for a recipe for making your own deodorant I have experienced that the crystal deodorant is not always very efficient I sweat more through certain periods during the month and also if I'm really busy or stressed out I tend to sweat a bit more and having to worry about the smell of sweat it's just not fun either so I actually have both a crystal deodorant for kind of low-key days or if days at home where I don't need as much protection and then I also have a traditional antiperspirant but just without any nasty chemicals and without perfume so that it's better for very sensitive skin and it's just a bit more healthy than the conventional antiperspirant so that's it for this video guys I really hope you found it helpful and that it kind of made you wiser in terms of cotton in general and choosing great durable qualities also in terms of choosing more sustainable options again like I said in the beginning of this video going for sustainable eco-friendly basics is a great way to start other than lowering your consumption and maybe going for secondhand as well personally I don't even think that it's that much more expensive than the conventional brand so really everyone can do this especially if you lower your consumption you have a bit more money to go for great quality and more sustainable options as well so enough blabbering I think this video is getting a lot longer than I thought in the beginning so I'm gonna wrap up this video if you liked it please don't forget to give me a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel I'd love to have you around also make sure to follow me on Instagram because I upload daily outfit inspiration from my capsule wardrobes and thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you all in the next one bye guys [Music]", "0hXNSG5qqQQ": "what's up guys it is your boy groupies coming out to you from downtown Los Angeles and today we are going to review a brand new product a heavy weight t-shirt yes that's true he conscious 1000 heavy weight t-shirt go alright guys so I've been on the search for a nice heavy weight t-shirt option for gosh a minute now if you're wondering why your brand they need a heavy weight t-shirt or if you're considering offering one there's a couple good reasons why you might want to think about that there's this certain consumer segments who kind of feel like a lighter weight t-shirt or like a thinner material translates to a lower quality product of course quality means something different to everyone so that's just something to keep in mind but if you have like if you're catering I get outdoors the audience or any audience that really thinks about the overall durability of a product like the longevity how long is this thing gonna last you may want to consider offering or using a heavy weight t-shirt as the go-to t-shirt for your brand so there's a bunch of different scenarios where heavy weight t-shirts come up and it really kinda just comes down to overall consumer preference I've looked at a bunch of these heavy weight t-shirt options and the one that I've been most stoked about is the e conscious 1,000 if you guys haven't heard of the t-shirt manufacturer conscious they really come out everything from a supply chain management standpoint about do things in an environmentally friendly way so this e conscious t-shirt not only is it a heavy weight 100% cotton t-shirt it is also organic so what that means is when they're growing that cotton they're not using pesticides or not using fertilizers so they're just going about things from a very environmentally responsible standpoint so that's also something to keep in mind when you're thinking heavyweight t-shirts of that being a premium offering also having it being a certified organic product adds to that additional brand value that your brand can pass along to customers and make them feel like they're getting a great t-shirt and a great product that's one of the reasons why I like this t-shirt and he conscious as a brand overall just because from a purpose standpoint they're going about all their products along this side eco-conscious way and so that that means a lot to me the next thing I like about it is this is a 5.5 ounce 100% cotton t-shirt and so if you look at like the standard go to premium t-shirt like a bell canvas that's 4.2 ounces so this shirt from a material sample has like over thirty percent heavier than a bell canvas three thousand one t-shirt I've thrown this t-shirt of people and they're like hey man what do you think tell me about it almost everyone's like wow this like a date t-shirt this is like heavy so it suits you kind of like take this thing out of the box and you put it on your ID it feels like substantially significantly different than just a standard run-of-the-mill t-shirt t-shirt is also a side seam so it's on the tubular t-shirt and you know it's cut from two different pieces of fabric and sewn together for the body part which is really great everything's double stitched it also has the neck tape on it right now your boy groobees is rocking a large now I'm kind of guy is like in between a medium and a large and this thing definitely has a box your bag your fit to it so you can see it just it has that really nice kind of overall loose fit and when you're going for a heavyweight t-shirt really don't want these things things to be it's like form-fitting and like attached to your body so this thing's definitely looser and a bag you're fit and I've seen in previous review videos you guys are but how does a watch Huggett percent cut that thing is going to shrink isn't it well I've washed this thing three times already and it's still basically has the exact same fit as before it hasn't gotten shrunked up and super short on you it still has basically the exact same fit so from a wash ability standpoint it's spot-on the reason why they're doing heavier weight t-shirt is really from that durability angle they're really approaching the environmental sustainability thing has hey if we make a better of t-shirt you don't have to buy them as often you won't burn through a t-shirt you know every three months this thing's really set to last six months or nine months or a year so far I've been super psyched about how this thing has held up in the wash obviously three washes is not three months worth of wearing but so far so good and I'll keep you guys posted on that let me quickly try on a medium for you and I'll show you how that fits on your board groobees your boobies is about five nine and a half and I weigh about 150 pounds so pretty average all around whole time okay so right now I'm wearing the Navy this is a medium you can see that this one is definitely smaller on me it's still got a pretty nice baggy fit to it like these or these sleeves are not like super tight form fitted sleeves and they're still just like a nice amount of material around the body that's available now the e conscious 1000 t-shirts they also come in a pretty interesting set of colors all the colors are not like super bright bright vibrant colors that almost remind me of like a pigment dye type of situation where it's like the lighter and the pastel shades so before I was wearing a black one this one is essentially like a navy color they call it Pacific they also have a white and a light gray color they call it a dolphin they have like a brighter kind of red color that they call a pepper they have this amazing yellow that they call beehive it's a super nice bright yellow and they also have like an olive color like a torso really super solid color options for this product all of them kind of have like that a little bit more faded pigment style to them have really really good print quality this is a white t-shirt that is a digital print on it and it came out super super clean really nice we do print with red and green ink so that's why we got a really really nice red but of course they also have the nice tearaway tag on it that's awesome the turbo type is Craig super super easy - real able and they also have like a nice branding message on the back which reads be the change you want to see in the world of course that's from your boy Gandhi boy groobees Ritz this t-shirt a super strong I really like it I think it's a super solid foundation for a brand overall that needs a more premium boxier cut t-shirt it is a unisex sizing but it's definitely one of those shirts that for a female you're either going to be going for just an overall my box your looser cut feel to it you're going to be hitting that boyfriend look you like style it with like jeans and vans that type of thing so it's kind of like the tomboy is kind of luck on the girls side for God's I mean a great go-to t-shirt for skate brands for outdoors anywhere where a thicker t-shirt or you get a certain teen audience that wants that decorative t-shirt so I will leave you guys some links below about where you can check this shirt out I want to hear what you guys think are you guys all Freight heavyweight t-shirts for your brand or you staying away from long is the price point not working let everyone know start the discussion boil down in the comments of box this video is helpful for you guys quickly smash the like button [Music] [Music] [Music]", "Xk5svE1dQx8": "[Music] um peace to the saints yeti trying out a new technology today and i had a topic that was on my mind so i just want to share a little bit of game with you guys today's lecture we're talking about the fact that as a man you should always err on the side of being more aggressive as opposed to passive when you're dealing with females as you all may remember i always tell you guys that you don't want to speak aggressively or speak sexually rather you want to act aggressively and behave arrogantly rather than having arrogant words come out of your mouth you dig when you speak arrogantly a woman's going to think you're insecure because you're trying to aggrandize make yourself seem bigger but when you behave that way they just accept it as this is who he is he walks with the swag for a reason now let me give you guys a few anecdotes because i know a lot of guys at home are like oh marquette i've been aggressive with females before it didn't benefit me well saints you didn't lose that because you were aggressive you lost that because the girl really wasn't interested in you and i'm gonna tell you what i really mean i've had numerous situations in life in which i failed to be appropriately aggressive there's literally almost no such thing as being too aggressive unless you're getting rapey you know assuming you're not rapey and going pepe le pew on the chick i think you're good this is what i mean when i was 16 years old i had this gorgeous young lady that i had the privilege of being involved with and eventually she said that i took her virginity who knows what the facts are i'm personally doubtful but i remember after that there was a time in which she had basically said to me hey you know like why didn't we do anything that particular day i said i wanted to do something but you didn't seem like you were with it i was telling you you know let's get it popping but you weren't making it happen and she says well why didn't you just take it take it you're trying to have me catch a case out here and when she said that i realized that for women there is this idea that once they've signed up to be with a man or once they're interested in a particular guy they're pretty much submitting themselves wholly to that man and they are indeed there for the taking if you have a proper woman who's mentally healthy if you have a feminist then it's quite a different story so that was the first time i had heard a woman say why didn't you just take it unfortunately it wasn't the last time and by the way shout out to all the saints who have uh sent through super chats and sent through the the cash apps always want to let you know that i appreciate those who who appreciate me you dig and let me just make sure that this stream is um showing everything appropriately because i've never used this technology before i think appropriately because i'm going to make sure i'm not missing anything i think appropriately because i know cool cool it looks like it's good to go all right we're going to carry on so then i was in university right and there's this one girl who's very shy and i ended up gaming her up she was a very thin brunette chick and she went to berkeley so clearly she's like a bit of a nerd in high school and i invited her over to my apartment a couple times the first time nothing happened i didn't expect anything to happen i was just building rapport then the second time i invited her over nothing really started to pop off sometimes you really have a situation with a female where you're connecting mentally but the physical chemistry doesn't seem to be there and then there was a third time still nothing that popped up is the third time i'm going back in to see if i can get it going and we're actually going to her apartment this time and she was walking up the stairs in front of me she's like a couple steps up so basically we're walking up the stairs to her apartment her butt is right there in my face and at that time a young man that was reasonably timid you know because i was used to things falling in my lap after all at my high school in los angeles i was the man right voted best smile best dressed uh mr irresistible so i was used to things falling in my hand not having been familiar and had enough experience with a shy woman who was a little more reserved chased and really wanted you to take it down like a hitman but you had to you know make it happen for yourself and really women pose a challenge to a man that really represents the nature of life and that if you want something you got to go get it so long story short nothing popped off with shorty and then um i was talking to her like a while after that and she ended up having a boyfriend she was dating some guy who was certainly my inferior and then i had asked i was like yo what happened with me and you like nothing ever popped off and then she was like well you never did anything what was i was i supposed to make a move and the truth is that the male is indeed the aggressor the male is the hunter the female is the prey so if you're not hunting you're not going to eat and the sad thing about it is she told me a few stories because up to this point i had dr fielder so then i started asking her about some of her experiences sexually and physically romantically and that's when she started sharing with me some of the things she experienced um previously in life like one time she was out in a foreign country and she ended up giving a taxi guy a hand job no kidding and then she told me with the guy who's our current boyfriend um how she ended up kissing him basically he just made her do it and things went on from there and so i shared these stories with you to let you know that you might be afraid of being aggressive what you're really afraid of is rejection you're not afraid of being aggressive you're afraid of getting rejected but let me tell you this the importance of being aggressive is that the woman picks a side right she either separates you into the guys that she likes and is interested in she gives you a little bit of play or she just you know holds you at bay and tries to you know play keep away for a little bit because as i tell you if a girl wants to stay with you she has to play with you right so that might be one strategy but what will never happen a woman will never be interested in you and take you out of the game because you've been aggressive because the true fact of the matter is that women who like a man are generally gonna go along with what he wants and if they're gonna if they're in that stage of still playing with you so that they can retain you um then they're just going to forgive your aggressions because they expect you to be aggressive because you're attracted to them so it's not a shocker to them that you're being forward sexually it just affirms to them that you're attracted and they expect guys to act like guys so anytime you're in your head talking about oh maybe i should maybe i shouldn't oh you definitely should and if she rejects you now first thing you have to understand there's a difference between rejection and delay often women will delay if they like you if they're really feeling you and they want to build up a real relationship with you they're going to delay you you know try to hold off because they know the longer they can hold off on the sex they're basically creating a situation in which you're more likely to be attached to them so they delay you sometimes you can confuse delay with rejection rejection has a level of finality if a woman rejects you that might mean she's not she's not interested she's not dealing with you she really viewed you as a friend and was milking you for your time emotion attention and finances and never planned on giving you a piece of pie so you have to understand the difference that's why being aggressive is a good thing in many cases because it makes her situate you on the right side is it on the right side of the fence where she's saying yes there's something here there's some potential or she's situating you on the left side of the fence letting you know like nah bruh you is never gonna get this you was never gonna get any of this good good i was just playing with you you did so it's always good to you know press her and make her let you know what's really possible within that relationship and looks like we're going to probably make end up making this one exclusive for the members so here's another story i had a time where i was at a charity event and they had like a casino night and basically you do gambling someone asked that i take the minimum wage video down no i put it exclusive on patreon.com the saint the center um for the the you know the people who support my work you know i always like to show love to those who show love to me saint and yeah so so that one is exclusive you know because for me it's like um you know those folks who really mess with me even when i take something down that i might not want public because it has a personal story or it has a lot of vulgarity i always try to make sure i put it back up for the members we also have a lot of exclusive content that will be coming on the members on the website so so that's there for them um shout out to uh edwin brunord since through the super chat the tuition truly appreciated saying he popped it off that's love um so another story i was at a charity event like a casino event so you basically um get your chips just like you would at a regular casino except you're not really gambling in the sense that when you buy the chips you're not gonna get any money back there's no such thing as winning all of the proceeds go to uh charitable cause so anyways i'm there at this event and i'm you know shooting craps next to an older woman who was 50 years old exactly i know that because she eventually told me but we just happened to end up next to each other by chance we're both gambling and we start talking but when i walked up to the table i just happened to walk up next to her not because i wanted to but there was an open space and so because i was next to her i could see her out of my periphery and this woman was staring me up and down it's like she was waiting for me to turn and acknowledge her and because i could see her out of my periphery giving me the eye i had no real hurry to acknowledge her because i knew that we were just drawing in more hunger and more interest and so i waited took my time acknowledged everyone else at the table and then acknowledged her and then as we were playing the game she was you know having conversation with me i was keeping my responses brief because as auntie val tells you um you know when you're a good-looking man or when a woman finds you to be attractive you need not talk yourself into her underwear your issue will be talking yourself out of her underwear so when you know you're already in the advantageous position your best bet is to keep silent and keep cool and so i made sure that i did that so anyways we're carrying on with the with the charitable activity and we're having conversation and she's really trying to my brain she's very interested and curious and i think part of it was that i was a lot younger than everyone else at the charity event which would suggest that you know i've been very successful very quickly and so anyways um eventually a man comes over her husband and so she introduces me to her husband and her husband wants to go off and do some other things play roulette and things like that so he leaves uh the two of us and i surmise that he didn't see me as a threat because i'm significantly the junior of his wife and by the way his wife for sure was a lot older but also very attractive yeah big and as i said in my previous video date rich women yes indeed and she preserved really well so anyways uh we we continued enjoying and having conversation and then um you know i could tell by the nature of her questions that she's very interested one thing i can advise you guys on if you are ever talking to a woman whether it's an older woman or woman your age and she's like deeply curious as to why you're single or she starts talking about hooking you up with her sister or hooking you up with her friend or all of these things this is really language that she's using to distance herself from saying directly hey i find you attractive i would like to have you for myself but i am married you see so she's using all of this language that is making it very clear to me that she is personally interested and so it got to the point to where when her husband came back over you know he was just dropping in from time to time bringing her drinks and things like this her husband came back over she leans over to her husband and says if i ever cheated on you it would be with this guy right here and so this is obviously not a normal thing that you want to say they obviously have a very strong bond you dig but she basically leaned over to her husband said if i ever cheat on you be with this guy right here so then he got to the point her husband chuckles and leaves and i respect his response because he kept it player you dig when you're in a situation like that there are very few good ways you can react right all you can do is laugh it off and maybe cancel the chick later or you know talk it out later but there's no appropriate way to react in the moment that's going to advance you so anyways um he leaves i continue on and at this point i'm just i'm just inching inching inching up because she's knocking back all these drinks and so i start whispering in her ear while i'm getting the dice to throw them and then i'm telling her all these things because if you know anything about shooting craps which i hope you don't there's something called a hard ten which is a five five and so you know i was telling her like hey i'm trying to roll the five five the heart ten it's the big one on the end and so i started saying all these sexual things in her ear and she's getting extremely turned on and so basically we we sit there and play together for about four or five hours and and she's basically melted by the the end of the experience then the but i didn't lay a hand on her mind you then it was a two-day event so i come back the next day you see and i see her in the venue and i see her husband i wave to the two of them and you know they wave back and then i go back to that same spot and then she eventually comes over and she says you know you know when i went home you know i had researched you so i was very interested to know your story and she's like you're a very humble young man i'd like to go thank you very much and then you know we we continue back gambling and then i go back into the the sexual conversation which at this case i always tell you guys not to speak sexually but this is higher level stuff i'm telling you guys introductory level stuff for the most part but when i already knew that i had her where i wanted her on the chess board you know it was just teasing and bantering because she already has her husband her husband's there she supposedly is faithful and so everything that i'm saying to her is entertaining it's humorous it's sexual but it's not a threat because there's an age gap it's not a threat because her husband's right there and women really like this when you're dealing with the taboo the age gap the race difference you're dealing with the the allure of doing something that you shouldn't be doing and having a very personal sexual conversation in the public sphere around all these classy people who are dressed up but only she can actually hear me so this was exceptionally stimulating for this woman and then the second day being that she came back over to where i was i knew that she was entranced and so being that she was under my spell i decided to escalate things further so in addition to throwing the die and saying crazy things in her ear um i started you know touching her just to see you know how she would react you know like having physical proximity like having my body rub against her body and then eventually putting my hand on her back and then into other places you see so escalating it and she was completely you know happy and pleased with it and i tell you the story for this purpose so eventually um funny so eventually uh by the end of the night you know her her husband comes back over and she had taken my business card and she was telling me like hey you have to come out to to my city um come out to austin i got a chicken farm there like i'll make you like this i'll make you that and you know we can all do blah blah blah we're gonna throw a party and so on and so forth anytime you come to austin please look us up i'm going to send you an email give you all my information now she ended up not sending that email and i never expected her to send that email for a couple reasons what number one she's married so once she was out of my spell i knew that there was very little influence i could have when she she was outside of my influence she would return back to her normal senses not being sexually stimulated or under the spell of my personality you see so i knew that i should expect no follow-up even though in the moment she looked me in my eye and told me that which is common and i know you've probably had women look you in your eye and tell you something that's completely untrue you know this is kind of what they do which is why there's the terminology of a man of his word but there is not the analog of saying a woman of her word right so that's something to understand but what i want to point out to you is that in that moment that i had her within my reach in a literal sense and also a figurative sense i could have done anything with her if i wanted to have her you know walk off with me to a private area and ravish her i could have done that you see all of the things that i did in that situation she did not rebuff any of my advances a very feminine woman though she might not make an advance when you make an advance she's going to submit to that if she's interested in you but the key is that you have to make that aggression right and then she's gonna allow it to fly and that's why i want you guys to understand that a lot of situations in which you're dealing with women if you don't push the gas on them you may never get another opportunity in fact sometimes when you push the gas on a woman and escalate sexually when you're successful you've actually increased the bond because as you know females are emotional animals and when they lay down with you so to speak that bonds them to you and even if the woman is promiscuous certainly having that physical connection with her versus not having it is going to improve your ability to retain that woman and also get around to honor and depending on the female if she doesn't feel that aggressive action from you you know you might be one and done you know she might not even ever deal with you again she gave you an opportunity you didn't take it my last anecdote for you all as you may know i found a fraternity uh in university and then i eventually lived in san francisco so my fraternity we'd have these events right after we graduated with like the fraternity guys sorority girls so people who are young good looking wealthy living in san francisco so we'd all meet up at a club and have a party and there was one time i was there and i was watching one of the fraternity guys who came in the fraternity years after me but i was familiar with him and he was pressing this one sorority girl super hard we're in the club he's trying to dance with her she keeps like wiggling away and walking away he keeps grabbing her hand and she keeps walking away and like guys are like elbowing me like what should we do something like should we grab him now obviously i founded the fraternity i was the president of the fraternity so guys still look to me as a the leader even though you know we're not in the formal structure and i was like nah nah let's see what happens she hasn't really shut them down you know she playing hard to get right now so we watched the situation play out over two hours they're both drinking he keeps trying to hug her she's moving away he keeps grabbing her arm she's walking away he's pursuing her by the end of that night she was putty in his hand after all of that fighting that she did all that struggling by the end of the night they're making out and i'm pretty sure he closed that deal you dig persistence overcomes resistance especially if you're confident about it and you looked in that woman's eye and you saw something there and certainly he saw something and brought it out of her the female animal is a very curious animal and she likes a struggle you dig you gotta be the hunter she likes to be the hunted you both have to play your role don't you ever fail to play the role of a hunter and i watched this young man hunt and man he caught him a nice little antelope i can tell you that now let me address some of these super chats and by the way peace to edwin for popping off the super chats that means a lot it's always a very manly thing to take leadership and step forward yet carrying on and i'm on a new technology so um you know do forgive me as there may be a little bit of delay as i address some of these things a learning curve we shall say dark dizzy since through the super chat he writes i'm going to pursue an mba after undergrad what are your thoughts on this saint i recommend that you get some experience first because then your mba will have more meaning which is to say that an mba is a business degree but there are many aspects to business i can tell you that i was invited to very prestigious um mba uh programs in chicago and i've given lectures at uh a good number of them and i don't have an mba but i have experience and i've run companies and this is very valued and so for that i would recommend that you consider doing the same so that when you do your mba you know you're doing it with a focus on hey this is how i want to operate within the business i want to be the the ceo or i want to be a fill in the blank title so i i recommend that mba is very good for giving you a grasp of of numbers you know within a business you know on you know how do you drive profits and things like that but often mba programs are focused around looking at case studies of highly developed businesses and often you know people want to start businesses they don't get a good education in that from an mba program victor sense through

stallion otw just paying tuition piece of the saint what does otw mean i actually don't even know what otw means i hate to admit minute you have to let me know right honeybee they want top tier men to be aggressive oh i truly agree if the woman is interested in you there's really no level of aggression that will get you in trouble in fact the actual definition of sexual harassment is is not what you do it's who's doing it so for example i remember that i was at a party in uh university it was actually on uh off-campus function in oakland and i walked up to a unicorn it was an asian girl with a fat butt super thick in these uh jean shorts and i walked up to her my exact words were turn around and shake that ass for me i licked her dead in her eyes and said turn around and shake that ass for me she looked up at me and shook her head and smiled turned around and shook that ass for me now the reason that she did it was because when she looked at me she liked what she saw and she liked she had to respect the way i came at her uh because she could tell i was like really that guy conversely if i was unattractive to her overweight not confident and i use the exact same words and she was not impressed with me as an individual man well you see her reaction would have been different and she could have even considered that harassment right but it's only harassment if the girl is not interested in you so for example how many guys ask a woman permission to kiss her no one right so if you're out with a woman and you're feeling it and you go in for the kiss and you kiss her and she kisses you back you're good to go but if you see a woman and you're feeling it and you're going for the kiss and she doesn't want to be kissed because she's not attracted to you then she can consider that harassment it's an unwanted advance so it's important that a you be confident but also b you'll be able to perceive if that woman's open to you but also you gotta test the waters you dig and ain't nothing wrong with testing the waters i think you'll be all right don't have any worry you guys worry too much covert wolf writes salute to the assassin if you let a woman dictate you will just dry her up take the lead that's so real that's so real in fact i have one young lady that i was just thinking about today who is very feminine extremely competent she does beautifully if you set her to a task but if you don't set her to a task and you leave her to her own devices to figure out which way to go baby girl is lost because that's not her strong suit she's she doesn't like to be in a leadership position i've even had females who will tell me hey i don't like to make decisions just just go ahead and make the decision and that's a real woman who's really in tune with herself a really feminine woman you dig takes a lot of confidence for a woman in our era to say hey i don't like making decisions i like you to make the decisions let me know which way boss and we gonna roll that way shout out to jelani jackson he writes d and i want to hit a few more of these super chats [Music] honey bee rights be aggressive with women what what woman in her right mind once an

i said i'm on a new technology so so do bear with me saints i'm not confident i'll use this one again scrolling is less than ideal here i'm gonna wrap this one up shortly let me just hit these uh super chats i want to show love to those who show love to me uh as a man you gotta pay what you owe and as people have um put in their super chats i'm gonna honor it like for example this individual ahmed khan writes why'd you ignore my super chat bro well ahmed i haven't gotten to your super chat and why you would even say something like that after watching me over time i don't teach this this is emotionalism anyone on here who's watched me for any amount of time they know i take out my time to address super chats there's no reason that i would ignore your super chat you are you occupy no space in my brain i have no ill will towards you so there's nothing motivating me to ignore your super chat so what you would really be wise to do is as a man stay calm don't get emotional and just post again super chat in all caps and write it out but this kind of thing shows a lack of faith i just don't understand why you would question that after like over a year of me doing the exact same thing which is being careful to address every super chat i just don't understand this kind of thinking it's like it makes me feel as though my teaching goes in vain it's like i try to teach values and like some people are just not soaking it up oh allison right so you're not going to read my cash app okay so let me see what you're saying boy i mean y'all are going crazy today it's like what are people drinking it's like is this are y'all drinking bad coffee or something uh allison writes that is why i call you nephew heart thank you alison well y'all don't be patient out here give me a second i gotta turn off the the heat is getting toasty [Music] all right yeah sayings i mean what i'm trying to understand is can we have some patience and understanding i mean i could understand if i'm just a random person off the street but it's like this does merit displayed over time not mean anything we can't have any faith and loyalty my cats ask me why i ignored their super chat yeah where does this come from okay boy i mean this is a special day today okay larry q writes appreciate your energy king a lot of these other youtubers energy be way off why is that lol you know i think a lot of it is because they're faking i'm when i watch these guys i'm shocked and even my assistants who are wise intelligent women and i don't agree with all of their their life ways but they'll even watch other people's content and they'll say like marquette like why are they using all of these like sound effects and all of this like hocus pocus stuff i was like because you know in the absence of meaningful insight they have to keep people entertained and so they use like all of these sound effects and all of these video effects because they're not you know intelligent enough or experienced enough or wise enough to be able to hold court and sit and just lecture they don't have the brains or experience and a lot of them are living a fake life you see they might tell you how to get girls but in real life they don't know how to get girls they've never had that in their blood and so it's just a lot of goofiness that's why the energy is off because it's fake and you know when you see me in real life the things that i really say i really live like that and like even these guys who you know they talk reckless on the internet when they see me in real life i'm going to be the exact same way and that's what i encourage for you guys it's easy to be who you really are thank you for that question ghosts writes thank you for your word piece of the saints thank you saying i really appreciate that it means a lot yasir writes good day saint i hope all is well what is the difference between a female playing hard to get not interested and playing you for attention thanks well a female who is not interested you should be able to sniff that one out the quickest right because if she's not interested there are certain things that she's going to not give you she is not going to give you any of the levels of affection that you want she is not going to ever contribute meaning show a balance to your efforts for example you'll find that you're always paying the check and that's because she's only there for you to take her out to dinner you see she's playing you for your income she's playing you for whatever you can offer but she's not out to get your true affection she's leveraging your affection as a tool against you in her benefit so it should be very easy to sniff out the one who's not interested the reason it's difficult for some guys to sniff that out because they're not looking for what is they're not looking for the reality they're looking for what they want just on my live stream a gentleman said to me he said marquette i dm'd a girl on instagram and she told me that she wasn't going to go out with me unless i sent her some money for food like you know i guess i he sent her some uber eats money now i said well why are you asking me how to respond to this girl you should block her or better yet you know screenshot that message and put it on your story and put her on blast because she's a piece of trash who's trying to exploit you for no reason you know me personally i say be good to good people and i truly believe that and you have to realize there are also wicked wicked people out there and in my book there's a chapter entitled learn the enemy destroy the enemy and that chapter is about knowing that there are people who intend to do you harm and if you identify those people who intend to do you harm you ought to do your best to give them your worst because as i write in the black box when you are not striking at your enemy you are allowing them time to prepare to strike at you and any person male female senior citizen toddler who would try to strike at you is your enemy and some differences are irreconcilable and i come from an environment in which you gotta settle those differences you dig and whether it's in corporate whether it's in a ghetto whether it's in civilized society anytime you have an enemy you should seek to destroy them or [ __ ] them or put them in a state of crippling fear so that they don't play any games and they don't uh erect an army against you because this can happen in the work environment in which you know there was just one person who didn't like you you let them flourish and then now there's two three four five people who don't like you and then there's a whole culture against you so you must always be smooth and play some finesse moves but always you know engage in that chest so that you can take down the other side straight g turo appreciate the support saying yes you're right ye of little faith so many have very little faith and it's amazing too because a gentleman asked me was i going to ignore his super chat as though that's something that i do i even read out super chats of people who are writing negative things in the super chat you are purchasing visibility and i'm going to give you your visibility because that is what you are doing with the super chat carry no self made rights peace of the saints we need more men like you teaching the gospel absolutely and by the way as i said i'm using a new technology i'm learning how it's displaying the super chats and it just writes them in text so they're not colored so it's harder to pick them out so i'm scrolling through i have to read every single message [Music] the funny thing is like when you have supporters big air quotes you have supporters who are coming at you foul like man you don't need enemies huh it was crazy [Music] allison writes that cash i was in reference to the lady over 50 you are awesome sweetheart good night thank you very much for the support allison i truly appreciate it wishing you a good night and i put my volume on metal baby slayer sends through a cash app and just a heads up guys no matter which technology i'm on the cash app is easier because i don't have to read through a thousand chats to see your your message so obviously cash up is easier metal baby player rights just got my shirt quality is amazing i'm very happy to hear that and you're part of a special group because there are no more shirts all right like you got like the last shirt so metal baby slayer appreciate the support i'm glad you enjoy it and yes the quality is great it's mercerized cotton and i picked it for myself because that's what i love to be love to wear i love to have the women touch that mercerized cotton and say oh what is that yeah [ __ ] that's that mercerized cotton learn about it okay and and saints by the way you have to use your head if i'm having trouble reading the super chats and you think i've skipped your super chat clearly it's not on purpose it's because there are you know 600 people online and they're all chatting so i'm just encouraging you guys to to be thoughtful before you make remarks lamar writes blessings king am i wasting my time being on these dating apps like tinder bumble i feel like the ones i meet are damaged because yes of course they're damaged goods and of course you're wasting your time it's a it's a last resort just when you haven't worked hard enough in the real world spitting game out in real life this is what you resort to for connection because all human beings want connection you want to feel engaged a part of a community you want to feel love and affection and this is like a it's like the dating apps versus spitting game in public is like masturbating versus having actual sex i hope you understand the differences and the accompanying levels of satisfaction okay by the way if i did not read what you wrote um please don't retype it in the chat if i didn't read it that's because it wasn't super chatted and if i haven't read your super chat that just means i haven't gotten down to it so if you did super chat you can retype that just type super chat in all caps and then retype what you wrote but if you're not super chatting please don't spam the chat scientific method right i want to thank you for being an innovator and a leader thank you lewis writes hey saying i'm 18 and going to study law at university what should i be doing in my free time outside of school right now well it depends on what you want in life lewis you know if you really want to lawyer if that's your true calling fantastic i think very few people's true calling is to be a lawyer at least based on the gentleman and ladies that i know i think what they really want is distinction they want respectability which is why they become an attorney because like being a doctor generally in most societies these are viewed as prestigious professions but if you want wealth lawyering will get you into the middle class but it will not get you into the upper class only business and creating products will do that so i would encourage you to start creating products whether it's you know doing one of the following which is to innovate create a product that's not been created before to um excuse me to create create a product that's never been created before or innovate which is to improve upon an existing product or to add degree to a product which is to take a product and you know make a modification in degree like for example i produce the world's longest hand wraps which gives you more padding and protection i've changed the degree of something and that makes it something i can market so think of products in those terms and go ahead and get started on creating one psyche it's good to see psychiatry we actually had a consultation i think we're talking about image during his consultation psychiatrist my guy it's great to see how the channel is progressing thank you i appreciate that and there's so much work that we're doing outside of the youtube sphere outside of the live streams things like that and by the way uh to the people who have advice and they're in the chat and they're giving advice to me and you're not super chatting it let me warn you i don't care what you have to say if you can't afford a dollar to super chat what you have to say either you're broke or it's not important to you so don't give advice chat amongst yourselves but don't give me advice because your advice means little to me i only take advice to people who are above me and i highly doubt that you're if you're in the chat and you don't have a dollar to super chat you probably are not in a position to give me advice so keep your mouth close that's some good game you keep your mouth closed giving people advice who don't want it then you can focus on yourself getting a stronger position you know self-focus is really uh the key i was at a dinner earlier today um with some older folks and with a young lady and they all started talking about something negative and i just clearly changed the subject and i think they could all tell like wow he just hijacked the whole conversation shut it down and changed it to something positive and it's like yeah i'm not going to sit here and listen to people complain the mirror writes peace to the saints and thank you for your work last life inspired me to work out twice today morning run and lifting in the evening shout out to you say i'm happy to hear that in fact you inspire me because i need to hit the gym tonight cartoon master writes dating an older woman who is in love with you i'm 19 she's 20 with two kids she's been buying and cooking and started training mma with me keeper well saint uh shout out to you [Laughter] certainly this woman has a level of immaturity if she's dealing with a 19 year old so you have to be aware that she has some things in her that are not quite right but you never want to discard an asset if the woman is providing for your basic needs she's treating you she's cooking and she's indulging you know engaging in your interests then you know there's some something good there and at the end of the day you have to realize that you have to live your life and enjoy what is good for you what is good for you may not be good for others so don't let anyone else tell you what to do me i say it sounds like she's an asset as long as she's operating in that way within your life i would go ahead and keep her around though i surely would not have her as a main woman for the long term because it is a unusual thing to see a woman deal with a man who's 10 years her junior thank you super chat just signed up for emperor level thank you for your words of inspiration looking forward to working with you joshua absolutely it'll be a pleasure and as soon as you you sounds like you're already signed up you can just uh shoot a dm we literally before i got on this live stream we returned all of our patreon dms um so you can shoot a dm on patreon or you can email bridget at fletchab.com say hey um i am at the emperor level i want to schedule my consultation for this month and she'll get you set up so welcome welcome by the way everyone you know um shout out to joshua he he's you know he's getting deeper into the sass and also taking out time to um you know grow something that's important to him whether it's his finances his image or his uh ability to do business or his relationships whatever the case is but he's seeking some growth so that's a beautiful thing ahmed khan writes is a woman's hair length an indicator of how feminine she is this is a very interesting question i would say no it is not generally you know some women may have what's called a bob which is shorter hair and someone may have very long hair and in fact at the place i used to live right above me there is a lesbian with enormous breasts like it was a loss to mankind just enormous natural breasts and very long hair but she was super gay and then being super gay i could never really define her as super feminine but her hair was very long conversely if you have women who have a very short haircut a buzz cut and there's no flavor to it no styling and in addition to that she has masculine characteristics i would say you probably want to stay away from that but generally speaking i don't think the hair length is a strong indicator of anything really uh abdi writes what is your cash app i believe my cash up is on the banner at the bottom is that not populating for you guys it's tag marquette m-a-r-q-u-e-t-t and obviously as i said that's the easiest way for me to see your question or comment because i don't have to read through everyone's uh non-super chatted thoughts yeah alex says let's see more positive chats agreed i don't understand why anyone would waste their time with negativity it doesn't pay strict dad writes you're the wisest of masculine role model content creators thank you thank you for your light better parents better children better world that's real talk and that's that's the core of what we're working on in fact if you're on the community tab you'll see that i just posted um you know something about the las vegas school district basically their their sex education committee is all females all white females in fact which is not reflective of the student body and you can imagine they're extremely liberal and this is why your kids are top poison it starts in elementary school one of the topics on the agenda was teaching about gender identity that's a new topic isn't it so really what they're teaching is gender confusion carrying on yeah get those likes uh by the way because we have a lot of frenemies here we have people who say they believe but they don't really believe they pretend so go ahead and get those likes up and the weird thing too about about this is that we have such high levels of mental illness in this society that people follow me um just to hate it it's concerning these people are really mentally ill i'm going to type my cache up in again i see someone asked about it twice there is my cache tag m-a-r-q-u-e-t-t okay and this new technology i'm using just a heads up it doesn't even show me if my moderators are on so and it doesn't even allow me to block anyone from here so that's why you might be seeing more more trolls than normal eric writes peace to the saints been watching your older content you got bars marquette when is the saint the center ep coming out tuition you know what man i i hate to admit it but i feel like i have more bars than 99.9 of the rappers out there um so i really do want to take out some time at some point and come out with some more music because i enjoy it and as i often tell you guys you should have a list of things that lift you up you know when you might feel depressed or down i have a list of things that lift me up and rapping is one of them i don't rap very much because i don't get down very much um but it's something i enjoy and i appreciate that saint um so for all of you who who do love real bars uh check out your boy at soundcloud.com slash q-u-e-t-t your mother writes peace to the saints piece of saints once more i can't teach every i can't catch every stream but keep speaking the truth marquette keep achieving and chasing your dreams people real talk that's a it's a beautiful positive message and people who speak negativity that's because that's what they have in them people who speak positivity that's what they have in them you should always seek to have that in you that's a beautiful thing to share a strict dad said hell no let her go two kids he's [Laughter] outro evan writes bro how many times did luis get banned yeah i know that it's strange that some people would get banned and it's like they keep coming back and these are some of the things that i find concerning you know with people okay we got a super chat by a cash app ace the baller rights looking forward to a consultation with you tomorrow okay you have a consultation with me tomorrow let me check my calendar i don't think i have one on the calendar for tomorrow saying check my email maybe just a book one but ace the baller i just read your uh super chat you said you have a consultation tomorrow i don't have one on my calendar but i will i will check and i've never missed one so i let you know what if you do have one it will be on it i've never missed one single consultation in life so thank you for the cash app okay [Music] alex sanders writes can someone block infinite accounts it's that luis alpha omega guys yeah can someone take care of that on this new technology i can't see how to block people and i really don't want to have to block people when we block someone it's not even because they say anything that disagrees with my way it's because they're just being foolish and they're displaying mental illness and we're just trying to keep that away from us so we'd appreciate it if you just leave our our leave our community uh and if we have to block you then we will but you know it's it's preferred that you just leave you know nomadic king writes how do you be how to be an effective leader of women i've created something called a progression of earned male leadership first you must be an effective leader of yourself when you have true self discipline you can control and influence yourself to do the things you don't want to do to wake up early to go to the gym two times a day three times a day four times a day if needed to lose 20 pounds in a week whatever you need to achieve you can leave yourself to do it when i say leave yourself it is the strongest part of you the greatest part of you pulling that weakness out of you and forcing you to do what is right by having a clear direction a clear plan when you are able to lead the self then you will be able to lead a woman leadership begins with certainty right certainty that you can get somewhere it re it goes back to the credo of i can get this done i can figure this out when you get that credo in that thinking and you've also mastered the self at a level and self mastery is a continuing process then you will be a natural leader of a woman you see so that is the start of it alex shares that joe abundance got banned because he's been disrespectful to multiple guests there you go and the important thing to understand is that within the sas and we do have a way and i'm not here to entertain anybody i don't ever call this a show this is a lecture this is a discussion this is an exchange of information um so shout out to all of you who are here for your own growth not entertainment got another um super chat via cash app david garcia writes keep up the good work brother love all of your topics thank you that means a lot because we certainly have some diversity here we're not always just talking about those females you know we're often talking about self-improvement we're talking about the things that are going to make you a great man so that you don't have to pursue women so that women start to pursue you always trying to flip that script you dig okay alex luis you are not strong you're trash i watch your youtube videos you act like a victim in our complete misogynist oh don't hurt him don't hurt him hey saints i know sometimes i get trapped into it but you know what some of these folks you just got to let it go don't bring war to them sometimes you just got to let it go because you can't you can't hurt these psychopaths man you just got to let it slide castro writes i used to watch red pill coaches until you murdered all of them in their ideologies when i was following their advice i noticed i was too mean and showed no love until i got that ism yidding a real talk all the time i have consultations and guys the first thing they tell me is hey man i was on this real red pill bs and i had some good women that i messed things up with because i treated them like dirt now me every now and then i'll tell you hey that woman is worthless treat her like the garbage that she is but you got guys who are trying to be red pill following advice from squares who have never done well with women and who are vengeful against women and they cause you to lose a perfectly good female if you want that exclusive content you really want to support be a part of this assassin you can do that at thesaintandthecenter.com um thank you very much for sharing that fables there's no question mark at the end but it's the same this is patreon.com the saint in the center juan lopez writes how would you check a woman that has crossed the boundaries on what you consider respect peace of the saints you dig juan i think the first thing you always want to gather in any situation is understanding you see sometimes you have a situation wherein you're culturally different from a woman or you have different values you were raised in a different place you're part of a different ethnicity you were raised in a different income level you come from different countries whatever the case is something she may consider normal and it was okay in her household may be disrespectful in your household and so it's a part of you as a leader of first going in with questions trying to get understanding of why she behaved or why she thought in a certain way she may not even know how you perceived it so once you get understanding you download her thinking on it then you engage in some socratic questioning ask her questions how would you feel if someone said that to you or how did you think i felt what outcome did you expect to get out of doing what you did or saying what you said once you get that understanding and you've engaged her with some socratic questioning hopefully empathy takes over and she can empathize or sympathize or comprehend your position if she can't come to that conclusion on her end on her own then you go through the part of explaining to her hey love my values are x y and z and you know they they must be respected here's why and you know can you agree to that and if she can't agree agree to that you know let her go her way and then you go your way it's super simple but what you don't have to do is you don't have to be rude or impolite you know you you really want to be mindful of what your position is if you're the pimping and she's working for you well then that's one thing if you're living as a square she's your main girl she should regard you in a very high level if you're a guy and she's just your side girl you know you can't expect much from her because if she had good values she'd be your main girl instead of your side girl right so you got to be thoughtful about the position everyone is in and shout out to fables man fables and fable's been doing his thing shout out to alex sanders a lot of the saints who are just super you know loving respectful gentlemen and they add so much value to the assassin and also i'm sure they add value to the communities that they live in on a daily basis you did super chat do you believe the app industry is saturated and not worth investment that is time to create apps tuition piece of the saints no the app industry is going to have a lot of when you say saturated which is saying there's a lot of products is it saturated meaning that there are too many no i don't think so the app industry is going to continue to grow what you really need to think about is what's bleeding edge and cutting edge in the app industry apps on the apple watch or apps that are going to be used for wearables you know health tech um things that go into your clothes there's so much that's going to continue to grow in the app market for example just last night i was at a luxury hotel and i just love when i'm in there and i'm saying hey alexa turn off the lights open the drapes turn on the the bathtub water fill up the bathtub you know all of that is app based so technology is limitless it's not saturated it's always a good idea to get deeper into that alex writes yes let's see more talented and loving energy oh absolutely right i bet you would like me to discuss the title i've actually already done that as the early part of the lecture and secondly um this live and often these will be taken down and put exclusive for members at patreon.com so what you like is one thing what you pay for is a different thing so i appreciate you sharing your thoughts alex writes don't entertain weirdos agree uh will cliff writes i don't agree with everything marquette says as a believer of god that doesn't want to be lukewarm but he is mostly right and has a lot of wisdom i can relate to his upbringing as a 16 year old well um saint you won't agree with everything anyone says not even people's children agree with everything that their parents say so what you're trying to do is come together on shared values with people that's how you build community emery writes what's your opinion on young pharaoh i don't know who young pharaoh is i have no idea um if you're on patreon.com just dm me a link if it's important to you but i don't know who it is and and generally speaking i don't have any opinion on any of these youtube characters these people are entertainers um i generally don't look into them but thank you for your super chat of course uh miguel the comedian writes keep being you and i hope you are more successful by the way i got me a second girlfriend beautiful thing oh wow i like to hear stuff like that especially for good people i love when good things happen to good people or better yet when good people earn the good things that they deserve which is the case for miguel so that's a that's a beautiful thing shout out never called that shorty a fake christian quest absolutely get those saints up carrying on ghost writes moving to los angeles from jersey to establish a career in entertainment tips on how to maneuver stay focused

dig for hours on end spin nothing but game shout out to my partner from my hood writes currently struggling to save money a lot due to gambling any advice to stay focused saying i can tell you that gambling is one of the worst vices you can have the only bright side if i'm being honest with you is that losing money is the the best thing to lose if you lose something right better than losing a limb losing life losing a good woman losing money is fine because you can always make more money but i can tell you it is certainly a sin it is certainly something that will hurt you i highly highly recommend against gambling and what you need to do is fill your life with engaging things exercise uh a good woman spend more time with family uh find a purpose that drives you travel get away from those casinos or wherever the hell you're doing this at but i i can promise you that is a very bad thing saying so you know fill your life with those things that are going to keep you away from this very destructive vice bobby writes how do you super chat through cash app you just send the cash app with your comment um within the description and then i read it out thank you for your question cato in my opinion the assassin website is much easier to navigate because it has a search function so you can just type in like dr phil for example it'll pull up all the dr phil video so once you create your membership at assassin.com which is www.t-h-e-s-a-s-n.com then all you have to do is click hub and alex sanders who's actually on the chat right now he manages it and has done a great job so you just click hub it'll populate all the videos there's even a live chat there and you can just type into the search box whichever topic you want and the videos will pop up so it's in that way it's much easier to navigate kyle the creator writes peace to the saints have much respect for you marquette question how can i pursue a girl who likes me but has very controlling parents appreciate it kyle if a girl likes you she will certainly go against her parents for you i promise i've experienced it personally and at some level you know the nature of the female to be rebellious especially in her teenage years surely that will only propel her in her pursuit of you so if her parents are controlling and don't like you that's okay continue to play your part certainly you don't want to speak poorly of her parents because that's just not a civilized thing to do even if they are dirt bags you don't want to speak ill of anyone's family so that's something that you should remember for life but i think you'll be very successful with this girl and hopefully things work out you know you certainly want to be cautious of the reality that people's parenting have an effect on the children if the parents are close-minded or unpleasant then that may have dripped into her personality but i wish you well in that endeavor and her parents will not hold her back the young lady is going to do what she wants to do trust me on that i know from real experience [Music] addressing these super chats again thank you to all of the ladies and saints who have supported the work neutronic wants the link for the black box yeah if you want a low-cost copy you can get it from assassin.com slash the saint oh no slash the black box i think you'll enjoy it in fact if you want a paperback you can get it from amazon.com and you'll see there um there's well over 100 um verified verified reviews you know thousands of purchases but over 100 verified reviews and it's all five star the only reviews that are not five star are the unverified readers which are essentially people who never read the book and um are mentally ill and they hate what i stand for and they've tried to deride me by posting fake reviews but the love outweighs the hate tremendously that's why the book is still at 5 stars super chat via cash app comes through from bobby he writes do you think investing in the stock market is bad no i don't think it's bad in fact if you're investing for the long term i think it's mostly always good so the stock market pretty much always does this it always goes up it's just that it doesn't go up very fast right so that's why i say invest for the long term if you have a diverse portfolio of say ten different companies you spread twenty thousand dollars against uh across ten companies you don't have to be smart you know check back in ten fifteen years you're going to have made money it's just that you will not have made money fast right but you will have made money so i think the stock market is a good thing it's just not something that's going to create wealth it's something that will grow wealth but it's not going to create wealth i hope you understand that fine difference thank you for your super chatted question by a cash app which as i say those are easier for me to find okay and i see folks in the chat saying i should collaborate with certain content creators as i said if someone has the same level of following i'm happy to collaborate pretty much the answer is yes if you want to set it up go ahead and do so me i don't really reach out to internet guys because for the most part i'm not impressed with them but if you ever want to make the connection i'm happy to do so happy to collaborate with them chavante writes peace to the saints peace to the saints i took some of your advice and was smooth and calm at all times i personally love being this way also why does it work though well you see being smooth and calm shows that you have control and presence of mind but certainly there's a time and place for everything what people don't realize is even sometimes one may be calm but one may project anger or project power but smooth and calm if you have it as a primary set primary way of being pretty much you know that always wins i mean think of how barack obama fared during the debates he looks great he kept it smooth and calm now me personally when i see one of my enemies and i'm looking at somebody like you know if we were in person i'll probably body you if nobody was looking and i knew i could get away with it you know i might not be so smooth and calm you know some people are uh are dirt bags and you know i treat them as such but generally speaking smooth and calm is always the way to go if you're never if you're not sure of how to handle it smooth and calm will always win carrying on miguel writes it won't let me send another super chat now miguel because i've seen you so many times and i trust your character just go ahead and type it in i want to honor whatever your question is so if i see it in the chat i will i will honor it because i believe you you see because over time you have displayed consistency so i believe you and you see men that's wisdom i believe him for a reason smokehomes writes your content is worthy of a million plus subscribers keep up the good work hard question what is the meaning of life that is a hard question because that's a question each individual must answer for themselves for some individuals they may say the meaning of their life is to worship god and in worshiping god they fail to serve people right but for them it's good enough and they feel happy and fulfilled so each person defines the meaning of their life for me the meaning of my life is encapsulated in that three sentence bible the three sentence quran the three sentence torah which is be yourself be good to yourself be good to good people you must do it in that order and when you get when you evolve into being able to hit that third point which is be good to good people you have good people around you and you're you're serving them that's a great privilege and it enriches you makes you feel happy and it makes them feel happy as well and you all live better lives so for me that's that's the purpose of my life that's the meaning of my life and each one must define it for themselves which is why sentence number one is be yourself romario comes through with the cash out he writes peace to the saints thank you thank you for that peace to the saints from romario cato writes easier navigation patreon or assassin.com i said assassin.com for sure um there are other folks in the chat you can give your opinion if you've been on both but i for sure would say the sas.com by far when i get messages on patreon.com obviously people at the boston emperor level they're always asking me questions about relationships or questions about business which we reply to um literally i always my assistants will go through sit next to me read every word of every message and i will tell them exactly what's a right word for word um so we never miss messages on assassin or on patreon but one type of message we get on patreon is hey marquette i can't find fill in the blank video because there's not a search function so i highly recommend www.thesasn.com neil hall comes through consistently writes the stream from last night got deleted i appreciate that topic a lot of ism as usual are you going to post it on the members page ps i super chatted earlier it got missed but it's all love brother no harm absolutely whatever you super chatted earlier just write super chat on all caps and then just retype it you don't need to super chat again i'm gonna get it um and i know you come through strong you dig and that um that stream we're waiting for it to process we're going to try to download it and once it's downloaded yes it will definitely go up for members so you can count on that one said some wild stuff in that one last bruh i said some wild stuff in that one indeed abdi writes you made a great impact on my life i appreciate you brother hey that means a lot to me and you know to the gentleman's previous question what's the meaning of life this right here when he says i made a positive impact on his life because i know he's going to go out and do great things and i get to be just a small part of what has motivated him or empowered him or skilled him to be able to do greater things and so as his name grows i feel like my star rises with him so that that means a lot to me when i can lift up men in particular because men lead families and um you know that you you make the world so much better when you lift up men so that's hugely important to me and that's nothing you know not to neglect my lady saints at all because you know i love the ladies okay okay kyle writes thanks a lot her parents actually like me and have met me three times oh you in the game bro i just met the girl three weeks ago whoa and trying to build rapport so if you met her three weeks ago and you've already met the parents three times this is moving very fast this is moving very fast bro so either they're very conservative the girl's very conservative there's definitely some family orientation and that's good that's a good thing you really want a woman who comes from a strong close-knit family so i'm hoping this works out for you keep us posted man it's a beautiful thing and have no fear um if it's meant to work out it will work out sounds like it's going swimmingly and very fast two three one zero sammy posted up that three sentence bible that three sentence quran that three sentence torah be yourself be good to yourself be good to good people absolutely by the way i know there are a lot of people in the chat who are trying to promote their own channel or promote their favorite youtuber it's probably just best to knock it off um if you really want me to collaborate with someone reach out to that person or if you are that person and you have a significant following uh just dm me and then we can set it up but it's no need to promote your your favorite youtuber or yourself in the chat i don't think people are here for that they're here to hear the topic and hear the questions uh being answered so you know like let's not continue with that it's a bit tacky and like you don't have to ask me what do i think of filling the blank person generally i don't think anything of it you'd be shocked at how much i don't watch tv i'm not familiar with the youtubers that you're referring to i don't want to become familiar with them i'm familiar with business people government officials in real life those are the people i do business with i collaborate with i make money with i don't really have any real interest in these entertainers so we can stop mentioning their names because they don't matter and none of you are going to benefit from watching an additional youtuber you're going to benefit from reading the black box and doing what the black box tells you to do which is to focus on yourself and to get to work get to work even my book if you ask me marquette i got three hours today a free time what should i do should i read your book or get to work should i go on your patreon or get to work i'm going to tell you to get to work because it's not about me it's about you bro it's about you getting to work so like keep focused keep your eyes on the prize like we don't need to hear these youtuber names in my comments it doesn't help anybody on the stream so knock it off downer island writes been watching your content for a while and learning and growing while i do it also bought the black box and felt it was time i dropped some tuition thank you donna that means a lot maurice writes peace to the [ __ ] saints druid yes we got another cash app from romario he writes i find consistency difficult oh don't we all i start strong oh i said he started strong but he ain't in this strong i actually have a video romario if you haven't checked it out i highly recommend it because uh consistency really is the difference between a a true champion and someone who is not a champion you can be a champion at many things right um growing your wealth is something that requires a champions mentality for you to maintain it because once you've made money maintaining it is also another additional fight so when you say that you've been good at um you've not been good at consistency i would encourage you to check out a video i caught i created uh for the members only it's called how to be disciplined and consistent so it's especially about this topic so do check it out carrying on okay nathan writes tuition i appreciate your content has changed my life for the better much love thank you nathan and i think that those who really want growth and really want to be successful they gravitate to my content because it's intelligent and it's experience based i never tell you how to do something i'm not done i tell you how to create a business because i've created many businesses around the world i tell you how to get women because i've gotten many women also around the world you dig there's some things bro if you if you knew what i really do hey if you knew what i really do it will blow your mind samantha writes not at all women have all the places in the world to go for guidance she's probably talking to someone else in the chat when i see ladies i like to you know share their comments because they're in the minority in the chat your randy writes i'm always supporting my girlfriend to the point that i feel i was being too nice but she does not reciprocate oh that sounds like a side girl not a girlfriend should i in the relationship thanks should you end the relationship no you should ease out of the relationship and what i mean by that your randy like my og told me call him big brian he's a sports agent and he told me he said marquette it's so much easier to get a girlfriend when you have a girlfriend but when you don't have a girlfriend going from zero to one is so hard he's like i don't know why but there's just something spiritually lacking in a man who has nothing so when you have zero women going from zero to one is freaking hard he said but going from one to two or one to three or two to five is very easy so never get rid of your woman before you got that next woman lined up that's number one and the number two this woman sounds like a dirt bag so she doesn't even deserve the honor of you not lining up that other woman right because if you're supporting her at such a high level and she gives you nothing in return that sounds like exploitation so you know this like you i'm just reflecting back to you what you already know and you know the saint would tell you hey man be good to good people well she's not a good person apparently so you don't need to do that and the center will tell you man [ __ ] this [ __ ] milk her ass and get rid of her and get you a better one uh i just got to keep it real at smokehims right why are women in the workplace so volatile bro why are women everywhere so volatile but i think in the workplace they're under stress from work it seems as though they make easy jobs hard oh absolutely and they love to complain go figure and hard jobs unbearable what is the nature of women to do so well as you may recall from my video which is now private and exclu or rather now exclusive on patreon.com the saint in the center or www.thsasn.com on that video which is exclusive for members it is about the science of the female brain and it describes the fact that within the female brain the area of the brain that is tuned for noticing errors or faults or mistakes is much more active in the female which is why women tend to be nitpicky or you know when it's really carried to its extreme neurotic they notice mistakes but also another thing about the woman is that they don't process stress very well and if we're being honest women are also disinclined to risk you see when women feel like they can't do something right or do it perfectly meaning it's going to have flaws then they go into a stress state and because women are expressive and they're more verbose they're going to share their stress state with everyone around them which is why it tends to be harder to be under a woman who's supposed to be leading because you don't really want to see your leader cracking or falling apart and women tend to be more expressive than men they're more verbose they talk more and so that's why these small problems feel like big problems because they talk it up and they they emote and let their stress out on everyone rather a man would compartmentalize and say okay you know maybe i got into a car accident but now i'm at work i'm going to compartmentalize that set that aside focus on my work when i get off of work maybe i'll tell my wife about the car accident then we can compartmentalize and move forward that is why you're experiencing that difference i understand [Music] persistence overcomes resistance true indeed get a double dose of that marquettism you dig the anecdote for laziness and failure yes it is that elixir that will lift you to greatness cube is writes what's your opinion i want to become a teacher in the future as a black man i would have loved to have seen more teachers that look like me shout out to the saints well cube is ha i appreciate your heart i know that you must be a young man and the truth is that when we are young we are so optimistic and we want to help i was a teacher as a teacher i can tell you that as a man one thing you will require at different levels but at some level and one thing you will desire is more respect teachers get no respect and half the time they don't even get a thank you i would never recommend someone go into teaching if that's your calling you have to do it doesn't matter what i say you have to do it if that's what you're called to but it is a very difficult profession it requires a lot of you emotionally it pays nearly nothing and when you meet a woman and she said what do you do for a living and you say i'm a teacher the vagina dries up immediately oh dry bruh it dries up trust me on that one so if it were me giving you a recommendation as a career counselor i'd recommend anything but it um so there's that there's that whoo sorry sorry sorry it just is what it is jc writes wow just had to throw that five on that jim first lead thyself yes indeed sometimes we bite off more than we can chew [Music] uh miguel i cannot help with that i'm sorry that that is the case but as i said just type in your just type the word super chat in all captions and type what you had to say um you don't even need to send the super chat you know i want to show you some respect back for your loyalty for messing with me for all this time for always showing up with the super chat for never asking for a freebie so go ahead and type that in yet show love to those who show love to you it's real out here um romario sends through the cash app he writes that he eventually returns to old habits yeah romaru what you have to do is when you're trying to get onto a new habit it's one thing to to if you when you're trying to get rid of a bad habit it's one thing to leave your bad habit but you have to replace it with something new right you need something to occupy your time and also you need a focus point to come back to so some people write their their goals in a place that they're always going to go back to like for example on your mirror in the restroom you might use a dry erase marker and write your goals out goal one goal two goal three things that you need to come back to and focus on so i highly recommend you do that you also have to replace bad habits with new habits and you have to keep yourself busy with good things and keep yourself around a peer group that is going to make you competitive meaning that i didn't get my first um bmw convertible until i was living in san francisco in a mini match and with kids i went to college with they all have bmw convertibles my card game has only went up from there you feel what i'm saying but it was all about that company i was surrounded in if i'm surrounded by broke people then it's not going to help me level up i don't even like to hear the thoughts of broke people when i see in the chat and people say oh marquette i don't have money right now but as soon as i get some money i'm going to get your patreon i'm like keep that to yourself just keep that to yourself you know just do what you do keep your eyes on the prize stay focused and when you get your money then do it but don't tell me what you're about to do you see because most people never deliver on what they're saying and what's worse i don't want to hear and i don't want you to speak on your poverty no don't do that don't even put that negativity out in the air you dig be wealthy in spirit if you're not wealthy in the bank account but you don't need to say oh i'm not wealthy right now so when i do get my money i'm gonna do x y z don't make promises that you can't deliver on and more importantly don't speak of poverty don't speak of ill health and don't speak of challenge because nobody wants to hear it you know speak of what you're about to do today to get to fill in the blank stage so keep that mind pure and focused you heard me yeah sounds like we got another cash app that came through so i want to make sure that we read this and honor the folks who are sending them and this one came from jesus christ he writes the love is real i'm loving the saints shirt oh he must have cop one of the those last sane center shirts that's a beautiful thing hey shout out glad you know i one of the things i love about business and this is something that communists don't understand because they're unproductive people as a producer when i produce a product and someone tells me they love my product that makes me feel so good you dig like i feel great that i made something that other people like and it's serving them and they can benefit from them from it and it's a beautiful thing because it's on both sides like i get profit and they get a product that they love and appreciate that helps them with whatever problem they had before they had that product makes their life easier makes their life better that's dope that's the beautiful thing about being a leader being a capitalist being a businessman carrying on rock three of just us writes what is your opinion on freemasonry i've not looked into this anything that circles around the occult circles around the illuminati things like this conspiracy theories or things that seem like conspiracy theories i don't look into it i can tell you guys uh without knowing anything about the freemasons or the illuminati or all that other stuff or the blah blah blah i've made great money and done business around the world which is to say none of these things are important astrology's not important none of it's important these are idle ideas that distract people who are bored or simple-minded so you know you just really want to stay focused focus is everything comes through strong the same is prosperous that's a beautiful thing he writes i respect your knowledge and your willingness to share it i appreciate you and your content stay up chief hey thank you i appreciate you as well see where we are still johnny writes thing is my partners and i are taking space and mother is attracted to me and i think i know i can provide leadership genuine love and security for them i do love god i'm not crazy this is not for all ah still johnny i'm having a little bit of trouble understanding your super chat thing is my partner's with an s so i'm not entirely sure if you mean your business partners or the women you're dealing with my partners and i are taking space i don't know if you're in like a politicist situation you're saying that you're taking space from your your wives or your women that you got and then you write and mother i don't know if you mean your mother your baby's mother or a milf is attracted to me i think and i know i can provide leadership of course you can provide leadership say it writes genuine love and security for them yes you can provide all those things that is though that is what a man is for leadership love security guidance that is what a man is uniquely tooled to provide he writes i do love god i'm not crazy this is not for all uh so i'm gonna just take that as a statement curry goodwin writes peace to the saints peace to the saints fell off of my usual hustle referred back to the keys of discipline and consistency i'm back in the gym i'm back in the gym and my head is back in the books the black box is on the way thank you marquette truly a pleasure and you know what curry if we're being honest as men as human beings women as well you know sometimes we fall down you know for example yesterday i didn't even make it to the gym it's just such a long busy day and i was exhausted by the end of the day i did not make it to the gym i was so exhausted i didn't even know i missed the gym i go to the gym every day no matter where on the planet earth i am you will watch me in china when i'm there in beijing on business i'm still working out every day you will see me in colombia in uh in zanzibar in curacao in dubai wherever i am i work out every day i didn't work out yesterday the day was so crazy i didn't even realize i had skipped a day um so it gets like that every now and then the key is not focusing on where the mistake was made but rather the true measure of a man is how he rebuilds and recovers because life promises challenge you will be challenged with ill health you will be challenged with poverty you will be challenged with death of your loved ones but the measure of a man is how you deal with those things how you smile through those struggles how you recover and build back up how you go broke and then build that bread back up to the ceiling get it so that's a beautiful message that you share with us curry i'm wishing you much ease and prosperity in becoming greater than you ever have been neutronic right i finally figured out this super chat thing question how do i forget the past and make the change i really want to see i'm always putting myself down that's ironic that kind of relates to what we just said number one is let me give you a book recommendation i almost never give book recommendations because i don't know these authors personally but uh neutronic to honor you i think you will benefit greatly from a book entitled in fact you don't even need to buy it you can get it free on youtube on the audio version it's called the power of now by eckhart tolle and he talks about being immersed in the present which is reasonable because in actual fact the past does not exist it happened one time and it never happens again even your birthday does not exist right you celebrate your birthday you were only born one time time is linear there is no repeat the days of the week those seven days that's just a unit of measure time never repeats so when you're living in the past that's silly because you're living in something that's imaginary so once you realize that that's step one step number two is to want things for yourself that are good and those things are usually in the future they're called goals and then to design your present mindset your present actions around getting there but all this comes from self-worth you see you have to love yourself you have to know who you are and acknowledge your own worth and if that's something that you're struggling with there's nothing wrong with talking to someone whether you book a consultation with me www.thesasn.com consultation or email bridget fletchat.com or you talk to a therapist or you talk to a mentor or a preacher or pastor someone you admire because at the end of the day if you're putting yourself down you're missing your biggest cheerleader you are your biggest supporter your self-talk if it's negative you will be crippled i always encourage people i'd much rather see you cocky and arrogant speaking well of yourself saying you're the best ever then putting yourself down you got to be on your side because i assure you when you reach toward greatness there will be many people trying to swat you down you can't be swatting yourself down so i would say you really want to put a big focus on lifting yourself up first and foremost thank you for sharing that meaningful question i'm very sure that a lot of people benefited from that one castro writes missed my last two super chats basic uh question is how do i teach my girl how to self love i don't have cash app available in my country understandable castro wow um this one is related to the last one i first want to challenge you on this castro and you know just try to hear this out number one if your lady does not love herself i'm not saying to throw anyone away now you first want to assess you know how much time do i have in with this woman how deep is our relationship what is the quality of our relationship if the the length of time is there the depth of connection is there then you do need to help build her up but if it's a new relationship you don't want to invest your time in a fixer-upper which is a safe it's like a a piece of real estate you can buy one house that's ready to move in it's beautiful it's shining has curb appeal and there's that other house which is a little bit run down and you gotta invest money in it when you invest money you're kind of taking money out of your pocket for the short term so you want to think about what kind of situation this girl is is she a fixer-upper or is she a woman who's good enough with curb appeal um sometimes it's not worth investing into a fixer-upper right there's too much work to be done so first ask yourself that if you find that she is worth building into and she's having issues of self-love that's a very deep thing and you would first want to make sure that you have a strong rapport with her otherwise you can't effectively doctor fill her and she won't be honest with you and let you get to the root causes that's number two and the number three is she has to want it for herself you can want something very badly for someone else but if they don't want it for themselves they'll never do it for example i love sports and athletics i have great talent in basketball but at six foot not enough talent to go to the league my brother was tall enough to go to the league my younger brother but he didn't love the game i wanted it i wanted it for him but he didn't want it for himself he wasn't into basketball so you can't want something for someone else so you have to thirdly ask yourself does she really want to make a change in her life and if she does a major part of self-love and self-worth is actually being worth something so you should be one who is a mirror and reflects back to her what she does really well what she's good at what her great personality traits are how intelligent she is help her set a goal and work toward achieving it so that she can have self-love and self-worth from a source of something real instead of imagine right and she can point to real things she's really done um so that's my a little bit of advice for you castro thank you for your continued support we appreciate it okay [Music] just pulling up these super chats right now ozdy writes what's the cash have i i think i thought the cash app was at the bottom of the screen on the banner but i'll type it in again the cash office m-a-r-q-u-e-t-t uh please be aware my name does not have an e at the end every now and then people are they might make that mistake [Music] yeah and you know the funny thing is when you catch one of my lives i remember back in the day this probably doesn't happen anymore i never used to buy michael jordan's shoes but a lot of cats in my hood used to buy jordans and it's like when they would come out people would go to the the local sneaker store and just like camp out in front of that joint just waiting for it to open and the dude named walt butler who owned the store he would just open it at random times you did so even if the store is supposed to open at 9 00 a.m he might come at 8 a.m or 7 30 a.m it was basically whenever he woke up and he could get there and you know catching one of my lives is like you dig being in that line for the new jordans yeah because i don't schedule these i do them when i can do them jesus christ is back he writes what's your take on body game not sure what you mean by body game saying but if you mean a man being physically developed i think that is very important is going to make you more confident with that female and women appreciate a man that has some level of size and so i always say you should prioritize size over anything but me as a boxer i cannot prioritize size because then i'm going to go out of my weight class but for sure the size is a factor amir writes how can i improve my attention span i'm a college student and as you say focus is key so i'm looking to improve this weak point of mind number one it's easier to focus on things you're interested in so i encourage you first and foremost to uh try your best to take the course of study that's interesting to you you'll find it a thousand times more easy to focus because you're actually interested in the topic that's number one number two turn off the music so often we're we're using half attention to get things done we're playing music we got netflix documentaries playing in the background while we're working you'll be far more efficient and focused with silence you know go to the library get in one of those little conference rooms just you your books your computer and silence don't play anything in the background focus and get it done when you do that every single day and you put yourself through that work you're going to get better at focusing you have to be able to endure boredom and drudgery that is what makes people successful coding is not fascinating but people who can do it get paid handsomely in fact they are able to make themselves billions of dollars fables appreciate it mfa was one of the greatest moderators in moderator history appreciated saying very honorable man and these are the kind of guys i look forward to the day that that we meet you dig fables writes assassin shirts are all out this is true uh yes those are all sold out and that's why i told you anytime i do a product you need to cop it as soon as it becomes available because i don't do reruns i'm not selling saint center shirts because i want to make money on satan center shirts i got real businesses that make tremendous amounts of money selling t-shirts is not that profitable only reason i ever did that is because with my conference coming up cats want to be able to pull up in that sass and gear they want to represent something they believe in so i made a run for the people who are really about that ism um i'm also going to do a set of pre-orders for the satan center hand wraps uh for for those cats who really get in the gym you dig we're only doing a run of 100. once it's done is done so that you always are wise to get on it as early as you can um sarah mondo truly appreciate the super chat saying thank you for the support showing love to those who show love to him um [Music] sarah mondo i'm not sure if you had like sent to super chain you're trying to send in your message and maybe you sent this after but i'm gonna just look through this make sure that we can uh show love to those who showed up to us but yesterday i asked the girl if she and i and her sister could hang out and she made an excuse i didn't respond and today she sent me a message saying i love you let's link up my sister just my sister just i gotta get to a second message [Music] my sister just broke up with her ex despite not showing interest these past few days how do i respond to a sudden switch up i need an angle on switch ups i'm only thinking of calling her out on it i tell you i tell you what women will appear to be very scatterbrained quite often sometimes it could literally be due to the emotion of the hormones sometimes it could be because they're running a play you will be shocked at how strategic women are with running plays you dig i've even been observed a situation where it was me a female and and the guy and this female was supposed to be dealing with this guy we get out of the car go into a party and then the female turns to the guy says oh i left my purse in the car can you run and go get it he runs and goes in to get her purse from the car and then she starts texting another guy you see she intentionally left that person the car just to give herself the space to send this text that she needed to send and it's just like women think on a different level sometimes so the the manipulation and their ability to think 10 moves out and play chess against you is quite impressive so what i want to advise you to do whatever the case be is you want to get her in person before you engage anything you never want to handle an argument or a disagreement via text message you never want to try to teach a lesson by a text message get in person if you can that's going to help you out kobe after dark writes any advice for being high value when i'm working on my finances i'm 20 years old in med school congratulations saint so most of my money goes toward those dues should i just focus on my career instead of attracting well saying if you're in med school i can promise you that's a very appealing thing i think saying med school um i don't know which country you're in but generally speaking med school comes after you've earned your four-year degree which is generally completed around age 22 if you're on time but most americans take about five and a half years to complete that so starting at 18 that means you know more so around age 23 24 at the earliest you would start med school so i'm not quite sure that you're actually in med school maybe you're getting a nursing degree or a nursing certificate or something like that but whatever the case is when you say being a high being high value i think what you're essentially trying to say is you're trying to get you a woman right let's just keep this i'm trying to get you a woman if you don't have finances trust me there are a lot of women out there who don't have finances i always want to remind you guys that right now out there there is a homeless man who is with a ladybug and she chooses to be with him even though he is broke and that's one thing a true player can teach you is that you don't need money to get a woman you need to be cunning you need to be clever and so don't ever let your bank account put value on you your value is who you are as a man so you always have to think about what the back door is what the alternative option is how do i have a date without spending any money or how do i get her to take me out on a date you did so i want you to engage that intelligence that i know you have and don't think about your deficits think about how you can leverage your assets which is your intelligence marcellus writes peace to the saints quick question how do you let go of someone who doesn't want to change their bad habits easy you stop spending time with them when they reach out to you to hang out you explain that you're very busy doing fill in the blank generally people will accept excuses related to school and work without much question that's what you do if they don't want to change their bad habits leave them where they stand whether they're blood or not because at the end of the day negativity and poverty and laziness those are not inspiring things in fact mostly they will just drag you down yes i highly advise you guys to surround yourself in positivity the company you keep is so important and that's one of the reasons that i read so much because in the absence of good company when you read someone's biography it's like being with them and going through life with them i'm a big fan of benjamin franklin a great man who's accomplished a tremendous amount and you know when i read his story of his life i get to learn some real boss moves and you know it's better it's like having him as a friend he gives you access to his mindset to his way of being i'd rather you know read a biography of a great man and use my time on that than using any amount of time hanging around people who are my inferiors and will teach me nothing and what's worse inevitably be jealous when i outpace them huh andro writes i'm 18 and you're really giving me all this game say so true being aggressive with women makes her choose and prevents my time being wasted rex gets it yeah true indeed talk to me now i love when i see the youngins who who really get it that's how i know they're in the field if you're not in the field half the things that i say aren't going to make sense to you because you don't have enough experience with women to say oh i saw that i experienced that so this man is really in the field and go crazy sent through the super chat truly appreciate it elon i talked to elon earlier today it's such a beautiful thing talking to the young man i know he's going to be successful he's good-looking and intelligent no homo but the fact is when you're a good-looking young man bruh the world opens up to you when you're intelligent as well you got that combination that's powerful man he writes great speaking with you earlier marquette your mentorship and advice the past few months has helped me with my growth tremendously peace to the saints and the other beautiful thing about elon is that we've stomped on the same land you dig university of california berkeley student and transferred in just like i did and i don't mean to put your business out there elon but it's just exciting to have that level of commonality and to see what he can do with that same environment that i had when i see somebody walk through that same road that i walked i want to see what they can do with it you dig it's exciting it's almost like a game and i want to see him beat the game i want to see him do more than i did with it so this is a beautiful day i'm very proud of the young man and i'm excited to see what he pulls off oh yeah samantha writes kobe the man i married told me no i'm too busy for relationships i can't be distracted it was love at first sight worry about you a worthy woman will find you from samantha there you go and i think this also reaffirms what i've said many times about a real woman does not want to be the center of your life she wants to be right next to the center the center of a real man's life are his goals his pursuits and what you will find is that you are if you're focused in pursuing your goals guess what a woman is on the way to those goals meaning if you're if you're really hustling you're going to encounter lovely women on the path to success trust me subbadai one of the saints who came to the conference he writes been so busy and haven't been sponging up this knowledge lately tuition for the good word truly appreciated saying we're gonna have to link up soon i'm thinking about doing something out here in vegas for march madness i gotta you know check with my contacts see what we can uh arrange i've been so busy i haven't had time to to get a hotel suite set up we'll see what's up okay just going down to hit these uh super chats the same writes if a woman has hsv 1 is that a write-off i believe hsv is a medical code word for herpes ah man i i try to stay away from it if i'm being honest with you you know you don't want to write off a human being but certainly if you don't have that i probably want to stay away from that if i'm being honest with you saint you know it's for your future you can still show her love but i'd probably skip ozdy writes help was at a state tournament and didn't approach a baddie all brah was always friend was always friends was always with friends and didn't have the guts to get rejected in front of hella people i feel you i feel you bro i would i mean there have been times i failed to approach a chick not a ton of times there have been times and that's why i say always when you wake up in the morning get suited and booted you dig hey you shave you know i'm saying um whatever you do shave put on your smell good cologne dress to the nines because you don't know who you're going to encounter you want to feel like a lion when you see that antelope and there here's another sign you might not be in the right company because i could tell you what if i was with my people and we saw a bad chick and i was your age and i know around what age you are because we've had a consultation and we saw a bad chick we'd be trying to hey we'd be trying to race to see who could go holler at her first you did and if somebody got shut down nobody's gonna hate on you cats are like hey you i'm glad you did that because we can't let that slide and so you got to be around people who are in that beautiful energy you dig people who really are in the game they understand that you take losses in the game michael jordan didn't win every game and he didn't hit every shot we only remember the shots that he did hit which is to say if there's 20 attractive women and you get shut down by 19 but you catch the 20th one hey using the game bro so don't worry about that at the end of the day people who have something to say about how you perform spitting game you were in the game they were in the bleachers their opinion matters not the old boy said he left the stream thinking i was going to end it got him that's why you shouldn't end till we end with the creed of assassin you did that's how we end around here creole cajun writes this guy is super intelligent and doesn't have to tear anyone down to educate i love what he's doing i'll cash out them you got this oh got the love face oh that's a little pretty little thing go ahead shorty boy i mean i love women you know y'all can't tell me nothing i love them all um shout out okay let's see yeah and don julio schwa who's been with me for a long time real saint jedi here i shout out to fables true indeed and that's what i love man i love to see people showing love and a real mark of confidence is when you can compliment someone else man like me i'm super player bro when i show up i know i'm super player like can't nobody take nothing off of me can't nobody tell me nothing and because i'm so convinced that i'm that guy it's nothing for me to look at somebody else and say hey man oh that shirt right there that's cold you james bond man it's nothing for me to compliment another man i'm up here i don't mind bringing somebody up here with me and if they up here i don't mind saying what it is you did because i feel that good yeah so shout out to the real men who are not trying to be alpha who were just keeping a player and enjoying life and they're happy to show love to those who deserve it shout out to those people when i can advise you as a woman a good woman she loves positivity she's nourished by that if she hears you hating on somebody that's going to rub her the wrong way trust me s smokings writes i had only one black male teacher he was hard knocks he was a gym teacher but he taught masculinity and to get up if you fall down we need more of that we need we need more masculinity that's for sure i can't in good conscience advise anyone to become a teacher but i do respect those who pursue that vocation for it is a calling and undoubtedly if you pursue that out of your heart you are a saint there's no doubt about that still johnny writes basically my shorty's mom is choosing me uh-oh she's choosing me in the spirit world right now i must learn how to court them both in a healthy way even though scripture is against it any pointers well still johnny this is a curious dynamic dynamic because you really want to think about what you want right what you want in the short term in the long term so number one it's highly unlikely that you're going to be able to have both the daughter and the mother because unless the daughter and the mother have engaged in perversion before they're not going to both be one of two of your women collectively that's not going to happen but you can get one or the other for sure but you have to ask yourself obviously younger is always better the facts if the younger woman if you think you can be have something real with her in the long term for sure go with her because if you go with the mom at any amount of time is going to ruin it's going to poison the well you won't be able to get the young one so if the young one is suitable to be a main girl and have her around for good go for her if that's not the case then you might go for the mother because the center would tell you the mother she probably got more bread she could lay a little bit of guap on you um you know there's a lot more peripheral benefits you dig a lot more side benefits you're going to get by going with the mother so hey let me know how it turns out you dig it sounds like a fascinating situation marcel writes i'm 19 years old and from time to time i get discouraged when dealing with women due to my virginity any advice man you're not that far behind bro i think i was um i was in like uh late like 16 about to be 17 when i lost my virginity um which i felt everyone else was getting it in way before i was i felt that way who knows what the case is but you're not that late 19 is not that late uh the truth is that when you do lose your virginity just make sure that you use a condom and if you're anything like me when you get your first piece of pie the first thing i did once i got like five pumps in this i was like hey can i take this condom off she's like yeah sure just don't come to me i think okay as soon as i put it in i felt like i was about to ski i had to pull it straight out and i skied it so i say that to say when i was 16 it's a different time then than it is now so just make sure that you're being safe i just posted a video on safe sex on my other channel which if you go to this channel and you look at the home page the other channel is called the saint i highly recommend you follow it one is a backup channel because youtube tries to shut this one down in two it gives you a super pimp move for when you are about to lose your virginity a super player way you can get your hands on that condom and go ahead and rolling back before you smack it down because sometimes when you're dealing with a female when you take out that time to to get your condom and you didn't have it ready that little bit of think time oh all she needed was that 20 seconds to change her mind edwin since through the super chat truly appreciate his saint ahmed since the super chat writes do you think god is a real physical entity or an idea of humanity's highest ideal that we should strive for so god being physical physical being that which is material that which you can touch and i don't think god is a tangible um when you say an idea of humanity's highest ideal humanity being the human kind collectively i think god is mostly fear so when do people call on god mostly either when they're about to bust a nut oh god or when they're scared right when they're scared they start praying like god if you just make me feel better i'm never gonna drink alcohol again or or you you just found out that your kid is in the hospital like oh allah please like make sure so-and-so survives so it's fear mostly the greater part of god is faith and you know positivity and creation and i think people rarely have that aspect of god you know goodness god for most people is fear and fiction thank you for your your question you you often have very deep uh philosophical questions saint james brandon writes ironically in my experience i've noticed that feminist liberals [ __ ] are the main ones who are drawn to masculine men and want to be dominated james that's funny you say that my experience has been exactly the same when a chick is telling me to pimp slapper or choker during intercourse it is often a hyper liberal white woman who is a super feminist and wants to get her butt worn out wants to be super thugged out by a hyper masculine [ __ ] isaiah wilson writes i i'd say be assertive aggression may put some of the more timid or self-aware off a man rarely shows aggression you're either wearing a pair or not i don't i don't agree but thank you for sharing your perspective now the assassin has heard your word sarah mondo writes best time to tell a girl you just want to be friends with benefits and do you support leading on women like these other youtubers well if you want to be friends with benefits with the female that means you don't really value her in a holistic sense anyways so she doesn't like that that's okay she can hit the road so i'd say tell her that at the beginning that's simple that was an easy one and then your other question is do i support leading on women like these other youtubers uh when we go back to the three the three sentence bible the three sentence quran a three sentence torah be yourself be good to yourself be good to good people if she is a good person should you lead her on absolutely not if she's not a good person [ __ ] her do what you want to do she doesn't deserve anything good but if she is a good person to honor that it'll be good to good people that's definitely not something jesus would have told you right yeah kyle writes marquette your one-liners are stellar peace to the saints i appreciate that kyle and i try my best to make things simple right you know the bible fascinating work the quran very impactful work the torah a very clear work but mostly nobody reads them and that's why we create the three sentence quran the three sentence bible the threesomes torah hoping that it will give guidance to um mankind in a way that's easy to understand easy to relate to easy to share there he is kevin white formerly known as swiffer wenchent writes peace to the saints i have a female around who values my opinions and guidance i bet she does i'm not surprised i bet a lot of men do as well i can give her she she values my opinions and guidance i can give her but she uses it to push it on other guys wait whoa she uses it to push it on other guys thoughts so just want to make sure i understand what you're saying so you're saying that you got a chick who you give some game to you share your values you share your perspective you give her guidance and then she takes that packages it up like it's her own thinking and uses that to steer other guys and to influence them is that what you're saying i think that's pretty curious and that is a unless she's talking to her younger brother that's a concerning inclination that she has trying to put herself in the leadership position of males so i would kind of be anxious about that i wouldn't really probably want to make her your main but if she's following your lead she still might be a good man but i'd be curious as to why she's seeking to be the leader of men tommy writes new subscriber love your content if a woman frequently compliments your appearance does that mean she likes what she sees or she's just being nice oh she frequently compliments your appearance i think she certainly likes what she sees and you ought not feel compli uh you ought not feel obligated to bounce that compliment back to her you can just say thank you and you don't need to compliment her back but certainly she likes what she sees and she's expressing that she's a very confident woman in that regard so nothing wrong with that and also regionally and depending on the woman's age certain cultures are more inclined to say how they feel so there's nothing wrong with that certainly appreciate it shout out to tommy appreciate the you joining the sas and so everybody you know welcome him warmly as is our way yo rbg writes the condom slipped off my first time sorry to hear that saint i hope that didn't go bad for you ozzy is back he writes how do i get over it and go spit that game at her you gotta really want it for me i find that the pain of missing a good opportunity whether it's a good opportunity with a woman a good business opportunity the pain of missing a good opportunity lingers and gnaws at the soul the pain of failure or rejection is sharp but brief i can deal with it i can't even remember the last time i got rejected because it happens all the time and because it's very brief and because i'm very numb to it at this level but in terms of my successes that i got from actually shooting my shot i can remember all of those you dig those successes turn into girlfriends they turn into friends with benefits they turn into women who pay me they turn into all kinds of things so you would be wise to shoot that shot but you really gotta want it with women and with anything else else in life you have to want it more than other guys do and that's why you make the action hang on [Music] just addressing these super chats real quick thank you all who have shared intelligent questions for you are benefiting everyone who's on the line samantha writes on hsv one it can be transferred to other areas stay away from it it's the herp through and through sorry i know ladies shouldn't speak like this i don't want to be bad info sharing here i don't want bad info being spread here hey samantha we appreciate it um the lady told you herself stay away from it i agree with her there and we're not saying that we're throwing away someone because they've contracted an unfortunate disease but what we are saying is that that threesomes bible be yourself be good to yourself is it really being good to yourself to expose yourself to something that can hurt you probably not jason writes definitely be aggressive play the game or watch the game piece of the saints that's real that's real bruh that's real samson writes have you watched red fight club if so thoughts i have watched that i thought it was a good movie and in fact um i might have to tell my shorty to cue that one up i might watch that one again recently i've been looking for some inspiration and motivation hey would you add fight club to our watch list okay let me also make sure we caught up on these um cash apps in case folks have cash after a question okay we got a cash out from jesus christ he writes what's a good way to promote my patriot or my i think he was trying to write patreon but he may have misspelled the word so so jesus um if you misspelled the word let me know in the chat but i think you're saying what's a good way to promote your patreon i would say make great content so make great content um for free and make great content for your members and it will grow that's that's really been no magic to it just make good stuff and people want to buy it king modi writes oh yeah until the last i want to finish answering this question he says what did i think of fight club i thought i thought it was neat especially as a combat support enthusiast and one who partakes in the sweet science that that was neat um and it was also unique movies i like things like that that kind of take you out of your reality it was also a psychological thriller and so for me it's very interesting to bend reality and you know sanity and insanity so i thought that was very fascinating king moti sends through the swedish crone um he's just showing love i appreciate that king modi i gotta let you know there are three emperors in sweden man and i just really need to take out the time and link you guys up man because i i just at least want you guys to say hello to each other um digitally if nothing else and emilio since through a super chat via cash app he writes proceed like a fearless lunatic absolutely he's soaking up that ism you dig one of my favorite quotes that i share which is proceed like a fearless lunatic absolutely be aggressive go hard at whatever it is a business opportunity a woman have that sense of urgency that leads to success that is a winner's mentality as the master sun tzu records haste can be folly but delay is never wise get to it so we have another super chat via cash app which is from horus he writes the delay is never wise quote changed my life you know what's funny i say this so frequently to make myself get to work that bridgette will tell me this every now and then she said hey marquette haste can be folly delay is never wise and when you really live by something you know the people around you they soak it up because you you're about it you know you're you're consistent you see and she knows how to drive me and that really drives me when i hear that i'm like you're right we gotta get we gotta get after it jesus christ writes real recognize real i i'ma just read this i'm gonna read this super chat by akash this wasn't what i said is what he said and this is from the lord jesus christ he writes quote real recognize real [ __ ] kevin sanders that's what he wrote i'm just quoting right here when it's your super chat say what you want to say you did and at the end of the day no we don't play nice out here we just keep it 100 yeti dressy super chats king moti wright sounds amazing thank you let me just let bridget know we need to make that happen hey bridget could you do me a favor we have three emperors who are from sweden we have king modi we have kamal we have um gentlemen i just spoke with uh adam so can you connect them please like via email just say hey you guys are all in sweden we just want to connect you you guys are all ballers very successful per level we we got to link you guys up because assassin is global and it's about community you do that for me that's a beautiful thing one thing i love doing is i love connecting people who are like-minded who who are hustlers because i know when you put the right people in a group and they're all very intelligent and proactive and they're positive things are going to happen good things are going to happen i know this because i run corporations right and my business is about organizing talent right so i know what what's going to happen and so i just love to see it and i want to be at the center of that i want them to think back like damn man like this business partner who i made my first million with marquette introduced me yeah absolutely i like that i like that man and a real person when they can set up a win for somebody else they feel like they won that's love go down and hit these super chats i hope she sends that email tonight tommy writes for some reason marquette every girl i've dated has always said that i have an attitude how do you think all these women viewed me if you're hearing anything consistently there's a level of truth to it now sometimes women will use poor addiction now if you you wrote every girl says you have an attitude so if every girl says that then there's a level of truth to it and you need to uncover what they mean and what the behaviors were that they experienced from you and you would know that if you doctor fielder so anytime a woman says something you should always try to uncover what she really means women are not often animals of being direct they're more so animals within direction so you really do have to go through that questioning process not an interrogation it needs to feel like a conversation but that is the only way to learn that but certainly it's something that you're going to have to adjust so that you can be more effective and you have to know that there's truth there because it's coming at you consistently and a real man loves truth and is nourished by it and you should seek to become more familiar with that truth so that you can thrive based on leveraging it for your own improvement or improving your efficacy with women carrying on rip nation since through the euro truly appreciate the tuition saint yonko writes the ism is that a self-made religion slash way of doing things from the heart of he who creates his own destiny aka the god of that individual's life whoa we gotta re-read this one he writes the ism is that a self-made religion slash way of doing things from the heart of he who creates his own destiny aka the god of that individual's life that is quite a long sentence my dear saint what i will say is when i use the term ism i'm referring to marquette ism which is a philosophy a way of life not a religion because there's no god in it if anything if there is a god is saying that god is within you when when you are being your most capable when you're showing the greatest part of who you are that is where god is when you are being great when you are showing like when the light is shining from you and power is emanating from you so when i say ism i'm talking about a way of life being saintly a way that allows you to be a cool breeze to everyone you encounter and when you leave from their presence they miss you because you were a respite from a hot day from a an unpleasant society and so when i say ism i'm just referring to this philosophy that is written this marquettism that's what i'm referring to thank you for your question and if i've not answered it feel free to add an elaboration so that i can address it rip nation writes tuition from belgium in the building shout out you dig we deep out here in europe yeah and this is a global movement it's a beautiful thing to be a part of because the likes of it have never existed cold steel rights what do you think of inviting women to participate in your favorite activities oh absolutely let them be a part of your lifestyle it positions you as a leader and costs nothing in time or money it might cost something in money and certainly um it costs less in time so i think it's wise to let them be a tourist of your lifestyle especially if your lifestyle is good and as you've heard women say whom i've invited on the channel they often point out that they don't want to a be the center of your life and be they don't want the feeling that you've been trying so hard they like things that feel effortless and natural so i think this is a wise thing jai mcwilliams writes first super chat shout out i always commend those who do something new when you do new things you get new outcomes it is the first key to having a mindset of making improvement so shout out for doing something new he writes first super chat been watching you for some months now damn okay i appreciate all the game that you give on the regular help me change for the better i appreciate that thank you for the support saying glad to hear that you're growing as a result of this ism that we're sharing jonathan writes once you're enlightened by the big homie you realize how much misguiding these youtubers do bro i'm telling you that's why i don't watch them that's why i don't watch them maybe they say the wildest things man i can't tell you how many times i have consultations with gentlemen and they say hey marquette you know i had this great girl and i ruined it by following these quote-unquote red pill coaches um i guess one of them i told this dude that she needs to comply or say goodbye and i was like come on man what kind of phraseology is this to live by like it's just like they're giving these these statements that rhyme and sound good but they're not elaborating on it enough for you to follow the directions effectively and the reason they can't elaborate on is because they lack experience hcdv writes nothing like nothing like gangster meeting real men in france i don't know if that's a typo g-a-i-n-s-t but nothing like ganks meeting real men in france hey shout out to the saints in in the eu you did shout out to france i'll probably be over that way as soon as the weather warms up i got a little shorty in the canary islands i'm trying to pull up on yetig carrying on curry goodwin is back he writes marquette i have a good woman i've been with for a decade now shout out to the saying that's a beautiful thing she gets it done whenever i ask real estate wise she recently agreed to adding to us where should i start she is an understanding woman so when you say she agreed to adding to us if you're talking about adding a female into the family i hate to make assumptions and project onto you saying so please forgive me if that's the case i'm just trying to piece together your message here but if she's saying she's agreed to add another woman to the family that's a beautiful thing you're blessed and that is a very pious woman and an understanding woman as you said um i did make a video ice exclusive on www.thesasn.com or patreon.com the saint and the center spelled out and it i think it's called uh practical steps for polygeny and it literally identifies the specific steps that you can go through to make sure that you um and you you build up your family in a a reasonable way in which everyone is cared for it makes the transition a little easier hey that's a beautiful thing man that is wealth that is true wealth and if that's the case that she's honoring you like that man you've established a lot of equity with that woman so i'm happy to hear that jonathan writes thoughts on self-made man featuring nora vincent i'm assuming that's a song i've never heard it again jonathan i tell you guys your boy is out of the loop um i've i'm not very good with pop culture or youtubers or music uh if i'm being honest with you so i've never heard it i'm assuming this is a song i feel free to shoot it to me on patreon i'll certainly check it out or you can dm it at www.thesasn.com and by the way for all of the members when you dm me on ig make sure you first let me know hey i'm a member a boss level member at patreon or i'm an emperor level member at assassin.com and then say what you got to say otherwise i'm just assuming that that you're a random person and i have to prioritize the members i have to prioritize people who really are part of the sas and they really mess with this ism you did i i can't respond to everything or else all i would do would be respond to messages so please let me know first and foremost and those messages so i can make sure that i uh respond to you yonko writes so the ism is a person's own way of living life no the ism is short for marquettism and it is a very clear way of living with certain values principles and rituals and there should be values principles and traditions that we live by so for example before we have a meal we always say to the persons at sitting at our table what is one thing you're thankful for why because we believe in gratitude we believe in being thankful and reflecting on positivity and it's a great way to start the conversation it's a great way to pick the brains of the people you're with whether it's your family or whomever so that's one of our traditions what is one thing you're thankful for at the end of our meetings we will always end with the creed of assassin that's another one of our traditions which is something that's about self-love and building up the self another thing that we do is it's called for the good of assassin which is basically um during our meetings to make sure that life is not all work you know after you end a business meeting you you might go through for the good of assassin wherein each person says what's on their mind you know what their recent experience has been personally you know whatever thing they want to say they say within the space of 30 seconds um so these are some of the traditions that we have um so the ism is a specific way of living and we also have the three sentence bible which is be yourself be good to yourself and be good to good people now be good to good people is the same for everybody if the person is not a good person you should be able to figure that out be good to yourself means we're good to ourselves in different ways different things nourish us we require different things to be good to ourselves and then be yourself we are all individuals so we have to be who we are as an individual yonko thank you for your questions and seeking to understand the ism you are a wise person because so many people um would believe themselves to be saints but you know every now and then i'll have a woman on here and half the time guys are like hey um so-and-so's ugly or they're just insulting and that's not our way we don't speak a word without purpose we think before we speak that is our way and so i appreciate you trying to understand okay i think i may have actually hit all the super chats just go back through the

the super chats this is good okay okay looks like we got a few new super chats and then we'll be wrapped up okay so peter the great writes marquette how do you suggest making a girl no one can touch fall for you also i'm 16 and thanks to you my life and my money gym gains success with growth etc are we coming up all is up so thank you for the so thank you you're the realest peter it's funny that you're 16 and you asked me this particular question because just yesterday i was telling this story i'll keep it brief um so number one we always encounter that female that no one else could get right oh someone's getting her for sure because every person's companionship even the most gorgeous or unattainable woman is going to seek it when i was in high school there was a nearby high school in los angeles called eagle rock high school which i didn't go there i went to a different one but my buddy ryan went there we're good friends we grew up together and there's this gorgeous young lady named tiana she was half black half salvadorian ran track lovely shape and the pretty face some might call it a dime so anyways um she didn't date black guys as she would say so everybody was trying to holler at her at the school but she had never dated anyone and in particular she stated verbally that she doesn't date black guys and so she had said that one time and then my partner was like oh you a day marquette though and she was like who and she was like marquette and then like couple cats who knew me at that school like yeah yeah marquette might be able to catch you slipping so then she was like nah i don't think so he's like oh okay and then so he just called me on the cell phone and put me on speaker he said hey quad i got this girl right here she said she don't date black guys and i said oh for real she'll date marquette though and then she gets on the phone she was like no i won't and i said okay well i'ma pull up there and come meet you then we'll see about it and she was like yeah come through so i already knew that i had her intrigued because in her mind there was already this mystique in that my name just came dropped out of the sky like i didn't even go to her her school so the fact that people would bring up a random guy from a different school showed her that i had a level of status further the fact that they would mention me as a guy who could get her let her know that obviously women have favored me and women being social animals her being aware that other women have favored me put me in good positioning with her and then the way i pulled up at the school just added to it and so she was initially resistant but i could tell that it was just the front she was intrigued she wanted to know more so she honored me when i invited her out to to hang out i didn't take her on a date i said hey come hang out so i brought her to my hood and me at that time in life when i used to go out i used to go out deep you heard me with all my wolves i'm talking about killers and so i took her out with my people like 10 of us so it was me like 10 of my people and her and she got to see how real goon lives you dig wet she wet you heard me so anyways i had a wrapped around my finger after that so i say that to say this number one the question is how do you get separated from the pack because when you're dealing with a gorgeous woman who's highly sought after you have men coming at her in droves so how do you separate yourself from the pack number one how do you put yourself on her mind in a unique interesting way to create that intriguing mystery to where she doesn't even know if you're really interested in her the way i came at tiana she didn't know if i wanted her for her or if i just wanted to show that i could get her you see so there was a lot of psychological stuff going on it was a high level chess match which i won checkmate so i would advise you to to study through that story and in fact i believe that story is in the black box actually so study through that story and ask yourself how can you apply some of those lessons to your dealing with this woman who a lot of guys are putting on a pedestal and i would advise you number one knock her ass off that pedestal for sure carrying on i hit these last super chats ricardo ricardo comes through strong he did not break the record i don't know if google corporation prevents people from going over 100 i don't think they do but he's at the record right now so ricardo has come in at the record super chat level you dig so shout out to him and the prosperity you dig ring the

really that tough or are they really just soft weaklings trying to cover up their inner problems peace to this look i tell you this no amount of ink on your skin that makes you a goon and i hear funny things on the internet like you can't look at someone and tell who they are some would say don't judge a book by its cover and this is mostly true if you've ever been in a boxing gym you know for sure that that ink on your skin don't make you a tough guy look at floyd mayweather he has not one drop of tattoo ink on his skin and he'd been whooping asses for decades and me i could tell you i'll be in that boxing gym you see the guys who are all tatted up and they they they look intimidating they get in that ring and start getting their ass molly whopped and you figure out like hey the mean looks and the mean mugs and them gold teeth in them tattoos can't fight the fight for you so yeah i mean i'm not going to deride anyone because they they're inked up um i'm just saying that the ink doesn't make you a bad boy you know that's who you really are it's either you are you aren't and at the end of the day what we should all seek to do is be who we really are and you did you do get a choice in who you are right but being fake is is not the way um and most importantly a lot of folks don't get a chance to really be an individual they're trying to follow all these trends you see i'm blessed that when i was coming up my family told me hey we don't do that what the society is doing now we don't do that within our family we do this and so i've always had a strong sense of self and that's something that i want to instill in you guys which is why i always go back to the three and i say number one be yourself period i never encourage you to be me or to be like me i encourage you to be you and be the best of you that's the important part one of the saints that come to uh tunisia oh man i can't wait bro i've been wanting to get to tunis for so long the flights are always like a

to strive every moment to show the greatest part of who i am peace of the saints", "iD00Y8QTdfE": "[Music] what is going on guys so right now we are at the mall and we are going to be trying to find the best white t-shirt 428 bucks and we're gonna take everything into consideration the price the quality and the fit yes sir and there can only be one winner at the end of the video let's go see what we find [Music] alright guys so right now we're noon aglow these t-shirts right here the supima kind crewneck t-shirts you know I don't want to make my decision right now but I've heard really great things about these t-shirts they are kind of pricey though we're looking at 1490 because they offer 100% greater cut oh hold on hold on anything rare you know I'm I'm big on the high prayer cotton but if you guys want something a little bit thicker a little bit more rugged for the same price they also have these right here the you crewneck t-shirts and here is a white one we're also going to get this and check it out as well [Music] alright guys so right now we are in Northland which carries top man these are their white tees right here right off the bat kind of thin collar is pretty thin as well but you know never judge a book by it's cover ten bucks you also got a Romani dollar option gonna get a more premium one little rough heavier but not as heavy it looks like oversize kind of yeah all right so we got a twenty dollar option and a ten dollar option from Topman let's get both alright so I went over to other two tees but I just came across the classic elongated tee if you asked me these are out especially for $30 okay I know they had its run but it's done I don't wanna see these no more any stores all right is this for beheads sorry man sorry I know we're on the search for the best white team but you know I saw this photo right here these gummy bears go for him you got try these this is like it turns up versatile sweet energy good texture on point it's not as hard as only one but I will do good though alright guys so we just ran into our friend Joe Nessie right here can you show us what you're wearing man wow she's in Chicago ones they're gonna love you alright see if it's too messy alright guys so last time we did the hoodie video man we went really hard on H&M you know we step foot back in here they've actually stepped it up in the cleanliness Department I don't know if they got the big boss coming through but everything looking clean it is super clean right now alright so the infamous H&M white see right here $6.99 $5.99 so $6.99 you're okay with that little bump oh cool alright $6.99 we got to get the classic H&M whitey let's see what they're working with alright guys so we just got back from the mall mayor behind us alright we got seven of the best white t-shirts out right now I'm gonna be putting on each one and we are gonna determine what is the best affordable white t-shirt out that money can buy let's get into it alright let's get started alright guys so right now I am rocking a size medium in the supima cotton Uniqlo standard t-shirt all right oh supima very very high quality cotton it's soft alright I'm not gonna like kinda have like sensitive skin a little bit yesterday you always oh you always bring that up when you wear t-shirt I can't do the Forever 21's fan I do that like I would pay that extra few bucks for something soft like this let's go over to fit real quick you know looking outside in a little bit above the elbow yes sir you know it does give it a little bit of a muscle tee by but not too tight not I couldn't have even said it better not too tight but it does hug around you know the bike don'ts a little buzz but as far as the fit of the t-shirt man I would say it does have like a relaxed / loose fit I made this for everyday wear this is actually the t-shirt that I wear pretty consistently they wash really nicely they don't wrinkle up in the neck area and we're not I say these are not bad at all good but I say we move on to you know clothes other thick white underside of the offer all right sorry let's get into that one so next t-shirt that I'm rocking right now is the Uniqlo 14.90 as well crew neck t-shirt so right off the bat this one is thick the hand feel right of the bat gives it more like an aged kind of a rougher hand field and you know most of the rather regular softer ones yeah I like that personally I like that rest of the vintage t-shirt I was gonna say I don't really like how like basically feels like a rough canvas you know what I mean but one thing we also have to bring up is basically like everyday wear this t-shirt right here is something that you're gonna wear on its own this one definitely gives off more of a boxy or vibe which is kind of more of my style when it comes to street wear the other one is you know a little bit too standard you know more for menswear kind of like off a mess you're teaching men's fashion kind of that style so if you're willing to compromise on the comfort a little bit then you roll with this one basically it all comes down to preference all right so right now I am rocking the infamous HCM $6.99 white t-shirt everybody had this shirt or all the other ten colors or twenty close offers they have a lot all right so all right off the bat man I'm not gonna lie these things are hugging nope I feel it's gonna say these are so small this is definitely more muscle surgery you don't need to have muscles and though you'll seem like you have my finger people like so right off the bed as far as the fit goes it is more on the smaller side of more a little bit more fitted for sure I mean I could almost see your whole bicep first it wasn't a little bit about the elbow yeah now it's all mostly a deltoid yeah so that's what you're gonna get as far as the fit goes and then now we got to talk about the quality it is pretty thin a way thinner than the first one yes sir and it kind of just tells you the quality of fabric may not be as good I mean when you're like even looking at the stitching and everything there's loose threads and I mean like the density of the fabric is what I'm looking at right now it is actually kind of thin and one thing you cannot you know determine from an eye test with these H&M t-shirts is after a wash so pretty much after you wash these and dry these it's just that's it yeah you're more you're you're you're caller just turns it to a bacon these turn like basically five times smaller so these are good for one wear basically and we have said this over and over on the channel for $6.99 that might seem like a good deal but if you pay like extra bucks you know for your noona clothes or your top man and t-shirts and whatnot you are gonna get longevity you can actually keep the shirt you're gonna be able to keep the shirt definitely do not recommend getting these for a few extra bucks you can get something much better yes sir alright so next up man I am rocking the top man standard white t-shirt this comes in at $10 from Nordstrom what do you think of this look you said the keyword standard not too loose not too tight okay I gotta compare this one to the to the first Utica one oh very comparable yes I got to ask you that comfort for five dollars less this is worth it I would say you know like you said I'm kind of sure I like this - Peet makan this is exactly the same no standard fit they probably cut it from the exact same template but the fabric he's not gonna offer it it's a little rougher okay and you know I stand by the Uniflow ones they do hold up really well and I can't really speak for the top man when it comes to washing I say we move on to the next top man t-shirt though this one is coming in at $20 alright so right now I am rocking the $20 top man t-shirt so this one is completely different more comparable to the crew neck t-shirt that I was wearing from Uniqlo I was gonna say has a vibe for me when it comes to a white tee I'm gonna rock it more flowy okay I'm gonna rock it we're gonna without anything over it out I got again so that's the look I'm trying to get that's why I like this t-shirt I like a Uniqlo one okay okay what about you for myself if I'm gonna rock a shirt like this you know loose and flowy it's gonna have some logos the logos and we're not so branded white t-shirts I just never seen white t-shirts as like a main piece so for that reason I wouldn't personally buy this white t-shirt but I could see if you do like that drape here flowy vibe this is much better to wrap this one up if you're looking for oversized shirt for $20 it's not bad this is the one you're gonna get my hair for top minute alright so moving right along we got a goody fellow white t-shirt right here from Target sorry the house brand this one is only six dollars the cheapest sand t-shirt on dollar list so far I'm not gonna lie right off the bat this looks not bad at all it doesn't look that out oh oh one thing that I got a really bring up as far as the quality goes is it kind of has this like almost like it was tumbled in like super soft fabric softener or something more soul about it okay yeah so right on the bat comfort you like it a lot really soft but as first the feet goes it's a [ __ ] to muscley for my like yeah I mean it does compared to the again hmm one where it's almost to your bicep yeah and the collar is very thin I can't see from here probably the thinnest one so far so a lot of people associate thinner collars which actually with more of like menswear premium okay so maybe that's what they're trying to go forward I don't think I don't think a Goodfella brand is a in street wear yet for six dollars mm-hmm if you're gonna compare to the H&M one I would just go cross street for them all no Target and get the good fellow yeah this is a shinobi a noir and you're gonna save a dollar you're gonna save a dollar and it's actually better yourself it's wrap this one up I say go with this one let's move on to the next one alright so last but not least right in front of us we got the Hanes what they claim is their premium pack right here we're looking at 70 shirts for $25 which comes out to what $3.57 to be exact oh my gosh they had a nerve to throw in an extra one guy used to be six okay but they're like you know what just one extra one they're seven sorry so this guy put this look at this collar the way it's not even like it's not even stitched correctly it's kind of weird as a cleaning I can't even it's crazy you wear this usually you look sloppy I really wanted to do this review to just basically should we just stamp never get a Hanes product ever well I was gonna say I mean not the move we try to even go for the premium line earlier there's one that's even worse than this I guess and there's nothing premium about it the fit the look I can almost see your nipples and it yeah it's I don't know it's it's pretty bad I'm not gonna lie when I was younger it was three levitates all about their branding man I used to gravitate towards D that's okay cool good deal you have an ice pack but once you open it up this is what you're gonna get right here as far as fit goes to it looks horrendous this is a work that I wanna do like short on the sleeves yeah super long on the bottom we are saying nowadays people make way better t-shirts I mean the Goodfellow one for five bucks $2 50 more going alright guys so we reviewed a bunch of white t-shirts today we didn't when it comes down to the official white t-shirt that we recommend the best white t-shirt out there I would go with the supima cotton Uniqlo standard tees $15 you getting to comfort the look the quality and you could wash it numerous times I've had them for years so let's go when it stands the test of time which i think is super important yes I recommend that one what about you I'm gonna go with look I thought it was gonna be the Uniqlo kunuk one the fit wise they didn't really like it that's why I'm gonna go with the $20 top man one oh okay cuz that one has the same feel Yanik it has like a little rough feel to it definitely has to look down of the vintage vibes and the oversized fit so i'ma go with that one right there okay that's not bad top so it all just to different preferences of what type of look we would like alright guys that's pretty much it for the finding the best white t-shirt video let us know down the comments below what white t-shirts you guys are currently rocking right now and one thing I also got to bring up too when it comes to the Uniqlo t-shirts I actually size up in a lot of them okay so the medium is a little bit tighter but in my closet right now actually wear a large in those supima cotton so just keep that in mind if you guys are curious but that's pretty much it man make sure you guys are sub to the channel make sure you guys like this video and until next time we out please", "7PaZotmqcgE": "how's it going guys welcome to the starving student reviews today we're going to be talking about the t-shirt a [Music] white t-shirt is something that's very important in everybody's wardrobe it's just a staple that's very versatile something that you can pair with jeans or chinos or pretty much anything else that you have in your closet to me it's kind of like a blank canvas that I can pair with whatever I want I know that all over the internet you can find varying reviews of the best white t-shirt and which one is the best for you but today I thought it would be better to kind of narrow it down to two t-shirts that I have found work very well for me in my wardrobe both of the t-shirts behind me come from the brand Yoona glow which as I've already mentioned is a well known brand for making high quality products at a very affordable price the t-shirt behind me to my left is from Uniqlo U which is a collaboration with the high-end designer Christophe Lamar and is known for its aesthetic and it's high-quality fabric and the one behind me to my right is the Uniqlo supima cotton tee which is known for its soft fill and durability I will be grading these based off of my usual criteria one being the quality construction to being the fit and three being the price so let's get right into it so let's start out with the construction on this Uniqlo you t-shirt this is definitely withstood the test of time as I've had it for over a year and it's had hardly any signs of wear the stitching is very even and uniform throughout and I haven't had any loose threads it's made of a very heavy weight cotton which is very durable and nice if you want to get longevity out of your t-shirt but it definitely doesn't come near to the comfort of the supima cotton t-shirt however I would say in terms of construction this t-shirt wins over the Uniqlo supima cotton t-shirt just because it seems like there was a lot more detail on thought put into the materials and the quality of manufacturing moving on to the construction of the unicloset pima cotton t-shirt i've had this for about six to eight months and it's also held up very well the stitching also seems to be very neat and uniform throughout the garment which makes it drape very nicely and it fits very very well I do think that the Uniqlo supima cotton t-shirt takes the cake the area of comfort the cotton that they use on this t-shirt is very stretchy and very comfortable and just feels almost like a second skin when you're wearing it so that's it for construction now let's move into the price the Uniqlo you t-shirt is a little bit more expensive at $15 whereas the Uniqlo supima cotton t-shirt comes in at just $10 so if you're looking at both of these t-shirts in terms of the price they're definitely very comparable and neither one of them I don't think it's going to break your bank now let's move on to the third category which is the fit and which I think will be the most important factor in deciding which one of these two t-shirts best suits your style the Uniqlo you t-shirt has a very oversized feel to it it has a very thick neck band and has kind of drop shoulders which make it look a little more oversized and it has a very straight cut in the body which makes it drape very loosely but also very comfortably it definitely looks oversized but doesn't look so oversized that it looks baggy or like it doesn't fit I would definitely recommend this for somebody who has more of a stocky build or wants something that drapes more loosely and is more on trend with what's fashionable right at the moment the supima cotton t-shirt on the other hand is a very classic t-shirt it hugs the body everywhere and is pretty slim fitting throughout it definitely fits well on the shoulders I really like that the collar is very close to the neck so it looks very flattering and just overall fits very well and this is definitely what you want to go for if you're a slimmer build or want something that's more timeless and is it is trendy so if I had to choose between these two shirts I would personally go with the Uniqlo supima cotton t-shirt as it is a little bit cheaper and it fits my personal style however I think that they're both a great choice and they're both very affordable and you're getting a lot of value out of your money both of these t-shirts I think are on the top tier of what you can buy in this price range let me know what you think about these t-shirts in the comments and please remember to like and subscribe thanks for watching", "hByEF6AaYAY": "\u200bToday we're talking about the Alternative\nApparel 100% ring spun cotton t-shirt. Now, this t-shirt by Alternative Apparel is one\nof our best selling ring spun cottons for a few reasons. One because it's Alternative Apparel offers a really soft fabric. It's a thinner fabric texture also, compared to\nother 100% ring spun cottons. A really fine thread count, the threads are very tight.\nWith that thinner thread also means it's just going to flow better.\n\u200bComes in some great colors. Great fit. It's right now between kind of the Next Level,\nCanvas 100% ring spun cotton pricing and the American Apparel, it's a good middle ground.\nOffers the same great fit, awesome fabric. Instead of telling you all just about it we've\ngot Tyler coming over, going to show it in action.\n\u200bFirst thing you're going to notice a great fit. Has the side seam here, which now a days\nis standard on any shirt that's going to be a nicer brand. Offers that side seam so it's\ngoing to be tailored right to your body. \u200bThe collar here is a great collar. Little\nthinner than other brands. The seam is on the inside also so it's a very flush outer.\nPrint location across the front is awesome. We have right here the sleeve length, great,\nright mid bicep. Not baggy like a lot of the other shirts that we're talking about on these\nvideos. Any time we're going with a nicer fabric and a better fit the sleeve should\nnaturally complement that. We don't want the sleeve to be baggy and the sides tailored.\nIt would be totally uneven. This shirt has great proportions.\n\u200bIn terms of the length we've noticed that this shirt seems a little shorter than the\nAmerican Apparel or even the Next Level comparison. It does seem a little shorter. Not bad, it's\njust something to note. Check out the size charts on our site and again this shirt is\njust great all around shirt. Kind of that middle price point in the 100% ring spun cotton.\n\u200bNow, we've talked a lot about 100% ring spun cotton and kind of the softness, the\nfit. You might be wondering what about shrinkage anything that way. Now, it is 100% ring spun\ncotton so over the course of it's life it could start peeling. It also could start kind\nof distorting in terms of how you dry it. If it's on high heat. We're not talking about\nfirst wash, second wash, the first washes. We're talking about a year down the line.\nIf you nuke the shirt. Longevity wise, anytime you want a shirt for the long hall a blend.\nA 50/50 blend, a 60/40 is going to be better than this for the long hall of the life of\nthe shirt, but this is a great shirt. You're going to love it and overall this is one of\nour best sellers because Alternative Apparel is a hot brand right now.\n\u200bTyler you look awesome in it too. Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate\nthis t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this video. Please let us know if you have any\nquestions because here at Coed Monkey soft matters and so do our customers.", "CYz4CtDCCrQ": "so today we're talking about the best t-shirts for working from home but I also have two thoughts that I wanted to share with you number one there is no such thing as the best t-shirt and number two and we can use a completely new kind of vocabulary to describe hand feel so you want to skip ahead fine go ahead timestamps in the description but I think this is actually really important see the problem is there is no best t-shirt there is no best t-shirt I spent $1,000 and I bought 17 different t-shirts from around the internet and I realized they're all different they all have different good things about them and asking what the best t-shirt is is like saying you know what's the best place to vacation well where have you been where do you want to go are you a city person you want to go explore nature do you want to see Tokyo and the culture do you want to let go and you know Baskin the rays of sunshine in a waterfall I don't know what do you want the exact same thing applies for a t-shirt is it the winter or is it the summer do you have sensitive skin do you like wool do you want to feel something that's vintage do you want some this all cotton we all have these idiosyncratic preferences and it's okay to have them so for this video I'm not gonna say there's one best working from home t-shirt I'm gonna give you a bunch of different options and then you decide I will tell you all about the myth of the everyday t-shirt and why there isn't a best t-shirt in different videos so click on the link down there or haven't made it yet so subscribe please now my second thought is this we need a completely new vocabulary for describing hand feel because every company now describes their shirts as soft and if every company uses the same word to describe a shirt then that word becomes completely meaningless it's like if you took Shaq and this curling athlete if the Metro got into sweet hog to make sure it maintains the speed with quiet time and you call them both Olympic athletes yes that's technically true but I don't think you've actually said anything in order to paint the most unique picture of each t-shirt and how it feels into your mind I will not use the word soft at all to describe any of these t-shirts so three qualities that I'm looking for and a work-from-home t-shirt number one comfort all right this one's obvious right I'm at home want to be comfortable and soothe and feel nice and relaxed and reassured number two not sloppy I want a t-shirt that has just enough presentable 'ti that I feel like I can go and do something you know it some good work finally thermoregulation the thing is in my home it can get really cold because my girlfriend is a ceramicist when she goes outside and she leaves and if i don't have to do that that'd be pretty nice unfit I'm a medium I'm 6 feet 160 something pounds slightly wider shoulders I'm like on the slightly larger side of medium and finally we are not affiliated with any of these brands we bought all of this with our own money so best 100% cotton is the lady white code there are like jersey for $55 the brand is chic la hipster so not bad lady white coat is my favorite t-shirt I've been wearing it every single day what I really love about it is it's perfect blend of being structured and having enough sturdiness and half miss where I feel like ok this is a real t-shirt versus descent there's a light like dream eNOS to it and we feel it in your hands you immediately know that it's a really high quality cotton and I love that so Comfort was my favorite thermal regulation though it's above average it's better than your average con t-shirt but I live in LA so it does really well for me if you're on the East Coast and it gets really cold fit is great you know uh it's not large it's not small I'm a perfect medium it fits me perfectly and if you want to have you weight and more vintage version they have another version of that on their website so if you like 100% cotton $55 like isn't too expensive for you then I would go with this one all right next up 100% cotton budget pick this is The Naked and Famous circular net t-shirts $33 they're an American denim brand that they're really into Japanese denim hashtag yellow fever is that you're funny do you think I should include that circular knit is when they knit the t-shirt so that they actually don't have a side seam which I guess it makes it a little bit more comfortable honestly I don't the difference but some people care also a mid-weight ring-spun cotton so it has a bit more of that stiffer durable you know hefty or kind of feeling to it which again if you like vintage teachers if you like that feeling of wearing a t-shirt t-shirt this one has that the thing that it's different from lady white coat is that it is less soft and aha I said soft it isn't as fuzzy or tender it's less dreaming so it's more stiff it is $32 it's like half the price it still feels really good and a little break in with a few washes so if you wanted a nice cotton t-shirt but didn't want to pay for Lady WIPO making famous is a good t-shirt to go with the reason why I have begun enjoying sturdier heftier t-shirts there is something beefy about it and there's something about its heritage because in the past teachers used to be sturdier they used to be a bit stiffer I just noticed that I wanted to connect myself to the heritage of t-shirts last the outlier ultra fine merino t-shirt for a hundred and twenty dollars so the outlier brand is for people who are really into clothing and they're down and pay more money for the highest possible quality that you can buy when people say the micron thing of wool they're basically referring to the diameter of the wool fiber so it's sixteen and a half that's just absolutely finest that you can go 18.9 prickly outliers t-shirt seven-and-a-half very very long furious I don't really feel the prick leanness at all but I will say I do feel it a tiny bit so if you have sensitive skin take that into account the hand feel is amazing though it's it's nothing that you've ever felt before it is luxurious it is buttery and as soon as you touch it it has this thickness that it drapes over your arm and if you really want to feel productive this shirt really works because the whole day you feel like you're wearing something that's just great heavily all over you also this is a large so size up and in thermoregulation the outlier rule t-shirt amazing if it gets hot you feel fine if it gets cold you feel fine it outperforms cotton by a huge margin a couple of problems with the outlier t-shirt number one is $120 number two it's so nice that I feel like there are times in which I want to take off my t-shirt before doing something like if I'm cooking and number three the main problem is the care you can wash it but they don't recommend it in the machine they tell you definitely don't dry it you have to lay it flat on a table to dry so like but if you like merino wool if you want something that's really gonna thermoregulation if you want to spend $120 if you want to take care of it the best merino teacher you can buy so wool blends I think are a good balance because you get a lot of the good properties of wool right you get the thermal regulation ice breaker you also get a nice silky hand feel right it's really wet it's like a perform it is a performance t-shirt and it doesn't have any of the prick leanness of what you would expect a little t-shirt to have and that's really nice but the other problem is is a performance t-shirt and I don't really like to wear performance teachers when I'm working but some people are totally fine with it my business partner Alan loves wearing silky athletic performance ET shirts to go to work you don't like the prick meanness of wool or if you don't want to take care of wool consider getting this winner in this category is cuts forty eight dollars sixty two percent polyester thirty-three percent cotton and 5% spandex they're a whole thing around this is that they called the hand filled buttery and you know what it is sort of I might even say it's a little velvety in a really good way it feels a little bit artificial and you know what you might not even notice a lot of people probably aren't going to notice I noticed that it's a little bit artificial that's doing synthetic fabrics no matter what it is trying to mimic the buttery hand feel to really really really expensive fabric but that's what it is it's it's an imitation the sleeves are a little bit tight and it has a curved hem I'm not really into that but you might be and that's totally okay if you enjoy synthetic blends and you like the butteriness of a good t-shirt that that hand fuel but you know you don't want to spend $100 for t-shirt this might be a good choice all right finally the X Factor t-shirt if you have been waiting for a silk cashmere t-shirt I've got the right one for you in the DOM $75 its silk cashmere oh my god it feels so cloudy and dreamy it is it's what you wish wool would feel like it when I wear it it feels like I'm just swept away on this cloud and taken for a joyride it might be one of the best t-shirts that I have ever felt in my life you have to hand wash it they say that I think they say that you can machine wash but they're very judgmental about it and I could not take that so I can't really recommend it for a daily wear unless you're the kind of person who actually hand washes their clothing I'm a 28 year old I can't do it that's really hot that's a problem hey we're gonna do more reviews and theorize about how clothing works so subscribe and/or check out our subreddit our slash merit store", "8VmwUmXgyJQ": "hey you guys and welcome to another video we're going to be talking about castor oil packs for fibroids today in fact the whole of today is just reserved for fibroids the conversation about oh and guess what i did not do my little honor of doing the microphone so let me do a little a little something and get that fixed because it does make a big difference um so yeah so if you've been following us for a while we've been creating a ton of videos for you guys just to really inspire you and give you um the science the recipes the demos and case studies and success studies from a lot of our listeners on how incredible the changes can be in the body and how you can really manage estrogen dominance with changing your diet by adding a few supplements and and adding things like castor oil as well so you know today we chose to talk about fibroids because research shows that about 50 of caucasian women at one point in their lives will develop fibroids in one size or another many women don't actually realize they have fibroids and then we also um we have a certain demographic like african-american women for example as many as 70 to 80 of them will have a fiber once in their life and so that's that's also quite staggering numbers and as much as fibers are not carcinogenic um they are not cancers per se i feel like it's um our bodies ways of signaling saying i am struggling here i am not detoxifying that estrogen very well and hence i'm growing something within the uterus and i need your help and so really that's where we are we're dedicating today to talking about fibroids um first in the first thing in the morning i was showing you how to make a uterine pack on using castor oil combined with magnesium to put on a uterus and i did a lot of questions and answers and today i uh those afternoon sessions are reserved for talking to a lot of my colleagues and good friends and um so we're gonna be talking about to someone who really i feel like is the well she calls herself the queen of thrones and she i think she's really a queen of castor oil um she's completely obsessed with castor oil and for a good reason um and so i want to bring on dr marisoltijero my my good friend and a really dear colleague hi there hello magdalena oh i am so obsessed with castor oil there are no better words for my uh i actually didn't realize that until when we went to him at this botanical medicine conference together and there was a castor uh tree in the backyard of the conference uh that we were together and um and i'll never forget your your face and how you lit up and um and you just all you want to do is sit under that tree so all right yes and for a good reason right i mean that's like something that is um that has got incredible results um and i will say i mean that's part of the reason why i wanted to bring you on and and talk about this is because a um i've had amazing results with castor oil personally and then then we introduced you your brand and your product we're going to talk about the packs and what's different about them um from from dr marizol and i mean they really made a such a huge difference in so many women's lives um in our community as well and so really want to talk about that can we just maybe start off first um just to explore a little bit like where does this obsession if you will and i mean in a very good way right your absolute passion uh for castor oil can you just give us like a little walk through what what got you started on that path in the first place sure it was so early on in my career it was even before i became a naturopathic doctor i myself was suffering with pcos irritable bowel syndrome and every single person was telling me to do castor oil packs and i would never do them i would never want to do them and why why not well because they were incredibly messy and i'm i'm like you i'm the type of person who i like things like you know easy done quick recipe and a friend and i didn't want to do this you know old-school 12-step program to get one treatment on my body like i just didn't have the time for it and i i couldn't see i couldn't believe that it would work either because here i was putting this oil on a piece of cloth and putting that on top of my body and it just was it was just too disconnected from from what i knew which was i knew supplements i knew pills i knew food i knew exercise i knew that those were the tools that could work so you know when i had been told and literally i was told countless numbers of times for over 10 years to do a castor oil pack i i just didn't listen and it wasn't until i got incredibly sick actually in naturopathic school with all the stress obviously lots of hormonal imbalance because the amount of stress was just so incredible and i found myself with a like a severe problem with my thyroid total totally chronically fatigued unable to get out of bed and it was it was that day that i said you know here i am doing all the supplements i'm taking a mountain of supplements i'm doing all these exercises i'm eating all the right foods but yet i've still gotten so sick so how do i change that how do i how do i make it better and that was the first time i actually sewed up my very first castor oil pack and i placed it on my body and when i put it on my body i think in that moment i knew why i had resisted for so long and why it was imperative that i it now become my mission to teach people about it because for me and i'm going to use like a a biblical uh excerpt because that first day that i put the castrol pack on my body it literally felt as though like the sky opened up and angels began to sing because for the first time in my life at 20 i would have been 31 i actually felt what relaxation truly was when i put on my castor oil pack and then i i realized a really important fact was that here i was doing all the right things but the thing that i couldn't address with supplements or exercise or all the other practices was the ongoing stress that was occurring every single day and that that was you know not allowing those other things like those wonderful supplements like those excellent that excellent food like that ex those excellent exercises that i was doing it wasn't allowing them to work to their finest so then when i started combining the castor oil packs with those amazing supplements with all those amazing the food that i was amazingly eating and spending so much money to get organic and just the best quality and you know all the right recipes it was really the castro packs that allowed my body to absorb them properly because i wasn't in such a state of stress and it cleared up a lot of my hormonal problems i mean i had pcos at 26 by the time i was finished naturopathic school i had no signs of ovarian cysts no signs of pcos at all i had a fatty liver at the time i was 26 by the time i was done you know a naturopathic college and after a year of usage of castropox i had none of those signs and i still don't you know like 12 years later and the end and the same thing has occurred in thousands of my patients in clinical practice and then now since we brought it to market i mean into the people you know we've literally been able to bring to people like your people and we we hear like comments every single day about people you know it changing their lives from people who've been infertile being able to get pregnant you know women who've had you know fibroids the size of watermelons them reducing in size just by them doing little simple castor oil packs or painful ovarian cysts and suddenly you know they do these castor oil packs they also don't believe that it could work but suddenly you know they go back to their doctor and those cysts are all gone no more painful cysts and you know the stories keep on going thyroid conditions improved um menopausal symptoms improved hot flashes night sweats women sleeping better and it's just honestly it's just so rewarding to be able to do this and help women in this way yeah so you know um hey you guys before i forget we are doing a giveaway from dr marisol of her castor oil pack so that includes the um the compress and the bottle as a set and we're gonna have a winner of this kid all you have to do is just student stay tuned in and and um just be with us um what we're going to do is some in um summertime towards the end of this conversation this interview and we're going to pop a question for you something we talked about and um and for those of you who are good students you get will get rewarded my step my team will gonna reach out to the winner um we can't be obviously giving away to everybody who gets their answer right but we we will pick one person so let's um and also another question i have for you guys is when you are i see comments already coming in if you have been using a castor oil packs with us because you you have been with the hormones balance community for a while do share with us like how have they helped you so i wanna um i just ordered from from her website and alex is saying awesome so the um so i wanna just kind of step back and i wanna share with you my uh my experience with the castrol packs and i am i i was not i wouldn't say i was not a believer i just wasn't getting results fast enough i'm doing the the cotton flannel over your liver put a hot pack on top sit in front of a tv watch a movie or read a book for a couple of hours so they take it off and then you're like it's messy and your clothes are messy and all of that and but most importantly i just didn't feel like it was work it was worth the effort i wasn't getting the kind of benefit that i was hoping for and so i kind of gave up on it until i met you and then you sent me a pack to try and i think i was on my third night when i used use it for the third night and i went to the bathroom in the morning and um and it's gonna be pretty gross what i'm gonna say but you know this is the hormone balance community so we talk about uh that kind of stuff all the time but it could really smell bad yeah it's melt of tar and this was actually right after a liver detox that i came back from this clinic in switzerland so we're doing a lot of work on the liver but there was something that castor oil moved that even the intense liver protocol that i was using in switzerland didn't even do it and it was kind of scary it it literally you know it it felt like if you open up a car engine and you smell the tire and the kind of like there was some chemicals and and it was also bizarre is that you know i'm not i don't take any medications i don't do recreational drugs i'm not an alcoholic and so i was like wow what is that toxicity there that something that really moved out of the liver and i remember texting you saying what the heck is this going on and you said just keep going and it's normal yeah and and then it stopped it started decreasing so the following night and the night after and then all of that went away so it was really profound um to to feel like there was is basically unblock something in my liver um that nothing else has in the past and so i definitely have regained a lot of appreciation for castor oil oil after that experience so i want to thank you for that it's been um it's been really very transformative and i know that hormones balance community has had great results with that as well taylor if we see any comments that are coming in with results do post that on the on the screen go ahead i was just going to say you know what what you said there it's very impactful for so many reasons because a lot of people have done castor oil packs before like some of you viewers out there right now might have done castor oil packs in the past and not gotten results and so you're not willing to give it a try or you think it's not worth it it's not going to do anything for me but i do want you guys to have an open mind because here's the thing is that not all castor oils are created equally and the pack is very important too so two big things that happen out there in the world of health is that people say number one you don't have to use a pack and i'm here to tell you that you absolutely need a pack because a pack is 50 of the treatment without a pack you're all you're getting is the anti-inflammatory effect of castor oil and the moving of the intestinal lining and a couple other things that improve the microbiome but when you wear the pack the important aspect of switching your body from a stressed state remember that stress state into a relaxed state where you actually can heal and you can cleanse and detoxify much better is so incredibly important and it also supports the production of like the actual pack not even the oil it actually supports the production of oxytocin which for those of you who know what oxytocin is oxytocin is a loving connection molecule so when you wear these packs at night you feel really good and really happy and you feel good in your body and that hormone is implicated in number one helping to improve so many of your other hormones like estrogen like thyroid that might be off but also it balances out cortisol so that nasty stress hormone that is really really damaging your whole hormonal world in your body right so it's super important to remember that you actually do need a pack and doing what's called the lazy man's castor oil pack just putting castor oil on your belly and a t-shirt you're not gonna get all the effect that you're actually looking for in the castor oil pocket and in my opinion probably the most important part is the fact that it does shift you over into the relaxed state and then number two magdalena is the quality of the oil i mean i searched about that in a second because i do want to spend some time on this i want to just um sorry this question is coming in and people are asking what exactly are they talking about the smell so sorry if i wasn't clear it was the smell of the poop that i'm talking about not smell of my body it was the smell of the so going in bathroom in the morning and like oh that is very different so let's just um i would love to talk about two applications of your castor oil packs today one is for the for for the uterus and and why does it work for the fibers and then we're going to talk about the liver and how to do there's a lot of how-to questions we are getting uh from you guys and so we are gonna get to those uh as much as we can um and people ask you where to buy it from um hey you guys we posted the link in the comments uh taylor if you could make sure that we put the um put the bitly link in the comments and um and then we can you can order it there and from the brand is the queen of thrones and we're going to talk about a way i chose to work with this particular brand and the short answer is because it's in glass and we're going to talk about this in just a second so queen of thrones is the brain okay um let's talk about what is the big deal about um how does it help fibroids fiber so the history a lot with fibroid treatment and castor oil pack dates back all the way to pliny the elder uh we're talking the roman emperors and they the planning the elder was the medicine man to the roman emperors and empresses and he created he wrote an entire book all on woman female health concerns with and castor oil is mentioned more often with fibroids and cysts and everything having to do with the uterus so back in the day we're talking like this is a long time ago this is by the fact of the time of christ um you know like 2 000 years ago they were already using castor oil for ovary ovarian problem ovarian problems uh uterus problems fibroid problems etc so this continued throughout the history and throughout the ages you know people would apply and use castor oil uh packs over the fibroids do we know exactly how it works well we know to an extent but we don't know exactly you know a lot in medicine people may say that they know everything but they don't know everything about it they know you know little bits and pieces and are able to put it together from there so let me tell you what we do know and how i think it works just from scene and personal practice and with all the people that we we've used it with so castor oil on its own is incredibly an incredibly effective oil that functions as an anti-inflammatory and it does so via the mechanism of prostaglandins it's the exact same mechanism that you get when you take fish oils orally now the only thing is that you're not going to necessarily you know put fish oils on your pelvic region right imagine the smell of that that would be horrible first of all and you know when you take a cat when you take a fish oils orally you know that's going to have an effect over the inflammation on your entire physical being right so it won't go and it won't be directly specific directed specifically over to the to the uterus area which is where you want it to work so that's number one that's one of its mechanism of action is via inflammation another mechanism of action is that it does stimulate nitric oxide and nitric oxide is is where i feel its power is worked working within the fibroid health aspect is that nitric oxide works at regulating candida and yeast and microbiome bacterial overload or a bacteria that isn't quite the healthiest bacteria see in fibroid fields physiology estrogen really promotes the growth of fibroids and progesterone helps to maintain the fibroid like growing so you grow it big and fast with estrogen and with progesterone that just kind of keeps that fibroid maintained so our goal is always to help with reduction of estrogen in all of our all of our tools in order to actually help reduce the fibroid so when you do a castor oil pack you know because of that effect of the castor oil impacting the microbiome via nitric oxide what that does is that actually helps to reset your microbiome and when you reset your microbiome you help with reduction of the estrogens that might be created from the microbiome so from the gut because not only are we getting estrogens from the outside world but we're also creating them on our inside when we don't have good and healthy microbes so that's that's number one that's a really really huge deal that we always want to remember number two is that or number three for an example so inflammation nitric oxide fixing up that microbiome and then number three it's all about liver detoxification and liver cleansing you know our liver is in charge of clearing out the excess estrogens balancing out the estrogen and the progesterone ratio you know whether that is that you have you know a dominant estrogen or like a true real estrogen dominance or you have you know like a perceived estrogen dominance just because of the ratio compared to progesterone either way castor oil packs help with resetting and cleaning and detoxifying of the excess amount of hormones that are within your body and so just by doing that alone you then reduce the amount of growth of your fibroid and then as a number four as a bonus we could say is again when you wear that actual pack when you actually put that pack on your body what you're doing is you're stimulating oxytocin production and when you stimulate that oxytocin production oxytocin comes from the hypothalamus pituitary gland region of the brain and it's one of the commanders of hormonal status within the body and when you have oxytocin it has a way of balancing out all the other hormones so that effect you know by reducing your stress hormone balancing out and improving thyroid helping balance of estrogen and progesterone that effect alone can have dramatic responses to fibroids and helping them reduce over time so you know topically do we have to actually because this is the question i get after i say all that is like do i actually need to put the the pack topically over my fibroids right because people always want to know should i just put it straight on my pelvic region well it's actually more beneficial to put it on your liver at least one once like one night on the liver and then another night on the pelvic region and the reason being is that yes you do want the contact and direct to the fibroids because that is going to help locally because uh castor oil also um you know over the years they've said that potentially what castor oil is doing on a mass topically is that it actually helps to break down how that mass is reacting so allowing the body actually to clear it out better so you do still want to put that pack on the fibroid directly but you still want to go to the source and the source of the estrogen problems the sources are within the liver and within the digestive area so that's why you always want to do the pack over the body and this is why you see this is my little female model who is wearing her castor oil pack and she is wearing it ideally over the liver on the right hand side of your body so this is right underneath your right right side and this is over your liver and see it covers not only the liver but you're covering a bit of the adrenal glands in the back you're covering a bit of your stomach your gallbladder your liver your intestinal area so a lot of the small intestine too so you're getting a variety of areas where you're impacting here so once once a night here and then the second night after doing the pack then you can move it down over to your pelvic region i do that being said also have patients who you know in the in the late evening when they're watching a movie or relaxing by the tv or doing their reading they'll actually wear the pack over their pelvic region before they go to bed and as they're getting ready to bed they actually move their pack over their liver and they go to sleep with their pack overnight so that's a really i love really that way as well too if i had to choose i mean personally i kind of like the put it on your pelvic region first for about an hour and then plop it up on your liver and go to bed because you get a more overall more effective more faster treatment but if that's not for you then at least do it one night over your pelvic region and one night over your liver nice um let's uh the other application i want to talk about because it's it's um you've already mentioned it that we can alternate between the positioning it on the liver and then then the uterus and then switching it around uh can we talk a little bit about the efficacy of castor oil on the liver itself so one of the things that you guys there is a whole chapter in a book just on how to detoxify your liver is um and there's just so many other things you can do as well including digestive bitters um using a lot of cruciferous vegetables in your diet this just goes on and there's a lot of really nice simple things you can do um but one of my definite favorites is doing castro packs over the liver can you jump in a little bit on and talk about why does it have such a big impact on the liver awesome yeah the liver you know the liver according to traditional chinese medicine is the organ that is in charge of control of the body right so when the body's out of control the liver is angry and in a woman who has hormonal problems guess what her body is out of control right she's getting all of these symptoms you're getting all these symptoms that you don't understand you can't sleep well hot flashes night sweats you're just you're really not feeling well in your body every time you step on the scale even though you're not eating very much you gain weight you feel bloated you know you don't digest well maybe you have acid reflux i mean the list just goes on and on and on so that's a body that's out of control so according to traditional chinese medicine what does the liver try to do while the liver it tries to gain control and the more that it tries to gain control in the system where it cannot gain control well the angrier it gets and angry we can correlate that to it being more and more inflamed problem is is that over time as your liver gets more and more inflamed it then can be moving towards a non-fatty liver non-alcoholic fatty type liver and that means that the cells of liver aren't actually functioning properly and their ability to cleanse into detox actually gets reduced greatly and so when that happens guess what the problems are is that you can't eliminate and you can't clear out and you can't process probably your your estrogen and your progesterone or any of your thyroid hormones or anything so the mess just keeps on getting bigger and bigger your liver keeps on trying to get more and more control getting more and more inflamed and then you just keep on feeling worse and worse and worse so the point of doing the castor oil pack is that locally you're gonna start to immediately reduce inflammation from the moment that you put it on your body because castor oil remember it it functions on the mechanism same like your fish oils but instead of it having to be absorbed and then being modified then being changed then go to a special area no no you're doing it directly on the liver and that's what has the biggest greatest impact is that it's directly on the liver so then you can also be doing strategies orally and internally with healthy foods and the wonderful recipes like in your book magdalena which are just like awesome like i i always love eating with you because you're just like the best that the rest of your recipes are just spectacular and i always feel in more hormonal balance after leaving your house for sure just because the food is so wonderful um but these castor oil packs they're gonna do it from the outside in and then what that does is that makes everything that you're taking from the inside work that much better and so you can improve better you can improve faster and you can feel better faster and your liver now becomes unoptimized liver happy in control cleaning out and processing organs you know like properly manipulating and moving and making your thyroid hormone so your thyroid can function normally like you know the comments that we get from people and this is what always is is the most astounding and and it just leaves me awestruck every single time is that women will put on a castor oil pack at night and by the morning what'll happen is that they'll feel their tummy is flatter and they'll feel have less love handles they'll feel like an immediate action with just using the pack and that is literally the effect of having an anti a very powerful anti-inflammatory that you know just doesn't only stay on the on the tissues it actually is the only oil that can go deep into the liver it goes deep into the liver and exerts that action of anti-inflammation right away and so the liver is happy and that that's the key to it and you know i will say i i always think of castor oil as being like the great mover um it's like i mean you can give castor oil to to drink to a pregnant woman and induce labor right and the same way you know for people who are severely constipated will drink castor oil i'm not recommending that but i'm saying you know if that's a phenomenal it happens and you get like a serious bowel movement um right so it's an amazing mover and this and it's no surprise that so many of us feel like our liver just really gets this incredible wonderful flash without doing you know any anything else um well the other thing i will also say that you know the some of the benefits that our community the hormonal balance community has been reporting on castor oils is um is sleeping a lot deeper oh yes yes uh having a better bowel movement like feeling really fully eliminated and you know i i've said it before and i'll say it again that whenever you are constipated you're bound to have hormonal problems you're resticulating all these hormones especially estrogens and they're re-entering your bloodstream and you're just like recycling trash uh taxing your liver even further right so it can help with constipation women feel like they sleep a lot deeper they just overall have a much better quality sleep i've been experimenting a little bit with my aura ring which kind of like gives you a lot of different um you know stats about your a whole bunch of different things but um one of them is is the quality of your sleep and i have been noticing now whenever i do wear a castor oil pack my deep sleep so you have you have um you know you have um shallow sleep you have rem sleep and deep sleep and deep sleep you only get about an hour to two hours a good a healthy person will get between an hour to two hours of sleep if if let's say if i had alcohol at night um or if i'm stressed out over my deep sleep will be as little as 20 minutes yeah then with castor oil packs what i've been noticing is that my dc tends to get longer so i've been monitoring that and tagging that whenever i do get castor oil pack on my phone which is really interesting it's it's yeah you can we hear these reports all the time i mean we get people constantly giving back their feedback from their aura ring and how shocked and surprised they are and and it's amazing because you know not much research has actually literally been done on castor oil pack there's a few studies here and there but the studies that have come out with with the information is the same you know one was done in in europe in an old age home and they were comparing the castor oil packs to laxatives and what they found was that you know the castor oil pack worked better than laxatives especially because you know the old people it was difficult for them to walk to the bathroom like they had mobility issues and so if you give them a laxative it's too hard too strong you know there's rebound constipation but with castor oil packs what would happen is that they would start to get into a regular pattern of having bowel movements and that that's the most important thing because you know as much as as much as you know we'd all love to have a magic pill you know castro packs are not a magic pill but they are magical because what they do do is that over time they do put you in that natural amazing rhythm that is the one that is divinely ours and that we should own and that we should have regularly right yeah totally um we have a lot of questions about other applications and so i just want to kind of breathe through quickly through them because we really want to focus on the liver and the fibroids and the uterus today that's the purpose of today's call um but you know i will say one of them remember how when we attended one of the conferences together and there was a lady from russia who joined us at a table for lunch and she said oh so you do castor oil i she didn't realize um that it can really work for the liver but what she said interestingly she said castor oil is something that i use that we use in russia to stimulate hair growth right and so so that's really fascinating talk to us a little bit about other applications um that can re the castro can help as well awesome yeah there's there's just so many ways it is used because i mean this is a practice that has been in existence since like 4000 bc like the first reported them finding castor oil in usage was 4000 bc in egyptian tomes so the egyptians used castor oil all over the place and i i bring up egypt because cleopatra was well well known for her castor oil use in fact she actually attributed a lot of her beauty like her eyes the whites of her eyes she would always apply castor oil in the white then it would make her eyes whiter and then of course her eyebrows as you know in any picture or even you know yeah exactly her eyes like these dark dark dark dark eyebrows it's kind of like the the style that we have today right right hold on i don't think i want to have thick eyebrows like that i'll be back yeah these are definitely casual enhanced i'm going to say i don't have any any of that treatment done but they're definitely castor oil and ants and you know i even look at myself in like my eyelashes like uh you know i've been doing castor oil for a long time and i have these lashes i'm like where do they come from like no fake eyelashes like it's i have a couple pictures that i've taken on on last last uh product launches and you know my eyes are looking down and my lashes are so long and i was like wow this stuff really works i mean i was convincing myself that i'm already convinced right so it's always good to get more and more proof but but you know for hair it works wonderfully well so much so well in fact that we we launched a an awesome hair wrap and a hair kit you know where you you actually put castor oil in the roots of your hair you use a comb in order to stimulate the circulation in the scalp and then you can also put you put castor oil in the bottom of the roots and then you wrap your head around and you keep it wrapped up for about an hour the thing when you do do castor oil for your hair is you the the problem that people have is that they put too much we're in a society where we want to use a lot of castor oil but it's not about that in fact what we did is comparison like on all of our treatments to the old ways that people were doing castro pack they were using too much castor oil um they would use when they would do a classical liver pack they'd use a whole bottle of the oil and they would like super saturate it no we don't do that we don't waste we use two tablespoons the first time then after that one tablespoon and less and less as you go until you need to replace your pack after two months and then with the hair kit you just only put a dollop size in your roots and then you put again like if i had long hair i do just put it at the bottoms right where there could be damage because that that that those are the key places in order to like make sure you put the oil in and not all over the hair because it's too it's just too much it's about the thyroid talk about the thyroid yeah so thyroid you know so here's the thing when when women have problems with when women get cysts or accumulations um in german medicine it's a type of a body system that basically accumulates it's commonly connected to what's called a lymphatic body type um oftentimes they have blue eyes um they'll have cystic breasts they'll also notice like cystic fibrosis on their thyroid and they are also as a sideline the women who are tend to be prone to get fibroids and ovarian cysts now in clinical practice this is what i noted uh we i have a mandatory policy where i actually do physical exam with every single patient who walks in the room for this reason is that many doctors don't put their hands on patients and many doctors like most women who have thyroid condition have never even had their thyroid examined and you know i would put my hands on every single woman in clinical practice and 98 of them would have something that i would palpate or that i would touch that i would be like wait a minute that isn't the normal thyroid and you know if any woman at home wants to check their thyroid all you got to do is it's like this like big this is your esophagus you can see it on me it's nice and clear which is really nice your thyroid lies right in between of the v right so if you actually want to touch it and see what you do is you put your fingers gently and you you move i know it's kind of geeking out here on the thyroid exam but i think it's so cool you push your thyroid out to one side because then you're able to actually feel your thyroid to see if you have nodules ah yeah i get dropped and i need i feel i don't have any but you can and over time you can start to feel you're saying if somebody had a thyroid nodule that they could feel the nodule oh yeah oh absolutely so you just gotta push it and and you can feel it and again you know this also takes practice and time and having done it quite a bit and so obviously i got very good with my fingers being able to notice the difference between like a regular thyroid gland and noticing when the thyroid gland was inflamed or noticing when there were cysts but no word of a lie 20 98 of my women we would send them out for ultrasound they would come back with a positive ultrasound ultrasonography for positive on on nodules and you know it's it's amazing i was just doing a little review of the literature um this morning and you know there's a big correlation between what type of nodules you have in your thyroid and the type of cysts that you may have in your breasts like it's it's really incredible just like but it's classic that if you if you are the type of person who accumulates in little bags and sacks and you have thyroid nodules or breast cysts or fibroids it's highly likely you're going to have that right now yeah and it's uh and i had both and at the same time too and it certainly is i mean both of them have literature showing connection with estrogen dominance in fact we had a couple of days ago we had a whole day dedicated just to breast health and using castor oil also to um we were showing we had a wonderful guest called gay walden and she was showing how to do a lymphatic massage of the breasts using castor oil right and so so if you if this is your problem then you you guys might want to watch that video it's everything by the way all the events um all the past videos are posted on overcoming estrogen dominance dot com slash events and you get the replay of all the previous videos uh right there so it's easy for you too awesome make sure you don't miss out on anything and i'll just mention one other thing about breast and then let's move on to questions and the giveaway because we've got a ton of questions coming in the and the answer is yes you can apply your castor oil on the thyroid completely and there is there you go so there's a yeah for that too yeah yeah um the what i was gonna say is um we had a lady in our community our close group and she said that she had a double mastectomy and um and then which came with a lot of you know a lot of swelling and even though she had drainage and all that everything was obviously very swollen she had a double mastectomy done at the same time and so she what she ended up doing is putting castor oil oil on her yeah on the pad right and then applied it on her on her breasts and she said literally within hours all that swelling came down and the pain reduced and all that which is really quite quite amazing yeah it's one of the reasons why i designed the pack in this shape right to be able to like because it is in the shape of an infinity symbol if i take this path up here it is in the shape that actually fits perfectly for the breasts if you notice you see so it actually fits perfectly for the breasts and my mother is an 11 year breast cancer survivor i i lost her um a couple years ago but she survived 11 years past breast cancer and she was actually one of my very first persons to try out my the first time that i had made the castor oil pack and i truly believe like her cancer was aggressive it was spread all over and she lived a very long time but a huge part of her treatment was that she used castor oil pucks on her liver on her breasts on her mastectomy like it like really she did and it was castrol helped a lot so um let's do the giveaway and um so do you um do you have a specific question that you would want to ask our audience i do i do i would like to say why is it that you absolutely have to wear a pack that's a good one okay okay why do you have to wear a pack yeah yeah why do you not just only put oil on your belly and wear an old t-shirt why is it so very important to wear a pack let's see if they let's see if they're paying attention all right um let's uh jump into uh questions so taylor let's focus on those questions that are the general use of castor oils as well as the fibroids liver sort of questions and and and rather than those ones i like about thyroid and stuff grace is saying hi magdalena my result can i use castor oil pack during ovulation and even after polyp's removal uh hysterectomy performed a week ago please thank you okay excellent so um your high grace oh beautiful name that's my niece's niece's name as well too beautiful um so i although obviously i'm not your doctor practitioner i don't know your personal case so i can't give specific recommendations but what i can do is tell you how we've used that in practice um we have absolutely during up for some reason out there in the world they said that you can't do castor oil packs during ovulation or you can't do them during your period and that is just simply not the case you absolutely can do it at any time in your cycle and in fact post hysterectomy i found them incredibly valuable because well let's face it you've lost important tissues right that did have a purpose but for some reason we absolutely had to remove them um so now it's a part of resetting the system and getting that balance back so wearing a castor oil pack as long as you're not placing it over any open wound i doubt that you would be doing that um because there shouldn't be on your surgery i'd imagine but if there is do not place the castor oil pack over any open wound but you can absolutely use it immediately after surgery and it's probably one of the best things you can do and because it helps to reduce the amount of scar tissue that you might be created post surgery you know within those first few days and that first week and there's a lot of inflammation because the tissues are trying to heal the more inflammation that you have that isn't regulated the more scar tissue that you'll create and long term that can cause problems in your digestion i mean i've even had a few patients where scar tissue in scar tissue's past hysterectomy has actually scarred into the bowels and caused problems with constipation later so really really important and i highly emphasize doing castor oil pax post hysterectomy is really really important or even if you're considering having a hysterectomy right sometimes that can be a savings just to so it's my fault i it's not a hysterectomy i misread is hysterescopie removal so it's way smaller than that oh yeah absolutely not even a concern at all that's actually a great time because you'd still have your you'd still have your your uterus intact so then absolutely go for it you can 100 do it yeah no problem actually better again to prevent the scarring the scarring that could occur right yeah awesome uh tonya tania is saying how many days do you do the castor oil packs all right so i would say every day right because well i know my patients i know human beings i know us women you know we tell ourselves to do something every day we might not do it every single day right but ideally it is done nightly and you look at it like no differently than you eat well every day or you do breathing exercises every day or you brush your teeth yeah yeah this is something that is constantly keeping your body optimized and its cleansing processes and its detoxification and you know my training in germany that was the number one thing that they would emphasize is the very first thing you do is you start cleaning a patient to find out what really is the problem so you know daily is the idea we're constantly exposed to toxins chemicals estrogens from the outside so making a practice of a daily is great if you find that's too much make it a goal of at least three to five times a week so that that way it's like on a regular schedule or the other option is to do like a seven day on seven days off seven days on seven days off so as anything in life the more that you give into it the more that you put into it the more that you get out of it so it really depends on what you want to get out of it the more that you do it the more that you will get out of it so that's that's the best guidance there for how long and is it okay to use on kids oh wonderful so ideally a minimum of one hour it is even better to wear it overnight and there's actual reasons for that again according to traditional chinese medicine uh three one to three a.m is the hour of the liver and this may be the time when many of you women out there many of you are waking up right you're finding like oh you're wait woken up maybe you have to go pee maybe you don't maybe you're just woken up and you find it hard to go back to sleep because the liver is so active when the liver is overwhelmed it can't do its job properly it's trying to detoxify and cleanse but if it's unable to do that what happens that all the toxins just start to irritate your nervous system and your brain and and your stress glands and it you get woken up because the toxins that are floating about and that can't be processed out of the body this is so important and so if you're one of those women's it is highly recommended and probably a really good idea for you to be doing castrol pots nightly and regularly overnight because it's going to help your body to better optimize liver function and optimize its natural cleansing and detox abilities and then that way instead of the toxins and excess estrogens floating about all night long causing hot flashes and night sweats instead they're going to come out of the body they're going to be processed packaged moved into the intestine and then when you wake up in the morning you'll have a nice healthy bowel movement that will get them out of the way so it's a really good routine for especially for those women who have those problems sleeping problem sleeping at night it'll be even more on point for you yeah and we're gonna have you back here uh another time when the book launch is over um to talk about poop and how do you because that's one thing that i know this is like a huge area for you and and i really love that and so castor oil is just definitely nice so nice to help eliminate she's asking about kids too can they use it kids absolutely everyone can use these they're safe for everybody children especially great we have a lot of people in our community in our queendom actually the moms do with their daughters i have a gastroenterologist actually who does it with her daughter every night so imagine that an md gastroenterologist doing every night with her daughter you can imagine that it's good stuff um so with kids it's absolutely fine we start castor oil from the moment of birth with children um within the first year of life it's great to do a little castor oil abdominal massage because that helps them to get really good digestion set up right from the beginning and then castrol pox from one years of age moving forward so it's a it's a great thing the earlier you could start your kids on castro pots the better that it is for them because get in the habit of it and they'll just know it's normal and then they'll be like my children you know my children you know now are uh 19 18 and 21 uh first sign of anything any upset in their body because i don't know where they put their castor oil pack but somehow they hide it somewhere they're again you know teenagers young young adults so you know not so responsible but there was like mom where's my castor oil pack and i'm like here you go put on your castor pack why aren't you doing it regularly a lot so talking about um let's let's talk about precautions who should not be using castor oil packs so anyone who's pregnant it isn't it is not the time to use your castor oil pack and that really is the only contraindication for castor oil packs uh women who are trying to get pregnant now you can absolutely use castropox you just need to use the timing method so no different than family planning right how you you know you only have sex at certain points in time when you're you know not ovulating with castor oil packs what you do is you're okay to use a castor oil pack from the point of bleeding all the way up until day 12 to 15 or maybe you feel that you've ovulated maybe you're testing your ovulation and then or you've had sex and there's a possibility that you might have gotten pregnant then you stop doing the castor oil pack all the way up until the time that you start bleeding again just in case she got pregnant during that time yeah you know there's a lot of our population of women who might have pcos might have problems you know just their hormones in general and they've been trying to get pregnant thyroid issues and not able to get pregnant um and so this routine has worked for many of them in order to just you know reset reset their cycle and also get everything flowing and moving and and more importantly really preparing the body as a garden to really grow a new life right because that's that's the biggest reason why most women don't get pregnant is that their levels of hormones and toxins are too high and they can't clean it right yeah it's a great way to prepare for sure um what is the um what about what would you say someone who is having um some really really heavy menstruation going on would you recommend for them to do it or not do it so i recommend for them to do it but to be very smart about how they do it don't start your castor oil pack on the first day of that super heavy menstruation it's the first time you've ever done a castor oil pack let me tell you it'll be too much for your body your body won't be able to handle it and it might actually make you feel worse because you know castor oil even though gentle can it moves things right so if you're one of those persons whose body is already aggressively trying to get things out of it well it you know castrol just is going to help the body to do what it does naturally better so what's more advisable is this is to actually start after a period start doing the castor oil pack do it for the preparation period all the way up until you do get your period and then you can safely do it through your period and you should absolutely not have major symptoms in fact most people when they do it that way they actually find that their period is like way better already than the last period that they had before they started the castor oil pack okay awesome um let's bring on more questions great dream spinner films um that's what shows up as a name how often do you wash the packs and how awesome awesome so we what we recommend is this is that ideally you try not to wash your pack you try to stay away from washing it because none of us like to wash if we can avoid we try to not wash it the pack has a life of around two to three months if you're a frequent user it's about two months and then you really want to discard the pack and get a new one refill it and the reason being is this is that well we don't know we the the science isn't clear whether or not castor oil or toxins come out through the castor oil back into the pack so we don't clearly know that so that's one of the reasons why we always say you know i would refresh your pocket after a two-month period when you do your pocket try to the first time only use a minimal amount of oil only two tablespoons in the middle of the pack and each time i actually got this ready because i was doing a demo this morning so this is two tablespoons yeah that's what it looks like that's all you need that's all you need yeah right you know at first some people see it also we i'm keeping it away from the seams yeah right so that that way it doesn't leak out um and or leech out and and then stain your clothing so if you keep it in the middle like this it's good enough and as your body warms it up it's gonna start spreading around but guess what it's gonna spread to that that empty area here and it's gonna stop there rather than be getting onto your shirt although i will play i mean occasionally somebody was asking a question earlier about what if you turn and toss and stuff like that right and um you know and so do you can you comment on that even if you're talking yeah this pack let me tell you it is not perfect i mean it's as close to perfect as i could get with castor oil i've been doing this for like 11 years and this now i think is my like seventh or eighth model so the first ones were completely different they were square they were totally different um this is by far the best and you know it is and i'm going to keep on improving it to always make it better for you but it's it's not mess less it's less mess i want to be incredibly clear and authentic with that with you guys here today um a lot of it is how you do it to make it easier so again keeping all the oil in the center trying to stay away from the seams and i still you know i still wear i mean when we go stay in a hotel you see i'm wearing an old t-shirt you're wearing an old t-shirt like we still wear something old on top just because there could be some there could be some transfer sometimes you know this oil can be very sneaky and it can kind of like get into the scenes without you even noticing it sometimes like as much as you try and it gets into the seams right so just try to keep it in the center and then if you do have to wash it you know i always find that if i do have to wash it somewhere around the three or four week period um by then there's a couple ways to do it one is in your dishwasher just you do need to make sure that you're using clean soap i use a nice healthy soap for you put it in the dishwasher once it's out of the dishwasher you do still have to do a little bit of work where you put the pack on a cloth and you roll it you like roll the cloth like the entire like inside part and the back side with a cloth you roll it and you keep on squeezing it to squeeze out the oil out of the pack right because because castor oil sticks to things and know that that clot that you're going to use to wash that you're going to be discarding that because it will be full of oil and you won't be able to get it out and so that's the reason why we say you know replace after two months get a new one try to avoid washing as much as possible because if there really has been any complaints in our community it's really been just about the washing because it is harder um but we try your best so if you do do it that way that works if you don't have a dishwasher you can soak it in hot water and baking soda soaking in hot water and baking soda can work great overnight and then in the morning you want to hand wash it again with a clean soap and then you do the same process put a cloth on the bottom put an old cloth on top you roll the pack you squeeze it squeeze it squeeze it keep on doing it and then lay it flat to dry and then you should be good to go to start fresh again i i will tell you i've had mine washed and um and and i will put it in um in a in my washing machine just alone without any other clothes and put it on hot water okay and and it's great like it feels it feels really nice and so i i find personally that to be the easiest method and don't i don't put it in a dryer i just let it um air dry on um on my top yeah don't mix it with any clothing or yeah because yeah i know you don't want to you know it'll transfer um let's see what other questions do we have coming in uh does this cramp your stomach awesome no it'll actually do the opposite it'll make your stomach a little better if you're having ibs or any type of symptoms like that like that was the first reason i was using it was to literally make myself that was like punched up in pain like just alleviate that pain so and honestly like i travel with it because if i eat something wrong or if something didn't sit well like i know i have my trusty castor oil pack and that there isn't really too much that compares to how quickly it makes me feel better and that's that's seen all the time when people use it okay great question yeah let's see what other questions do we have love it such a wonderful community you have laura's saying can it be used to remove makeup sure can this is a thing castor oil i truly feel should be a part of everyone's pharmacy and beauty cabinet and it should be kind of that big staple that you have there because you castrol is an excellent oil again if you think of what castor oil does in our bodies it grabs things it moves excess estrogen out of the body right but same thing with the makeup so if you if you have too much eye makeup on you can just use castor oil around the eyes and take it off and yeah there's a whole beauty routine you can do do you remember our little trip to uh north carolina yes a little trip and we had a whole spa day with castor oil because there's so much that you can do from washing your face with castor oils scrubs and masks and gosh and like eye makeup remover it's just it's such a well known so because it is a quite a thick oil um i do recommend so that's what i do is i put it in a bottle and i do use half i use half castor oil and the other one you use witch hazel but not the non-alcohol containing one and having these two together kind of um you know it dilutes the castor oil to and and and it's just easier i find to remove your makeup but just a really great way to get the makeup off that's for sure now one other thing i want to talk about and we come back to the questions in just a second you guys we get a lot of questions today that's awesome it's an interesting topic casserole is always our huge interest for our community i want to talk a little bit about um you bottling that in glass yeah um and so can you talk a little bit about it because i think you are the only brand there's i think one other one um bottling in glass but you are like one of the very few brands that will and most of the most other products are being bottled in plastic can you explain why would you want to go through the trouble of doing this and and before you answer that i will say one thing that you know as a as a manufacturer myself too now right and as we have our supplements and and digestive bitters and all that stuff is when you when we transition over to glass it's a royal pain in the ass it really is it's our shipping has gone up um our you know our um the damage is a lot higher um when we ship through amazon we need to do additional packing because amazon requires you to be able to drop at least our supplements from two two-story building without damaging the product so you have a you have a lot of plastic that goes into packaging there's gonna be another story and in spite of all this um all these issues and it's because of material is more expensive which goes because then is passed on to to you guys right and so but you could make a lot more money as um as a manufacturer by putting things into plastic so can you just explain why are you going through the pain of doing this yeah well you know i think first and foremost is that this is my mission in life and you know you and i have conversations and i really truly want to give the best of people out there in the world and this is what i use on me and this is what i use on my children and my husband and my patients that i love dearly and all the people in our community that i love dearly as well too and i would never even fathom giving them something that wouldn't be the highest equality that's that's number one that's just my prerogative on everything and i learned early on in my practice that it was as important of how you did something as that you did that did it and you could do something but if you didn't do it well using the right tools it was worthless and and this is one of the reasons why castro packs have maybe fallen out of fame or out of practice because people didn't get results with it because a number one they weren't using an actual pack and putting that pack on the body but number two they were using a cheaper a non-quality oil and you know with castor oil you have to be really really cautious because there's a lot of people out there who are bottling and not the best quality of castor oil and then on top of it they're also bottling in plastic so there's two factors to actually be concerned with um so number one castor oil there's all these different varieties of castor oil right ours is extra virgin hexane free it is just cold presses as natural from the plant as you possibly can get and that is my prerogative because what happens with that kind of an oil is that you just get that much more nutrients within it i mean your your stockpiling the vitamin e the glutathione glutathione is an expensive supplement when you're taking that oral you know castor oil naturally recycles that in the body that's another action why it helps the liver too right so you get much higher levels of these these aspects prostaglandins are better levels when you're using a much better quality oil like the one that we have which is completely toxin free we don't use any chemical to extract it's literally just pressing it the way that they used to do it in egypt and in rome and all over the mediterranean basin and all over the world just pressing it and then the glass why is glass so important i've since the beginning of my practice i have always said if there's only one thing that you're going to buy for food substance organic then just make sure it is your oil it has to be the number one thing if there's only one thing that you can afford make sure it is always your oil now this is important with dietary oils like olive oil etc but it's even more important with castor oil because castor oil is an oil that is a carrier oil it is the very best carrier oil when it comes to things like essential oils it in whey beets like sweet almond oil or lenolene oil or any of the other oils that are jojoba oil anything else that is used for essential oils because castor oil is the only oil because of its actual molecular structure that is able to get past that first like layer of skin and deep into your tissues so let's say from for women for wrinkles around the eyes as an example when you're putting castor oil around your eyes what's happening is that it can actually pass through that top layer and go deep into the tissues where your collagen is and that's why castor oil can help reduce the fine appearances of lines around your eyes other oils don't really do that because the other oils can't get into the tissues so if castor oil is so awesome at bringing things into the body then guess what if you have it packaged in plastic uh-huh you got it and if there's any heat around it if it's been stored in that bottle for too long that's that plastic starts to melt into the oil and now here you are trying to do a hormonal treatment to clear up your hormones but what you're doing is you're actually bringing in more plastics more estrogens you end up defeating the purpose of doing the castor oil pop in the first place so i cannot emphasize how important the quality is making sure you have organic material for your your cloth or your pack which is what we use you know we use organic material the outside is a polyurethane shell that is made with no chemicals you know it's a very special manufacturing process that we have to do so is this um because i got this question a lot as well so this is not plastic are you using vegetable salad nose yeah it's a no it's a polyurethane so it is actually plastic but plastics are made differently and this plastic is made with no heavy metals no chemicals nothing that could disrupt hormonal balance because let me see my my population and me it's we all deal with hormonal dysregulation so if i were to go and put a product that disrupted hormones well then i wouldn't be any better off either i do every single day so i don't have a special stack stash for me and then a special stash for people no i have the same stash for everybody because i believe in treating everyone the same way so so this material even though it might look plastic you'll see that over time it deteriorates because it isn't a normal plastic it's not a plastic that's those things that make it bound but it's also the reason to why two months and then you it's time also to let it go because these things have a lifetime right um the um we're having a lot of questions coming in about where to buy it from hey you guys so we posted the link number of times in the comments there's a button there's a there's a link saying where you can get it so click on that um and the other thing is a lot of questions about canada yes um dr marzul actually is based in canada so her store supports canada for a change which is really nice because yeah wants to be like oops sorry only us and people get very disappointed um so that's covered and then um i i'm not sure i think she's talking to you so let's post this out lisa is saying about your castor oil and use it every day and night especially when i'm meditating i love your book um it taught me a lot and drink lots of green tea now thank you that's not your vote because you are the green tea person i am i love green tea and i love that she mentioned about meditating because this is a little part about castor oil packs i'll leave i'll i'll end with this but you know castor oil packs if you look back into history and over time uh biblically scripturally whatever it is that you believe it that doesn't matter we're just looking at the history um of course i honor what you believe in and and such but that's on the top the topic is this is that there's a practice of anointing uh there was a practice of anointing in the bible um kings and queens used to be anointed because as a king or a queen would take and own their throne they would be anointed because it was said that the anointing or the placing of oil on the body actually brings you closer to spirit or closer to the one and connects you to everything so when you're meditating your whole goal is to really get zoned in and get you know get spiritual get open get get get connected to everything that is around you so castor oil packs not only do you get all this physical effects of it but there is an entire side of it that is actually connecting you spiritually yeah and when it comes to things like thyroid diseases and you know there's a lot to speak about how i'm writing a book right now about thyroid and castor oil and you know one of the things is that the thyroid is connected to our it's the bridge between our our physical body and our spiritual body so when there's blockages there you know we want to get good flow and as you said at the beginning my dilena you know castrols move the castro packs move things so casserole is all about getting good flow and when you meditate you're looking for good flow too the um you know one thing that comes to mind like as you you keep referencing a lot of like um historical biblical um egyptian right um you know stories weaving into the conversation today and it's a bit it's a bit unfortunate that there isn't like as many medical studies as that we would like them to be for castro but here's what i have i have learned over doing the years of doing this work is that you know like if you talk to somebody 20 years ago about meditation having a medicinal benefit right i mean they will just laugh at you going like that's a hippie thing that the beatles used to do when they go and travel to india and sit there and chant and meditate with a guru right it was kind of like the hippie crazy thing to do and now it's like you know you go to a harvard review medical review you you look at all these studies about like how meditation changes your neuroplasticity and it can help you with depression and anxiety and you can sleep better and all this body of research right and i'm like wow now we believe it because now there's evidence right where before it was it was um it was just a crazy hippie thing to do and and so i feel like with castor oil it's a little bit of a similar thing that it probably in a decade's time we're gonna have a lot more um research if that's what you if people are after but i always feel like it's such a it's such an is so important to honor um traditions you know i mean there's a number of different herbs that we're going to be talking about in the coming days that for example help hot flashes but if you ask me for a piece of research there isn't one you know but it's news for in traditional chinese medicine for for years and years so um so i i think it's just really awesome that you're bringing up a lot of these anecdotal historical references and and that does not make them any less valid just because they might not be uh research at this point yet um and you know they work right i mean they work with your patients they work with with our community i'm just gonna pop over a couple of more questions before we wrap up you guys so you never rinse it off of your body no because especially you don't um by the end of the night alex you're it's gonna be all absorbed and that's also another fascinating thing oh like where did it go inside your body and so by the time you you will feel a little bit of oiliness uh when you take off the pack but once you take a shower it all going to come off yeah no problem at all did i add about the study aspect because i love this yeah already i did in my clinic so uh just to let people know that because there is some research and and sadly like you said modern science can often take a long time to to to verify what ancient medicine knew for a long time but castrol packs were used in hospitals up until the 80s so that people know in obstetrician words and and now in my area at least there's actually uh osteo osteopathic surgeons with hip surgery replacements using castor oil packs post surgery so it's starting to make its way back into the world which is really cool to see um in my clinic in order to give it more more validity i i did a trial where we tested and i presented this at a major international conference where we tested a group of people doing a clean to two groups doing a cleanse and they all did the same things it was a combination of diet uh supplementation your key supplements colon hydrotherapy iv therapy so you're talking like a pretty intense deep cleanse and castropox in one group or no castor oil pox in the other group and we actually tested so many different measures we tested hormones we tested up normal blood levels we tested thyroid we tested iron we tested b12 we tested liver function tests we tested kidney function tests and cholesterol all these different markers that show so many different things in the body and what was amazing and what i already knew would be the results that you know when at the end of the study was that the group that did the castor oil packs over this period of time had a much greater you know noticeable improvement in their labs versus the group that didn't do the castor oil packs so you know b12 levels in many of these women these were all women who had thyroid problems low levels of b12 low levels of iron right a classic picture that you see with thyroid conditions what we would see is that all of these women post cleanse with the castor oil pack suddenly have normal levels of iron and normal levels of b12 and all their liver functions would go into normal if they would have high levels of cholesterol which is normally a sign of you know too much inflammation in their body that level of cholesterol would then normalize if they had a vitamin d level that was low chronically over years and you know we've been testing them for years they would do this cleanse and the group that did the castor oil packs their vitamin d levels would get into normal ranges higher and better than the group that wasn't doing the castor oil pack so it just you know to me that was all the proof that i really really needed to just go gung-ho and really help everybody with the with the packs yeah thank you for sharing that's um that's such an awesome um study for sure um i i will just also let's just wrap this up on a lot of there's a lot of medical questions that are coming in um and i kind of want to contextualize this a little bit so gab briedell is saying what about hot flashes and menopausal symptoms any help here and so i'll let you answer that in a second i just want to kind of set a sense of context here castro oil is just a wonderful tool yet another tool in your toolbox you know if you're eating junk if you're drinking booze every night if you are living off sugar and caffeine if you're highly inflamed because you were just eating gluten three times a day and that's not serving you you're drinking milk and such i mean you know the list goes on you know what i'm saying right um just expecting to use castor oil packs in order to relieve your symptoms of hot flashes and menopause is gonna help you maybe a little bit it might help you a lot initially and then stops working so think of it as like a wonderful tool to add on to your nutritional protocol to maybe you're doing a couple of supplements that can be really helpful castor oil just really can take it to the next level but to expect castor oil to create miracles for you while you're neglecting other parts of your protocol then i would i would say it's a little bit you know it's uh it's unfair for yourself to be expecting it's unfair of your body to exp you know to expect your body to respond just to castrol packs and nothing else okay over to you i didn't i did my that's good no no i i agree absolutely because it is it's a tool within the toolbox like this castor oil process remember castro packs yes you could start with them to begin with like that's the first thing i do with my patients but i then you know work on their diet i put them on supplements they're doing all these other things in in conjunction with it and and the reason i love the castro packs is because gastroparks makes all those things work so much better so then they can take less supplements over time and that saves the money people love that with hot flashes and menopausal symptoms as i was saying earlier you know sleep is often disturbed during menopause right so you're hot flashing you can't sleep well your night sweats um so doing your castor oil pack at night and improving the time when the liver is actually cleansing which is between the hours of 1 and 3 a.m at night if you do those those hot packs at night luckily in most cases what's gonna happen is that people find that they sleep deeper and sleep throughout the night so they don't wake up that much with like night sweats and during their day their hot flashes are greatly reduced too so that's awesome so really really this is a tool that throughout life throughout whatever the hormonal condition um it is a base tool in that protocol because whether it's pcos menopause thyroid endometriosis i mean the list goes on and on and on fibroid cysts like whatever the case may be hormonal dysregulation you know castor oil packs is at the base of the protocol it's like that foundation it's right with food right right um there is a chapter in the book on hot flashes and so you can refer to this on some page 180 that it starts and one of the interesting things that i have found with when it comes to hot flashes is that um i actually did a poll once and i asked women what have you done this is what our hormone balance community so you know people who have gone through our programs and protocols and so i posted a question saying what has helped you the most with um with estrogen with hot flashes and it came as a real surprise to me that you know some people were saying like our giving up glutens or bringing inflammation down reducing caffeine or reducing or cutting out coffee reducing um there was a few people who felt better with magnesium that kind of things right but the overwhelming overall response um to all of this was reducing your blood sugar levels reducing your your sugar intake doing your pff kind of breakfast protein fat and fiber kind of breakfast if you don't know what i'm talking about um look at our events page and you've got all the videos there i was demoing how to do breakfast and by the way all the recipes in my new book overcoming estrogen dominance are savory breakfast um there's a couple of them that have tiny bit of sweetness in it but it's just a tiny bit and um so it's all savory savory foods this is one of the greatest way of containing your um your hot flashes anyway we're going to be talking more about how flashes in the coming days we've got a whole day with my good friend dr anna cabeca we're going to be talking about maca um and blood sugar balance and all that kind of stuff so come on that one if you if you think this is gonna help you hey we can go on forever on this one um and as already we are like way over the hour so i think we're gonna draw the line somewhere thank you so much for being here today with us i i so appreciate it and we got questions about the book um and got questions about the pack so hey you guys all the links are in the comments and um and so i will just mention one thing that i forgot to say is that when you order the book um go to overcoming estrogens.com so the titleofthebook.com right and when you go there um get the book from amazon or whatever you want to get it like internationally enter the receipt number and it will send you a code we have a coup we have a discount for you um a gift card that i think all of you are going to really love and so then it will email you the code that you can use it um later on so good to see you always a good conversation you always draw a big crowd good i always love talking about the caster hope all right wonderful obsessed yeah yeah we got wonderful responses um i think part of it is because a lot of people already know about castor oil but i also do think a lot of people are kind of have shied away from doing making them a consistent practice because it's just so messy and complicated you know i mean this is like that's what i used to use right all this kind of the wooden flannel right but then you have to wrap yourself up and that thing keeps moving and you know all of that stuff so i think with your innovation and real um you know the genius of these packs you have really made it into like a daily routine for women where they really can get the benefits of castor oils rather than making it once in a while when i have the time after the thing because it really removes the barriers and it also removes the excuse of like i have no time and and whatnot because it really you know it doesn't i mean if you don't have the time to open up this darn little thing right and then fill it up with two tablespoons of and you don't even have to measure you just go um you just squirt it on and if you don't have the time for this and then put on your liver uh then you probably don't have a life you know that's just really as simple as that so find a time for doing this this is an awesome practice so many people love thank you so much for being here today and um i will see you guys later to later in the evening i'm going to be doing a book reading um on the chapter of course on fibroids because this today's whole topic is on fibroids and we're going to be talking about the other some of the other solutions including some herbal solutions that you can bring in to restrict the blood flow coming into the uterus and and that's going to help even more with reducing your fibroids thanks so much everybody for being here today thank you for your awesome questions and i'll see you later today", "-MshQ4K83z4": "welcome back to another video so today I'm gonna be showing you guys how about washing and drying my t-shirts so they won't shrink or lose any quality [Music] so I've quite a few shirts here I have one two three four five great t-shirts of course how we're letting gray three black t-shirts one two never mind just two black t-shirts should have a white t-shirt but I think I forgot it I'm gonna be right back and the white t-shirt so for starters one of the most important things to do it's of course sort them by color I've already done that as I showed you I have to graze the blacks and a white all separate the most important thing to do is to check the Kerr attack in most cases you're probably watching cold water when you're watching t-shirts especially colored t-shirts any kind of heat will shrink that t-shirt so we're gonna do a bit of a test I'm gonna use the Machine and also some hand washing methods to see which one works best before we get started we're going to measure the size of a cup of t-shirts a grey one and a black one just to see if they're gonna be the same exact size before and after washing let's do it [Music] tell me baby is a good touch time I managed alright now that we're done with the measuring let's let's get the washing so I have two gray split teeths from keeping New York everywhere so I'm gonna actually machine wash and in hand wash the other one they're both the same measurements both a size large so we're gonna see how do you still hold up so as you can see there's nothing really special about this wash I'm using is by a brand called Hotpoint have no clue what that is this would just actually inside my apartment when I moved in so this is the best we got we're using a small load we're using whites light and we always want to wash code as I mentioned one thing I will say about these low and washing machines even though you chose to wash and code in most cases is still gonna use hop for majority of the washing so that's just something to keep in mind and I can't say that it'd be the case for all washing machines but it definitely is for this one like I mentioned I don't know much about the brand hat point but I'm guessing this pretty low budget so let's look review what I got load size small I have this on whites light but let's actually go to delicates because we don't really want anything bad to happen to these clothes of course and for cold let's use tap cold we've got the shirts in there I'm gonna be using Tide Pods just one of them just one drop that in there they were gonna hit start now for the hand washing I'm going to be using Tide simply clean and fresh I'm gonna pour a little bit into the lid just a little bit make sure we're running cold water [Music] for the shout it's all the way alright and how do we have to save mother's before with cold water we're gonna pour a little bit of this in there mr. Bob Dole the t-shirt against itself I usually mainly focus on the pits [Music] because of course that's what perspiration happens very good and they'll rub it in and I do that for both mine arms now we're just going to let that soak for a little bit let me get little more water in there as I mentioned cold water dry like this so as you can see the water looks a little bit murky because of course is shirt was dirty and I'm going to check on the other shirts as I mentioned this water is hot we're just gonna do the same thing which allows for this to soak it now again I would not recommend using hot water to do these that of course what this all is about we're gonna test and see which method works best and then Jenny all right so a couple hours have passed since this has been soaking these items are completely done they've actually sat in here a little bit longer they should've I had to tend to some other stuff so I'm hoping these didn't drink at all it looks good that one looks good that one looks good so what we're gonna do with these items is hang dry them [Music] so I dressed in all the gray shirts out of the washer and then hung them on this drying rack that I got from Amazon this is a stainless steel drying rack I'm not sure exactly how much I paid for it but what I'll do is go ahead and drop a link down below so if you're wanting something like this you can find it now we have to dry out this so it's kind of hard to get a good angle on it but when I was doing I would grab a piece twist it fold it twist it fold it twist it and that's usually enough to wring out enough of the water I'm just going to put this on the rack as well and then let it dry overnight so now we're done washing all the gray t-shirts we're gonna go ahead and tackle the black t-shirts and I mentioned earlier I'll have two black t-shirts one of them is a keeping New York everywhere split tee another one is my champion logo black team I originally planned to hand wash one and machine wash the other but it actually got really late I got kind of doing something else and it's like almost 11 o'clock and I don't want to be up all night doing this video so I'm gonna go ahead and toss both of these in the washer before I do that I'm gonna do the same exact thing I did with the great tee and I'm gonna measure to keeping New York everywhere black tee as you can see keeping New York everywhere size large turn it inside out and let's take it to be measured before toss it in the washer don't need a one-handed I know two t-shirts and a washer by yourself is just a waste of water but it's kind of what I got to do I'm just like before one pod and we're gonna keep all this settings the same small delicate tap cold so now that we got the black t-shirts inside to watch her I'm going to go ahead and just hand wash this white t-shirt this is the last one has to be washed this is a white t-shirt from Urban Outfitters so let's do it [Music] alright so now we got the washer going and we got this white tee soaked in so now we're gonna wait for this cycle to be done and about that time I'll go ahead and take the shirt out of the sink alright so now we're gonna hang dry these hang drying is the most essential part of this process alright so lastly we're gonna tackle the white t-shirt and the same no I do have a setting that's going to be a drain and spin setting on my washer so for this one I'm going to utilize that if you don't have a drain and spin setting we're gonna utilize the first method I showed you which is the twist and ring [Music] [Music] as you saw I gave it a little bit of a twist in the sink as you can see it's still pretty wet so we're gonna head and drop this into washer so just gonna toss that in there we're gonna go ahead and twist this to the drain and spin and then see what happens here we go so now it's gonna drain and spin itself and then we can hang that up so it's been about maybe five minutes and I just heard to wash your stop which means this should be fully drain now all right so far so good it's pretty drain and nice and damp and ready to be hung drive the rack is pretty full got one two three four starts here the middle bar has another shirt another shirt oh boom there we go utilize this bar right here alright so all of these shirts are washed they're all drying right behind me I'm gonna get back at you guys tomorrow and then we're going to check it see how they turned out the next day it is officially the next day and the t-shirts have been drying for precisely 21 hours something like that I just got off of work and it's about eight o'clock and if you remember I think I put them to dry maybe a like nine or ten yes about almost 24 hours they are officially dry so let's check them out and Dan we're going to measure same exact t-shirts again to see if they lost any size or quality so let's do it so this was the hand wash t-shirt so he make sure he keep this separate just to remember that was hand washed the rest of these gray shirts were machine wash so I'm just going to compare these two in size because I took measurements of these so machine washed and washed and then we're gonna compare size to the black t as well was it this one yep this one hand washed cold water so a measuring from the top like before so see there all the way down and it is at 30 just a tad bit under so hmm I measured these a mouth will last my little notes here but you see the great teacher we've had at length 30 so let's see if the chest still not 23 and a half so we got the chest starting here 23 and a half so I get to save the state I really didn't lose much size with hand washing and again his home was hand washed in cold water and then hung to dry and now we're gonna test the other gray shirt that was machine wash and then hung dry so the second one just measured out for 29 and a half in a chest both these are the same exact size it looks like we might have lost a half an inch in the length and again this was the one I would machine wash so it's safe to say that the hot water that it did in a wash cycle may have shrunk just a little bit but let's check the chest so the chest is still twenty three and a half inches now to be fair I only measured one of these great t-shirts because since they're the same size I assumed that the dimensions would have been the same but that's false they probably weren't exactly the same so I should have measured both so if we were gonna lose size of the t-shirt we would have lost size from both the chest and length so at this point I don't think that the machine washing affected anything but the true testament will be the black shirt because again that went inside the machine and I did get measurements of that before going in so let's check that [Music] twenty-nine and a half like shirt merchants out at 29 they have and it appears that the black shirt didn't lose any size at all and that was in a machine wash on the dry so in conclusion I would say that it doesn't really matter which method used whether it's gonna be hand washing or machine washes make sure you use cold water and use the delicates settings for your washing machines if you have a washing machine that allows for you to control the temperature through the whole wash make sure you use cold but if it doesn't as you see minded and have those settings and for the most part I didn't lose any quality or size of my T's if you enjoyed this video make sure to leave a thumbs up comment down below and if you're new to the channel make sure you hit the subscribe button and click the

We're here\nto talk to you today about some dye sublimation. Did you know you can dye\nsublimate on more than just 100% white polyester t-shirts? I'm AJ, this is Kirk, we're going to show you today on how to do different blends of t-shirts and a\nwide range of colors. First we pressed 100% polyester t-shirts.\nYou can see we did white, a columbia blue, and a dark grey. All the same exact print, and as you can see with 100% polyester, after you wash, the colors stays the same. You're never going to have any fading when you use 100% polyester, but you are going to have the different contrast of the color coming through the inks. As you can see here on this white, the colors were super vibrant. You know, white is the best for colors. But, also, there's some cool effects on the columbia blue. Really like the colors. I like it. The look is what, you know it makes it totally different. As you can see, the\ncolor, even between the yellows on the grey - totally different. So what we did, we went and found some tri-blends, because I like more of a softer shirt. I'm kind of the guy, that kind of t-shirt snob, so I liked that type of stuff. So we went and found some tri-blends and these are like 75% polyester they got\n12% of the rayon and also 13% of your cotton. And so you look at, is like when I\npress this, I mean like what do you think? (It's cool) It looks good. But when you washed it, we're going to have a little bit of fading to it. But, I think it still overall looks great. So obviously you can do the traditional white, but then you also, your wash look, you're going have a little bit of fading. I'm a big fan of the sublimation on color. It kind of gives you that a little bit more to offer your\ncustomers. What do we have on? My favorite - 50% polyester, 25% cotton and 25% rayon. It's another style at tri-blend, but it's\nreally nice as well. It has a really fresh look when you press it. So don't get used to that, because as soon as you wash it you're going to get that better cool of a washed out look that a lot of people are going for these days. I like it. I mean I like the feel, and I think kinda of has\nthat faded look. Already looks like the garment's broken in. When you're pressing AJ, \nyou prefer to use like, when you tack stuff down - you know I'm a guy likes to use the spray. What about you and what else do you use? I like using the thermo\ntape. We have green and clear. Typically green is used more often just\nso you can see it on any color garment. But that's what I like. I like the tape\nit's tried and true. The spray is your favorite. I like using this spray a\nlittle bit. So you just kind of tack along on top of the paper. And it holds it in place. Don't have to use the tape. Just a light mist on the paper and it tacks it right in place so you don't have anything jumping off our ghosting. So more versatile for\nme because I'm doing kind of back and forth But whichever you use, obviously you still get the same results as you can see. So now AJ, let's just talk a little bit about\npricing and make sure that everyone understands like now we're using a lot\nnicer garments - they're tri-blends. So you have a little bit higher end shirt. So\nobviously you factor in obviously your time and your inks and your paper. But now you have the garment that's a little bit higher price. So don't forget now you're\nhaving an very nice garment, so you can charge more and get more for it. So obviously make sure you're getting what you're worth on these garments and\neverything else you're doing, because this is nice stuff and it's neat. So you can get all these different styles of garments that you saw here today by\ngoing to HeatTransferClothing.com And anything in the dye sublimation world\nthat we talked about with the spray or the mist paper or ink by going to HeatTransferWarehouse.com Thank you decorators for watching our video today.

and let's get to it [Music] in short the best answer I can give you is it's what you're using it for so now let's dive into a pro and con list kind of like you did with your ex before you broke up with them cotton first cotton is strong and it's soft and has been used since the dawn of time you think that would make it the best but in fact that's not good but let's dive into some more pros cotton is breathable so if Comfort is your number one choice you've found your best match another thing cotton is cheaper but that's only for now cotton is renewable and biodegradable but here's your first con cotton is a very water intensive crop with that said they also rely heavily on pesticides this would move this into the con list for sure however organic cotton has really started to make a play within the industry in the last few years okay let's next touch on polyester polyester is a petroleum-based synthetic fiber aka it's plastic you think this would be a con however in the last couple of years manufacturers have actually started to use recycled bottles to make polyester tees more pros for polyester include that it's durable meaning it will withstand all of that wear and tear polyester also dries quickly wrinkles less and is stain resistant all major pros now for the ultimate plot twist manufacturers have actually started to combine the two making it the goat of blinkx poly cotton blends don't shrink they hold both their shape and their color for extended periods of time they are affordable and they have the softness you want in your favorite team okay we've made it this far and you think you know what T is gonna work best for you but I'm about to throw you the ultimate curve ball now you have to put decoration on your apparel so let's get into it first we're going to talk about water-based inks water-based inks you have to use 100% cotton this also applies to discharged inks as well next let's touch base on plastisol inks with plastisol inks you can use bulk cotton and polyester however with poly and poly blends you'll want to make sure you touch base with the manufacturer to make sure you're good to go in the ink Department when it comes to embroidery you can use both cotton and polyester however just make sure you have the right thread count to make sure your needle will pass through the thread with ease finally heat transfers for vinyl you can use both cotton and polyester however make sure you have the recommended heat settings from the vinyl manufacturer for sublimation we recommend using a hundred percent polyester after all of that I guess we're gonna have to let the debate continue because as you can see it really depends on what you're using the product for but we want to hear what works best for you guys and what is your tried-and-true so give us some comments below to let us know what works best for you thank you guys so much for stopping by to engage in the debate of what is better cotton or polyester if you're looking for more debates like this click that subscribe button turn on your notifications and have a great rest of your day oh hey there thought you'd get rid of me but here I am talking again don't worry you'll only have about five more seconds to pick another video before time runs out look at that one in the top I think that one looks very interesting", "fWfdzXfZ5uI": "what's up y'all I'm Madison beam and welcome to another video if you love budget style and beauty be sure to hit that subscribe button because I make content like this all the time but in today's video we're having a little faceoff of who makes the best budget white t-shirt as you guys may have noticed in my last several your girl has been scooping up a lot of white t-shirts and that's because it really is the go-to basic of the season a lot of publications were reporting that it was supposed to be the year at the tank top that's we're seeing on all the spring runway shows but like I've said in other videos that all changed when Meghan Margo was seen on one zoom meeting wearing a white t-shirt so now it's absolutely everywhere we've been seeing celebrities even Quarantine styling white t-shirts different ways so I wanted to see for the money from brands like Target Walmart hmm and more who made the best budget white teeth I spent my coin so you guys don't have to as always I will link everything in the description box and for size reference in this video I'm between 5 2 and 5 3 I'm very short I weigh around one hundred and forty five pounds and I'm typically a dress size 6 I'll share my sizes as we go because it does vary from brand to brand so now let's go ahead and hop in the video so when I was planning for this video I really thought that I was gonna choose one favorite but as I discovered ordering a bunch of white t-shirts and different styles some are better for different outfits so instead I'm gonna break this down more by category and then at the end I'll share with you guys my favorites out of everything so starting with the top that I have on this cropped pocket boyfriend tee this is from Walmart and it's around $8 but you could normally catch on rollback for even cheaper than that I did get my in a size medium but I could have definitely gone with a small this shirt is 100% cotton as well and I am so obsessed with this style if you guys have seen my last Walmart haul you know that I went kind of crazy and I bought this literally in every color that I could find it first of all of the boxy oversize style are what's really popular for 2020 I also find this to be very flattering on my body type because it is on the more cropped side and you can still see my waist especially if I do decide to do like a little front tuck the sleeve also hits me lower which I find extremely flattering it does have a drop sleeve some of these tees as you're gonna see don't hit me necessarily in the best spot for my arms but this one really does and it's the main reason why I absolutely love this style it does also of course have the pocket another pocket white team that I have is from Target and if you're more into feminine styles this is definitely the one that I would go with it does taper in a little more at the waist and it does have a scoop on the bottom and set up just the straight across crop and the sleeves do cuff up you can't undo this by the way it is how the shirt actually comes but I do like that this fabric is a little different from any of the other shirts in this video and that's because it's 50% linen so it does give it a little bit more texture than any of the other shirts the other 50% is polyester by the way and I did get this in a size small and it's around 16 dollars out of all the white t-shirts in the video this is really the one to me that screamed summer so I definitely like that about it it is on the more see-through side so I would expect to wear a white or nude bra or to wear a cami underneath it honestly out of all of these even a thicker ones I would still expect to wear a white or new bra but especially this one is more see-through and I do honestly grab for it often like I said if you're a more into feminine styles this is the one that I would go with and my last pocket tee I did order from Amazon and it's the jockey brand I bought in the medium and it was $13 to be honest I'm pretty disappointed in this shirt I was hoping to have it be comparable to the shirt that I have on but first of all it does fit very small I would definitely size up in this if I had to do it again also it has the word jockey across the pocket which it did not show on it was on this show that this was a completely white pocket now they don't even sell this shirt at all so I'm not even sure I can return this but I'm a try and it's not that it's the world's most terrible quality white t-shirt but I personally just don't really want to walk around in a jockey on the pocket Amazons brand daily ritual has a cropped pocket tee that I would recommend instead of this jockey one the website listed as a cotton in Modell's blend which is my absolute favorite that's what gives it that nice stretch and it just feels really smooth but I definitely would skip this so another Amazon white tee is this one and it was $60 and I did get this in a size large and yes I said large because this is a pretty small shirt it's 65% polyester 30% cotton and 5% spandex I love fabrics that either have spandex in them or they have a spandex feel it's super comfortable and I really love that the tied detail is already built in on this one I normally have to tie up my t-shirt so I like that this one already came with that with that being said I do feel like this is a really small I'd also wear it with high-waisted jeans or even some high waisted leggings but to do it again I would size up I do really like it though and they have this in a ton of different colors in different patterns in this same style so I'm definitely gonna order more of them but I'm personally gonna go with an extra large so next onto just the plain scoop neck tee that's what I did get from Amazon Amazon does sell them in a two-pack so I did go with this oatmeal color and you can get two white ones though and I know this is a video about white tee shirts but I absolutely love it in this oatmeal color as well and I did get both of these in a size small because I read their reviews that this is supposed to be a lot more fitted and more snug so that's just what I went with but if you don't want to just tie it just size one up although I do really like this fit both of them are a cotton and Modell blend and that's what gives the fabric comes done so much stretch and honestly you guys be sure to feel like butter and I really do love these shirts with that being said I understand that this is sleeve in particular hits my arm at the widest part and it's not necessarily the most flattering sleeve it also very see-through so I know I'll have to wear a lighter bra with this but these are still some of my favorite shirts in the whole video next I have the basic white scoop neck from H&M and I got this one in a size medium it's also 100% cotton I really love this shirt and it was only $4.99 you guys this one isn't as tight so even though the sleep still hits me at the widest part like the last one it's not as obvious as the Amazon one and overall it's a lot more loose fitting of a shirt I think both of these are fantastic options actually so it really just depends if you're wanting a tight scoop neck shirt or if you just want something that's a bit looser and overall has a more casual look okay onto v-necks although I find v-necks to probably be the most flattering neckline myself I really didn't think I would love them as much as I liked all of these options so my first one is from Old Navy and I got it in a size medium it's 95% rayon and 5% spandex so that does make the fabric very yummy and I don't even know what other word to use besides Yummie I'm absolutely obsessed with this white t-shirt it does have a lot of stretch and it is pretty big on me so to do it again I would size down in this and although it does have shorter sleeves because it is looser I find it to be more flattering than some of the other cap sleeves and the fabric is a lot thicker on this one too so my next Phoenix is from Walmart and it's the time and true brand and this was only five dollars you guys and I did size up and get this in a large so I could tie it up but these shirts do run true to size so keep that in mind it's 60% cotton and 40% polyester and you guys this really is the shirt that started all for me this is the first white shirt that I bought this season and I do really like it it's very inexpensive if you're looking for just a plain white v-neck this one probably is your best option and now comparing it to targets version I bought this one in the men's section it's the Goodfellow brand and I got it in a size medium and it's also only five dollars I did get it from the men's section because I just couldn't find anything comparable to this in the women's section this shirt is also 60% cotton and 40% polyester a target one because it's from the man section might be like a centimeter longer so I think my favorite still is the white boyfriend pocket tee that I have on I feel like this is just gonna look good on absolutely everyone plus it really is on trend and it's very inexpensive for scoop-neck tees I'm probably gonna have to give that today H&M one just because it is a little looser that I feel like it looks slightly more flattering on me the name is on a central one but just know that I do absolutely love this one and I know I'm gonna wear it often and for v-necks y'all gonna have to hands down give this one to Old Navy one it's just a much higher quality shirt that's it for today's video please comment below which white t-shirt was your favorite I would love to hear what

Now, the Bella ladies 100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt is a\ngreat option, great price point, great fit, overall an awesome shirt. I'm going to have\nMaia come over and show it off instead of just talking about it. Right away you're going\nto notice a great fit, tailored side seam means it's naturally going to hug your sides.\nIt's going to offer that more feminine feel to it, 100% ring-spun cotton. It's soft.\n\u200bNow, if we're talking about sizing on this, we do kind of ... Anytime we're talking about\n100% ring-spun, err on the side of ordering one size larger because 100% ring-spun doesn't\nstretch as much as more of a blend does. You'll notice the sleeve length fell a little higher\nthan the unisex version, not baggy at all, naturally complements her body. The other\nthing is the neckline here, a little breathe-ability here. It's not tight up to the neck like some\nt-shirts are. This offers a little breathe-ability here.\n\u200bAll around though, great shirt, a lot of color options and since it's Bella, Bella\nowns Canvas, a unisex t-shirt company so a lot of the colors are interchangeable between\nunisex and ladies. This is great for a ladies group. You can also order the Canvas t-shirt\nfor the larger group of males or just women who maybe want more of a boxy fit, but for\na women's t-shirt, great standard. If we're talking about this versus the American Apparel\nand the Next Level 100% ring-spun cotton, I kind of put this right in the middle. The\nprice point is closer to the Next Level. You save a lot going Bella over American Apparel's\n100%. I believe that you get more out of this shirt too than the American Apparel, which\nis why we probably sell so many of them, although the American Apparel has the name everybody\nreally trusts. Bella is also a name, but anytime you're ordering 100% ring-spun, again, think\nabout ordering one size up in the ladies version because you don't want it to be too small.\n\u200bYou look great in it Maia. Thank you so much. \u200bOn the Co-ed Monkey Soft Scale, we rate this t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this\nvideo. Please let us know if you have any questions because here at Co-ed Monkey, soft\nmatters and so do our customers.", "4b5kto2QJc8": "Hey everyone welcome back to this channel today I'm gonna be showing you the basics of a white t-shirt all the ways you can tuck tie And wear your shirt to make it look better than just a boring white tee if you guys want to see what I have to Show you then just keep watching This is how to slay your white t-shirt I'm gonna start with the basics because this is the most important part getting a great white t-shirt is really important It's not hard to do But I want to mention that when you get a 100% cotton t-shirt Unless it's a really soft cotton it can be too crispy, and it won't fall and drape properly, so I like to use something that's a blended cotton and synthetic blend because it just ties up easier and it drapes a lot softer You also need to wear a nude bra underneath not a white bra. Not a black bra Not a colored bra because a nude bra will just look like your skin And it will completely camouflage itself underneath the t-shirt once you got these two things you're set up for success And you can start tucking and tying the way that you want This is the perfect tuck. This is great for every day This is good for special occasions like it literally looks so perfect and it emphasizes your silhouette But there's nothing tight on your body so if you're bloated you can wear this and it'll look great The key with getting an all-day tuck is making sure you tuck everything really really firmly So for this you're gonna have to pull it out so that it doesn't look strange But also make sure that your tuck is secure What I'm gonna do is push the fabric all the way down until it you can see it's strained in the middle Then I'm gonna fold over the edges just to make it get that natural drape And I'll pull up the middle until it's just naturally kind of draping over But it's still firmly tucked underneath, it's just that no one would know it Now all of a sudden your shirt is not boring it looks effortless and chic and I love the fact that the back of this shirt stays untucked so this is great for Covering up your butt if you're not having a good butt day This next tuck everybody should know this is when you are having a good fat day You want to show it and you want to look really effortless While you're doing it pick a side of your shirt right or left And then tuck it from the side of your hip all the way through to the middle of your jeans So it should aligned with the button on your jeans to make sure that it's going to look perfectly Asymmetrical then what I'm gonna. Do is fold over the shirt, which is the key to making everything look draped and Effortless that's my favorite word And if you want to show off your silhouette you can just make sure that the side of your waist is tucked in a little Firmer, but still pull it out so that it can drape over the jeans a little bit. I love that This is added a ton of visual interest to such a casual look and this looks really great when you add some layers over top Tying your t-shirt is such a cute look it really emphasizes the waist and it's really on trend right now all you need to do Is take your fabric bring it up to the area that is smallest of your waist That's where I find it looks the best and then grab the material and create a loop at the base Tie the t-shirt around itself and then pull it through until you have a knot Very very simple of course this turns it into a crop top, and if you want to show skin you can But there's another way you can wear this you could put something that's really high-waisted underneath And you can still get that cinched waist effect without showing any skin This next tuck is for when you fully just want to show off your buns And they look really good in certain pair of jeans so you're like okay Let me put all of the emphasis on this and leave the front of the shirt really simple you basically just have to tuck in Your pants, but if you didn't know to roll over the side of your shirt. It would look really Like you tried really hard to tuck your pants in so make sure that the sides of your shirt are folded under Until you can't see the seam and that will cause it to drape naturally causing you to look like your shirt is just Casually tucked into your pants which is a much better look This is the ultimate tuck for when you just eat lunch, and you want to cover up the tummy, but the buns are looking poppin This is the most unexpected way that you could ever wear your shirt. I didn't know what the hell to call this This is really easy to do all you need is a little elastic grab some fabric from the side of your waist On the t-shirt, but you have to do it from the inside Then you create a little bit of extra fabric and fold it over Just to check what it looks like it should look like almost a little flower or like a little Roush in your shirt It's a very cute, and very chic way to wear a basic white t-shirt This looks super cute because it emphasizes the waist and it adds like little feminine touch if you want to wear this But you want to really cinch in your waist you could do it on both sides And this kind of creates a peplum t-shirt style Just tie both sides the way that you did for the first one and make sure that they're Symmetrically even on your waist lining up with each other and This will cinch in your waist and of course add more of a feminine touch than the first one and I thought I would save that one for last because it's super cool and totally unexpected. I hope you guys enjoyed these ways to tie and tuck your t-shirts. Let me know if you like this video by giving it a thumbs up if you did. I love you guys so much and please request in the comments below what video you want me to make next and I'll do it, okay? I love you. Bye bye", "fJH4ulFOIoc": "- Hello and welcome. This is Angie with\nthecountrychiccottage.net. Today, we're gonna talk about\nsublimation on a cotton shirt. So if you can believe it or not, this is a cotton T-shirt and I actually sublimated this design. So what is the trick to\ngetting sublimation on cotton? 'Cause you've probably always heard that sublimation can only be on polyester. That's kind of true. Sublimation can be on\nany polyester surface and it just so happens that\nboth glitter heat transfer vinyl and there's even a polyester\nflocked heat transfer vinyl, your sublimation will actually\nreact with those products. I'm giving two products a try today. The first is a glitter\nheat transfer vinyl, and I'm gonna link to all the\nproducts in the description below, so you can find those easily. So this is from B-Flex, and\nmost glitter HTVs will work. You do wanna make sure like they have some polyester content. And then they also have a\nflocked heat transfer vinyl. If you don't know what a flocked is, it's kind of fuzzy, and it's actually polyester, it's intended to be used\nwith a sublimation printer. So you can actually print directly on this if you have a sublimation printer and add it to your cotton designs. But we you are going to not use a sublimation printer because I know a lot of you don't have one. We're actually gonna\nuse sublimation markers. So I'm gonna use this Artesprix brand, this same technique will work\nwith any sublimation product. If you have a sublimation\nprinter, it'll work with that, it'll work with any sublimation ink like sublimation markers, it'll also work with infusible ink and\ninfusible ink sheets. So the same method on the\nflocked heat transfer vinyl, as well as the glitter\nwill work for both these. So this is the glitter that\nI'm wearing and then this shirt is actually made with the flocked. So I'm gonna show you how\nto make this cool watercolor effect on the design, just as an example, but you can definitely use this\nsame method for any designs. You could draw with the pens\nand your Cricut machine. You could cut something out\nwith like the infusible ink sheets and then add it on top\nof the glitter or flocked HCV. So let's take a look at the\nsupplies you'll need and then make our project. The supplies we're gonna\nuse are as follows, so I'm gonna use some Artesprix\nthermal transfer markers. So these are sublimation markers. Then we're gonna need\nsome protective paper, some heat resistant tape,\nand then you'll need some regular copy paper. Now the copy paper will need to be rated for use in a laser\nprinter or copy machine. Just check the back of the package to make sure it's rated to that. And then you'll need a plastic bag. So literally plastic bag\nout of your kitchen cabinet, I recommend a disposable brush\nbecause you can't really, I don't feel like you can\nget the ink out of it. So I always use a disposable\none and then just a little plastic cup or some water, and then some T-shirts. And we are gonna give this a try with two different products. This one is the glitter HTV. So it's a white glitter HTV. And this one is a flocked HTV. It's a polyester flocked HTV. So this particular flock, you don't have to mirror\nit when you cut it. And we'll talk about that in a minute, but if you have like a\nreally intricate design, you may want in some transfer tape to transfer it to your shirt, the transfer tape will need to\nbe something that's rated for heat transfer vinyl. I may or may not use transfer\ntape depending on how my design looks once I cut it. But if you're using a different flock one that's not meant to be printed on. You will wanna make sure\nit's a polyester flock so that your sublimation\nwill actually go into and have that chemical\nreaction with the product and be permanent. So be sure it's a polyester flock. Let's get started first by\ntaking a look at the sublimation markers and how we're gonna\nuse them in this case. All right, so I have my copy paper, and what I'm gonna do\nis pick three colors, completely up to you\nhow many colors you pick and what colors. So I'm gonna go from\npurple to a dark blue, to a light blue. And what I'm gonna do is\nactually write with these on this plastic bag. So I'm gonna write with\nthe purple up at the top, and then I'm going to\nwrite with the darker blue somewhere over here to the side, and then I'm gonna put\nsome of the lighter blue over here on this side. Now what we're gonna do\nis add some water to this. So this is just a cup with\njust a little bit of water and our disposable brush. And we're just gonna\nstart with this purple and add in a few drops of water. Basically, we're making\nour own water color, but with sublimation ink. So now that I have that good and watery, I'm just gonna take some of that and I'm gonna put it on\nthis laser copy paper. So I'm gonna go all the way across this with my watercolor design, because I know that my\ndesign is long and skinny. If your design is small, you can just do a small area or you could do the whole piece of paper. Next, we're gonna do this blue. And what we're gonna do right here on the, the plastic bag is drag some\nof the blue to the center here and drag some of this purple\nand mix those together and create a completely different color and add that right under the first. Then I'll grab some of the blue, add that, and we will do this\nlightest blue and add that. Again, you can do this\nhowever you would like. There are no rules to this at all. And you can even go back\nand add some more color if you wanted to at this stage. So let's more purple to that, just completely up to you. How you want yours to look. Then we want to set this aside and allow it to dry completely. So it's really, really wet. I'm gonna allow that to dry completely. Now I have a few that\nI've already completed and allowed to dry. And here's my two designs. As you can see, like they're kind of\ndifferent, kind of the same, and we're gonna use\nthese and cut the design on our Cricut out of\nthese pieces of paper. So let's take a look at the design itself, cut our paper that now has all\nsublimation ink right on it. And we're gonna cut our glitter\nas well as our flocked HTV. So here we have our Cricut\nmat and we wanna place, this is the glitter and\nthe glitter goes face down on the mat or shiny side down. And then I've set my dial, I'm using the Cricut Explore Air two. This will cut with any Cricut machine, but I set my dial to custom and I picked glitter iron-on from the material list. And I'm also going to pick more pressure, just to\nmake sure that it cuts all the way through. And then I also mirrored my design. So anytime your material\nis face down on the mat, you want to mirror the design itself. So now we can cut the\nglitter HTV with our Cricut. (machine cutting) So once the cut's done, we can eject it from our Cricut, and then we can remove\nthis one from the mat. Now, we will want to also cut\nthe paper that we added the sublimation ink to. And we wanna cut that mirrored as well. So what I did is I took the paper and I used a pair of\nscissors to cut fairly close to where I had painted my design. And I want to put that at\nthe top of my Cricut mat. And now we can cut the same design we just cut from the glitter, we'll want to cut from\nthis piece of paper, using the Cricut. This time however, I'm gonna set my dial to the paper setting, and then we can cut our design. (machine cutting) Once that's done cutting\nI will eject it as well. Now let's take a look at the\nweeding of these designs. So now for the weeding. So for the glitter, I just cut off the excess\nlike with a pair of scissors so I can use it for another project. And then we just peel back all the excess. So we want everything around the outside as well as in this case, I\nwant this center home piece to come out and I'm just\ngonna carefully remove that. So what I would like to do\nis actually use the home for another quick test or project. And I also want to leave, in this case, the centers of these letters and just remove the word itself. So I'm gonna just gonna\nkind of carefully do that, leaving the centers of\nthose letters in place. So I'm gonna do that for the entire word. And then we'll talk about\nweeding the copy paper with that sublimation ink on it. All right, so there's that\npiece completely weeded. So now let's talk about this copy paper. So we're basically\ngonna do the same thing. In this case, I can probably just lift up the Tennessee itself maybe. If you have problems with curling, what you want to do is flip your mat over, and remove the mat from the material and not the material from the mat. And we'll also wanna get out the centers of these letters. So I'm gonna pull off\nthis large piece first. In this case, it'll be two large pieces. Then we'll grab the\ncenters of those letters. Like I said, I kind of have a plan I wanna try to use the word\nhome for another project. We'll see if that works. So I'm just kind of\nbeing gentle just in case I can get it to work. And what I like to do is kind\nof put those pieces right here, so I don't lose them. So I'm gonna be working\non some other stuff and I can just put them\nright there on my mat. And I know that they're\nnot going anywhere. All right, so I've got the centers I need, the two large pieces I\nneed, and the glitter. So let's talk about the\nflocked version of this design. So first things, first, the flocked itself I needed to cut on the green mat. The blue mat was simply not strong enough. I cut it on like a fairly new green mat, a purple mat would probably\nactually work as well. So you need a little bit of a\nstronger grip for the flocked. And then the second thing\nI'm gonna talk about is the fact that there is\nright now as of this airing, I did not see any flocked\nheat transfer vinyl setting on the Cricut. So I tried the glitter. So I did the glitter iron-on\nsetting, more pressure, and we are gonna see how well that worked. So this one we're gonna leave that, there's like a backing paper. Again, we did not mirror the flocked, and you will see why in a few minutes. And the cuts actually look pretty good. So I'm just gonna kinda\npeel everything back. And the T is separate from\nthe rest of the words. So we're gonna peel it from this side. 'Cause this one says Tennessee, while the other one said home. And again, I'm leaving the\ncenters of those letters and this is fairly\ndetailed, so I may go ahead and show how to use transfer tape. Again, if you have a simple design, you could just peel it from this paper. So there's our Tennessee, worked great with the settings that I used. And then we can just weed\nthe paper in the same manner as we did the paper for the home. Again, this one is mirrored. So you wanna mirror for the flocked, don't mirror the design itself, but mirror the sublimation drawing, and you will see why when we press, but that's gonna be\nimportant to get it right, is to not mirror the flocked. And again, it has to be a polyester flock. So don't mirror that. If you purchase the same\nbrand that I'm using and then mirror the actual\npaper that you added that sublimation ink too. So there's that. So I have everything I need on this mat and I'm gonna leave it there. These pieces are super, super small, so I don't wanna move those. So I'm gonna leave that\nand I'm gonna go ahead and get out my easy press and get set up to press these. All right, the B-Flex glitter presses at 295 for 10 seconds. And I have my largest easy press so I can cover this large\ndesign in one press. Now I'm going to first just\nkind of heat up the surface a little bit, getting your\nwrinkles and moisture out, and then what I'm gonna do, I know that I'm gonna be\nsublimating on this in a minute, so I'm actually on top of\nmy largest easy press mat, but I'm gonna stick a\nsmaller, easy press mat, the medium size one inside the shirt. And then I'm gonna use some\nprotective paper to cover that mat up. I wanna make sure that\nit's completely covered where my design is going to go. Just so I don't get anything on my mat and nothing on the back of the shirt. That's just for sublimation. If you were just using\nthe glitter by itself, you would not have to do that. All right, so now the shirt's cool, we're ready to press. We're gonna locate the\ndesign on the shirt. All right, and the carrier\nsheet's already on this, we just need to press, so we'll go ahead and put that down, press with medium pressure\nfor the 10 seconds. And then when the time's up, just remove our press. And we can actually start kind\nof peeling this right away. Just be careful that it's not so hot it's gonna burn your fingers and everything looks really good. We'll just make sure that E stays, okay. So now that design is on our shirt. Now we wanna make sure that's cool. It's already pretty cool, before we put the sublimation on. So as soon as the sublimation\nhits anything hot, it will start to transfer. We can go ahead and set the easy press. So we wanna set it at 360, and we are gonna set it for 100 seconds. Let's do 120. So it says 90 to 180. So I'm gonna do 120. So this is heating up. Our home is cold. So now we can locate our design. And to do that we're gonna\nuse heat resistant tape. So don't use any type, you wanna make sure it's heat resistant. Then we can start taking those pieces that we weeded earlier, placing them on top of this glitter and taping them into place. Now, remember, these are\nthat laser copy paper that we did the watercolor effect on. So they have that sublimation ink on them, and we've already put our easy press mat covered by butcher paper inside. So we know that everything's protected. We will just put this into place and\nyou can just tape it down really well. You don't want it to move during the pressing process. And we'll also have some centers, so I'm gonna leave that\ncenter open just a minute, and we'll tape in just a second. So now I just have the\ncenters of all those letters. And again, we want to make\nsure to put those face down on their corresponding letter, and then we'll tape every\nsingle one of those down really, really well, making sure\nnothing moves when we press. All right, so to press this design, we will need to cover\nit to protect our press. So I'm gonna use a piece of\nthat protective paper again. So you have the paper, then\nthe sublimation ink design, that glitter HTV that we\npressed underneath that, the shirt, another piece\nof protective paper, and our easy press mat. And then I have the back of the shirt and another easy press mat just under there to protect everything. And now we're gonna press\nat that 360, 120 seconds, and you don't want anything to move. So we're gonna press it down, press the C and hold it with\npressure for the full time, not allowing anything to move. All right, so after the time's complete, again, we don't want anything to move. We're gonna lift it straight up, and then we're gonna allow\nthis to cool completely before we move this. All right, this is completely cool now. And we are going to start peeling back. And see what we got. So you can see that effect\non that glitter HTV, that kind of watercolor effect, where it's going from like a\npink to a blue at the bottom. And there, you have it. So sublimation on glitter HTV. Now let's move on and see what happens when we use that flock. Alright, so for the flocks\nwe need to be at 305 for 10 seconds. So I went ahead and set\nmy easy press to that, and that's going to be\ncooling down while we work. I went ahead and pressed\nover the top of this, just to remove any wrinkles or moisture. All right. The flocked, once again, we did not mirror it and it\nhas lots of little pieces. So we need to get it from this\nbacking paper onto the shirt. There is transfer tape that's\nmade for heat transfer vinyl. This is a piece of that here. You could also use a\npiece from an old project. So this was just from\nthe glitter I just used, that we just did the home, and I can just press that right onto here. So it's rated for use\nwith something like HTV. And so I can just use it as long as it'll kind of lift up from there. And the only thing when working with this, when working with the\ntransfer tape and HTV is the transfer tape is never, or I don't find it's ever\nlike really, really sticky. So you just kinda have to play with it and kind of peel it back. Just kind of play with it, peel it back and just make\nsure that it's staying stuck to your, whatever you use, transfer tape, an old carrier sheet, whatever. And then watch when you get to\nthe centers of those letters, they actually stay down and into place. So I'm just gonna keep\nmoving across this piece, making sure everything\ngets stuck to this tape, and then we'll press it\nand add that sublimation, just like we did on the glitter. So here's our piece completely\non this transfer tape. So I can just flip that over carefully and add it to our shirt. Now the easy press has cooled down to 305 and I have it set for 10 seconds. And we're just going to\nmake sure this is about in the center and that it's straight. And then, once again I've\ngot an easy press mat inside of my shirt covered\nby some protective paper, because I know I will be\nsublimating here in a few minutes it will just save me an\nextra step here to do that. So we're gonna press this 305,\n10 seconds, light pressure. And we'll remove that easy press. And you can actually remove\nthis liner while hot, just to make sure that it's not so hot it's gonna burn you. And we just want to make\nsure everything is stuck. Now we have that flock right on our shirt. And remember, this is\nthat polyester flock. So we can put our\nsublimation ink right on top. We are gonna wait until this\ncools off so that it doesn't start sublimating while we're adjusting. And then we'll do it just like the glitter where we'll put it in\nplace and tape it down. All right, so everything\nis taped down well where it won't move. And we're gonna put our\nprotective sheet on top of it. So protective sheet, the paper with the\nsublimation ink face down, taped down well to the flocked that's already attached to\nour shirt, protective paper, easy press mat, back of the\nshirt, another easy press mat. We're gonna press this down. And it's 360, 120 seconds, firm pressure. Then once your time is up,\nyou wanna lift it straight up so nothing moves. Then we went to allow this\nto cool completely before we remove the paper with the sublimation ink. All right, I've allowed this to cool. And now we can reveal the\nmagic and see if we have that watercolor design on that flocked paper, on that flock HTV. And it looks amazing. Totally awesome. All right, so there is how\nyou add sublimation ink to both flocked and glitter HTV. So it's super simple. And I know the first question\ny'all are gonna ask is how well does it hold up in the laundry? Well, I'm gonna tell you right\nnow that I have already ran these through the laundry\ntwice, both of these shirts. So you can see that\nthere was like no fading. That is absolutely 100% fine. Yes, you can still laundry these shirts and not have any problems. So if you were to use\nsublimation ink directly on the cotton without the glitter HTV or the flocked HTV between it, when you went to throw it\nin the washing machine, it would fade. So it would give you like\na really distressed look. It would be kind of semi-permanent. So a lot of it would come\nout as you laundered it. And I don't know how long\nit would last actually, but I actually ran these through twice just to kind of see what\nwould happen the first and the second time. And both the glitter HTV from B-Flex as well as the flocked can be dried. So actually ran both these\nthrough the dryer as well, no issues at all. So if you're gonna drop down\nbelow and ask that question, there's your answer\nright before you ask it. But if you have any other questions about anything we've covered today, feel free to ask those in\nthe comment section below. Also head to the description below, grab your supplies to give this technique a try for yourself. If you've wanted to try sublimation, you hate polyester shirts. I've heard that over and over again. I hate polyester shirts, or maybe you want to put it on a hat and all you can find are cotton hats. This is a solution. So glitter, heat transfer vinyl, as well as the flocks. Now the flocks you wanna make sure it has a polyester coating. I know that multiple glitters will work, but the flocked I am not sure about. So the only flock I tried was this B-Flex that's made specifically for sublimation. So I would definitely give that one a try. And I do not know about\nany of the rest of those. So if you are looking at another brand, I do not know if those will work. And I have only tried, I've seen other people try other glitters, but I've only tried\nthe glitter from B-Flex just to let you know that as well. If you'd love this video,\nif you learned something, be sure to give us a thumbs up. You'll also want to head on\nover to our YouTube channel, hit that subscribe button. We have videos like this all the time, and you don't want to miss any of those. I hope you enjoyed these\nshirts today and will try this watercolor technique for yourself. Again, the markers I use were the Artesprix sublimation markers, they also come in a\nwide variety of colors. So this is the 10 pack with\nlike the standard colors. I think you saw those in the video, but they also come in\nother colors as well. If you are interested in\nexpanding beyond the basic colors, but you can do the technique\nthat I use, where I took those and I kinda mixed them\ntogether on that plastic bag and create kind of all\nkinds of your own colors just by buying one pack.

on today's episode we'll be looking at cotton and polyester through the lens of a sportswear designer if you guys are wondering which of the two fiber types is most suitable for a sports or collection watch this video you're gonna find out [Music] welcome to fit design TV on this channel we'll explore what it takes to make it as an active wear fashion brand whilst providing tips tricks and actionable steps towards starting your own product line whether an entrepreneur look at the start your own brand or just someone interested in fitness fashion there's something for you here [Applause] [Music] cotton/polyester are often compared to contrasted just because they're so widely available on the market they're pretty much two of the most popular farmer types when making a selection on what fabrics to make there's a good reason for this and we'll go through it in this video the main difference that you need to know about these two fiber types is that cotton is a natural fiber versus polyester is a man-made or a synthetic fiber that we made in labs and those are pretty much the main core reasons as to what drives their differences we're looking at six different categories in terms of determining which of the two fiber types is most suitable for a sportswear application hopefully by the end you'll be able to make an educated decision on what is right for you we'll be looking at the durability of these two fiber types the temperature regulation of these two fiber types we'll also be looking at the comfort and feel of these two fiber types the ease of maintenance or cleaning the cost associated and last but not least the light weight this of these two fiber types we'll start off with number one the durability the durability has a lot to do with that cotton is naturally occurring and polyester is a synthetic fiber cotton will wear out over time a lot more easily than polyester while you'll notice with a new cotton t-shirt is it's good at retaining its shape up until a few washes at which point it begins to break down from a fiber standpoint it gets a lot more loose it starts to hang loosely it gets a lot softer and this is because it's just much more of a delicate fiber versus polyester which is polymer based it's synthetic fiber it's just going to have a lot more strength into your ability over time it's going to be able to withstand a lot more wear and tear which is important when it comes to sportswear design we're always active we're moving around we're putting our garments through a great ordeal of dynamic activity and our garments need to be able to match our need when it comes to stretch or movement or agility and if cotton is going to wear out over time you're going to notice your garment get looser it's not going to fit as well and it's just overall not gonna perform as well as it needs to perform versus polyester it's gonna go through a lot more wear and tear before it exhibits similar levels of deterioration polyester wins here next is temperature regulation if you know anything about the way that our bodies regulate temperature you know that we spell sweat through the surface of our skin and through the process of evaporation we move away heat from our bodies cotton is breathable which is a win for it in that regard however it absorbs moisture it doesn't wake moisture away from its surface puts it on the skin so what that ends up doing is it prevents the body from allowing sweat to evaporate away from the skin thereby allowing you to feel hotter which polyester doesn't do polyester is more thermal constricting up until a certain point so it'll make you feel hotter and a certain range of temperatures but it will allow you to quick sweat away to the surface of your skin which will allow it to evaporate it won't hold on to that moisture and it won't give you that hot look that cotton is going to do because cotton is just gonna want to absorb all this sweat or first is polyester which is going to wick that sweat away so coffin is much more suitable for neutral climates polyester on the other hand is going to be the more suitable for hot climates where you're going to want to sweat or cooler climates where you're going to want to constrain or restrict the movement of heat away from your body so if you want to look at it cotton is in the middle neutral and then plaster on either sides of the climate scale next we'll look at the comfort and feel comfort of your is a major reason why we select certain fabric and it's no different in this case polyester is known to be a bit more let's just say allergenic when it comes to the way it reacts with people's bodies yes it's silky and it's smooth but it does cause some irritation on a decent segment of the population there are many people that may overcome a certain level of irritation or just an overall mild discomfort with polyester based fabrics that they won't with the cotton content being durable sorry cotton being breathable and cotton being natural it just lends itself to being a lot more suitable for a wider range of skin types so cotton is going to get the edge in this regard cotton is just a generally more forgiving fabric when it comes to skin types and how it meshes with our bodies we also want to look at the ease of maintenance or cleaning like I mentioned cotton is just less durable so it's going to withstand less wear and tear that is afforded by washing whether it's a washing machine or your washing by hand you're going to wear out cotton and faster than polyester polyester though is more prone to deterioration from heat from high levels of heat because it's a polymer based compound it's going to be a lot more sensitive to heat which is also why you can't iron it nor should you iron it but the plus here is that you don't need to iron it whereas caught in wrinkles very easily needs constant care and attention to iron it polyester on the other hand doesn't you just have to be careful not to iron it because you will ruin the garment and not the subject the high levels of heat in a washing machine so it's a give and take here but generally polyesters is going to be easier to maintain over time we want to look at the cost cost is a complicated subject because there are a wide range of different qualities of polyester and cotton but if we're going to be very objective and comparing one to one generally cause it is more expensive than polyester because cotton is a naturally occurring fiber it's limited in our supply - what is available in terms of the agricultural landscape what is the local market able to offer us in terms of raw supply of cotton plant in order to create our cotton fiber needs versus polyester which is a polymer based compound we are able to make it a lot more freely and on our own terms so polyester is going to be cheaper in this regard however you can get better quality of polyester and at the same time you can get a better quality of cotton so it depends it is a give-and-take but I want to one buy a service gonna be cheaper the last is the lightweight nature of both garments hello cotton is more breathable on a meter per meter basis where both fabrics have the same thickness you're going to notice that polyester is going to be significant more lightweight again it is because of the fact that this is a synthetic fiber we're able we were able to create it and as lightweight a case as we can polyester generally is much more lightweight than cotton so for sure if you're going for a lightweight fabric and you want to have some thickness to it you want to go with polyester versus cotton that being said both fabric types or fiber types do have their applications in different cases but we generally do recommend polyester when looking at a core fiber type to incorporate your collection coffin is great for a certain level of tops or lightweight garments that you want to have in a situation where you want to have a natural fiber of your collection but for more of your heavy duty core essential garment types you want to look at polyester because it's going to perform in a way that is a lot more analogous with the needs of sportswear design hopefully guys that makes sense we've also done a video on polyester versus nylon because those are both synthetic fibers that often get compared we give you our verdict on that one highly recommend you check it out if you want us to compare and contrast any other fiber types leave it in the comments below we always love making these videos for you guys if we missed on anything again in the comments below thank you so much for tuning in to fit design TV until next time sails", "l7DqqQXwX0w": "I'm Steven Fortin founder Burford baguette service hello I'm going to show you the proper way to oil shirt step 1 dampen it the best time to iron the shirt is when it's freshly washed and still slightly damp if it's dry use a spray bottle to dampen all your iron we'll probably have a spray function too step 2 collar and cuffs make sure that your iron is at the correct temperature select the cotton setting and give it plenty of time to heat up when ironing the collar start from the point and move inwards find in the other way we'll leave a telltale upward curve in the fabric now the cuffs are on the inside a little to get the main creases out and start on the outside as with the collar always start from the outside and iron inwards once you have ironed them fold the cuff silver and press them to give a pleat that runs along the line of the arm step 3 the Yoakum back start with the young that's a section that covers the back of the shoulders keep the shirt on to your ironing board like so I and the yoke started from the outside the moving England's carefully press down any please now iron the rest of the back of the shirt using plenty of steam to get the creases out step for the front and back it once the back is free of creases rotate your shirt on the board iron the front applying steveland pressure to the packet that's the part of the buttons and buttonholes when the first side is done or I take the shirt around to do the other side press between the buttons using the tip of the iron when the creases are all out you're ready to move on to the sleeves step 5 the sleeves lay out the sleeve on the ball use the scene to make sure it's flat before pressing it repeat the process with the other sleeve and you're done finally the tip if you're traveling and need to fold your shirt this is the best way to do it button it up every other button is fired lie the shirt on each front and learn a full sheet of card on the back bring one side over fold the sleeve over line the cuff flap is it designed now do the other side fold the bottom of the shirt and sleeves up and then fold in half like so if extra care is required you can fold it again leave the collar on the inside just make sure that you give it a quick press when you arrive you", "YQpUVchzLjA": "I

back to another screen printing video by cat spit productions so I thought it would be cool to do a few t-shirt or views alright so this is a first of a mini series that I'm gonna do for you where we're gonna take a look at some t-shirts we'll look at the knit quality the print quality you know the shirt the stitching you know yada yada yada we'll take a look at it I'll tell you what I think about it how it prints and such and I think I'm gonna try to take them home and wash them so that we can look that look at them you know before wash and post wash alright so today I have Hanes and I've got I believe the beefy T of course and a tag list a and I will put the product descriptions specifically you know for these two shirts by Hanes in the prom video description not the product description in the video description right below the video so you can open that up and that will tell you the exact two shirts we're looking at but one is the Hanes beefy T and the other is the Hanes tagless t so let's take a quick look at these shirts alright so I have my cheat sheets here so the Hanes beefy T is the 50 180 okay and the tag list T that I have here is the 50 to 50 okay these are Hanes products okay so the beefy t I've worked with this shirt before and you know the beefy T is actually a really it's a it's it's a pretty high-quality shirt it's very heavy the print surface is really nice I know that that you get some really nice prints on these because it has a tight knit and you know the only issue is that it's really heavy so for your customers that don't like that really really bulky heavy feel this is not the shirt for them you know what I'm saying I like the print surface of these shirts but I would never wear one of these myself because it's just way too thick and heavy for me but there are many people out there who love Jayne's BVT and it is a very well known product okay so I thought we would go ahead and do a test print on this one all right usually the stitching and everything on the Hanes beefy T is pretty spot-on now here the Hanes tagless T it's a six point one ounce you know just handling it it feels very good looks good print surface actually looks pretty good take a close look at it not bad the you know the we'll find out when we actually print on it really but it looks pretty pretty good print ability and looks like a decent shirt you know stitching doesn't look too bad once we get it on the palate we can see sometimes we can see how jacked up things are right so let's let's get these on the palate and do a couple prints I think I've got let's see what do we have three shirts here so I might do the spot color and the halftone design let's let's check let's take a look all right so hopefully this focus will work out and not like change I'm not sure this is the I think this is like first close up I'm trying with this camera or something I don't know so so this shirt is the beefy T Hanes beefy T I didn't even test print my screens but that's okay because I'm an old pro right yeah okay so yeah the Higgins beefy t ism ISM it is a really nice shirt it's very heavy and quite frankly it looks very well stitched the sample that I have here anyway take a look body looks nice and square even the collar looks pretty decent which usually is not the case all right so I think on this one will print the secret society logo what you see where the print is landing okay we're gonna pull this up a little bit for positioning it's just easier for me to do that right now okay that looks pretty good sorry about the screen going by there all right so hopefully this screen will print and not embarrass me in this video [Music] it's printing so let me get that decent okay I got a little piece of lint or something here oh actually I have a little something in the screen look here I don't know if you can see this there's just a little bit of ink that gummed up so let me grab a little screen opener it looks like there's something in my ink look a big like a horsefly that was in here the other day there was a giant horse fly in here and I bet he landed in my ink so let's see that's not bad I'm gonna um I'm gonna go ahead and give it another hit there and see something moving on I'm not sure everything's good take a look at this print might not be the greatest print well that helped out all right so that's not too bad I just saw a little loss of detail over here that I don't like for some reason that's probably because I may have not wiped it well enough but we're just looking at this so let's take a look let's throw it off onto the Belcher R that's a good good coverage no problem there alright so that a little bit kind of a halftone thing going on here let's see sorry I don't really keep my unit locked in that's not that what's giving a little more ink this this one you have to finesse a little bit more this is a like a 156 I believe and you want it with this design I like to get you know balance between coverage and you know not too much ink so that looks pretty good I think we'll go with that because we don't want this one to be thick all right so let's we'll cure these shirts and take a look at them oh of course don't forget I sell screen printing equipment and supplies cats fit screen print supply.com check it out if you have any questions give me a call or shoot me an email all right so this is the Hanes beefy T I'm not sure what you can see from this but you know I have a little I don't know there's a little bit of resolution loss over there that was probably because I had to do the screen opener and I liked it and I missed something there but um you know takes the ink very nice it has a very tight knit and this you know this shirt if you look at it through a loop it actually has a really tight knit seriously I'm not you know so it can it's probably a good prospect for high detail work but like I said again the feeling of the shirt when you wear it is very heavy it's thick it's very heavy weight sure in fact what is it if we look at the specs here well it's only a six point one you know so I would have thought it might have been a little heavier but it feels they all it almost feels like we're you know we're in a campus tent or something that's just my thought on it all right so all right so here's the Haynes tagless and printed very well it's nice how the knit is pretty fine as well I mean actually I'm kind of impressed with the tag lifts one I think it's actually pretty nice shirt the stitching is nice it's pretty heavyweight it is as well a six point one as we said I believe I should have my cheat sheet over here but I don't yeah six point one so you know this is also pretty heavy shirt I don't think it you know yeah it probably feels almost as heavy as the beefy tape but this might be an option you know against the beefy t possibly if you need this kind of heavy shirt but the stitching looks pretty good print surface looks great looks like a pretty high quality garment and I have printed these in the past so yeah I think they're pretty popular people like them let's look at the other prints alright so here's the Hanes tagless and once again I have to say actually kind of impressed it's really nice construction good stitching pretty cool print surface print looks really good nice and sharp this could be a good candidate as an alternative to the beefy t although it is you know 6.1 ounce as well but for some reason it doesn't feel quite as thick sometimes the way they knit them and even the dyes you know how much dye is in the shirt can make it feel kind of thicker you know like you can have a black and white shirt of the same exact model shirt right and the black will feel thicker and the reason is because the cotton is swelled from the dye so you know that's something to keep in mind with shirts all right so what I'm going to try to do now is I'm gonna take these shirts home tonight and I'm gonna wash them all right and then I'm gonna bring them back here tomorrow and I'll try them on a little bit I got them in my size so I could try them on and you know see how they feel and see how they wash so I will cut that portion of the video tomorrow and it'll probably have a different color value because it seems when I shoot in different sessions I get different looking video so you'll be able to tell all right so let's take these home throw them in the washer and see what happens okay so here's the final evaluation after washing all right so I washed them all inside out you know regular kind of laundry setting nothing gentle and you know this is the Hanes beefy T so you know I would say that you know the fabric definitely you know is a little bit more fuzzy than when it was unwashed so there is a potential for fibrillation possibly I would pay attention to your print surface when you're printing I did not because I was shooting a video so my print surface isn't the greatest but you know it does appear that there could be potential for fibrillation I think it you know would be wise to watch your print surface what it looks like when you're printing it and make sure that you're getting a nice smooth print but the Hanes beefy T is constructed very well heavy stitching it's pretty straight it loads on the pallet nice at least this sample did the collar was straight not really jacked up like they are most of the time so it's a pretty high quality shirt and I think the quality of print that you get on it really just depends on you alright so meaning that it's a good shirt to print on you you can get nice prints on it so here's the Payne's tagless and you know I have to say this one this one is a little bit different it's not as soft after washing like the beefy tee so this one may have a little bit less possibility for a favor elation although you know I washed them inside out all right so this is the one with the skull this type of one and again the stitching is pretty good everything looks really good went on the palate Strait collar looked straight stitching looked straight you know everything looked pretty well done so again a pretty heavy shirt seems well made and it appears you should be able to get a nice print off on that again you know you've got to pay attention to your print I don't make screen printing videos while you're trying to print somebody's work unless you're super awesome like I used to be but yeah once upon a time I might have been able to do that but these days anyway so yeah this one looks pretty good too yeah I think honestly I think the Hanes tagless tape probably has a little bit more durable surface I don't know how to say it it didn't get as fuzzy as the beefy tea after washing so that probably is a good thing but again very heavy type of shirt so if your customer doesn't like a heavy garment they still want something lighter like me personally these shirts are pretty heavy for me but uh let's try them on see how they fit okay all right so how's my mop do okay so this is the Hanes tagless like tried this one on cuz you know whatever I don't know um but it's I would say they run pretty small or tight cut okay I'm wearing a medium and it's pretty tight on me and if you go by the old rule of these sleeves they're starting to creep up my shoulder just slightly so this would be probably like if the trunk anymore it really wouldn't fit so I wouldn't be comfortable wearing this I want a large or something because it's too tight in the shoulders and under here okay so that's something to know sizing on shirts can be a big problem you know they're different brands and styles can be cut more generously than others so this one seems to be not very generous in the sizing so this is the Hanes beefy t this one is cut more precise perhaps I mean for me this fits a lot better I can move in the shoulders you know under the sleeve seams and stuff it's not too tight it's not cramping me up in there body is pretty good I ought to tell you the truth this one the Hanes beefy T in my opinion is more comfortable than the tagless T that I just tried so that's interesting I really didn't expect that because usually the beefy T is pretty stiff and bulky and heavy feeling you know what I'm saying but in my personal opinion this one is cut better and more comfortable to wear if that's possible but it is I guess the softer a little bit softer finished remember I said that I guess it's true it does you can really feel it Anya I think so it feels a little softer more comfortable as opposed to the Hanes tagless T so that's interesting alright so comfort can be an issue with customers as well if they just don't like the way the shirt fits or how it feels that's all I have for you

answer that number one question for you up next [Music] hey guys it's melissa my shirt space when it comes to finding the best t-shirt to start a t-shirt line what you'll first want to consider is your brand's aesthetic if you feel like your brand is more about the design than the shirt I would consider using the g500 okay what I'm referencing here is brands that tend to be about funny slogans or silly images personally I wouldn't consider a brand like this to be a fashion-forward brand so what classic tubular team might be your best bet but I'm guessing that people watching this video are more interested in starting a fashion-forward clothing brand when it comes to a fashion-forward clothing brand that appeals to all genders I can definitely give some more recommendations and again we will want to touch on what matters most fit feel and fashion let's start with fit this is a big one everyone wants to look good and feel good but plains of both genders can be hard this is where manufacturers have stepped up to create the retail unisex team this slim-fitting tee that caters to both genders will be a hit for sure next let's touch on feel a soft comfortable tea will be something that your customers will not forget so this is where fabric comes into play there are three recommendations I would make on fabric the first is cotton the second is CVC and the third is try blend let's talk a hundred percent cotton 100% cotton is a tried-and-true tea it's only downfall is that it will shrink after its first wash but if you provide your customers with the correct wash instructions to follow they will be sure to fall in love next up is CVC cv c stands for chief value cup this refers to the cotton poly ratio within the tea with a heavy percentage of cotton these teas provide the softness of the cotton and the durability and texture of the polyester finally we have our try blends this is a blend of 50% poly twenty-five percent cotton and 25% ring a triflin is very similar to a CVC but with an added feature you have your softness of your cotton your durability and texture of your polyester but then with that round you also get some added features these fabrics all have a very price point depending on where you'd like to be for your customer base okay let's talk fashion a huge trend in the fashion world right now is street wear so how does this apply to choosing a teeth well the unisex tee is one of the hottest things in the street wear market right now so you should definitely consider everything that I've touched on when choosing your fashion-forward teeth but I know what you're thinking WTF I just wanted her to tell me the answer well it's your lucky day here are my top picks or starting a t-shirt line first we have the Bella canvas 3001 seat this is a 4.2 ounce hundred percent cotton retail fit the shirt comes in a number of amazing colors and also has a tearaway label and it also comes in a CTC option next up we have the n62 10 by next level this shirt is made up of 60% cotton and 40% polyester it's a 4.3 ounce and comes with a tearaway label as an added bonus now for our tribe ones first up we have the tr4 o1w weighing in at a 3.7 ounce making it a great lightweight option finally we have my personal favorite it's the three four one three seat by bella canvas it's a three point eight ounce retail fit with unisex sizing side seams and a tearaway label oh and it's also preshrunk what's not to love well there you have it guys my thoughts on the best t-shirt to use when starting a fashion-forward t-shirt

smart i really like that i like it with the the buttons open like that should i yeah maybe a bit too much chest here but if you are going sean for the sean look oh collar let's have a look at the collar so it is a soft collar yeah it feels really soft but you do have the collar stays in there and these are removable you can get these out if you need to change those around or iron them without

flowering now ping that into the search bar you do get some from the collection interesting interesting so talking to a couple of mates in the community we all we all really love sun spell that's a given we love the sea island cotton i mean the quality is fantastic but an ian fleming collection we would have liked to have seen something that ian fleming actually wore you know i don't know if that shirt with the patch pockets in the belt is probably too much cosplay but you know just having something that's a bit closer to fleming i mean if you would have look at this bad boy i mean a polka dot shirt of him sitting at the typewriter and now if that's in the collection we'll just snap that up anyway going off the grass here thank you sun spell for sending the stuff on uh i actually really like it i do wear this all the time when i'm on zoom calls bloody hell sorry music's just kicked in and anyway thank you sun spell for sending this on i do recommend the sea island cotton if you're looking to get a nice off the peg shirt that you're going to feel comfortable in when you're sitting down for them zoom calls this is the way to go all right until next time [Music] you", "TU5rGP10SNE": "if you're curious about the next level 3600 like this one right here then this is a video you do not want to miss [Music] in the last video we talked about the Gildan soft style geez 64,000 and today in this video we're going to talk about the oh so popular next level 3600 [Music] there are a ton of blank t-shirt options out there to choose from and this is the second in our shirt review video series there are a few important things you need to consider when trying to choose which t-shirt is right for you comfort style color options price and print ability let's start by talking about comfort this shirt is made out of 100% combed ring-spun cotton what that means to you and I is this is an extremely soft t-shirt because this is a cold drink spun cotton t-shirt it's softer than your standard cotton which you'll find in like a guild in G 5000 and also your ring spun cotton is like your gilding soft style t-shirts the next level 3600 t-shirt is comparable to the Bella canvas 3000 won and the American Apparel 2001 t-shirt which are all combed ring spun cotton and what that means is they're all extremely comfortable t-shirts now it's time to talk about styling this shirt is definitely a fashion fitted tee which is why it's really popular with clothing lines and band merchandise this shirt has a baby ribbed collar it's got side seams and a tearaway label one thing that I've noticed after wearing these shirts for a very long time is after extensive use the bottom seam of the t-shirt can actually start to come unraveled so that's just something to take into consideration this shirt definitely wears a lot longer than a lot of other t-shirts so if you compare it to like the Gildan soft style G 64,000 it's gonna be come down lower on your body this is definitely one of our most popular t-shirts at Twin City tees and also one of our most recommended this shirt comes in extra small through Forex l when it comes to shirt colors the next level colors are definitely limited compared to your Bella canvas and gild and t-shirts although the shirt colors that they do offer are very good ones as for price this is definitely one of the most affordable fashion fitted combed ring-spun t-shirts on the market it will of course cost a little more than your ring spun cotton and standard cotton t-shirts as you can see here on our chart this is our price here at Twin City tees this is for 50 t-shirts with a one color print and this is just to show you where this shirt lines up among a lot of our other popular t-shirt options I want to make it very clear that these prices are subject to change okay next let's talk about screen printing when it comes to printing at Twin City tees we use water-based and discharge inks primarily and because of that the dye lot of the t-shirt is extremely important and what a dye lot is is where they actually dye the fabric of the t-shirt to give it its color next level dyes their t-shirts and multiple factories around the world and because of this they're starting to show a little bit of inconsistencies and dialogues here I'll show you an example right here as a counterexample Bella canvas actually manufactures their shirts all over the world but they dye them all in the United States which gives them a lot more control among their dialogues as a customer you shouldn't have to concern yourself with this too much I just bring it up to let you know that as next level has grown some of their quality control has fallen a little bit so that's something to pay attention to in the future but when it comes to dye lots at Twin Cities it's our job to make sure that you guys get a high quality product with consistent printing so we'll take care of the dialogue issues so you don't have to worry about anything as mentioned before the next level 3600 is definitely one of our most popular t-shirts we print thousands of them a month they're soft they're stylish and they come in a great price point so if you're trying to choose which t-shirt is right for your business band or group consider the next level 3600 so now there's only one thing left for you to do click on the link below fill out an estimate let us know you want the next level 3600 if that is indeed what you want and before you know it you'll have t-shirts of your own if you're curious about the guild and saw style G 64000 check out this video next we'll see you in the next video", "u9LtHj7KnAk": "check it out in this video I'm gonna be going over the process of bleach dyeing your own t-shirts so I'm to be using a method where I actually cover up the design I want to be printed so this is a super DIY and at-home application to get some somewhat printed custom t-shirts so by nature the bleach helps strip out some of those pigments in the actual t-shirt so when using a darker garment like black or purple you're gonna get these nice kind of almost white tones under it now be sure to go after something that is a hundred percent cotton ideally anything that has a polyester blend to it will actually kind of have somewhat a gray undertone and your prints are definitely not gonna look as vibrant I accidentally forgot the double check the contents of a sweatshirt I did in this video and it turned out to have this really kind of funky gray color so maybe if your after that go after that but personally I really like that orange e-crime field that bleaching out a black t-shirt gives also be sure to clear your area of anything that might get stained that includes everything that you're wearing definitely wear an old t-shirt and some old pants and make sure it's in an area that's not gonna have any overspray getting bleach on anything that is a fabric is gonna be kind of detrimental to what it looks like now so avoid those issues by working in an area that you can get totally messy in and then also wear some old clothes that you don't mind ruining so I've got my design all prepped up we gotta get started here with the plotter so like I mentioned before you can cut your sense lot with a ton of different mediums I'm using the plotter because it's a fast multi-purpose tool that you know allows me to reuse and reprint the same image a few times over the only big characteristic you need for your stencil is that it's somewhat of a plastic medium so that the bleach won't bleed through so paper and stuff won't really work because if they don't have actually the chance that that bleach can saturate into the stencil whereas here with the plastic is that's going to kind of resist any bleeding in there so I've seen people use kind of plastic just sheeting I've seen people use some wax paper from you know the produce store but I dealing something similar to a vinyl plastic will work great the adhesive on the back of the vinyl sticker is an awesome addition to because I can just stick it on there and then peel it right on off once I'm done [Music] prep my mat with a little bit extra spray tech and I'm actually using some clear vinyl - that is kind of just a production choice now the color the vinyl obviously doesn't matter I went with the clear just because that means when I am recording the video you can still see through the black t-shirt on the back side so it's pretty in line with what you're actually gonna get at the end that was just you know an artistic choice but ideally I've done it with black vinyl and green vinyl and whatever I had laying around so not too particular on that front so I just sent the design over to the plotter I'm just gonna cut it right on out there we'll be good to weed everything out and get it stuff to a t-shirt alright the cuttings done let's get this ripped off and start weeding so for this t-shirt I want the black area to be the actual design and then have that kind of bleached out spray around it so for that reason I'm just gonna weed out all the negative area and leave my design in there so something I'll also need is a little backdrop to actually stuff inside the t-shirt to give a nice solid ground so here we're just gonna cut something that's slightly wider than the actual t-shirt that way it stretches it a little bit and gives you a nice smooth area to actually apply and work with you did a nice backdrop as well and then just slide that over your t-shirt and to the center of the chest area or wherever you want your actual designed to be [Music] so a helpful rule of thumb for alignment on a t-shirt obviously I'm gonna do mine right in the middle but the top of the pattern should be about a hands width away from the collar that being said some people like to use the bottom of the color some people you'd like to use the top of the collar so for shirts that are medium and small I like to do from the top of the collar and kind of align it up to that point for a large or an extra-large I like to do it from the bottom of the collar you can also use the collar in tag to hopefully Center it so I'm going to pull my sticker off the backing and this transfer tape will help apply the original vinyl to my t-shirt now simply press that down make sure all the vinyl has now stuck to the t-shirt and then you can pull up your transfer tape so it looks like I missed weeding a couple of small details I'm gonna just take those off now so obviously the centralized piece of this project is a big bucket of bleach these are you know five bucks for a huge gallon like this I really can't go wrong with having that as your you're printing medium I also picked up some small sprayers this was in the travel size section of Walmart so it's just a little spritzer not sure what it's actually intended for but that'll give us some kind of even spray mist then also like a little spray bottle this can also give that wide plume but then you know if you only press it in a little bit you can kind of get those droplets bits so while we fill them these up now you can dilute your bleach as well in the past when I've been doing this obviously the more bleach in the solution the faster its gonna eat into and remove the black dye of the t-shirt so I don't mind having this totally bleach I did do some test runs with reducing it down you having some water in there I found that I had to do just way more passes with the diluted version so I was ended up kind of saturating the t-shirt and I wasn't getting as clean of prints because some of that you know bleach and the water mixture was leaching under my design so I've opted for just keeping it as the entire bleach solution and that way it can set in and start working you know as best it can right away I also be sure to wash off the edge of the bottle just so you don't get any thing on your hands while you're working [Music] so I'm gonna start out with the small bottle this gives a really kind of consistent small spray so that'll give me a nice way to kind of bleach out the bigger section and then maybe do some spritzing and I even grabbed a paint brush to kind of dip in here and do some splatter I was good to have some paper towels on hand in case you need to clean off or make sure there's no dripping and you'll see this really start to work right away [Music] so now there's a bunch of bleach kind of built up on the stencil so I'm just gonna Pat it dry to make sure it doesn't totally set in around those edges and that'll keep some of these edges hopefully a little bit more crisp so I'm gonna let this dry and totally set up and then maybe go back with a second pass of the spray to get lighten up some of this interior so this is now dry to the touch and you can see it's kind of set into that nice orange color I'm going to want to spray out some more in here just to make sure that I get some of those details but just a couple little extra spritz and maybe we'll get slightly down to a more white [Music] once again just patting dry that top section so that it doesn't eat under any of these edges too hard now after letting it sit for probably 25 minutes and letting it totally dry and come peel up the last of your stencil now some of the bleach on top of the stencil didn't quite dry because it wasn't you know setting into a fabric so I just tapped that down maybe Pat it off with some more paper towel before you go at it you can see here that the mask is really really tight with that vinyl decal it definitely has a really crisp edge and here is kind of a an area where a big droplet came down and kind of bled under it but all together I really like how it turns out and this adds a ton of uniqueness to each print you can change up you know how things are splattered or how things are sprayed each and every time [Music] so like I mentioned at the beginning of the video the outcome and the exact color of your bleach is gonna depend on the contents of the garment you can see the sweatshirt starts to have that orange color but even after the first spray it sets into a very deep kind of gray now that grey comes from the polyester that's within the hoodie it's 50/50 so half cotton half polyester whereas the t-shirts I was doing we're 100% cotton now preferably I like those t-shirts because they have that nice kind of cream under color when you do bleach out the black so when you're going out to get your t-shirts or hoodies double check that and make sure it's what you're going after now it's also critical to make sure you wash these t-shirts by themselves don't throw them in another batch and fear ruining some other clothes throw them in the wash on a small load with some cold water and that'll help wash out any extra bleach that's stuck inside the garment [Music] so I hope you all enjoyed this little DIY project and feel free to show me some stuff if you actually ended up using some of the tips on one of your own projects it's definitely easiest just to go tag me on Instagram and a post I'd love to see what you guys come up with one of my favorite components about bleach dye is the fact that you're not actually adding any paint or any image to the surface of your shirt so it's gonna have a super soft feel the whole way through because there's no extra ink applied to it and that being said it's also not gonna fade it's not like you're gonna have an ink on top of your t-shirt that has a chance of peeling off or whatever you've actually dyed and changed the fabric of the t-shirt so the only way to actually ruin this design is to you know stain on top of some of the newly bleached area these t-shirts have an awesome feel as it's not a big bulky print even though you can get a lot of information all over the shirt it's also great to see that each of these t-shirts are is totally unique from the next all the splatters are unique and you know even if there's some discrepancies or mistakes under some of the printing it adds a nice effect the grime enos I was going for it so I made a few of these shirts for myself as well as through a couple on my web shop if you're interested go check them out over there I'll have a few available so jump on them if you're interested and also be sure to check out some of the other videos from

our new printing\nshow here at wekoma with the increase in demand for printed\ncustom apparel and other types of printed goods we decided to create a\nbrand new series where we showcase what today's printers\nare capable of and how your custom apparel business can benefit from them\nso before you go make sure to like and subscribe so you don't miss any of our\nfuture episodes all right with that out of the way let's move on to today's\nepisode in which we are going to be transferring\na design onto a cotton t-shirt using the r550\ntransfer printer and the ricoma flat heat press the r550 white toner transfer\nis a versatile printer that can print full color designs that you can then\ntransfer onto cotton and polyester using a heat press\nand since this is a white toner printer you can actually print bright\nvivid whites on your dark garments also the two-step\nsimply peel transfer media that comes with this printer is a great low-cost\nsolution for high quality garment and textile transfers the sheets have a\nclear coating that protects your printed graphics and prevents cracking when the\nfabric is stretched the transfer sheet is also transparent making it easy to\nposition your graphic correctly on your garment now let's go ahead and get\nstarted all right so let's go over the materials\nwe're going to be using today first up we got our cotton black t-shirt\nthen we have our teflon sheet for our heat press and then here we have the two\nsheets that we're going to be using with the heat press\nand the printer to create our transfer paper so first up we got our transparent\ntransfer sheet this is the one that we print this\ndesign on using the printer and then we combine it with our adhesive\nsheet using our heat press to create our final transfer sheet and\nthen obviously we're using the ricoma r550 white toner transfer printer and\nthe ricoma hp 1515 heat press now the 1515 stands\nfor the surface area of the heat press which is 15 by 15\ninches all right so let's get into the profit potential for these kinds of\nprints so we bought these shirts at wholesale\nat a site called jiffy shirts and they were about 2 dollars and 25\ncents each then the ink and the transfer papers actually cost about\nthree dollars so that puts our entire investment to about five dollars and 25\ncents shirts like these you could sell them\nfor about 15 to 20 dollars so that means that you have a profit potential\nof 9 to 14 around that all right so let's go over to our computer so that we\ncan start printing out our transfer sheet now this software is included with\nthe purchase of the printer like everything else that we're showing\nin this video so if you're interested go down to the link in the description\nall right to do this we are going to be using the icolor pro rip software\nnow in this episode we're really just going to go over an overview of how to\nprint a transfer sheet but in the future we're\ngoing to be making other videos that go more in depth into the software\nso basically all i have to do is grab my design that i already have here on my\ncomputer drag it over to the software and it's\ngoing to appear now all i have to do is wait for the preview to load\nand then i can go ahead and start setting up my project now because of the\nfact that this design was essentially created by a designer\nand it is already created to the dimensions of a regular\nprinter paper of about eight and a half inches by 11 i\nreally don't have to do a lot and in fact the software already puts the\ndesign mirrored so that when i place it on the\nshirt it is in the right orientation all right so since it is already\npositioned where i want it all i have to do is go here select the project\nright click and print all right so i'm going to go ahead and load my\ntransparent transfer sheet onto the printer so that i can print on it\nnow i'm going to be doing that with the matte side up and the glossy side down now as soon as i insert the tray it\nshould already start printing since i already set the design to print\nall right so here we have our hp 1515 heat press now i have the temperature\nset to 310 degrees fahrenheit now before i do any kind of pressing\nwhat i'm actually going to do is preheat the bottom layer of the heat press\nfor about 120 seconds all right so one of the cool things\nabout this heat press is that when the timer is done it'll actually\nautomatically open all right so now that our heat press is\nnice and warm we're gonna take our transparent\ntransfer sheet we're gonna take out the tray and we're gonna put\nour transparent transfer sheet with the glossy side down again\nin the middle of our heat press then we're gonna take our adhesive sheet and\nwe are going to try to place it right in the middle of the transparent\none lastly we're going to put our teflon sheet\nand place the tray back inside of the heat press now we still have our timer\non our heat press set to 120 seconds and we're gonna be going for again 310\ndegrees fahrenheit all right so our heat press is done i'm\ngoing to take out the tray remove the teflon sheet\nand i'm going to peel now the trick is to do it at a consistent rate\nand non-stop and there you have it there's our\ncompleted transfer sheet all right so we're going to take our\nshirt and we're going to place it on the tray of the heat press\nright in the center or as best we can and\nwe are going to press the shirt for about 10 seconds just to remove any kind\nof moisture and wrinkles i'm gonna smooth out the\nt-shirt all right now before i place my transfer\nsheet on the actual t-shirt what i'm gonna do as an added precaution to make\nsure that i don't have any streaks of residue or anything like\nthat what i'm actually gonna do is just cut around my design\nall right so the next part is placing our design on our actual t-shirt\nand for the first time we're actually going to place the design with the\nglossy side up and the reason for this is because\nthe adhesive and the ink is actually on the matte side\non the bottom and that's the part that we want touching the shirt\nand now we're going to place it by measuring about four fingers from the\ncollar and we're going to try to put it in the\ncenter as best we can that looks about good i'm going to go\nahead and grab our teflon sheet i'm just going to place it above\nand we are going to press this at 310 degrees fahrenheit\nfor about 40 seconds so we're done pressing our shirt and\nremove the teflon sheet and we are going to take our shirt with\nthe design and we're going to place it to the side\nto cool down you want to wait about three to five minutes\nall right so it's been a few minutes so let's just go ahead and peel it now in\nmy opinion i think that this is the most satisfying part of the entire process perfect all right so now we're just\ngoing to finish off the process with another press at 310 degrees for\n20 seconds as always put your teflon sheet on top put the tray\nin the press and change my timer to 20 seconds\nand press we're gonna take out the tray peel the\nteflon and that's it there you have the finisher all right and that's it that's

and you're gonna go too what's going on everybody today we're gonna be going over various white tees and a bunch of different brands in pursuit of the perfect white tee if that's even possible to him I mean I've gone through so many different types of white tees from different stores different fits different prices alright so hopefully this video eliminates any future guessing games when it comes to the white tees you ready to talk about these men let's go [Music] all right team first whitey that we're gonna review is a classic white tea from pains man from what I remember when are these hain tea is growing up once you get them a little bit dirty you throw them in the washing a dryer they're done the color pretty much turns into like shrivel the bacon real ugly that's why the price is 5 for $20 like you cannot beat that price right there deals and after trying it on I'm gonna have to go and say the cotton is not that soft okay okay well what about the supreme one though okay that's another slavery the supreme one is for hypebeast aesthetics only wear Hanes I feel like they have a lot of brand recognition you know Payne's class or in Jordan it's a beautiful thing I put them up there with fruit of the Loom and whatnot but as far as the product itself I'm gonna have to go rate it at 5 how to change whatever you man the fit was a little bit off I'm gonna have to go and say solid because you do get five t-shirts for 20 if you just want to cover yourself up these are the ones that go ain't ease are definitely the ones that you wear to go to sleep in yeah generally not something robbed with a nice pair of denim definitely there's a go to safe bet go to sleep don't on your girlfriend type team your girlfriend okay alright so that wraps it up for the hangs white tee I think we could find something better I agree alright alright so next white team we got one from the rail department in North Sean I would say off the bat supersoft we already tell it is a lot better than the Hanes one you can tell right that with the price point to 430 that's not cheap at all that's kind of steep when it comes to a white tee but I'm thinking this is the one when you could wear not just to sleep so right off the bat looking at this white tee right here you could tell the fit is a little bit different the caller is a little bit more structured than the Hanes white to you that's definitely one thing when it comes to quality the white tee then I look at is the collar and you can't really see through the fabric like the Hays white so you can see I think you can foresee the problem if the nipples are Perkin the hanky is gonna show so after trying on this t-shirt I'm gonna have to go and say the fit is pretty good maybe like an 8 out of 10 okay it does feel pretty trendy the mid section is not too baggy it's not flowing all over the place overall when it comes to the rail white teeth I'm gonna compare to the Hanes you're gonna see this white seat hung up in my closet more I see what you mean cuz it hangs ones you're gonna play ball at the park with and then the rail t-shirts you're gonna you're clark's with alright so there we have it the rail department white team I would say worth checking out if you guys want a very soft nice fitting white team mover right along we got a pretty popular one that a lot of people get cuz it's so damn cheap we got forever 21 White T's for 4 bucks just feeling the Chi right now I wouldn't even call this con it has like slight like cardboard tight it leaves a little bit Scratchy let me tell you one thing just observing it before even touching it it does have a trendy look it does it almost reminds me of the real one that we just covered but it has the quality and the feel of the Hanes one well I mean that's what you're gonna get from a lot of forever21 products you're gonna get to look down but you're not gonna get the quality oh I've got these over the Hanes one the $4 so their dollar cheaper they look more expensive than they are I see what you mean I see what you mean but you know what am I I don't even put them in the same category the haze or whooping in the park tight white seat though on your girl like you said earlier this is more for like you want to hit the club and look trendy you know right but I don't put them in the same category so there we have it the forever 21 white tee you're gonna get that trendy look but you're not gonna get the quality down but for four dollars you don't really have a seat so next t-shirts we have up or from H&M and for a longest time I'd walk in there and be like why is there two white tees and two different prices one is a premium version it has like a slim fit you know a little bit thicker and kind and the one is just your regular plain $6.99 and white seat I'm not gonna lie I would get the ones out of 69 cuz they're cheaper and I really did not know the difference so for the ten dollar one this is called a crew neck t-shirt and then it also has a slim fit label on them I put this kind of in the category of like maybe that's all Bay white t-shirts you know what I mean like this fits a little bit tighter around the body and everything that leaves are super super short kind of like a euro fee okay I don't know you personally like it I can see what you're saying because the sleeves are kind of small the armpit of late is pretty short I got a long armpit hairs me you're gonna go down and stay away from this one man so I've always gravitated towards the $6.99 one I don't know why I decide the price point I just felt like wallet II was there for the price okay okay so everything on is not Dashie yes that's half the price of a regular screen print very true I do like these because I've always taught about a white tea could only be worn you know underneath the flan oh yeah well underneath a dress shirt but for some reason man I could wear this with a nice denim and they also have another section in H&M called the divided section they have really good white tees as well so also check those out they have a blue tag on them but as far as these white tees one thing I really never liked about the $6.99 ATGM White T's is the color is very wide do you like that I like it the blue chain shop I see fresh clear then ballers man they a not even a baby that's a newborn chain no it really is though this is how I categorize it man I think the big dudes you know the Johnny Simms and I in a weird way consider myself that big dude okay like I've been called a nugget before he's not sure people come in a nugget like a little stumpy so I'm gonna put myself in the category of your big news we like white tees with nice solid color collars I mean so for myself the hnny tees I never really liked them because of that reason I would definitely rate this one part of one of my favorites top three white tees I'd rate it solid nine out of ten I would put this over the rail or this one I just wanted to get this across that just cuz it's more expensive does not make it better from H&M it's not even gonna be the same thing as a cheaper one so you definitely got to try it on see what works for you so the slim fit white tees $9.99 I'm gonna have to say no go from H&M so last but not least we got the Stafford white tee right here you get four for 20 from JC Penney's if you would like and this is the type of color that I was saying that I like man meaning Johnny you know what I mean I really like this I don't like him at all I feel like this is oral Tim we need to rock the fitted over the ears yeah they arise with too much of the champs in footlocker for 420s men I already know off the bat quality is really good the quality is on point very thick you get a really husky collar right here best fit a little bit oversized when you do get them out the pack but these shrink really well after you shrink them okay pretty nice Stepford overall in general they have a lot of variations of their white keys this one is just their standard bit but they also got like the slim fit they also got some like cooling that one so definitely try out all the variations they have they don't all fit the same so overall wrapping up the Stafford white team I'm gonna have to go and say for myself okay as a small little nugget I like the Stafford white to nihilism right would you rate it are we gonna have to break this a nine out of ten there's no perfect white see out there idea no truth if you guys know what Earthlings signature is it's a brand from Costco and may have white team's very similar to this alright so there we have it the Stanford white tee not really for everybody but if you do want that feel of a street wear tight t-shirt go with the Stafford ones wrapping this one up tan what was your favorite white tee that we went over man I'm gonna have to go with the hmm for $6.99 for myself I like the Stafford white tees we get for 4/20 if you want that more like premium cotton feel but if you want more of like a trendy flow wear t-shirt I actually really like the ones from the rail department even though they were 15 bucks you definitely get that soft cotton feel alright so there we have it please leave down in the comments below what your favorite white tee is to wear right now some other brands that you guys recommend shoutout to tan tan for being in video and until

time we out peace", "zyGQ8mpTXlM": "hey guys okay so I'm back in the back of the shop and I've got the heat fresh heated up and we're ready to print so forth the sublimation transfers of sublimation final as I should call it the sublimation file this one you need to pre-heat your press to three-fifty and my purse my camp is a little high I met 369 one state between and I know that sounds long but it's not so we're going to do 350 for 60 seconds when you print your final sublimation transfers your promo vinyl it's going to look like this okay so it's gonna give a dull look but once you press it this is what it's going to look like now this one is faster so once you press it gonna line up and these are the colors that you're done please so you see it's a big big difference okay and here's one that we actually be it on a t-shirt so we're going to go ahead and we're going to get started with this particular type of printable vinyl you do it comes with a clear backing and you see those sublimation inks they go all the way to the back so you do have to take this apart and remove it now because this is a pretty easy design it's all in one piece I can just remove it with my hands if maybe I was doing another video where I'm doing some tag sorts of things that are separated and I'll show you how to print how to pull those up early in the morning my mouth is very dry so that's just how you do it and you're gonna lay it face down and you always want to have some type of paper and you can use just regular regular old coffee paper this is my subs I'm sorry my screen credit transfer but I'm going to use this today while I'm waiting on my feet French to PETA is I just take my t-shirt and I fooled my t-shirt in half like this and I lay it on the fridge and I'm gonna move this camera over here some so I lay it on the crest I can lay multiple [Music] we are pressing under the stairs so all I'm doing is I'm giving a 17 and I can do five or six of these at one time if I need to [Music] so this give me a knife I already know whatever Spencer thirty and I know exactly what I'm told so that's fine everybody so I'm just going to take my transfer and because I've gotten to a point here I'm gonna [Music] without one and can't touch them done so you can't really go from scene from well I'll just pull that turnout sorry folks I'm gonna pop that down now because I'm doing sublimation vinyl transfers i'm not going to pre-press and I just had quit Princeton anyway so close this down and count off about 30 seconds go right to that [Music] and I'm going to lift my transfer straight up I don't want to leave it there and move it around okay because they'll get the wrong thing on it so I've got one down [Music] [Music] and normally don't use a ruler but [Music] now sublimation transfer they start to roll I'm gonna put something over that collar right there because it looks like a scientist I don't want that so just gonna do another one [Music] now let's remember that I am paying myself for the time that I print so always remember to calculate in your crisis the time that it takes you to print those garments [Music] good thing I didn't put that there [Music] [Music] the colors of nice and vibrant I'm continued with these [Music] [Music] but I'm always using just a regular heat transfer paper uses a regular not heat transfer for regular copy paper you'll save a lot my heat breath was not flattering [Music] probably [Music] [Music] I noticed that I've got just a little bit of that white outline showing someone go back over this with my favorite friend and that's the ability continue to go on - sure you [Music] it's a good idea to invest in a lint roller and lint roll that area I don't have a lot of [Music] so I'm just going to continue to do this and show you guys the picture to kind of give you guys an idea as you get to get to going on this fresh thing you know once I pretty much know where the print goes and I don't really use the metric package well one thing you have to realize is you see how that curling up is that when you're pressing you gotta watch out for that that makes sure that you don't get curls now I'm going to reuse this paper but the reason that I'm reusing if I am doing a black shirt I've gotta make sure that it doesn't you are my sublimation I've got to make sure that my paper does so that's one of the things that you need to watch out for when you're pressing shirt another thing is if you start to get press lines on your on your charts these are polyester shirts if you start to get press lines then you want to rip your paper that's on top of it so like for example here I don't know if you can see but there is a little press line pretty much come out [Music] a really high temperature but if you were hundreds of we'll do those press live let me get a fresh taste of fresh so they're going to do is just rip the edges of it and should they ever do that in the smooth the edges I exam you will avoid those principles so this is the last shirt I'm going to a manual inspection of each and every last one of these shirts now and since idea to this cut by hand I'm going to go in with a fabric marker and make sure that I don't have any white spots it's all about so just when it's hot put this on my pray grab a marker I just gotta [Music] [Music] fabric [Music] that [Music] like [Music] so [Music] here we have it in Canton and scale [Music] and I'm doing this very I'm just looking for I want my [Music] it's about right about 9 o'clock and I'm here all alone this morning my Bulldog to the bit [Music] my birthday lunch is my birthday month close it up stop one thing that I love about the business [Music] right time to start holiday things like that stuff like that [Music] working [Music] walk back looking at my sale [Music] updating website all of that type of stuff so in your downtime the last one we saw [Music] you know what for long term now for and [Music] 1987 was when I graduated oh I love this song [Music] my all of that stuff is so really what we're gonna do is we're about to start doing the home invasion start [Music] I'm gonna go back over and do a final pricks but again [Music] one day Oh only done one press and I didn't do this one free because I want to show people that it be explored out of the white shirt and I didn't press the back so guys that [Music] that one here that's almost [Music] now to really take your time even with with your conscience [Music] my shirt yeah Oh [Music] [Music] and the follow this order get it ready box up for the customer and get on to the next thing that I have to do state custom the appeared to be the day I make sure you got let you guys see me set up a child on the automatic", "Vbfj6TyMwY4": "hi guys it's Krystal welcome back to my channel so this is going to be the design that we're gonna be using today I've already printed it out using my Sawgrass SG 400 that's the sublimation printer I use now I've had people ask me if you could use a regular printer and you cannot I'll insert a picture of it somewhere in here so you guys can see which one I'm using I've got tons of videos on it so I've already printed out my design is ready to go the paper I use as Tex print are I'm going to be using my Cricut ten by twelve quick and easy press today for the design so we're gonna be using that and I'm gonna be using my 14 by 14 polka dot mat as well and then the shirts that I'm using these are the Gildan so when you first get them they look like this I'm gonna be doing the bleach method today and this is how they look when you first purchase them they are Gildan soft style ring-spun so they look just like this okay I'll have a link down below where i order my shirts I'm not affiliated anyway but they are super fast and that's just where I order them these are 65% polyester and 35% cotton as well as they are color you want to stick with like a light color a high polyester count so this is the ones that I'm using today they look like this when you first start out so you can put it on here and it will look super cute if you want to do what's popular right now and do the bleach method this is how they're going to look now I've done a video already showing you how to do this but I've actually changed the way that I'm bleaching these now so I actually don't even do it that way now so what I do and I'll just tell you really quickly and then I'll actually do an updated video very very soon so the way that I do this is I just put a hanger on it like normal I go and hang it outside on a tree like a small tree like a little branch you could be doing this um you can use like those those clothes racks that you get at Walmart that you know those little metal racks you could use those you could get them as cheap as like eight dollars I think 810 dollars so you get one of those clothes racks hang it on there so what I do is I have it on the hanger I hang it on a tree branch where I can reach it obviously and then I take a a bleach bottle like I did before and then I just lightly spray in this area and then I kind of spritz here and there just to get like these little spritz marks here I'll change the dial on my spritzer so it'll have a straight stream and then that's how I kind of get some of these spots like this so this is what the bottom of the t-shirt looks like just like this and then the top part where the design goes that's what a lot of people are doing just like this and then on the backside since it's hanging from the tree I'm not a lot of the bleach comes through there so it's just ro bite and then I took my spritzer and just kind of went like this with the sprays and that's how I came out with this really cool effect so it's super cute on the back love it but it's set out there I let it set out there and kind of dry just a little bit then I brought it inside now if you're doing a ton of these you don't have to do this stuff but this is what I did I brought it inside hung it up and then use my blow dryer to dry them really quick I like the ones with the attachments like this so where you have them on here so it gives it a nice string that's straight in my spot I always talk about that and then I just go you could use like a heat gun and stuff just don't get too too close so you're just gonna use your hairdryer I go over the whole shirt drying it really quickly and what that does is it intensifies the bleach and really helps bleach this out so I found it the best way and then when I'm done I take it over to my sink and I rinse it with cold cold water rinse rinse rinse rinse rinse until I know all the bleach is out I add just a little dot of the Dawn dishwashing detergent just a dot and then I just kind of wash it at my sink it's wet like this really well rinsing and washing and kind of carefully gently going like this until it's completely rinsed out there's no more soap bubbles and then I ring it and ring it ring it gently because I'm not want to get crazy just spots like this and I'm kind of pushing any water out like this as much as I can and then I just throw it the dryer just like that because it's clean I did the Dawn dish soap and everything so then I just throw it in the dryer with some towels or something and it's good to go that's how I'm doing mine like I said I will do an updated video very soon but I wanted to throw that out there just so you guys had that okay so let's get going so I've got my Cricut easy press on 350 for 60 seconds any taking my 14 by 14 mats I'm gonna get that down here you're gonna want to protect that surface with some butcher paper and then I'm gonna go ahead and get down my t-shirt get that up here like so take your lint roller and go over the entire shirt to make sure there's no lint especially if you put it in there with some towels probably bad but that's what I do so definitely go over it with a lint roller make sure you get off any lint and that's gonna avoid those little blue dots that you'll get okay so our t-shirts ready to go I'm gonna go ahead and pre-press it really fast to get out any moisture just like that so just pull down any moisture that was remaining and now we're ready to go so what I like to do is take my design here and I'm gonna fold it in half obviously it's not from the paper to paper it's right here so I'm gonna just I get it like this fold it in half where I can see my design I'm gonna line those up make sure my papers up here at the top make sure those are lined up and I'm gonna get a crease so that way I know where my Center is up go ahead and take my Cricut ruler that I've talked about before today I'm do it using these six by 26 looks good I've got it even up there at the top then I'm gonna go ahead and take my design we're gonna put it upside down I'm gonna line up that crease mark just getting that right up there at the top like so all right I'm gonna go ahead and take some heat transfer tape you can either get it from Amazon and rolls like this you can also get it from Cricut or you can pick it up at Michael's or Cricut calm I'll have it both of these linked down below so just gonna go ahead and give me some heat transfer tape like this and cut that down and I'm gonna get one on each side so I'm just gonna go ahead and get one here and one here all right so we're ready to go now that I've got this down all I'm gonna do is take a piece of butcher paper on top I will have this link below as well I buy the big rolls of this from heat press nation so now we're ready so we're gonna do is 350 for 60 seconds and you want to keep it as still as possible all right so very carefully we don't lift this up we're gonna go ahead and pull off our butcher paper all right so I'm going to go ahead and peel up our design just like that super cute don't worry about this right here so it looks like it burned the shirt so this will actually wash out whenever you go to do it I don't know what it is between this and the bleach I actually have it do this to me earlier and all I did was take it over to the sink just to double-check it would come out and it did so I took it over to the sink washed this out thing between the bleach and the press but like I said once I wash this it did come right out so don't worry about it at all so I'm gonna go ahead and go wash this really fast I'm gonna come back as soon as it's dry and show you guys that this is just gonna come right back out we wouldn't do that really quick and I will be right I am back so it felt seconds for you but it was about an hour or so for me so I washed the t-shirt and it completely came out I don't know why it does that I think it's some sort of chemical reaction with that bleach that it does it but it's not stained it will come out so if you guys do this where you bleach it first and then you put this on make sure you wash the t-shirt bleach it wash the t-shirt and then do it but even when you do that if it does that like I said it's some sort of chemical reaction but when you go wash this it's gonna completely come out what I do is I take it over to the sink again add a little bit of that Dawn dish soap and I brought the t-shirt together very carefully rubbing like this all the way around and then I wash wash wash in the sink wring it out and then I threw it back in the dryer now I probably could have just thrown this into the wash and it would have just done it on its own that way but since I was kind of quick for the video I did it that way so if you need to do it that way as well you can I just put a little bit darkness up like I said just one dog and then I moved it around the shirt and kind of wash while I was already wet and then just rinsed all the way around and like I said I don't know why it does that but it has to be some sort of chemical reaction now it's only gonna do that obviously if you bleach the shirt and then do it so if you do like we did before we use sublimate and then bleach the shirt you're not gonna have these issues at all you don't want to fuss with that I would definitely recommend that you go ahead and sublimate your t-shirt for first and then do the and then do the bleach because it's going to come out the same either way but you're not going to have to fuss with the extra steps of washing it again cute like I said I absolutely love the bleach effect this is what the back side of the t-shirt looks like it's super adorable I love it so I hope you guys enjoy this I hope you guys found it helpful if you did please hit the like button down below and subscribe and I'll see you on the next one", "pgBfew1-YqY": "hey everyone i hope you're doing well just wanna do a very quick video showcasing some really nice technical and basic tees from uniqlo i have a handful of uniqlo tees that i've been wearing for more than a year and they've held up really great this particular shirt it's the alexander wang aries mt collab that they did a while back and it's held up absolutely great so i did notice that uniqlo added some more colors and a couple different cuts of the arizona tea to the website so i thought i would go ahead and pick some up just because there's such a good basics and i also picked up two supima cotton tees from there because i wanted to try those out and then each t-shirt i'm going to show you guys i'm going to give a sizing reference for them because it's a different cut or it might be a different size or anything like the supima cotton teeth i got one in a large one in medium and then i would showcase the different styles of other t-shirts as well i'm gonna go ahead and talk about what makes arizona so special so if you want to skip that skip to this time right here to go ahead and get to the t-shirts and if you want to see how i style it with some very simple fits go ahead and skip to this time right here by the way if you guys are into fashion at all i highly recommend you pick up a tape measure it just makes buying clothes online so much easier it just makes buying clothes online a little bit more worry free because you can measure the clothes based on the size charge to something else you already have in your collection just for a sizing reference i also sell stuff on grailed and this comes in really handy just to give a potential customer an idea of the size of the garment i'll go ahead and link a super cheap version of this down in the description below highly recommend it so four out of the six shirts i'm going to be showing you today are the airism fabric which does have a lot of cool technical features in it such as it's anti-wrinkle especially after washing it's antibacterial just to help stop odors it's cool to the touch and of course it's quick drying and very breathable as well really interesting feature that they have with some of the uniqlo errorism tees are that they are uv protectant so i wanted to look into that a little bit more to see like kind of what that was and i couldn't find anything super concrete on what they do to errorism to make it more uv protectant than a normal piece of clothing but i did find some general information on the internet regarding uv protective clothing and then taking the knowledge from there and then comparing it to what uniqlo does release you can kind of theorize on what they do so basically darker colors protect you a little bit better than lighter colors the denser the weave of the fabric obviously the more protection you're going to get from the sun which is pretty intuitive you know if you have a fabric that's super tight it's not going to let as much sun get through treatment and dyes can be added to a fabric to either reflect or absorb uv rays i suspect this is what uniqlo does with their arrows and tees because aerism is a very breathable fabric so it does let air through so it's not super dense they do say on the tag of some of the errors and tees that uv filtration has been added to the fabric to a rating of upf 40 plus which i looked it up and that rating means it blocks 97.5 or greater of the uv rays shiny polyesters and satin silk type fabrics do a really good job of reflecting uv rays as well which i think this plays into airism because depending on the t-shirt it's either 27 to 47 polyester however these heirism shirts don't really have like any shine to it like with a lot of athletic tees so they're all really subtle and look nice for just everyday wear anyways enough of that i'm gonna go ahead and get into the t-shirts so the first one i got this is the uniqlo u arizum oversized boxy tee and this one is definitely the most unique cut of all of these shirts i was going to get this back when the uniclo u collection initially released but upon the day of release there must have been some logistical error because it wasn't available until like a week or two later so then i just kind of missed out on it but luckily they are still in stock the thing i like most about this tee are the elongated sleeves they come about right up to the elbow and it does have the dropped shoulders and a much tighter collar than a standard t i mean it's not like too tight where it's uncomfortable but it is a little bit more snug up so it does have a very unique silhouette i think this looks really good with like some techier fits maybe some pairs of pants that are a little bit wider or a little bit baggier just to kind of match the oversized proportion of the top this does come in a lot of different colors but i opted just for black just because it is more of a unique cut of tea so i just wanted to play it safe and go with a subtle black instead of a really bright color but again that's just my subjective style opinion because this is oversized i did size down to a size medium now just looking at the size of this tee here the rough measurement shoulder to shoulder which i measured from the hem to the hem it's 52 centimeters or like 21.5 inches and then the total length from top to bottom is about 70 centimeters or like was that like 27.5 inches i think and then the shoulder to the end of the sleeve is 26 centimeters or like that's like 10 and a half inches i think so it's definitely pretty boxy um however the the shoulders are like i said earlier the drop shoulder so they are supposed to go off your shoulder so that's why it's so wide in those measurements but again that's a size medium for wrestling i did pick up one of the basic airism cotton crewneck short sleeve t-shirts and this is just a normal cut t-shirt that i picked up in this really nice dark gray and this dark gray in the arizona fabric kind of gives off a really cool kind of industrial metallic metal like vibe to it that's kind of weird to say but i don't know it has a more athletic cut to it but it's not too slim and they do have normal length sleeves but a lot of times with my t-shirts i do like to cuff it two times just to make my t-shirts fit a little bit better or maybe subconsciously i'm trying to make my noodle arms a little bit more buff looking i don't know i did get this in a size large and the rough measurements of this are shoulder to shoulder it's 47 centimeters or like 18.5 inches total length from top to bottom is 71 centimeters or like 28 inches so again a little bit longer than the boxier cut one and then the sleeve length unrolled of course it's about 22 centimeters which is like nine inches right right now it's just kind of wrinkled because it came packaged up all folded up really close so i'm trying to get that out of here so the next two shirts are of the same cut these are the arizon uv protectant long sleeve and these are an online exclusive so i got one in black just to play it safe can't go wrong with a very basic black tee and i also got this one in dark gray which it almost kind of has like a brown hue to it depending on the lighting in this camera it does look pretty gray um but in some lighting it does kind of give off some brown undertones which i think is really cool and i think this one might be my favorite tee of this whole like mini haul but it has a really nice earthy tone to it it's very classic fit but it's not too boxy being a basic long sleeve there's not too many cool features with this but there are like a small slit on the sides of the waist and then of course you have a nice cuff and collar as well i did get both of these in a size large and the rough measurements from shoulder to shoulder are is 47 centimeters which is like 18.5 inches the total length is 72 inches or 28 inches just like the last tee and then the sleeves are 58 centimeters which is about 23 inches these errors and teeth just have like such a great feel they feel so comfortable and i really really like the texture of it as well it's not too shiny and soft kind of like more typical workout gear but it still remains to be very soft and kind of a soft like cool touch to it but anyways lastly i did pick up two supima cotton basic tees and i am quite impressed with the feel and quality of these t-shirts now just comparing the supima cotton to a standard cotton tee from uniqlo is the supima cotton tee is noticeably more soft and it almost feels like errorism it's so smooth whereas the other one it's a little bit more coarse and granded this one is older but if you're thinking about getting one of the t-shirts i would just go ahead and opt and pay more for the nicer quality tea so anyways i did get these in two different color ways i did get one in a dark green and then the other in a dark brown now the dark green is a size large and the brown is a size medium this season they did design these to be a little bit of a looser fit just so it drapes more on the body both the green and the brown do have undertones of gray in it which makes it very very wearable just for every day and then being 100 con these are much more of a matte color than the arizontes not that the arrows and tees are shiny at all these are just noticeably more of a matte color so the large measurements are roughly 44 centimeters from shoulder to shoulder or that's like 17 and a half inches total length is 71 centimeters or like 28 inches and the sleeves are 22 centimeters long which is like eight and a half inches now comparing that with the size medium tee the shoulder to shoulder width is 47 centimeters or 17 inches so you lose about a half inch in width so the total length is 68 centimeters or 27 inches so it's an inch shorter than the large roughly speaking and then the sleeves are 20 centimeters so it's straight eight inches so not too much more terribly small than the large but it is noticeable and in hindsight i probably would have got both of these any size large just because i like a little bit more of extra room in my teeth just so it drapes a little bit nicer on the body and it's a little bit more comfortable anyways here are some outfits that i put together with these again very simple because all these tees are really great basic building blocks to construct an outfit off of so i kept everything very simple and with the aries mts i put together very basic like techware fits whereas the supima contest put together very basic street road looks but anyways here they are [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i will go ahead and link all the t-shirts i got down below in the description i do use an affiliate link it doesn't add anything to the price but if you do choose to buy one of these t-shirts i get a very small cut of it so it's a nice way to support the channel if you want to pick one of these up and they do have these in tons of different colors so whatever fits your taste they should have it anyways guys i will see you in video pretty soon thank you for stopping by and thank you for subscribing

jared with heat press nation one thing that comes up again and again is the question of whether or not you can sublimate onto cotton apparel sublimation is an ink only transfer process that is designed for a hundred percent white polyester apparel only let's see what happens when we attempt to sublimate onto a 100 cotton t-shirt we created sublimation transfers for both polyester and cotton first we'll press the cotton transfer we'll press this for 30 seconds at 370 degrees fahrenheit [Music] now we'll press the polyester transfer also for 30 seconds at 370 degrees fahrenheit the difference in color vibrancy is immediately noticeable and after one wash the cotton transfer fades drastically but the polyester transfer retains its color to learn more about the sublimation process please visit our website at heatpressnation.com if you have any questions feel free to reach out to my expert representative at support.heatpressnation.com once again i'm jared with heat press nation and thanks for watching you", "lLILkojt_z4": "if you were curious about the Gildan soft style geez 64,000 like this one right here then this video is for you there are a ton of blank t-shirt options out there to choose from so many that stand has this permanent look on his face but not to fear because today we're just gonna look at one in specific the Gildan soft style G 64,000 there are a few important things to consider when trying to choose which t-shirt is right for you comfort style color options and price and also since we are a screen print shop we're actually going to talk about the print ability using discharge and water-based inks which is what we specialize in here at Twin Cities first let's start with comfort this shirt is a hundred percent ring-spun cotton and it weighs 4.5 ounces what this means is that through the ring spun process they've left it with longer stronger strands of yarn what it means for you and I is that this shirt is soft and it's durable shirt was made for wear it's a softer shirt than your Gildan G 5000 your standard heavy cotton t-shirt but not quite as soft as like your next level 3600 your Bella canvas 3000 won American Apparel 2001 those shirts are combed ring spun cotton so they're gonna be a little bit softer but this shirt is a nice middle-of-the-road comfortable shirt next let's talk about styling it's not a Corvette but it's also not your grandma's beige Buick LeSabre out here this shirt is a semi fitted with a tape neck and shoulders it has a rolled forward shoulder so it fits most body types really comfortably it has a nice seamless double collar a durable sleeve and him double needle stitch it is a little longer than your standard t-shirt but not as long as something like the next level 3600 and this shirt comes in sizes extra small through Forex as for shirt colors Gildan always has a lot of color options and this shirt is no different it has a ton of different options to choose from if you look at these charts you'll see that they mix the heather colors and things with it as for price once again nice mill the road shirt as Goldilocks would say it's not too cheap it's not too expensive it's just right and to give you an idea here is a price list this price is 450 shirts with a1 color print and as you can see it fits right in between like the cheaper Gildan 5 thousands and the more expensive fitted shirts like next level labelled the canvas american apparel things like that so this price is really just to give you an idea where this shirt fits among a bunch of our other popular t-shirt options and remember that these prices are subject to change since the time you've seen this video so next let's talk a little bit about actually printing on the Gildan soft style t-shirt since we use discharge inks the dye lot of the shirt actually is very important and what a dialogue is is where they actually take a blank material and they diet to give it its color so in some places like here's an example of a bad dialogue where we print discharge ink on it and we get varying results luckily Gildan has been very consistent with their dialogues we've seen a little bit of problems lately but not too much the important thing is as a customer it's not really that important to you guys because it's up to us to printers to figure out the dialogue problems and it just makes a little extra work for us but for you just so you know the Gildan soft style t-shirt has always been a good option their colors always come out really nice and really consistent one more thing to add the Gildan soft shirt also comes in a ladies version that's the G 64,000 L let me just throw that on for you real quick so you can see what it looks like so once again the Gildan soft style is a very middle-of-the-road shirt it's not fitted so it's not going to make you feel insecure staying here has no shame and it's not a boxy shirt that's gonna make you feel like a square it's right down the middle and now there's only one thing left for you to do and that's to click on the link in the description below fill out the quote form let us know you want the Gildan soft style t-shirt if that is indeed that shirt you want and before you know it you'll have t-shirts of your own we talked about a lot of different terms in this video we talked about ring spun cotton and if you want to learn more about the differences between types of cotton and what those terms mean then click in this video here because I go into detail about those different things and on that note we'll see you in the next video", "maoUzT6aYqc":

Channel and click the notification bells so that you're up to date on new tutorials live episodes and more from heat pressed nation if you're looking for more details on sublimation we have our sublimation starts here playlist which can be watched right now by clicking the card above let's get started one of the top reasons for sublimating onto a t-shirt is that you get a photo quality image with super vibrant colors not only that but since you're dyeing the shirt the transfer doesn't feel like it's there at all also making it very light to wear lastly sublimation is a permanent solution and has fantastic wash ability if you're new to sublimation are doing your research on it here's a quick look at what you'll need to sublimate a t-shirt first is a sublimation printing system which is a specialized printer ink and paper made specially for sublimation if you want more details on these systems check out our category page at heat dot press / sublimation for this video shirt a print out my transfer with a sawgrass printer with sublogic HD ink you'll also need a heat press I'll be working with our 15 by 15 inch craft pro and of course we will need a t-shirt I'll be transferring onto a hundred percent polyester t-shirt because of the nature of the sublimation process you can't use organic materials like cotton the dye simply will not stick to it for the best most clear and vibrant results go with a hundred percent polyester I'm going to print up my design on the Sawgrass printer using the Sawgrass print manager this program optimizes my printers output so my colors will be true once sublimated it also mirrors the image by default and has a lot of other helpful functions as well notice how my printout looks a little dull and washed out this is totally normal since sublimation inks don't reach their full brilliance until heated up so once we sublimate this transfer onto our t-shirt the colors are really gonna pop we recommend using a pressing pillow for sublimation as I'll help prevent press marks from being left on polyester shirts for the sake of demonstration I'll go ahead and press my shirt without one for now we're first going to Center our shirt on the lower platen and pre press for about three seconds pre pressing the shirt helps eliminate any moisture in the shirt and also gives us a smooth flat surface to work with we're going to place our printed sublimation transfer ink side down on our shirt I'm going to eyeball the center for this demo but you can use an alignment tool like a t-square to get more professional results when placing your transfers before pressing be sure to cover your transfer with the piece of parchment paper to protect our heating element from any out gas dye or bleed through if you're using a thinner t-shirt you may need to slip a piece of parchment paper inside the shirt to block any bleed through to the back or onto your pressing pillow next I'll slide the lower platen back in and press my team for 50 seconds at 385 degrees Fahrenheit the sweet spot for sublimating garments is between 385 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and 45 to 60 seconds for this particular graphic on this shirt I found that 385 degrees for 50 seconds works perfectly depending on your heat press t-shirt ink system our local climate you may find the need to use more or less heat and our time we always recommend performing several test presses with different settings to see what works best for you all right so our shirt is done since I didn't fix the transfer in place with any heat tape or adhesive spray I want to avoid shifting the hot transfer on the surface of the shirt if the ink on the transfer paper is still hot it may still release onto my shirt so if it shifts it may leave us the imprint on the shirt this would result in a blurred look that's commonly referred to as ghosting so I'm going to remove the parchment paper carefully and I'll usually give the transfer a few seconds to air cool before I pill it off and again we want to avoid the transfer from shifting so I'll just pull it off quickly like a band-aid pulling up and away from the tee and there you go we have a gorgeous sublimated t-shirt I wish you could reach into your screen and touch this shirt because it's super soft you literally cannot feel a thing this transfer is soft vibrant high-resolution permanent everything you want in a

Cities in st. Paul Minnesota and today we're going to talk about the different kinds of cotton when choosing the right t-shirt you can only love you if you've looked at cotton t-shirts you'll probably see that there are a lot of different options you've got standard cotton ring spun combed ring spun heirloom organic lemon shrimp coconut shrimp what do these all mean what are the differences between these types of shirts first of all all cotton no matter if it's ring spun combed organic it all has to go through a process of spinning where the cotton is drawn out into long strands and turned into a yarn the yarns later sewn into fabric which makes your t-shirt so your basic standard cotton t-shirt such as your gilding g500 it's spun into a yarn but a lot of the short strands of cotton and left in there and you get a rougher feel less durability because of that it's the least expensive oh it's a shirt and I saved a buck next you've got your ring spun cotton all that means is there's an additional process of spinning the yarn and in that a lot of those short strands will be taken out this gives you a softer more durable type of cotton not too shabby the next one is your combed ring spun cotton and that's just an additional process of coming out short and mid-sized strands of cotton leaving you with a really long strong durable piece of yarn and then this would be like your next level 3600 your American Apparel these give you a much softer much more durable t-shirt this shirt is really soft and nice I love it if you've looked at Bella canvas shirt so you've noticed they have something called heirloom cotton all this really is is a cone ring spun cotton they've coined their own term heirloom cotton it's their process of towing and spinning the cotton and it's a marketing term they claim it's the best in the industry if it is or not that's up to you to decide but that's all that is is a cone ring spun cotton heirloom cotton huh highlight misty and then lastly we've got organic cotton which has nothing to do if it's ring spun or told and everything to do with the way it was grown and harvested in an eco-friendly way so to recap you start with your standard cotton also known as carded open in cotton that's your cheapest least durable roughest feeling cotton and then you go up to ring-spun which is softer more durable a little more expensive and then you go into your combed ring-spun cotton t-shirt those are much more expensive but they're much softer very durable very nice t-shirts are made out of this and then finally you can go into your organic Cotton's which make the price go up even father if you're looking to have t-shirts made head over to Twin Cities com fill out a quote form and we'll get you set up thank you guys for watching this episode I hope you guys enjoyed this and we'll see you on the next video if you have any questions leave us a comment you", "fFfBTWFJx_U": "I also guys today I'm going to show you guys out a pretreat and press dark t-shirt I'm using a next-level 100% cotton t-shirt also move the same for 100% Gildan 100% cotton Gildan t-shirt so let's get right to it I'm using the saw hot sonic 16 by 16 heat press and the first thing you're going to do to prick your shirt for our pretreat you're going to press it for 10 seconds I have it get currently still at 340 degrees which is okay you don't need that high to pre-first it but that's what I'm going to need afterwards some to dry out the pretreatment so it says 3:40 I'm going to first it at medium pressure which is number 4 on the hotronix keepers and I'm going to press it for 10 to 15 seconds you also need a craft paper um you can use parchment paper if you don't have access to this or Teflon sheet I normally go with the craft paper because down the parchment paper is really soft and it'll rip apart really easily it doesn't last long the Teflon sheet it's good if you want your graphics to have a sign layer so it leaves like a block you look on it with beyond Teflon sheet whenever you use a craft paper you get more of a flat looking design so position your craft paper and I'm going to press it for 10 seconds I would set at 40 but I'll just count down the 10 seconds 10 to 15 and what is this does is it gets the moisture out of the t-shirt [Music] 10 to 50 okay so you see the paper slide right off now we're going to move over to our pretreat setup okay so I have this little jig that I that I made check the camera it's good made off particle would I would recommend particle with reason being if you use plywood if there's any overspray or anything anywhere it'll just run off this is so soaked it up with the particle is that wood so I found out that therefore it's pretty good pretty good for you now used in beyond particle wood though the main change is same as your t-shirt platen on the vtg it's eleven point seven by 16 and a half you just bring that over it I want to recommend you guys do it inside your home try to do it outside because the chemicals in the pretreat okay you got it all position now let me show you what I'll let you leave I used Firebird pretreat for both light and dark garments I found that this works pretty good never had any issues with it and I've done thousands of shirts usually not you're going to need a roller from loads or own people it's a foam roller all right show you what what I use this for afterwards most importantly you're going to need a Wagner sprayer and one of the most important things about this is to have the settings correct if you have a screwed all the way in what's going to happen is you're going to have too much pretreat it's going to start flooding and it's going to start dripping and running all you need to get all you need is a mix I don't know if you guys can see on where I have it set but I have that the edge of this gray part you see the camera is set in line with that yellow with the end of the yellow part so all you do is I have that set right there and then try to get it as light a lighter of a mist as possible so I'm just going to do a lot to encourage as you can see it's just a light mix you're not really keying like the white from the pretreat if you're seeing up and your is too much so now we're going to do one time across that way and then that way so we're going to go that way that way and then up and then pop down and you need to be at least 12 inches away from the teacher so and then you don't have to go too fast or too slow but if you do go to school you're going to start flooding on your t-shirt it's going to over exaggerate it so here we go that's the first layer and this is where your foam roller comes in you just lightly roll it and this is just a purse but pretreat into the material so that's all you need is just a little minute okay so that's that if you can see it you can probably see the outline of a pretreat then now we're going to go like avoid writing fur-lined it up grab your parchment paper put it on there now I'm going to press it at 300 F 40 degrees for 40 seconds medium pressure and that's number 4 on the hotronix okay right now okay step 4 okay and once this is done your paper your craft paper should just slide right off off your your shirt if it sticks to it like you're feeling as if it's pulling up the fibers off the t-shirt so we've pressed it again for like 10 to 15 seconds see how this goes all right you see the slide right off depending on the heat press that you're using sometimes it may not slide right off you might stick to it a little bit and just press it back 10 to 15 seconds get rid of the excess moisture and that's it slide right off now you have a shirt ready ready to the print with your etg machine so that's it for dark t-shirt also need to add on another little arm device here I want to show you guys it's good to get one of these it's a laser grip it's a heat gun it picks up the heat as a laser light and as a heat sensor this is good because if you are using a different press well no matter what pressure you again you want to make sure that your heat temperature that's on your meter is accurate with the actual heat pad if you notice when I shine the laser on the arm on the heat pad you'll see how much degrees it is so let me get it right here and now it's saying 320 tools so it's fluctuated if I hold it steady I'll get the exact heat that's on the UM just on the UM on the meter so let me get it here and then different heat person sometimes it depends because a lot of the cheaper ones the core isn't it doesn't have beyond the heat the core isn't isn't fully um doesn't have to hold the same temperature so you'll find out that a lot of times you do a press sometimes half of your graphic might not come out properly because there's cold spots on your heating pad so with this thing it's accurate so it's good to use it and check different sections of your heat pad to make sure that I'm you have the correct temperature and that your heat person is showing the right temperature so if I put a link in the description for that go down that's it the dark t-shirt and all you need me to do", "iNtufeGrRho": "so people have been

big Brando and I wanted to answer a question from the homegirl Mary today and she said every time she tries the heat press some vinyl onto a t-shirt when she lifts the press up she notices that it's all gunky and gluey and sticky and the designs not smashed into the t-shirt it's pretty much sliding around and it's just a big mess from the pictures that she's shown me I asked her what kind of vinyl was she using and she replied with she was just using the vinyl that came with her vinyl cutter I think she has a cricket or cameo not exactly sure but I think she bought one of those like budget bundle deals where she buys the cutter and it comes with like a few you know twelve by twelve pieces of vinyl to practice on and test out so I think she had one of those but she thought she had heat transfer vinyl but the vinyl that was supplied was regular decal vinyl now you're asking yourself what's the difference between heat transfer vinyl and decal vinyl basically heat transfer vinyl is made to be heat transfer it onto a garment onto a t-shirt onto a hat onto whatever type of material you bought the vinyl for now let me stop right there and just say that when you're buying heat transfer vinyl you have to buy the vinyl made for the material that you're gonna be pressing on meaning if you're gonna be pressing on polyester make sure that the vinyl you buy can adhere to polyester a lot of times we'll buy some vinyl because it'll be on sale or we might not be looking at the label and it might be made for like nylon and then we go and try to press it onto a cotton t-shirt and it doesn't adhere right the settings are all backwards and messed up and we don't understand what's going on the problem is each vinyl is made for certain materials so you might get some heat transfer vinyl that's made for cotton for polyester and cotton poly blends so that's just saying that heat transfer vinyl will work on 100% cotton 100% polyester and a blend in between the two now why is this important because it's not going to adhere correctly to whatever material you're using if have a heat transfer vinyl that's made for like I said nylon and you're trying to put it onto cotton or vice versa so you have some heat transfer vinyl that's made for cotton now you're trying to put it onto some nylon bags and nylon jackets and you're melting your bags and jackets and you don't understand what's going on you have to buy the vinyl made for the materi you're gonna press on with that being said decal vinyl is the vinyl that you make stickers and car decals and like that for hydro flash car windows I mean you can stick them on anywhere but that's the regular basic decal vinyl that's not made to be heat press and it's not made for t-shirts now if you are buying vinyl by the rule on the shelf this might look normal and like oh yeah let me just get that put that on t-shirt but no this is actually decal I know it's a little bit more glossy you'll notice that there's some holes right there let's see if we get this in focus so there's holes on the side usually that tells you that this is decal vinyl you could tell by the feel it's pretty glossy most of the time heat transfer vinyls a little bit more matted and dull in color this is usually on a really big role when I go to mclogan right here in LA this is on a really big roll and I tell them let me get you know 5 yards of this 3 yards of this and they pull it out cut it and give it to me this is a 15 inch roll this is probably maybe two yards of orange this right here looks the same it's rolled up vinyl but this is actually heat transfer mine on the shelf it probably doesn't look just like this it comes in a C it'll come in like a bag similar to this there'll be some heating instructions a piece of paper in here it'll say you know what material it's made for the brand name how to apply it the instructions all of that will be on a piece of paper inside this plastic tube this is your standard 5 yard if 10 inch roll and this is heat transfer vine this right here made to put on two garments so these are made for cotton and poly blends there's no holes on the side like the other one that I just showed you color is a little bit more magic because this is the side that's gonna get stuck on to the t-shirt they look very similar like if you're buying them on Amazon you wouldn't know the difference most of the time heat transfer vinyl comes with application instructions the regular decal vinyl sometimes does sometimes doesn't but yeah that's pretty much it so hopefully if you were having that same issue and you watch my video and you see me cut some vinyl out and press it on a t-shirt you notice that the decal vinyl is not sticking on the shirt and it's kind of gumming the shirt up and you see the glue getting everywhere and like that it's a big mess that's because you're using the wrong final possibly you might be using decal vinyl when you should be using heat

lady style t-shirt one because of the price - because of the fabric the fit everything about this shirt is great for large groups instead of just telling you though I do have Maia coming over she's gonna show this off first thing you'll notice is great fit first because this side seam here now that means it's going to naturally hug your curves any lady shirt shouldn't be baggy like a unisex style it should naturally hug and this sure does that the next thing you'll notice is the neckline here it's a little lower than the American Apparel 100% ladies neckline the American Apparel is a little tighter this does offer a little more breathability so if you're looking for a hundred percent ring-spun cotton ladies t-shirt this is our go to it also it's a better price point than the American Apparel ladies hundred percent the other thing you're gonna see is just the sleeve length flattering it hits you right at the right part of the arm not too high not too low fits great feels great hundred percent ring-spun means that basically if you're thinking about sizing we do suggest maybe getting one size up so normally Maia would wear maybe like a small but in this we have her in a medium today just because with that cotton and just doesn't stretch as much so that's one thing to note with this if you order familiar drew sometimes err on the side of bigger because it's never fun to get a shirt good with this though we recommend any type of our eggs vintage or standard vintage being the lighter ink coat standard being a normal print a little thicker ink to make it pop but with this also comes in two 100% ring-spun this is a heathered garment and athletic gray meaning at any time we have a heathered means this could be 90 10 90 cotton poly which just means it's gonna have a little more stretch but still offers kind of that more snug fit great shirt overall one of our best selling ladies shirts and you can see why great price point great fit the neckline is awesome everything about it might look awesome in it I'm a co-ed monkey soft scale we rate this t-shirt a - thanks for watching this video please let us know if you have any questions because here at co-ed monkey soft matters and so do our customers", "_LunBmg4is0": "[Music] i have been on the hunt for the perfect white t-shirt and it's so long and if that's you too probably why you clicked on this video i'm going to be investigating eight different t-shirts and we're going to be putting them to the test for a few different things fit price feel sustainability so let's get to it my name is amanda weldon be sure to subscribe would love to have you part of the fam but let's get to this video the first one that we are going to investigate is a canadian brand if you've heard of a lego shop before you probably have your frequenting style youtube here she is the founder of uncle studios and this was my first impression of the t-shirt okay so these are my initial reactions nice and thin not see-through i am wearing a beige bra though so i will do test later honestly the length is really nice it's not too long but it's long enough that you can tuck it in and it will stay tucked in that's always so annoying when you have a t-shirt you want to tuck in and then you move and it just kind of comes untucked i think as well it honestly has this really nice kind of a bit more cap sleeved but not too cap sleeved but not like down your arm i know there's different styles that people like but uh the threading very minimal and it's super soft nothing about this t-shirt is itchy so that is my first impression i like this one the soft feel of this t-shirt comes from the components that make it micro model and super cotton i hope i'm pronouncing that right a 50 50 blend and as well this t-shirt is made in canada something that i was definitely impressed with on their website was reading more about their eco-conscious materials and their ethical labor you can definitely see more about their sustainability practices there if you go into their education sector which i have linked down below you can read a little bit more especially about the specifics of those two fabrics so moving forward this is a lightweight t-shirt so my worry was it was going to be a little bit see-through and it proved to pass the test the thing i loved about it so much was the feel and as well where it hit me on my body and it being lightweight is nice it won't pill it won't lose its shape and as well this will be so perfect during the warmer months it hit the bank account though 48 u.s they also talk about why it is that way on the website and i ended up ranking this one one of the highest at 23 out of 25. next up we have madewell so this madewell t-shirt when i tried this one after the uncle studios one i thought hey it's actually pretty similar but here is how it is different okay so first impressions of this t-shirt again very light doesn't feel thick at all easy to move it's a little bit off-white it's not that perfect perfect white so i like the way with the color is a little bit thicker and yeah this one's pretty pretty simple this t-shirt is 100 cotton made in guatemala and i found it different from the uncle studios one because i didn't find it as soft and when i started doing a little bit more investigation on a website called good on you which i definitely recommend you guys check out i'll link that down below as well i looked up every single company we're going to investigate but some weren't found on it however for madewell unfortunately their ranking was not so good they scored 11 to 20 percent on the fashion transparency index and that's when they look into information like the source of their materials where they're made the people the planet the animals all things that are incorporated in that but though that they ranked pretty low on that one they actually do have a ton of sustainability practices when it comes to their denim so maybe you've heard of madewell because of their denim now madewell is a branch of j crew and to be honest this t-shirt was pretty basic if you were just looking for a standard white t-shirt it was pretty good the size range as well was pretty inclusive and that was ranging from a double extra small to a double extra large and their pricing was pretty inclusive as well around 21 canadian sadly the shipping was half the cost of the t-shirt as well so it actually ended up coming to 31 overall i don't know why i just wasn't as impressed with this one and i took off some points just because i wasn't sure how sustainable this branch of the company was just because of that transparency index and then as well the durability next up this is this is one i'm so excited to tell you about and this is one a lot of you voted on instagram for me to check out oh this is such a nice t-shirt damn okay first impressions of this one oh my god this is a thick t-shirt but it is beautiful this is the kind of t-shirt that i picture like with dress pants and a really nice layered jewelry moment it is so nice i actually love where this sleeve hits my arm and the thick layer as well it's kind of got that like thick stitch i feel like you could do if you're someone who likes to spice it up a little bit you could do the one two roll so you hide that seam oh i love this one i could see myself getting this in another color i think that's how you know you want to get multiples 100 cotton and made in vietnam this t-shirt when i put it on i just kind of knew you know that feeling i'm actually wearing it right now because i was so impressed and it was definitely one of my favorites the way that it hits me on my body as well as the length of the sleeves i definitely definitely liked and just the thickness it made it feel a little bit more upscale like i could match this with a really nice pair of trousers and then stack some jewelry and i would be all set to go and feeling really chic when it comes to sustainability on good on you they still ranked it's a start so that's still kind of mid-range when you go to their website though they do have so much more information about their sustainability practices and it really seems like they are trying to continue to push this forward it was designed in paris and basically called the ultimate basic t-shirt and i could totally get behind that whether it comes to the design or kind of the thickness and durability and versatility of this t-shirt i'm all for it double x or small to double extra large as their size range and this one will come in costing you around 30 plus tax it got to my door pretty quickly and i was impressed with everything about it i ended up ranking this one 24 out of 25 4 out of 5 for sustainability because there's still some work to be done province of canada made in canada canadian canadian-born but clearly this isn't the one guys this is a beautiful t-shirt it's super well made it's made in canada it's 100 cotton it's really nice and i think the reason why i ordered all these t-shirts in small and this is a unisex t-shirt so it's uh just on the larger side and these sleeves come down so much lower i think that this one's going to scotty but if you guys like the um the longer sleeves this might be the one for you okay so this is such a tough one made in canada 100 cotton this was honestly a beautiful t-shirt but because it was unisex they were saying on the website if you are a woman you probably want a size down i ordered all of these t-shirts all eight in a small so that you could see the range of them there's definitely some work to be done when it comes to their transparency about sustainability specifically but on their website they do say there's a reason you feel reassured when you find a t-shirt that reads made in canada on the label too many local manufacturing is synonymous with quality and equality which is why made in canada is the main pillar of our company now because the size wasn't for me i had to bring in scotty we are pretty similar in size and i thought that this would be way better suited for him and this is what he had to say yeah it fits you really well it's the providence of canada tea the province of ontario province of canada yeah it's nice it fits well i think um all in all because this is a unisex t-shirt i honestly think it fits you better than if it's me yeah yeah did they have an extra smell i think so yeah it's a really nice t-shirt though yeah the material is amazing it feels really really soft when he asked me if there was an extra small i wasn't 100 sure so looking into the size range there's actually extra extra small to extra extra large which means a very inclusive size range and then when it comes to their pricing as well this was a little bit pricier of a t-shirt 38 dollars but i did end up getting 10 off because of a welcome deal overall i rank this one 19 out of 25 but i think if i had gotten the right size it would have been up a little bit higher so this is the only one that i say take it with a grain salt have you ever heard of the brand cotton this is a really cool brand guys and i'm excited to tell you about it this was their packaging and then they as well sent along this little tote it was the only company to do this in the full gamut of things this one's really thick you can tell it's really well made the stitching is beautiful but it's a bit off-white so if you're looking for like a crisp crisp white this one is a little bit off-weight and it has a very different color than the other ones it kind of has like a ribbed collar but it's nice and thick and i think the shoulders might be just too wide for me but this is a really beautiful one and the sleeves come down a little bit longer no cap sleeve here so after my first impressions this had a different kind of stiffness to it 100 cotton egyptian cotton and made in egypt and this t-shirt i thought was really cool it's really hard to tell on camera but it is a bit of an off-white and the sustainability practices of this company are very impressive and they also have a lot on their website when it comes to education about their farms and sourcing of their products so definitely check that out for their t-shirt though the fit is actually a little bit boxier it's a vintage inspired t-shirt and it's a band tee and around the neck it had a really cool ribbing detail that was so different than any of the other t-shirts it's going to run you around 38 and the size range as well was inclusive with that double extra small to double extra large this one actually ranked quite high 22 out of 25. it just wasn't the fit that i specifically was looking for okay so let's do erisia as a whole because there's three t-shirts that i sourced from maurizia their sustainability practices still have work to be done on good on you they definitely talk about that and on their website i actually never knew this i've been on the uricio website so many times but i've never reached out to their sustainability side of things and it was really cool learning more so i put that link down below so you can check it out too the first brand we're going to look into is daviton so this is the only one of the white t-shirts that i've actually had for a while and it's the babiton everyday shirt you can tell it's a lot shorter than the other ones and it's a bit like slinkier in feel versus that stiff 100 cotton i really enjoyed having it i lay it flat to dry and it's kind of that perfect layering underneath a sweater or something like that but if you are someone who likes a longer t-shirt because you want to tuck it in and when you raise your hands you don't want it to come up this might not be the one for you but all in all it's super soft and it's a pretty basic go-to teeth this t-shirt is 94 round and 6 elastane and made in china funny enough about this t-shirt specifically this is the only one that i actually already owned before this video and this ended up being one of my least favorite t-shirts i don't know why i think i'm just when it comes to a white t-shirt i really want that structure because i think that a white t-shirt when it's crisp and a little bit more structured it can look so sleek however because of this more like elastaney feel there was a bit more of a see-through quality to it the one thing i did love that i could use this as is a workout t-shirt because it is nice and stretchy or for hiking i think it would be great it'll run you thirty dollars not too bad middle of the road and the size range is from double extra small to extra large i ended up ranking this one 17 out of 25 taking points off for some sustainability fabric opacity and fit as a whole for me personally next up is wilfred and these were my first impressions this is the only fully ripped t-shirt and you can tell it's a lot tighter than the other ones a totally different style has more of a cap sleeve and finishes right at the top of a high-waisted jean this is definitely just like for a totally different situation and i would consider this more a casual white t-shirt versus some of the other maybe even more oversized ones that you could dress up with some jewelry so i like this one but it really all depends on what you're looking for 91 model and 9 elastane i think my first impressions were pretty we're pretty accurate with this one this t-shirt just looks so casual and it is much tighter again i think i would consider this one more as a workout t-shirt it has a shrunken fit a crew neck it's ribbed it reminds me of a high school girls t-shirt it just kind of i don't know what it is about it it just comes off a lot more casual than the other ones did and a little bit more young looking but that totally makes sense for eritsia and the range of people that shop there i still really loved this t-shirt i think there's just a time and a place for it and what i was looking for was my everyday t-shirt that i would pick out for zoom calls and just running around whereas this one wouldn't be the one that i would grab for it was honestly so soft though and i would definitely take this one on a vacation double extra small to double xl was the range and surprisingly this seemed like the tiniest t-shirt but it ended up being the most expensive one from auritzia it came in at 40. total was 45 20 canadian taking some points off for fabric opacity as well as the fit and maybe a bit of sustainability i ranked this one 16 out of 25. last but not least we have sunday best again from auritzia as for the sunday best t-shirt this is a lot thicker than the other two from auritzia i would say this kind of also rivals the earlier t-shirts that were just that thick opaque you're not going to see your bra through it at all i think that if you're wearing a white bra as well you won't see it and it's obviously as well a lot tighter and finishes at the top of your high-waisted jeans i think that's more of the style of orizia kind of the clientele that they're looking for as well and this is a beautiful t-shirt it's very soft it feels just like good it just feels like i don't know it would be a really nice go-to and it also all depends on whether you want that tighter feel so i do really really like this one the only thing that i wish that i could do is i wish it was a little bit longer so that i could get that tucked in effect but other than that just i can see this is a really great like travel tee the total makeup of this one 57 cotton 38 polyester 5 elastane and made in china if we're talking about t-shirts that surprised me the most out of this whole test it was this one i actually love this t-shirt the only thing that makes it different from the uniqlo one because it definitely was thicker was it was much more slim fit and it also hit me much higher on my hip so it matched the top of my jeans kind of like i said earlier it definitely passed the opacity test and the size range was double extra small to xl i would recommend this t-shirt to you if you are going to find one in auritia i think that this one might be the one and surprisingly as well it was the cheapest one out of the three 25 dollars and the total price was 28.25 for the total score i ended up giving it 5 out of 5 for fit i really liked it 22 out of 25 total and i think that it really all depends on what you're looking for but personally for my style and what i'm looking for my top picks were uniqlo uncle studios cotton and sunday best tied for third specifically what kind of stood out to me about the uniqlo one and the uncle studios one that kind of ranks them equal in a way but i put the uniqlo one a little bit higher because of the thickness and i just love the way that it looks i think that pairing that with a nice pair of trousers and as well some stacked necklaces like i said earlier in the video would come off so beautifully and i definitely want to invest in the black t-shirt from them as well the uncle studios one i loved so much too and it was really hard to choose which one i would put first the only thing i found a little bit different about that t-shirt was that it definitely was thinner i think that if i was doing this investigation in the summer i would have maybe ranked that one first because of that thinner maybe more lightweight feel it would be a bit more comfortable in those hot months so all depending on where you live and where you plan on wearing your white t-shirts those are the two that i would highly recommend that you investigate further for yourself let me know in the comments below if you like this style of video it allowed me to flex my journalism muscle which was so fun also just kind of diving into the sustainability practices of all these t-shirts was so fun and i hope that you guys enjoyed that as well of course i'm not perfect i'm just going off of their websites as well as what i could find hopefully on good on you which is another thing i would suggest that you check out if you are looking into new brands subscribe become part of the fam thanks so much for watching and i hope you guys found your perfect white t-shirt i know i did bye [Music]", "flr-V4g7h8w": "so we've all noticed both singles and weight while looking at the features of t-shirt in reality what do these mean and what's irrelevance singles and weight are some of the most important factors that you will need to pay attention to when purchasing a shirt I'm about to tell you why next hey guys it's Mel also a shirt space so let's first touch on singles single refers to the diameter of the yard and is calculated by the number of times that that yarn has been twisted think of it like you do sheets the higher the thread count the nicer and the softer the sheets end up be in the apparel industry singles range from 18 to 40 so let's look at three tees within this range the first tee we're gonna look at is from all style the al 1301 is a six ounce 100% cotton tee that has a single count of 18 the 3600 is a 4.3 ounce 100% cotton tee that has a single count of 32 the three four one three si is a three point eight ounce tribe leg that has a single count of 40 so have you started to notice a pattern here the higher the weight the lower the single why is that so let's dive into weight weight is the weight per square yard and is usually listed in ounces so here's the correlation between singles and weight now let me make sure I get this right one pound of one single yarn is 840 yards long while one pound of 10 singles yarn is 8400 yards long aka the higher the single the tighter the yarn the softer and lighter the T is thank you guys so much for stopping by to learn the importance of singles and weight if you guys have any questions or video ideas go ahead and put them in the comments below make sure you subscribe turn on your notifications and have a great rest of your day thank you for sticking around with a video this long I hope you're enjoying our educational videos we have a lot more to come but make sure you subscribe so you don't miss any oh and come check out our Instagram you won't be disappointed", "I9kgTaieozI": "[Music] you too what is going on it is your boy easy it ain't easy being Kesey and if you are new to this channel we talk anything from clothing music to culture and if you're into any of that stuff I recommend for you to subscribe so on that note today we are switching it up just a little bit and I have some comparisons that I've been wanting to do so I've waited about a week and a half to do this to make this video and what this is all about is oversized t-shirt I've recently kind of got back into oversized t-shirts which kind of just look like baggy shirts from back in the day except the cut is just a little bit different but today we're gonna be comparing minimal to all style okay and more specifically it is the 1301 style for all style and it is the drop tee or oversized tee for minimal it I'm pretty sure it's called drop tee but there's so many names for this like oversized t-shirt but I'm pretty sure to drop to you right on their website as we speak now if you're interested in the old style right off the bat all styles are always available there on Amazon their own eBay they're on all different types of blank websites as far as minimal girls I don't my guess is that this is something that they have all year round but it can also not be something that they have all year round unfortunately enough I have a size large and an extra large and a 13:01 and for the minimal I have a white enlarge and then I have a size medium in the black and the reason why I have black color is because they ran out of size medium and white so I have to compromise okay and how we're gonna format this video is that I'm just going to try them on give you my raw opinion of it and then afterwards I'm gonna give you some measurements and then kind of answer some questions at the very end and then wrap up the video the first one I'm gonna try on is the size large in the white from minimal before I even try this on I'm gonna be honest with you this thing looks huge this thing looks massive but let's give it a shot are really huge but ii thought too thick not too thin but this is wow this is huge dude Oh Dawg Dawg I'm swimming dude oh my god big man this is too big this is way too big to size large and most t-shirts but like this's I understand it's a drop tea but God can't see my elbows man without being said let's try on the medium for minimal perhaps the same material all right so this is doable and doable size medium of the minimal drop tea though I recommend I already recommend buy a size down from the minimal drop teas or an oversized t-shirt this is exactly what I'd be looking for I think that how to buy like a regular sized t-shirt that is not a drop teat it would just be too long on the bottom if it's oversized so it's nice that it kind of it kind of stops a little early compared to most just regular t-shirts I guess let's go ahead and try on the old style so this is a size large which isn't bad this kind of just fits exactly like because it's 1601 or just a regular adult team it's not bad I do wish that the sleeves came down a little bit longer since that being said let's try on the extra large with a extra large is just way too big I was saying earlier with regular size t-shirts this is kind of like a regular size t-shirt got this specific style recommended to me from another youtuber which I'll try to link up in description if I find it again he said 1301 is a good for oversized t-shirt but right now I'm gonna say that this is a no like this is huge oh mighty like this is a very big shirt alrighty and I got some pretty skinny sweats on right now I just I look like I'm stuck back in 2003 [Music] like this is not this is not it man this is really big I mean if he came up just a little bit more they'd be cut off like right here area it probably would have worked but this is just it's too big man I don't ok so just very quick on paracin that we have here so we got the minimal here obviously they do a lot more brand heavy stuff for their garments so you got your minimal tag here which is pretty cool and then they give you this tag as well the minimal one I paid about 20 bucks you also want to get about 10 dollars but this material is a lot better I think the black one that I'm wearing right now that I was just showing you guys that one I don't know why but it feels better than this white one that they made but again the material this one's a lot better now their white is a little see-through I know it's hard to tell because though my white light right now is shining directly on top of it but in real life put this on and then you have a pair of pants on or something like that or something more reviewing on the inside it's gonna show something dark it's gonna show which is a little unfortunate but as far as all foul that won't happen to you because their garments are pretty thick as it is but that's kind of arguably where all style kind of is a little disappointing sometimes is because sometimes I wear all style and it's like really cold outside and it works because it's kind of thick but then sometimes it's really hot outside and I don't want to wear an all style t-shirt because it's just too it's too much it just it doesn't feel as comfortable as something like this that's like a little bit thinner I don't know if I want to say better quality but it's it's softer and a thinner and air runs through it a little bit better air doesn't always run through an all style t-shirt as well as it should but I'm a little disappointed in this all style I thought it was going to come and gonna kind of fit like a drop tee but it didn't end up fitting like a drum - you just ended up fitting like a regular adult all style t-shirt which I don't personally like I don't and I'm not that fond of that the caller's are very very different - with the minimal you got this like collar that is a lot softer obviously from an all style all style collars tend to be a little bit rough sometimes this is a lot softer but the drawback with these type of like minimal collars is that if you wash it too many times they get a little crinkly and and it just it feels funky man just to be very honest it feels kind of weird after a while and it feels very used either right now it's good obviously cuz it's brand new now these cup of college they'll last you a long time but they're not always the most comfortable colors in the world they're very thick and like I meant it in the summertime it could be a little too thick now to my understanding I believe all style is made here in the US if I'm not mistaken it could also be made in China and then imported here and you know however they do that but my guess from the materials that I see on the minimal I haven't even looked yet but they're my guest of the materials on the minimal it's got to be from Pakistan maybe China but probably Pakistan or somewhere in the Middle East quick let me see if they have tag on the inside here as I suspected made in India now I don't know what it is about this specific material and also these type of collars I've ordered a lot of blanks myself with my own clothing brand name and like looking into different manufacturers that make it different types of collars and materials and I don't know why but this material just it just speaks either China or India or Pakistan to me and I was kind of like dead-on right on the money with that I mean you should be either determinant of which one kind of fits you best okay so you're gonna do some very quick measurement wean all style here and minimal these are both a size large got the height thirty inches and for the minimal 29 to 30 inches now if we take the width of this t-shirt about 21 inches and be minimal is coming in about 25 significant difference the minimal is almost two and a half to three inches wider than your all style if we take the measurement of caller to the sleeve you have about 16 inches here and collar to the sleeve there's about 19 inches cut on this is obviously a lot better to achieve the oversized look and the all style isn't doing so hot I remember that these are both size large and also remember that all style you know they didn't purposely make this t-shirt to be an oversized t-shirt or oversized fit but remember minimal they are meant to be an oversized fit I recommend whatever your true to size is go one size down in this and if you really want the whole style then go one size up and then maybe you can tailor it later to fit yourself you know better but this one is pretty off to the actual look that we're trying to achieve today I don't know okay closing the video out I will say that minimal had blown this one out of the water but I mean it almost came to no surprise that minimal was better than the all styles because you know all styles the purpose of the all style was is not supposed to be an oversized t-shirt I mean you could buy one size up depending on your body type or whatever if I was a little bit taller then yeah the XL would have worked for me but the the large just felt like a regular ol style t-shirt large like an adult t-shirt large which I don't like that sizing of that right now and then the extra large just felt huge you just felt massive no different than the size large in the minimal that one also felt massive but the medium that I have on is a perfect size I like how much it kind of covers the elbows a little bit but to achieve that oversized look and 20 bucks for the t-shirt it does feel like a lot of money to buy one shirt for a blank shirt for twenty dollars but minimal does a pretty decent job at there are some other brand names that do do it too but this was the only one that was kind of more accessible towards me towards online so I happen to buy the minimal and I thought I'd do the comparison today so hopefully this video was helpful don't say I want to say this now all style is not a cheaper alternative as of what I think about the 13:01 if somebody knows a another style number that is a good comparable style words fit or cut to an oversized t-shirt better than 1301 now please message me I would love to know which one that one is or another brand I would love to do another comparison so anyways closing this out make sure you guys keep it lock right here for all your latest information

shirt for whatever reason you want to shrink a shirt the temperature of the water is gonna determine how small your shirt gets I've had a shirt come out of the dryer looking like a Barbie shirt before and I never got to wear it again it also depends on the material of the shirt if it's something that's a really like you know like a sweater material it's gonna shrink a lot faster if you just have cotton it's gonna take a little more to shrink it so boil some water on your stove after it's been boiling you want to bring it over and dump it into a bowl or a pan whichever shirt you want to shrink drop it in that hot water let it sit in there until the water goes cold really let it sit in that hot water after you do that if you wash the shirt on the hottest possible setting in your washing machine it'll shrink it even more and if you dry it for a long time in the dryer on a hot setting you should come out with the shirts it's about two three sizes smaller at least I'm Rachel you choose this and that is how you should make a shirt", "QIz2B4Jdkn0": "[Music] please like comment share and subscribe hey now it's your girl shanita nicole and welcome to do dream one if you're new and if you're already a dreamer welcome back welcome back welcome back so today we are going to be going over how to sublimate on white glitter vinyl so i'm really really excited today i have two projects i'm going to be doing i'm going to be printing this out on a square image and i'm going to be printing this image out on a circle so i'm going to show you two different ways to do it um the circle my best friend wants me to make this for her so i literally made this design myself for her and i'm using a circle template i'm going to use white vinyls white glitter vinyl and what i'm going to do is i'm going to print this out in silhouette because i'm in silhouette studio so i'm going to print this out in silhouette at 9.336 inches around and then i'm going to print the circle and glitter out a little bit above it now typically you put the image larger than the glitter but i'm going to do this one is going to be smaller because it doesn't really matter now i'ma show you how it matters when i do the other image i'm going to do so i printed this out in silhouette studio and then in cricut i'm going to show you how i printed this we are in cricut design space and i'm printing this circle at 9.5 and that's what it is all the way around now honestly it didn't matter because the background is white and the blue and the glitter is white so i could have made it the exact same size larger smaller etc but i i put it on top of each other i put the image here now you know you can't print out actual print and cut designs out larger in cricut so what i did was i put it inside of here so i could see how the image would be when i printed it out and i wanted it smaller versus larger with the circle because i'm gonna have to cut the circle around because i do have a cameo but i haven't set it up yet so i don't um know how to use it so i don't want to make it larger and then my outside circle is off i made it smaller so i'm going to hand cut around my circle and if it's off it's not going to matter because it's going to be inside of the glitter i hope that makes sense so that's why i made it different so this is going to be my first design i'm going to do when you do this you want to make sure that you heat your shirts up a little bit it gets any type of moisture out so i heat my shirt up as well as i use a lint brush so i want to make sure everything is going to be nice and smooth on there okay so that's what i do so i'm going to show you typically we use the lint roller to get any type of lint or dust or anything off of the shirt and then we typically you can use a teflon or butcher paper if you want but i know nothing's on my pad so i'm just heating up my shirt and what this does is it one gets the wrinkles out and then two it takes out any absorption any moisture anything like that some people do some people don't i typically do depending on the shirt how i want the images and things to stick so there's a good lint roller and then we have go ahead and get that out so that's how we do that once we do that i'm going to go ahead and um put the vine the glitter the white glitter vinyl on top of the shirts so i have two black shirts i'm going to be using i'm going to use white glitter vinyl on both one is going to be a circle one is going to be a square okay now for the second image i got this image off of google i'm not going to be selling this this is just for tutorial purposes but this is good old nipsy hustle if anyone knows me they know i love nipsey i'm so devastated about his passing i just continue to grieve which is so weird but i'm just like hurt anywho so this is um an artwork that is done outside of the marathon clothing nipsey hustle as you can see victory that it is so dope so i'm so excited to do this image now for this image this is how you typically do all of your cover up vinyl i'm sorry all of your layer glitter white vinyl with an image you want to make sure that the image is a little bit bigger than the vinyl and the reason you want to do that is because i'm using white vinyl this picture is not white like my other image so i wanted to cover up as much of the white vinyl as possible so it can look smooth and clear and crisp okay so for this image the um inches are 9.435 and height and 9.59 inches in width okay so that's what i'm doing for the image and i'm going to show you once again we're in silhouette studio because this is the only one that can print this large and then for um for the actual white glitter vinyl we can print out of cricut so i'm going to show you what that looks like okay so i'm inputting the image inside of cricket i'm saving it as a print and cut image and then i'm going to go ahead and upload the image and it's going to take a minute okay so i'm going to unlock the image when you unlock the image it lets you change it to the size that you want so if you remember in silhouette it is 9.435 in height or we can just type it at the top 9.435 and then with it is 9.594 so i'm going to press enter and then it's going to change the image so now we can actually put the image on top of each other to see exactly how much space is going to be so i technically could make my um image either a little bit bigger or i could make my vinyl a little bit smaller so you can do this so you can know for sure i'm not sorry i'm not showing you you can do this so you can know for sure so i think i'm going to make my glitter behind the image a little bit smaller because i want to make sure it covers it up a hundred percent completely okay so the picture can be a little bit larger we're gonna lock and load it and then that's we're gonna do so i'm gonna just cut a little bit of my vinyl off the glitter vinyl off so that it can be a little bit smaller than the actual photo okay so that's how you could always check it but as you know in cricut it will not print because it's too um because it's too large okay but we will print it out in silhouette alright so i'm gonna go ahead and start putting the glitter on the shirts and then i'm going to go ahead and then sublimate on top of the white glitter vinyl now i've used several different brands so it doesn't matter scissor is a great brand i always use that one a lot um i've tried other brands that i needed i tried cricut when i was like in a jam um i've tried other brands and they all seem to work for me but i believe scissor is the best brand um there is another brand i really like and i i have to find what the name of that is but yep so i'm going to go ahead press the glitter down and then i'm going to sublimate on top of that if you have any questions comments any easier tips anything please let me know okay so i have this it's like i create ruler by tam sweet life so if you wanted you could go to tamsuitelife.com um or follow her on ig by tam's sweet life that's i'll put it in the comments says b y t a m s s w e e t l i f e anywho so i use that to make sure it's perfect and because i'm a little bit ocd i also use this t ruler just to make sure that each side is exactly where it needs to be now each image will be a little bit different um and each size of the shirts may be a little bit different so this is a circle so it's a little bit different anywho i'm going to go ahead and press this on um yeah so i told you i have uh yet learned how to use my cameo so i'm literally oh the vinyls on the shirt it's nice and pretty so i'm learning how to um i haven't learned how to use my cameo so i'm going to just cut around the circle and that's why i gave it some wiggle room because i'm like i don't want to mess this up for my best friend but i don't know how to cut it out of pricking it so i'm just cutting it around and then i'm going to lay it on top and she's going to have her shirt that she wanted the other shirt is going to be a little bit different because it's square so squares i have a paper cutter that i could use to do that i mean or i could use it by hand as well but that's that thank you no i don't like it so i'm going to make it bigger so i'm printing out of my workforce epson workforce epson 72 i'm sorry printed out of my work for 7720 series popping colors cassette 2 that's my preset and i'm printing it out you should hear it in the background if you want to know what my presets are you can watch my how to sublime beginners video you can watch that again if you guys want me to i can make another one but i've already made it so it's kind of like i don't want to be redundant keep repeating myself so go ahead and watch that but i'm printing it out because i needed it to be a little bit larger so i printed it out this one is a little bit better but honestly i could have used more space i'm also noticing if you haven't noticed your um designs and cricut and this silhouette don't match up so my inches i've noticed they don't match up i know someone previously told me in my comments to make sure that um i think she said something like tapering off the image or something something like that but i have to look that up a little bit more to figure out what it is i have to do to make sure that the designs line up but this will work because it's literally just going to be glitter all around it so it's not going to matter but for my other image i'm going to have to make sure that it's perfect like i need it to be perfect like i needed to be but this one is perfectly fine for right now because it's just going to be white glitter around it and i already told her how the image would be and she agreed so that's not a problem at all so yeah so we're going to go ahead and take this down and i'm going to put it on 400 for 60 seconds that's what i'm going to sew now here i'm just measuring everything from the top making sure that everything is going to be the correct amount of inches from the top and the bottom that i want it to be so you could play around with it i'm like i said a perfectionist so when i do things i want to be as close as perfect as possible even though i am hand making it and human error you know but i try to make things okay so i use a sub paper as you can see and i use cosmos oh yeah okay so there we go i have it on 400 degrees for 60 seconds and this is the image that i created for my best friend well my boss friend that's what we call each other all right so that's how it looks now i'm going to do my second image on the square inch but it looks good i hope she like so i'm literally just cutting a little bit of it off so that i can have a little bit more of this overlapping the vinyl so i want to have the picture a little bit bigger than the vinyl so i'm taking just a little bit off so that it can overlap it a little bit so i'm taking it off on both sides the width and the height just a little bit okay so i've always been a person who i can eyeball things and look at things and know exactly how much to take off i don't know how i don't know if it's the photographer in me but i can look at things and see if they're like crooked or fix things just visually so i don't know how much i took off i just eyeballed it okay so now before i even put it on a shirt i see that it's a little bit overlapping and that's what i need because i don't want to see any of the white vinyl and excuse my niece in the background baby sitting in my knee so my daughter and is playing with my niece so that's what you hear in the background so anywho this is going to be perfect so now i'm going to press this on the shirt and then i'm going to press sub this one you see i got my ring light i got my ring light i have my [Music] tammysuitelife.com create ruler and i have my t ruler so i'm making sure that this is correctly in the middle so that it won't have any issues or problems and now i can go ahead press it and then i'll sub on top and yes i do use heat tape this tape is from amazon it came in a two pack um and this yellow is never transferred on anything of mine i've heard people say that it's transferred so until it does i'm gonna keep using it i may try a clear one they have blue ones they have all types but this is the one that i use and i've never had any issues from amazon so gonna go ahead and press it down now for real okay so here's something that i noticed depending on the brand of um white glitter that you'll be using it may have like this has little like lines in it it's not a bad thing it's not going to mess my images up but i did notice that so if you can see you see that it's like lines so that's going to come up in the image so that's okay so that's what i said you may want to play around this is not scissor brand i honestly have to look and see my friends tell me to try this brand out so i'm trying to get out my home girl hey girl tell me to try it out so i'm trying it out and um so it's not scissor i have to see what the name of it is but it has a little line so the image is gonna have those little lines but like i said that's perfectly okay i'm trying to think of other things i may have missed previously things i'm trying so if you can't see the entire image what i'm doing is i apologize but i'm just going the sides and making sure that it's overlapping on all four corners so that there won't be any white hopefully around the sides you don't want to see any of the white glitter because it's a color image so i'm just making sure that it's overlapping and the ink will get on the black but it's okay because it's blue and then hopefully it won't hopefully it may come out because that's not polyester so it shouldn't be an issue okay so i'm going to take this down sup i'm doing the glitt white glitter at the 3 30 for 15 seconds i'm on the heat press and then this i'm summing at 400 for 60 seconds okay so as i always say it's always more than one way to skin a cat this is how i tape it down i want to make sure all of my corners are taped down so that it can make sure that it absorbs and all of the white glitter i literally lifted each side up made sure that it was a little bit over the edge of each of the sides so i'm feeling really confident about it and i'm going to go ahead and sub it now like i said at 400 degrees for 60 seconds if you guys have any other tips or tricks please share thank y'all for sharing some of y'all are hitting me up on facebook instagram some of you guys are um commenting under my videos let me go check these babies out yeah so i got this nifty little thing from amazon it's by bryco goods and what this is is it holds my um butcher paper and then i can tear it off it would normally press this for 60 seconds at 400. right i have to loosen the tape up a little bit it's hot but i cannot wait to see this finished product i loosened up some of this tape and i'm gonna look and see oh yeah it's literally perfect and i don't say things that perfect [Music] i did so good guys i'm so happy because i'm like i'm doing the tutorial and i hope it'll come out right [Music] and then oh you got all that ink off here baby yes it's acer paper 125 grams cosmo ink on top of white glitter vinyl so yeah so here's the finished product i told you i used asa paper cosmo ink white glitter vinyl i hope you guys enjoyed it i

Now, over the past few years this has\nbecome one of the most popular and most demanded T-shirts we've seen, for a few reasons. One is the price point, two is the color options, and three is just the fit and fabric. It feels great, fits great and again, that price point is amazing. So, so many bands look at this shirt as their standard at merch tables. Instead of just telling you\nabout it though, we do have our model coming over and we're gonna show it off.\nNow, first thing you're gonna notice is it is a great fit but there's no side seam here, which that's, that kind of\nbegs the question, what does that mean? Well, without a side seam we can\nactually do more of a wrap logo, which is very popular. If we had a side seam\ngoing down the side, it could be an uneven print right there, which makes the ink\nkind of bunch up and not be as good. So this is perfect if you want to have a wrap logo. The next thing we're gonna talk about though is just this neckline. It's bound on the\ninside, super clean neckline here. 100 percent cotton has a good stretch to it without being too\nstretchy. The sleeve length is pretty generous here. It's a little longer than, maybe the comparable Next Level or American Apparel, but still hits at a great point here, not baggy at all. It comes in great colors, and like I said before a great price point for this shirt. 100 percent ring-spun cotton, now you might be wondering, does that mean it's gonna shrink? How should I wash it? What size should I order? It fits very true to size, on top of that, it is a hundred percent ring-spun, so you're not gonna have to really worry about shrinking it. A year or two years down the line if this becomes\nyour favorite t-shirt, I'd just say, don't nuke it in the laundry. You know, kinda keep it to that mid to low heat, because cotton, over the course of its life, could shrink. Cotton also can pill, so, if you're looking for\nlongevity of a shirt, I'd recommend maybe looking at the District Threads 60/40 blend or\nmaybe a Canvas, Next Level, American, one of their 50/50's if it has to wear and re-wear every week for volunteers or maybe, if you're ordering for employees that have to wear it. But this is a great price point, 100% ring-spun cotton, same line of thought as the Next Level or Canvas in terms of pricing. Cheaper than American Apparel though and the Alternative Apparel. So, if you're looking for a great price point go with this, which is why we get it demanded so much. Thanks so much, you look awesome in it! On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this video please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters and so do our customers.", "s56ckRKlCK8": "things are about to get hot in here

let's jump right in to pick the best shirt for heat transfer vinyl the shirt has to meet a certain criteria it will not only need to be a great T to wear but it will also need to be a tea that works well with your heat transfers heat transfer vinyl works well with many fabrics but we think these two type of fabrics stand out above the rest the first is a hundred percent polyester polyester is less likely to shrink than any other fabrics but what does this have to do with heat transfer vinyl once your design has been added to the tea it's crucial that it does not shrink this could wrinkle pull or even ruin the vinyl with 100% polyester you know your shrinkage will be minimal and we like minimal shrinkage especially when it comes to HTV but I'm not just gonna stop there what if we could take it to another level well there's no what-ifs about it we can with three simple words cotton poly blend cotton poly blends are the best of both worlds you have the durability and minimal shrinkage from the polyester and the softness and wearability of the cotton the blending of these two fabrics will create an overall makeup that you will love since this is our number one candidate what's the top tea we recommend in this category drumroll please it's the bell of canvas 3001 CVC made up a 52% heirloom combed and ring spun cotton which is the best cotton out there and 48 percent polyester weighing in at 4.2 ounces this is a lightweight tea that you will love to wear being a retail fit and fashion-forward your customers can rock your great design it has unisex sizing side seams tearaway

in his 1920 novel this side of paradise that's a fun party fact go ahead and take it it's yours you're welcome", "YBNjhuVgYFM": "what's up just Ali and as you know I am starting my own t-shirt company line merch whatever you want to call it caught my visual interpretation let's go ahead and get into what type of shirts of that boss so I am going through what's their name TSE apparel so I'm going through a wholesale company called TSE apparel and today I picked up some sample and I can already tell the difference in qual one of them's like a hashey black that's the Gildan and I don't appreciate that I'm gonna have my customers putting a lotion on their shirts I'm about to show y'all in one second we lay about let me lay them out for ya let me lay them out for ya okay so you can see the variations in the and black pusher turn the soft light off that back light you can definitely see the variations you've got Gildan you've got Bella canvas right here Bella canvas and then I also picked up a home brand Toltecs and as of right now just looking down I like these two better already out the gate because you can just tell the quality from looking at the shirts that you know they took their time they took the time this one this one's actually this is definitely going to be or I shouldn't even say a she is just it's just a different black a black that I can't appreciate right now um and what I'm going for with my brand is you know quality products because I can't be giving out no uh no lame stuff but off the camera this one is definitely darker this it goes darker this one and then this one but let me show you how they feel trying all Gildan first so trying on this shirt first I mean it's okay now I have no complaints as of right now it feels it feels fine I feel like maybe it might be a little bit each year but I mean it's not bad whatsoever it's not bad at all it feels good it's not riding up my arms I can it's good like me I mean that's good you thought you got to see some titties psych next is Bella canvas Bella canvas this one feels a little bit better this guilting was a little bit it's not I can't say it's itchy it's just different it's just a little bit different this one you can definitely tell they took their time with it the dyes I mean it just feels good I liked how the hello how come I have my own how the sleeves are it's not it's not tight it's not hugging too tight and by the way all of these are smalls I'm 5 2 and 1/3 ok I'm 5 to 130 so this is what it looks like I mean this is how it looks on me [Music] so this one as of right now between the two that I've already warned this one is definitely tough like I said the color is different the color you can definitely check tell the color colors apart this was deeper this one is like I said this is like an Ashley black this is Gildan Ashley black and right now I have on the belly canvas it's not getting into focus but this is the Toltec okay again this is a small this is a small not too bad I like the fields I like to feel I kind of I when it comes to the actual sleeves I like how Bella canvas and gilt it kind of wraps around and it's tight with this one this one's kind of loose it's not a bad thing it's definitely preference but I don't like I don't I like it to hug me hug me tell me how you really feel so my number one is Bella tall Tex and then the Gildan Gildan is okay I feel like I just feel like the Gildan it's just it's just it's just just this is just I don't know what I got to do to get that feel it like I said you gotta try these things on because it's one thing for somebody to tell you it's another thing for y'all actually feeling it on your skin this feels good like a bread my titties for tuning in this is the start of my visual interpretation support me I love y'all all the realest just a lead", "OGDhx9fpP88": "hey guys it's becky with design bundles and today i'm going to talk to you about bleached t-shirts now this is not necessarily a new craze but these always flare up around the fall and you know why that is because they make nice distressed designs okay distressed fall they really go hand in hand so now is the time if you have not done so already grab your bleach grab your t-shirt and let's go ahead and get started okay so here i am on designbundles.net and i scored myself this really awesome leopard or cheetah print uh pumpkin okay and of course i i'm really loving let me show you guys this up close i'm really loving this um cheetah leopard print and the hearts so of course i had to grab it too so i have my pattern and i have my pumpkin and i'm going to go ahead and purchase these so that we can get started okay now once i'm in silhouette studio now you can do this in any designing software it's completely up to you but i'm going to set these up to be sublimation prints so i'm going to go to file and merge because i already have a window open so i can merge instead of i'm going to open like normal and i've already unzipped these you guys saw me do that so i'm going to i like to use the png formats and i want to use is that the pink one i'm going to use this orange one here now they usually import pretty large so if it takes a minute don't be alarmed all right so this one is not bad at all i am going to shrink it down just a little bit and i also want to merge in my pumpkin let's see jpeg and png i do like to use the png those usually have a transparent background it doesn't matter for this in particular but it could matter in the future now i know probably what you're thinking the pattern and the pumpkin don't match up very well that's okay because it's not going to be that big of a deal once we get to the actual project so what i like to do is this is going on an adult large shirt so i'm going to size it and i also need to change my page setup because i will be printing on a large format as a matter of fact let me set the custom okay can i go 13 inches wide i'm going to change my machine to none there we go 13 by 19. okay this is the size that i'm going to print and i want my pumpkin to be let's say let's do 9 inches now i do want to say this is going to be a little bit smaller than 9 inches because it's measuring the outside borders here so what i can do if that concerns me is i can draw a box that is nine inches line that up with my pumpkin and then i can size my pumpkin manually so that it's closer to the nine inch mark so my clipboard is actually nine point eight four seven that's okay that's not a big deal just something to know when you're using clip art and i am going to go ahead and flip it horizontally okay so with that in place what i'm going to do is i am going to make this pattern a little bit larger and i'm also going to duplicate it now the only reason i'm doing that is because i do want to have longer pieces and i want to use up the rest of my space down here now silhouette studio will only print what is on the page so just something to keep in mind make sure everything is on there and i'm literally going to fill up the rest of the area with this awesome cheetah pattern i keep saying cheetah is it cheetah or is it leopard all right so i'm going to print now i do have to select my sublimation printer see there we go i'm going to go to preferences and every time that i print after restarting my software i need to re-choose my super b 13 by 9 and 13 by 19 i mean and then premium presentation paper matte i'm going to choose okay hit apply and then i can hit print that's going to send over to my printer and of course we will reconvene and i'm going to show you not only pressing this on the shirt but then applying the bleaching process okay so what i have here is my sublimation print now this is the shirt that i'm going to use this is a style that i really like especially this orange it is a gildan soft style and it is 65 polyester and that leaves 35 cotton now there are reasons why you want to use a blended shirt like this first of all you need the cotton or to be able to bleach it second of all you need the polyester in order to be able to sublimate it but do remember that because you're not subbing on 100 polyester your print is not going to be as bright now for a bleach shirt that's fine and that's why we're doing the bleach so that you can see the design a little bit better but just be prepared for that now i'm going to trim all the way around all right now that is because sometimes and i find this a lot with sublimation printers you can get a little bit of ink around the outside of your paper and i would rather not have that happen so i just trimmed around each side and we will sublimate this part first and of course i have some butcher paper over here so what you're seeing down here on the bottom is just a heat safe mat that i have i'm going to grab my cricut easy press it is already heated up to 400 degrees for 60 seconds i'm going to fold my shirt in half it's kind of my thing i mean not my thing it's a thing okay that way i can get a crease before i sublimate my design on there so here we go i'm just going to pre-press that section and it doesn't have to be for the full time you just want to press it get some of the moisture out of there and give yourself that nice pressing line and just works out really good it's a good habit to have okay with that taken care of i will smooth this out and i'm going to go ahead and sublimate first yes you heard that correctly i'm going to sublimate my design first now i'm going to take my design now this is a design that i printed sometimes you can get them pre-printed from certain areas okay if you want you can use an adhesive to keep it here i'm not moving this shirt so this will be fine for me i'm going to cover it with butcher paper and then heat press my design now sublimation does not take a lot of pressure but you do need consistent pressure another good thing about these bleach shirts is that if this is one of your first time sublimating then it doesn't have to come out perfect because bleach shirts are supposed to look distressed so it just works out really good as a beginner project okay now be careful when opening your heat press or removing your ez press because since we did not use any type of adhesive or heat safe tape we do not want this design to shift okay so on this part we are a done deal now you cannot reuse this butcher paper you see you have the ink on there that transferred and that's okay just know that that's a thing all right there is our beautiful pumpkin now what we want to do and i'm going to start small just to show you guys i'm actually going to tear around this design okay because i do not want it to look like um just a rectangle obviously i actually prefer these to look like stripes all right so there's one we can use this one for another one and it just gives it a rough edge instead of just a bland okay and of course i have this entire sheet over here that i can do the same thing to i can make these a little larger and i probably don't even need all of these i tear them into little triangles and i'm not going to use the ones with the blunt edges like that okay so i can use as many of these or as few of these as i want to i'm just going to go around the shirt and press these on now let me also say if i was using a different shirt especially a white shirt or a light gray shirt you do want to use butcher paper or a different type of blowout paper in between your shirt layers i don't have to do that with this one i've worked with this one before and it is not going to bleed through to the back but just something to keep in mind and i like to do that kind of test anytime [Music] i'm working with a new shirt you do want to make sure you get some along the bottom now my shirt just my shirts seem to bunch so i'm just going to put some off to the side over here now our sublimating is done all right this is our our final effect we got a couple stripes up here and a couple stripes down here all right now don't worry if they look a little staged after the bleaching process they will blend in a little bit more and i promise this shirt is going to turn out great so i'm going to go ahead and prep the bleaching area and then i'll show you guys the setup that i use okay so the basics are you need it to be sunny outside obviously you don't want to be raining you need good weather conditions you also need a bleach safe environment now on top of just this piece of hardboard that i have you'll notice that i'm inserting a piece of cardboard into my shirt that's just going to act as a barrier so that whenever i spray especially the main middle pumpkin there it's not going to saturate through my shirt all the way to the back in addition to that make sure you're wearing bleach safe clothes in my video there was a little bit of wind blowing and i didn't have any blow back but that is a real possibility that you could blow the bleach that you spray back on the clothes you're wearing i also try to give my shirt a little bit of character so you'll notice i have done the pinch and twist on three of the areas and that's just going to give some areas where the bleach cannot reach and it just gives it a little bit of texture now i'm using straight bleach this is also cheap bleach i have heard that the high-powered bleach is more potent so definitely keep that in mind and i'm spraying all the areas that i have sublimated on including i'm trying to carefully go around my pumpkin and make sure i get that area really really well but you're going to notice that i give it a pretty good overall spray down i don't really well it's not that i don't like them i personally am not a fan of creating the shirts that just have the block of bleach right there in the middle and nothing else so i just really think that adding more bleach gives it some character you see i do a little bit of misting here now if you want some true misting you'll want to make sure to choose a spray bottle that has a really fine mist i'm going to come back and do that in just a minute i like to do my bleaching in stages so i'm doing one overall bleach right now and then i will actually come back and add a little bit more bleach in just a minute wow did you notice the change there so i had set it up on a time lapse but the gradual change wasn't quite as impactful so um it did occur now that probably took about five minutes what i'm doing is i'm going back and i'm re-saturating the areas where i've sublimated and this is with a a smaller bottle so i have more control over where i'm spraying and i'm going to let this sit for just a minute but another important thing to remember is when you take this inside you do want to at a minimum rinse it with cold water and then some people talk about also adding peroxide to neutralize the bleach i haven't had to do that but it's just something to keep in mind if you are in the mood to experiment but also as you're carrying it inside make sure that you do not dislodge the cardboard piece inside because your shirt will still be wet and also make sure that you don't brush the shirt up against your clothing because obviously it's covered in bleach so overall just try to keep an eye on your shirt and after you see a little bit of the transformation you can also straighten it out flatten it out and you know take a look i like to do that because it gives me a better idea of how the bleach process is going because i can compare my bleached area against the unexposed areas and see how much change there really was now here we are on the inside i have already rinsed this with cold water i feel like i got pretty good results on my bleach shirt you can see i got a pretty good bleach around the design okay and i don't like it when it's just a plain circle right in the middle of your t-shirt i do like these lighter colors i think they bleach really well and it's not a stark contrast so i'm very happy with how this turned out and i'm going to throw it through the washer and dryer and then we will take another look so uh do you like it i mean i i'm not gonna lie not everybody is with the bleach shirt craze all right that's okay there's no judgment in this zone this is the safe zone okay now if you like it you kind of get addicted to it pretty fast and if you live in florida like me then you know having all the sunshiny days to sweat your ear off bleaching shirts i mean it just depends on how you feel about that so all right well i really appreciate you

lot of really fun tutorials for you right around the corner thanks again we'll see you next time you", "f2E25CDxoRA": "[Applause] cool guys welcome back to another video I'm Daniel and I hope that you fellas are having a good day dressing well and of course getting stuff done alright guys so it's gonna be a nice and quick one today I'm gonna be going through my top ten favorite go-to t-shirts that I personally find myself wearing all the time a lot of you guys always comment in each video what t-shirt I'm wearing so I'm going to be going through all of these showing you guys which are my favorite where I got them from in the price that I paid for them alright guys we are standing straight into it this is a very nice fitted white t-shirt from cause and I paid 25 pounds for this there's two kind of unique features through this t-shirt one is the high neckline which is the main reason I really mess with that I do just love a nice tight high neckline the second is that it's a very light almost see-through material I don't know if you look close enough but you can probably see my mic so it's a very nice breathable one perfect for coming into spring and summer alright guys so staying on the white trend this is my most expensive teacher that I do have this is the acne studio one again similar to the COS high neckline has that printed acne studio a very nice fitting t-shirt absolutely love this this is a lot more of a heavyweight material but it is also quite stretchy so the size every time I wash it it always just comes back to its natural size and I absolutely love it coming on to the third one guys and this is kind of like my most oversized t-shirt that I do have it is very oversized but this is definitely a lot more of a summer vibe t-shirt now the material of this one the reason I like it so much is it is that towel material I got this from All Saints it was on sale when I got it absolutely love it and yet for me this is my kind of more out there t-shirt because I do really like my t-shirts to be simple and played down but with the stripes going across and their texture to this t-shirt it just adds that little bit of detail that I absolutely love so guys coming on down we are entering a round of Col bloody Buxton this dude is just breaking the bank on me because they keep putting out good pieces I have three t-shirts from them the next this one and the next two are all called Buxton but let's get into this one first I paid forty pounds for this is the Col Buxton week a t-shirt is a lot more of a softer material really just sits on the body great for kind of like every day absolutely love this season my favorite black t-shirt completely it is that oversize fit you guys would be the common theme in pretty much the rest of this is just oversized it's just what I like love tucking it in I love having a little bit of that bagginess it's kind of just my style and personality that I really mess with but yeah very simple cannot go wrong with a nice black shirt especially when you tuck this in to some black smack-heads add some Doc Martens perfect you're good to go again guys called Buxton this is their warm-up t-shirt you guys know I did a full review on this there's the first stop I bought from them 60 pounds still love it to this day I love this is the slate colorway it is a great fit is and like kind of a boxy fit the material is a lot more of that heavy weight and license duty I love how simple this one is yet but because of the way they designed their t-shirt gives it that nice kind of vintage feel so it's a great way to add a little bit of texture to a very simple outfit and yeah it's a good colorway the last of the call back someone same warm up t-shirt this isn't happening the colorway but I call it the concrete one if that's how eyes up do it exact same use the other t-shirt nice heavy weight and yeah just honestly guys the Cole bucks and stuff like I'm not just like saying it for the sake of it like I messed with their stuff and anytime they drop a new t-shirt I'm most likely gonna cop it because this is the type of stuff that's always gonna be in my wardrobe as long as my style stays this way I'll always mess with their stuff so this next one is by Val Christopher I think that was a hundred pounds that is quite pricey but it is so unique and there's a lot that goes into it obviously it's quite a bit more tout oversized bit to it man I've actually been thinking about just doing a full video based on this t-shirt because in this little snippet that I've got it's not enough time but what I do really love about this t-shirt is it's the type of one that I will wear when I want to just make a bit more of a statement when I want a little bit more of a unique standout t-shirt but the reason why this is my top ten is because it's still a very subtle t-shirt yet it has its own amazing uniqueness to it obviously there's the so much going on I kinda just want to do a whole video on this but yeah I love it so for a lot of you oh geez you will remember this t-shirt it is definitely one of my go-to yet because we've been in winter I just don't go out for brighter colors but coming into spring and summer you're gonna see this one a lot more this is my small supreme box logo t-shirt this is what I want to just you know what I want is just be a little bit of a height beast for today I want to just be a supreme head you know I just want to be in that game very subtle very still minimal definitely my style definitely great balance between minimal and you're still in that kind of like Street way scene all right guys on to the second to last one and this is my burnt orange t-shirt again oversized boxy and you may have seen some expensive t-shirts my first t-shirt was 10 pounds from Zara I absolutely love it love the fit of it look the colorway of it perfect when you come into order and perfect when you're in spring summer winter whenever I love it guy size large fits really nicely colors great it's just a really nice way to add color to your outfit but without being too bold all right guys last but certainly not least we started with a fitting t-shirt so we're gonna end with a fitting t-shirt as well it's not always about the oversize fits this is the day's march one you guys would have seen this recently again when I add color to my outfits I like it to be in a more desaturated way love the fit of it I love the cotton love the heavyweight material of this and it's just a really good vibe for about three pounds and there we have it guys those are my top 10

Now this is our standard 100% cotton\nlong sleeve t-shirt kind of our big group order t-shirt. There's nothing\nI'd say super special about the cotton on this. It is gonna be the standard\nhundred-percent cotton. It is a great price point however. There are softer\nshirts but, they're a lot more expensive. The sleeve length and\neverything is pretty standard. The sleeve kind of, how wide it is, is also pretty standard. But instead of just telling you about it we do have our model here and he's gonna come over and you'll see it in action. The first thing you'll notice is it's a pretty generous cut both in the width here and the sleeves. They're both gonna be more generous. I don't wanna say baggy but\nthey're not gonna be tailored or tapered. So, as you can see here, there's no side\nseam. A lot of the softer shirts actually have a side seam because they're gonna be more tailored, and that tailored side seam on the softer shirts just makes it cut in. This is going to be more of a straight down, kinda more of a generous cut, so great for wide range of body types, I'd say. So, big events this is your go to long sleeve. The sleeve length also everything pretty standard here. We have a great cuff, it does, it's gonna basically hold very good over the course of the shirt. The neckline here, very standard hundred percent nothing special about the neckline to note, it's just a standard neckline. It's not going to stretch very far down and it's always gonna come back, which is key to 100% cotton. It doesn't have a lot of stretch to the fabric either. Now, you might be wondering about care instructions, will it shrink? Things like that. With this garment, don't really worry about shrinkage, but you might want to think about over the course of the lifetime of the shirt, being a year, or two\nyears, if you're washing and drying on high, it could shrink. That's one thing to note about a hundred percent but it is pre-shrunk you get it Very true to size when ordering. So, looks great and a great price point too, so if you're looking for a big group this is the shirt to go with. You look awesome Tyler, Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a one.

design is a shirt that looks good and feels great let's talk about the best tea for cricket vinyl transfers heat transfer vinyl can work on many types of fabrics but we think there are two that are superior to all the rest first let's touch on 100% polyester polyester shrinks less than most other fabrics this works great for heat transfer vinyl because once you've applied the vinyl to your shirt you don't want it going anywhere this includes pulling and shrinking in the wash after the fact making it less likely to shrink 100% polyester is a great candidate it's a very cool fashion-forward 100% polyester shirt that we recommend is the thread fast won 4-0 a it's the men's liquid jersey short sleeve t-shirt it's a 4.2 ounce making it great and lightweight to wear it's a retail fit giving it fashion-forward feel its side seams giving it a comfort to wear it also has a tearaway label which is always an amazing plus okay let's move on to our second favorite fabric for heat transfer vinyl cotton poly blends these tees are great because they provide the softness of cotton and the durability of the polyester with having both types of fabrics you get multiple perks in an overall makeup that you'll love the tea that we recommend most under this umbrella is the Bela chemist 3001 CVC it's a 4.2 ounce 52 percent heirloom combed and ring spun cotton 48 percent polyester making it very soft and lightweight it has a retail fit so it'll give you that fashion-forward feel it has unisex sizing so it'll fit multiple different body types it is also side seemed so it has that comfortable constructed feel it has a tearaway label because who likes a scratchy tag anyway and it is also pre shrunk so it's less likely to shrink after its first wash there you have it the two best tees for

your dreams that's kind of creepy [Music]", "LLCb4hjFWPs": "you guys I'm going to be extra truthful today my biggest pet peeve is when my t-shirt shrinks after washing it it really can turn my day upside down but why does this happen let's get into it [Music] hey guys it's Melissa a shirt space so the shrinkage in the tee can be caused by a couple of things first it could be the way you wash it but the second can be if a shirt is preshrunk or not so let's get into that what does preshrunk actually mean the term preshrunk mostly speaks for itself but there are a few factors to be aware of so I took notes to make sure I get this right preshrunk doesn't necessarily mean that the t-shirt manufacturer washes every single garment instead it refers to the garment being put through a machine that pushes or compacts the fibers tightly together this process condenses the fabric by removing the spaces in between the stitches as a way of replicating the shrinking process in doing this the garment has been pre shrunk and will shrink less when being put through the traditional washing and drying process now let's be real I couldn't have memorized all of that point number two having a pre shrunk shirt doesn't always mean the shirt won't shrink further most fabric will shrink on average three to seven percent so you won't typically notice but there will always be some additional minimal shrinkage to be where bottom line is preshrunk implies that the shirt will no longer string but what is actually the case is it will just reduce the amount of shrinkage thank you guys so much for

the leg where a name would normally go so her name would normally go here if you wanted it they charge extra flat but all they had were assurance with this white bar so they wanted to give us these shorts for free because we didn't want him like that but I paid for him anyway it was a big deal but I said that I could just put her name on here with my vinyl cutter so today we're gonna be using the Cricut explore air to to cut out some vinyl and put her name on her gym uniform should be long so let's turn on this heat press awhile [Music] so I have it set to 350 degrees that's for a screen printing I'm gonna put this down to maybe 250 degrees or the vinyl [Music] so 250 degrees because we're working with this type of material so this is 100% polyester and we don't want to burn the shorts so 250 degrees should be good our guys so I'm gonna go over to my desk where my Cricut explore air tube is at and we're gonna cut some vinyl [Music] all right so I'm gonna do a quick screen grab for design space design space and I'm gonna click on the text tab and write my daughter's first name well her nickname and I'm gonna do a second version of her first letter of her name and her last name then I'm gonna put the width so 4 inches and a height of 1 inch and as you can see I changed there but we'll fix that the same thing for that other version and this part I forget that the lock box is not unlocked so it's not doing what I wanted to do so I unlock it and I put four inches as a width and one inch as a height so I do the same thing for her first name and that lock box unlocked and I'm gonna put 4 inches as a width and a height of 1 inch and I'm gonna click make it alright so I'm gonna rearrange just the way I want it cut so I'm just gonna put them on top of each other and click there and as you can see here the the the top one mirrored but the first name on the bottom did not mirror I didn't notice that but it came out alright I don't know what happened there maybe a glitch [Music] all right we have our vinyl cut so let's see how it looks on the shorts perfect okay so I'm gonna change the pressure of the heat press because I had it at a really really light pressure for the screen printing but we're doing vinyl so I'm gonna put the pressure and back down [Music] [Music] all right guys check these out they came out super super good I know cans gonna love these shorts [Music] yeah that was actually really easy to make I know she's gonna love them and you know what we're gonna do another custom job or a family friend we're gonna make a t-shirt out of vinyl so let's do that while we're at it well we got the heat press going on so let me get this shirt [Music] [Music] it looks pretty good all right let's sit this on the shirts [Music] [Music] [Music] all right guys so I gotta get going I'm not gonna finish the shirt it still needs to be completed I have to put bread for Edie the shirts for our family friend she's a teacher and she's represented in red for Edie and I believe red for Edie stands for if you guys don't know is - what is red red I think it's to bring awareness I may be wrong but I believe it's to bring awareness to the needs of teachers and students in public schools for like supplies for for like supplies and you know for teachers to get paid what they deserve I think that's what the movement is I'm not too sure I could be wrong but I believe that's what it's for so making the shirt for her it's almost done I'm gonna finish it tomorrow because I gotta get going are real quick there's a huge be in here I

on these jackets so stay tuned [Music] [Music]", "RaBffG1zLL8": "today we made it into downtown LA home\nof the fashion district where creative entrepreneurs brands and businesses come\nto shop and sell the latest styles now whether you guys are consumers or\nactually in the fashion industry chances are you've seen rolls of fabric like\nthese which actually go on to become the products that you wear now virtually\nevery brand and business gets their start with a simple t-shirt crew neck\nand hoody and more importantly is a very interesting fact is they don't actually\nmanufacture the products themselves in fact a lot of the times are being\nmanufactured in large facilities so as a consumer you need to know that you have\nthe option and the choice to impact the world at large\nby the businesses that you'll go on to support so in this video I want to peel\nback some layers and actually show you guys how products are created on a mass\nlevel and I thought it'd be really interesting to start with how these\nfabrics are actually made cotton the most popular fabric in the world is\ncreated from the ground up before being made into the fabrics you wear it begins\nin the field where it has grown and picked by industrial equipment and\nshipped to be processed during the processing stage the cotton is cleaned\nup removing impurities and then the soft fluffy cotton you see becomes a strong\nfiber the process here is designed to create combed and ring spun cotton that\nhas a softer feel this type of fabric goes through an innovative spinning\nprocess that's designed to thoroughly soften and straighten each fiber the\nstrands will then tightly knit and woven together to create a raw fabric that is\nnow strong enough to be worn next time you're choosing a shirt take a look at\nthe fine details to see this for yourself\nonce the fabric is completed and then gets transported to a dye house where\nthe fabric is dyed to the color specified by the manufacturer the\nprocess we're showing you here is unique to Bella canvas which is the largest\ncutter and dhyryam apparel in America we take you guys inside of the state of the\nart facility to show you what it takes to make quality apparel for millions of\npeople all over the world as you see once this fabric is dyed it gets\ntransported as these fabric rolls which are then laid out across large\ncutting tables the fabric is stacked up to a hundred and fifty layers before it\nbeing mass cut inside of this factory they cut three million units a week and\nI personally always wanted to see how these machines layout the fabric so\nlet's take it out for a spin what's the worst that can happen so right out of\nthe gate there's this machine here and it has like all of these different\nsettings and I see this little this thing so I could just move this and it\nworks I'm going to reverse though huh let's let's crank this thing up but the whole thing my privado I messed up this fall\nI dig I think I did a bad job that's that's that's bad huh - push the button\nthere that is odd this buddy right here tightens up the rope\nshameless crap okay I'm gonna try it again how much right right\nyou know at first glance these machine seemed to move themselves but what I\nfound out is that it actually requires some skill in order to tighten the\ntension of the fabric as it's being laid out the faster you go the faster that\ntrigger fingers got to be in order to keep up once the fabrics are laid out\nthe cutting machine arrives to cut the fabric in the shape of the required\ndesign this is the cutting machine that essentially takes all the digital\npatterns that are created during the design stage and they input it into the\nsoftware which allows this machine to just automatically cut the panels which\nare then shipped to the facilities where they're going to be sewing right here I\ndon't know if you guys can see the screen but it's literally showing you\nwhere it's going to be cutting next and as it's cutting it's actually vacuuming\nthe entire operation so it vacuums that in order to make sure that the seal and\nthe fabrics lay very flat so there's no differences when it's actually cut these\nrobotic cutting machines ensure every single piece is cut precisely as it\nfollows a designer's blueprint keep in mind not every factory has something\nlike this these machines make it possible to get a consistent fitting\nshirt every single time once the panels are cut they are placed on carts and\nmove to the next part of the process and so just wanted to take you guys behind\nthe scene here as we as we show you guys where this fabric is\ngoing before it's being sewn and it got my boy Brett got the man see\nright over there but guys an interesting thing that we saw here is as you can see\nright here these are actually not moving so it makes you wonder how is that\nmoving right so I wanted to show you guys something really quickly here in\nbetween these lines here there's actually lasers so there's a laser\nguided system that actually brings the fabric as soon as it crosses a path it\nactivates the new beams here so let's check this out\nmoving not moving and moving haha check this out go check this out\nbring the camera a little closer moving not moving and moving yeah this is how\nthe fabrics are transported in masses in order for them to be bundled and finally\ncut so what oh you would have thought these\ntwo crashed right now but they didn't because of the way that everything is\nbeing automated and I feel that automation in the sewing process and in\nthe manufacturing facilities such as this that's based in Los Angeles with\nAmerican workers it's it's the way well it really is the way of the future and\ncompanies like Bella canvas are able to still produce a USA strong while being\nable to sew in different countries and put out a quality product so this is the\nway that things are moving and like this fabric let's get moving over to the\nbundling stage we can show you guys how that works\nso these fabrics back here as you guys can\nis the bundling machine so it's it's making sure that the fabrics are safe as\nthey're being transported to the next facility which actually does the selling\nthem investing into these types of logistics allows them to keep a quality\nproduct from the beginning all the way until it's done the scale of this\noperation is huge guys and as you guys can see from the forklifts to the\ncutters to everybody that's that's a part of this operation it really is\nsomething that requires a huge investment in the production as well as\nthe logistics and the team behind it thousands of people are employed here in\norder to get this to actually work so you could imagine that it's it's easier\nto cut corners than it is to do things right so when a company invests in doing\nthings the right way it really makes a difference in the market and it really\nmakes a difference in the world with rap fabric ready to be transported these\ncontainers play a logistical role in transporting materials needed for\nvarious parts of the production process globally these containers travel and\ncarry mass quantities of gray's goods which come from all over the world\nwhich are then dyed in an eco-friendly way in Los Angeles a fun fact is that\nthe USA China and India produce over 50% of the world's cotton this business\nchooses to die unprocessed fabric in Los Angeles in order to reduce the\nenvironmental impact commonly associated with Daiya fabrics in other parts of the\nworld once they are cut and dyed the majority the production is transported\nto Central America where they are sewn up and shipped back to the US a\nfulfillment center since we know how fabric is being dyed and transported for\nproduction we are wondering how they ensure the sewing factors are taking\ncare of their people and environment we spoke with Xavier to get the details you\nknow Bella canvas is making sure that every factory that is part of our supply\nchain is 100% certified by ara which is a certification that is granted to\ncompanies that are fully in compliance with labor laws and regulations in the\ndifferent countries where we operate the efforts that we made to make sure that\nyou know the workers that are part of our supply chain are being treated\nfairly not only in terms of other compensation also but you know all the\nsocial benefits that they receive recently we were approve also to become\na participating company with the Fair Labor Association which is like at the\ngold standard for our industry we are in the process of certifying the entire\nsupply chain is a it's a lengthy process and it will take some time but\neventually the company will be fully activated with the VFL a North America\nis made up of multiple Latin American countries and although sewing also\noccurs outside of the USA Bella canvas promotes a USA strong initiative which\nemploys thousands of workers in the USA while also producing a line of apparel\nthat is made here in the Los Angeles facility so as you guys to see right\nhere in this sewing factory they have literally over a hundred and fifty\nemployees skilled employees actually sewing the t-shirts in right here as you\nguys can see on this stack these are the cup panels we were showing you guys\nearlier more importantly I just wanted to share with you guys some of my\nthoughts in and some of the things that happen in the factories such as this the\nskill that's required to actually do a job like this so this is my man Felix\nright here and I won't I won't disturb his work that much but as you guys can\nsee it requires very skilled thought so with that being said a lot of workers\nactually only do one part of every garment which then goes on to the next\nperson to complete it and funny enough to show you guys like how difficult it\nmight be my brother actually over here my brother actually knows how to sew and\nwe were discussing like hey are you okay so you're already making excuses do you\nthink you can do it or not alright so Felix get a mpirica ladder\ncomo la so this machine is like it's this is a Pegasus w6\nand it's very beefy so they have two needles so right out of the gate we see\nthat there's there's a reason why workers are actually focusing on one\ntask so there's a lot of little pieces to the garment and if you were to try to\nsew everything yourself you'd probably screw up the entire shirt or a won't be\nas efficient so my brother Caesar here is is skilled in this if I were to try I\nwould have probably lost my finger but look at this guy he's actually doing it what's going on here guys you're holding\nup my line we got it good thank you guys for bringing us behind the scenes here\nand our that my brother slowed down the production line now you have to get can\nyeah but but overall you guys seem to be running a really tight ship how many\nunits do you think about the canvas is producing on on any given day so about a\nweek we're showing about three million units three million t-shirts so the\naverage of about 600,000 teachers per day oh yeah that's crazy\nbut what would you say is like is one of the things that the workers here need to\nhave in order to be successful in this career how many years have they been\nsewing for so some of these people have been working with us from the beginning\nso about you know 10 15 years they've been here it's people that I come here\nevery day they're being they're been here ever since at the beginning you\nknow what type of fulfillment do you think\nthey find in the sewing do you think they need to have a passion to work in a\nfactory like this you definitely have to you definitely have to enjoy it\nbut as you can see everybody comes in here and everybody's pretty happy you\nknow not sad faces yeah yeah it's definitely something that it's part of\nour culture now you know we're a big family\nwhat's the products are sown they undergo a quality control process that\nensures every t-shirt meets their test it's pretty crazy to see that there are\nreal people working on every single t-shirt that you wear so this is one\nthat passed the test right here yeah this is one that can go out to a\ncustomer yeah definitely ready to go and I think that's the beauty of like what a\nlot of people don't get to see is the fact that even though things are being\nmass-produced there's real people are like handling\nyou're populating it and there's real love that goes into it or a real passion\nyou got to have a passion for sewing and you got to have a passion for this\nindustry in order to stay in it with what 15 years yeah so it's a lot of time\nand energy that goes into one garment and it's a lot of people that handle\nthat one garment yeah it's about from the beginning to\nthe end there's about 13 13 people that but you know the teacher goes through\ninto it's completed not counting people into distributions in there yeah\nliterally hundreds of hands are going into the making of your product that you\nget at home and I think a lot of time we do miss the fact that there is a\npersonal touch to every single garment you guys whether it's mass-produced or\nwhether it's this is could be considered handmade I mean it really is because\nsomebody's making it with their hands so with that being said I wanted to leave a\nlittle note here you think I can leave a note in this box yeah there's like made\nwith love regardless of whether the finished garments come from their\nCentral American manufacturing facilities or in LA they ultimately\narrive at the fulfillment center where they are responsible for organizing and\nshipping to distributors and brands all over the world many entrepreneurs and\nsmall businesses rely on Bella canvas and suppliers like them to stock t-shirt\nblanks that can use to sell their designs now this company doesn't stay in\nbusiness by simply selling random designs and a bigger challenge that they\nalso have is the fact that they're selling to customers of all shapes and\nsizes so design wise they have to cater to a very large market so\nwant to go ahead and actually show you guys the behind the scenes of what it\nactually takes to design for a mass markets for millions of customers all\naround the world and we're actually going to see how they choose the colors\nthat are guaranteed to sell through to a large audience let's check that out man\nright out of the gate so this is where you guys do fittings yeah this is our\nfit room we spend a few hours a week in here with models and styles and we just\nmake sure that the styles fit on our base size models the best the best we\ncan interesting what is so like as I walked\nthrough here I felt like my equilibrium was almost off because it obviously\nthere's a sound panel but we'll the purpose for a sound panel enjoy cool\nwell no this is actually the Ellsworth Kelly from 1956 it's a sound barrier\nyeah he's a California abstract painter it's actually the exactly just absorb\nsound like so we're not bouncing around the room and little easier to tolerate\neach other I thought I had like a real like I thought it was a real pain I mean\nI don't think I'd be behind a glass door if that were the case of a real pretty\ncool so this is where you guys fit your models because you guys designed for\nmillions of people different body types all right we did we tried right you try\nwe're trying our very best so so how can you walk us through how how you are able\nto do that we want to fit on multitude of body shapes and sizes we'll start\nwith a base size size medium men's for instance for a unisex t-shirt 3001 we'll\nstart with our men's medium he's our basic block and so we start\nfitting on him when we have it tuned up the way we like the way it fits the\ndrape performance will go on to the next size so we'll fit eventually a full size\nrun so if there's a small all the way to like 4 XL let's say we'll fit every\nsingle size yeah so we're trying to take those silhouettes into consideration so\nyou mentioned earlier that you like to work directly with the manufacturing\nteam so as a design director how does working with the manufacturing arm make\nsure that what you guys are creating is going to be something beneficial for the\nworld at large working on the ground level just getting to the factory we\nhave a communication line that help is build product the delicate design\nprograms that we have we try to make sure that there's no pieces in between\nour sewing and our brains or the to the design vision and the sellers are kind\nof on the same page we develop fabrics and samples we send them back and forth\nuntil we alekhya them exactly the way we see them fit in a production setting and\nthat's important to us so that's part of the reason we have that connectivity\ntissue between sewing and the design vision is that we close the gap on all\nthe pieces that would go wrong by seeing each other in person by working together\nas a team so far as that this is super detailed process they are very\nmeticulous about what they do and the whole team is here to make adjustments\nin case there's anything to be done so this isn't the first sample set that\nthey had to actually fit this is actually a rendition so what they're\ndoing is essentially making sure that it all goes to spec before it hits the mass\nproduction okay so we're just gonna run through the specs again really quick and\nlike for instance the shirt I'm wearing this is actually one of you guys is more\nlater styles so this is something that you and your team came up with yeah so\nwhat what what inspires you for new designs and how do those like how do you\nguys kind of maybe make sure that they stay in the market for a while versus it\njust being a trend yeah this might be a trend you know it's a raw edge\ntranscends like I can't say this will be in the word forever is very scary\nfashion forever don't really jive certainly so what we'll try to do is\nwhat I like to see is like make the very best styrofoam cup that you can see at\nevery single coffee station forever without it leaking it's keeping its heat\nall those other components that the Styrofoam cup would have but ours is a\nbasic t-shirt we can dress it in skin it in different ways that speak to\ndifferent trends like raw edge seam work or pockets out to the side or however we\nwant to address it the core block that you see is our crewneck sweatshirt which\nwe feel very comfortable selling to a large community people can buy them\nprint on them embellish them in that market but in this case they can buy the\nnormal crew of pullover with raw edges everywhere it's\nmay get slightly more trend forward or fashion forward it's not enough to have\na great designer fit today as consumers we need to ensure that our purchasing\ndecisions do not support things that are unethical and oppressing others\nthat's where businesses such as these are raising the standards by not only\ngiving people an amazing product but by being transparent and doing things\ndifferently from how they treat their workers to the green initiatives in\nplace that are minimizing the environmental footprint on the other\nhand there are real problems happening around the world with apparel\nmanufacturing the constant drive to compete on price in order to sell\ngarments for pennies on the dollar as a resulted in producing in unsafe\nenvironments where buildings are failing and chemicals are being spilled into the\nenvironment the way your favorite products are being made today will\ndrastically affect the way our world looks like tomorrow now as we wrap up\nthis video I hope you enjoyed the process that we shared and how to shirts\nare made in America as you guys can see this operation is huge and the brands of\nbusinesses that you support also go through a process like this now the ones\nthat are just getting started the ones in your community that friends and\nfamily are be are actually creating are able to leverage resources such as bela\ncanvases infrastructure to actually make their brands and businesses without\nhaving to spend the millions of dollars that is required to do something like\nthis but more importantly as a consumer you have the power to choose the way\nthat the products are being created you see where you spend your money is what\nultimately is gonna dictate what the market and businesses such as these\ncreate so next time you go shopping or next time you're about to consider a\nbrand keep that in mind and more importantly if you guys enjoyed this\ntype of video I highly encourage that you guys hit that subscribe button

"Consider the classic white t-shirt. Annually, we sell and buy\ntwo billion t-shirts globally, making it one of the most common\ngarments in the world. But how and where is the average\nt-shirt made, and what's its environmental impact? Clothing items can vary a lot, but a typical t-shirt begins its life\non a farm in America, China, or India where cotton seeds are sown, irrigated and\ngrown for the fluffy bolls they produce. Self-driving machines carefully harvest\nthese puffs, an industrial cotton gin mechanically\nseparates the fluffy bolls from the seeds, and the cotton lint is pressed \ninto 225-kilogram bales. The cotton plants require a huge quantity\nof water and pesticides. 2,700 liters of water are needed to produce\nthe average t-shirt, enough to fill more than 30 bathtubs. Meanwhile, cotton uses more insecticides\nand pesticides than any other crop in the world. These pollutants can be carcinogenic, harm the health of field workers, and damage surrounding ecosystems. Some t-shirts are made of organic cotton\ngrown without pesticides and insecticides, but organic cotton makes up less than 1% of the 22.7 million metric tons \nof cotton produced worldwide. Once the cotton bales leave the farm, textile mills ship them\nto a spinning facility, usually in China or India, where high-tech machines blend, card, comb, pull, stretch, and, finally, twist the cotton into\nsnowy ropes of yarn called slivers. Then, yarns are sent to the mill, where huge circular knitting machines weave them into sheets \nof rough grayish fabric treated with heat and chemicals\nuntil they turn soft and white. Here, the fabric is dipped into\ncommercial bleaches and azo dyes, which make up the vivid coloring\nin about 70% of textiles. Unfortunately, some of these contain\ncancer-causing cadmium, lead, chromium, and mercury. Other harmful compounds and chemicals\ncan cause widespread contamination when released as toxic waste water\nin rivers and oceans. Technologies are now so advanced\nin some countries that the entire process of growing\nand producing fabric barely touches a human hand. But only up until this point. After the finished cloth \ntravels to factories, often in Bangladesh, China, India,\nor Turkey, human labor is still required \nto stitch them up into t-shirts, intricate work that \nmachines just can't do. This process has its own problems. Bangladesh, for example, which has surpassed China as the world's\nbiggest exporter of cotton t-shirts, employs 4.5 million people\nin the t-shirt industry, but they typically face poor conditions\nand low wages. After manufacture, all those t-shirts\ntravel by ship, train, and truck to be sold in high-income countries, a process that gives cotton \nan enormous carbon footprint. Some countries produce \ntheir own clothing domestically, which cuts out this polluting stage, but generally, apparel production accounts\nfor 10% of global carbon emissions. And it's escalating. Cheaper garments and the public's\nwillingness to buy boosted global production \nfrom 1994 to 2014 by 400% to around 80 billion garments each year. Finally, in a consumer's home, the t-shirt goes through one of the most\nresource-intensive phases of its lifetime. In America, for instance, the average household does nearly\n400 loads of laundry per year each using about 40 gallons of water. Washing machines and dryers \nboth use energy, with dryers requiring five to six times\nmore than washers. This dramatic shift in clothing \nconsumption over the last 20 years, driven by large corporations\nand the trend of fast fashion has cost the environment, the health of farmers, and driven questionable \nhuman labor practices. It's also turned fashion into the second\nlargest polluter in the world after oil. But there are things we can do. Consider shopping secondhand. Try to look for textiles made from\nrecycled or organic fabrics. Wash clothes less and line dry\nto save resources. Instead of throwing them away\nat the end of their life, donate, recycle, or reuse them\nas cleaning rags. And, finally, you might ask yourself, how many t-shirts and articles of clothing\nwill you consume over your lifetime, and what will be their combined \nimpact on the world?", "9Ra1fswSqJE": "hey there in today's video I'm gonna show you how I use my Sawgrass creative studio software I'm going to grab an old file that I do need to press print and press on 100% cotton shirt and most of you already know that sublimation you cannot print on 100% cotton shirts but there are several ways to accomplish that my favorite one is a powder process which I'm going to show you today so I'm gonna go ahead and log on to my Sawgrass software and it's called okay I'm gonna launch it and right now it's gonna it's gonna ask me what blank design I want and I'm just gonna click Next and I'm looking for I'm gonna do a letter size US letter ate nap by 11 next it's always gonna be white sublimation there is no white so you can start with just a blank canvas and I'm gonna be printing a vertical I mean there's that on the vertical image map 11 so I'm going to start my designer I'm gonna go to my designs and I'm gonna pull an old image there's a lot of stuff I've done since I've had this sucker software for three years I guess anyway so it's perfect if I would have added too much white that would have literally see that cut into that so you don't ever want to save an image with too much white up here you know it's not gonna print but still if you covered that that's exactly what's gonna print it's gonna cut that ringside off so I'm not so I don't want it don't know what the gloves too big because it's gonna this is gonna be a crossing chest so I want it maybe maybe five inches right here it tells you it's five by I'm sorry seven by seven right now I want it maybe five inches so that it doesn't look too too big there's a shrink this too much so let's just say about five inches okay so it's five inches squared actually this is gonna be on an excel shirt let's say for next so this is an eight nap I live in print maybe we can be seven inches just go back to other seven inches let's do six and a half up here on the left corner to telling me like what the image size is okay so here's where you see the white those are called bleed lines you don't want to go over or put you don't want your image in there and it's gonna cut off you're literally gonna cut off your image it's kind of a guideline not to go over so let's do that but this is close to the top as possible do you see the bleed lines right here you don't want your image or wording in there and I want to make this as white as possible I'm staying away from the big line if you look up here hopefully you can see it so this is gonna go on an excel shirt just solid white I kind of want to make this bigger but I want this to be across the chest I thought about doing I thought about doing this making this um heat transfer vinyl so that I can make it bigger which I probably should but it's two different processes and for a freebie you don't want to spend too much time on on this process I can make it wider to make it more pronounced again I'm trying to get avoid the bleed lines if you want please comment down below your thoughts I'm just playing around with the I think that would look okay I already have one printed it was my very first one I think I don't remember what happened but somewhere along the line the I mean I didn't place the the image correctly and when you're using powder for your pressing your print on your press you have to be really careful once you place it because once you put it down because it's powder that it's soaking up the ink once you put it down that's it you have to leave it down or it's gonna mess up your humor process I think I want to leave it like that I think that looks looks okay maybe shrink it just a little bit maybe let's make it six inches I'm just trying to imagine what it will look like on an XL shirt normally I would put it that close but again we're working with a freebie right now just for the guys just gonna be using it for boxing boxing shirt okay so let's say we want to Center it I'm gonna highlight both click on object and align Center right so it's a line now so okay now so now what I'm going to do is I've been imprinted on sublimation I'm sorry the powder comes with its own toilet tone paper from SEPs and I'm gonna show you that process now I'm getting ready to print that first I want to show you I put my process my powder in this in this container it's uh it's a one and a half gallon Rubbermaid container and we're gonna have it this big is because I want to be able to fit my paper like at 1111 an 11 inch by 17 inch is the longest either way I want to I want enough room to put the paper in there and I'll show you what I'm going to do they look they did their paper just so that people know which side to print on this one had a little wine on it probably cut that out I'm gonna go ahead and use this I'll just cut that out if I don't need it and I'll show you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go ahead and stick this in mind this is my soccer X it's 200 try to face down let me stick them on print the image you do have to select which paper and because it does not give you an option for four steps in a virtuosic creative studio I've been choosing the option of I still select you know sub products and for the paper I just pick a key plot no idea what that is to be honest but it works and I keep it on high quality waiting for it to print I don't need that much powder this is gonna be plenty usually there comes a little baggie like that I don't put it back I just close the seal the literally tightly and I just leave it there until the next time I use it because ink is what if you touch it you're ruined the print so do not touch the ink just be careful and just hang on to it just just grab the edges and avoid touch them to eat I learned the hard way okay so what I'm gonna do you can still wet now grab to eat the paper and just slowly just move the the powder in there grab the ends and I'm just gonna kind of sway back and forth so there's one one time and then I did one last time and that's it I just tap it just like that I also have this little comb brush that I bought just to get any excess powder because you will have to put it under the your heat press for about 30 seconds to secure it so I'm gonna do that process now okay for the temperature settings they have to be 375 Fahrenheit 30 seconds since it's fresh off the press and still wet when you use a piece of parchment paper because there is gonna be powder in the back and that's what the brush silicone brush was for but I went ahead and use my hands just to get any excess out and I'm just gonna set it down I'm waiting for the temperature to get to three seventy-five once that's once I've reached that temperature I mean just let it hover over the image and just let it cure for 30 seconds and then from there I'm going to show you the the pressing process I didn't mention you have to use moderate pressure and it is for 30 seconds once you've done that you have to it's a cold pill so you have to wait about 40 seconds before you remove the transfer so I wanted to add that really quick before I forget this shirt appears a medium-sized shirt this was the very first shirt I print a while back I mean it's then it has been a good maybe a couple years and I can't see it and I want to take this shirt off but I have this as my sample for evening for showing people the sublimation to cutting process which is this powder process I somehow didn't place it correctly and it's it's kind of off in some areas but here didn't pick up the ink and that's why I decided to just keep this I used a sharpie pick just for so looking for display I don't know if you can see about you'll be able to see once I show you now use a sharpie see the black mark I just did that because I wanted to keep it for Show and Tell for sublimation to patent that's why I still have this plus it looks good I mean it's good to have shirts for your process for show-and-tell not what people can see the different processes that you know I would turn the camera but I don't want to have to I'm using the octopus one and I won't have to readjust it but eventually I'll show you all the shirts that I have them hanging on the walls that I use a show and tell the pressure is already at 6:56 362 which that's hot enough so for now I'm just gonna go ahead and cure my in so again it has to hover for about 30 seconds to let it cure and all it's doing is just keeping the moisture it's removing moisture and it's also curing the ink with the powder and you can feel it you can't feel it it really just feels like heat transfer vinyl okay that's about 30 seconds I didn't really count maybe about five more seconds okay so it's out don't touch it I wish I had a handle to do this I'll bring it in close I don't know if you can see it but it's kind of got a like a velvety kind of look to it I would say feel but you can't feel it but he's got a velvety look to it and if you remember a little while ago I mentioned that it had a little smudge or something on I'm gonna go to cut that out I don't want that to end up on my shirt so I'm just gonna cut it out and I'm fixing to I'm fixing to go ahead and take the moisture out of my t-shirt these are white of course this I'm gonna go into these my lint roller you still have to be careful not to touch touch the the image same thing [Music] try not to be camera I'm using a Hanes t-shirt turn it to the camera too much it's gonna move the moisture out of the t-shirt my my my tripod broke my big one my 50 inch tripod it broke got the pressure too hard I'm gonna go ahead and find my center line I'm gonna fold it in half vertically just suck and create my center line my image and I do have this and one of my videos how to find your center line has a kink in there and trying to get out I don't want that I want to get him as far as possible like I did something wrong sorry I know I'm off-camera just trying to find my centerline doesn't let me take this long and also when I look at when I'm you trying to find my centerline the caller when we slowed it in half you can feel the caller I always put the collar off of the edge of the heat press only because I don't want the I don't want the collar imprinted on the on the [Music] on the other side of the shirt if that makes any sense okay that's good for now just going to apply the pressure line to close it just to avoid the camera being so shaky okay now on you can't you can't find the you can't bend it like you normally would he transfer vinyl there you know you pinch the top and the bottom but you can't do it on these because you know you don't want to ruin the the image because it's powdered so what I've been doing there's my centerline look you can see it there you go there's my centerline and again this is an XL shirt I'm gonna do four inches I'm just gonna put a little indention with my nail and I'm gonna get the color off the press or the Putney so what I do because this is I know this is eight at eight and a half by eleven I just find the four and a half inch mark with my ruler or my tape measure normally what I do and I do this way before time I just get it like an exact don't know if you can't use a pen or marker of course you don't want that on his shirt I just he's a either an exacto knife or I'll just mark it with the scissors I know it seems like a lot of different steps but for me it's worth it I'm just gonna make a little make a little mark with my scissors again the wrong reason I'm doing that is because I don't want to touch it and I'm just gonna make little Mark's and just to show you my markers right there my scissor mark so four and a half inches plus another one of inches actually I'm more fiction is I don't wanna to off okay so right there right there right doesn't have to be perfect but that's just me okay and the reason you want to do this is because it's powder once you put it down that's it there's no turning back but regardless I still love this process because I'm able to print on one or any cotton-blend shirt okay so I've got my mark I'm gonna line these up with the center line that I created okay so once they're fine cinnamon I just drop it very carefully and I do use um parchment paper for this for sublimation you do not want to use Teflon sheets because it will pick up any of the ink and I will you will transfer that to your next substrate so I always use parchment paper when I'm working with sublimation okay so we're gonna do 30 seconds and then we have to wait 40 seconds before we can remove the transfer to the transfer paper so we have about seven seconds left if you want to share what process you use for sublimation please drop that below so we can share information maybe I can give you some tips that you have any questions please feel free to drop your questions down below you have to wait 40 seconds I'm not gonna need this because that's the cup steps instructions I'm gonna wait about 40 seconds turn it's been 40 seconds and it is Coquille I hope you can see this I want to call the image when I press it one more time just so I can remove these lines this is a civil mission - cotton okay I hope this video was helpful feel free to ask questions and I look forward to producing more videos for you thank you for watching until the next time", "LT9ov3rzVIc": "your business is booming your bands on tour that family reunion you

basic economy shirts two your mid-level premium shirts three your high-end tri blends basic economy shirts I'm 6 foot tall 185 pounds and I wear a large of the basic shirts we sell all the brands and styles are pretty much the same standard fitting true to size and about the same 5 ounce cotton weight getting one instead of the other because you're looking for better quality is like going to Burger King instead of McDonald's it's a little different you might have a preference but it's kind of the same thing how dare you don't listen to a Big Mac baby flame-broiled Maia for basic 100% cotton shirts we mostly sell the Gildan 5000 some substitutes include the Hanes 50 to 80 and the jerseys three six three four basic blends we mostly sell the Gildan 8000 for a substitute the jerseys 29 m or the Hanes 51 70 blends are usually a 50/50 mixture of polyester and cotton make my own blend a little bit of cotton a little bit of poly and so you might be asking what's the difference between a basic blend and a basic cotton tee cotton has more breathability and comfort but it's more likely to lose shape and color with repeat washings the polyester and blends makes them stronger hold shape and better for athletic activities all of these shirts have preshrunk cotton but if you don't follow your care instructions and just cram it into the dryer which is what most people do they're going to shrink I ain't wash my clothes anyhow and I ain't got a wife that does it for me either if you're worried about shrinking your best bet would be to get a blend a lot of times people are afraid to get basic shirts they call them cardboard shirts got this for cheap scratchy and starchy not wrong with a little starch they aren't that bad by any means they have a purpose they're budget-friendly shirts good for work and giveaways if they get ruined it doesn't hit your wallet as hard they're also better if you prefer a loose-fitting shirt or if you have a larger build maybe you're a big dude you even lift bro and you don't want some fancy fitted shirt with soft cotton maybe you want to roll your cigs up in that unfitted sleeve and listen to the boss Tipton worth mentioning some of the brands offer even thicker versions of their 100% cotton tees like the Gildan 2000 or the Hanes 50 180 beefy t be fair these are gonna be a bit tougher and I recommend them alongside the blends for contractors but keep in mind it's still a shirt sometimes we feel like customers are looking for a magical shirt that's flame resistant stain resistant stab resistant unfortunately the quest for the magical unicorn shirts have a field of course because they do not exist there's no shame in getting the basic shirts the best way to describe them is they're just regular shirts I recommend considering the basic shirts just think about your needs and they might be the right pick mid-level premium shirts I still wear a large you'll see the words combed ring-spun cotton which is a manufacturing process that makes them thinner softer and stronger usually these are fitted to these are the shirts people would generally rather wear because they're more comfortable than the basic shirts being fitted they also look more flattering for a lot of people and they're a little bit more trendy trendy they will last longer they will make you look good for 100% cotton we mostly sell the next level 3600 and for a substitute we usually sell the Bella 3000 and one for a blend we mostly sell the next level 6,200 and for a substitute the Bella 3650 these shirts cost more but you can generally get into this style for about 80 cents to a dollar more than a basic tee that's less than extra cheese on your pizza extra cheese is two dollars again I recommend trying them out to see if the right for you [Music] talk to your tribe lense Oh what the hell's he talking about blend I still wear a large as the name implies it's a blend of three materials generally cotton polyester and rayon making them the thinnest and the softest they're fitted like the mid-level premium shirts except the rayon gives them a unique drape does the carpet match the drapes tri blends usually don't come in solid colors I'm not gonna say they never do instead they usually come in Heather colors Heather's a girlfriend once I think her name was Heather here you can see the difference between a solid black and a tri-blend black these shirts are very fashion-forward trendy we mostly see them used for clothing lines small or personal runs of tees athletic based companies businesses that aren't contractor based but even contractors might throw in a couple of these as nicer shirts to wear when they're not working the brand we sell the most the next level 6010 for a substitute the belle of 3413 see starting at two dollars and sixty five cents more than a basic shirt you generally don't want to ruin these as work shirts or use them as a giveaway 265 more tell me how to spend my money I'll make it rain crap that was a tenner again I recommend trying them out to see if they're right for you you can always get a mix of shirt styles in one order they don't all have to be the same style or brand also you can order blank samples before you place a print order these are shirts that I wanted to bring up because I want you to know about them but they don't really fit in the other tiers I'll call them hybrids not talking about no Toyota Prius first up is the Gildan h zero zero zero hammer shirt this is a regular fitted shirt manufactured like a premium shirt it's thick combed ring spun cotton so it's a soft strong shirt that's standard cut and true to size instead of being fitted next up is the jersey 601 mr tri-blend it's standard fit true to size but it's a try blend lastly 100% polyester shirts they are often billed as dry fit ClimaCool cool dry dry power dry Sport active and performance shirts they have wicking properties which are essentially Littlejohn wicks that fight off moisture by absorbing it and drawing it away from your body of course really good for athletics in the sports ball go to the shirt I recommend most is the a four and 3142 let's do a quick review the cheapest option the 100% cotton standard cut Gildan 5000 worried about shrinking need something a little stronger try a blend the Gildan 8,000 take it up a notch with a premium fitted cotton tee like the next level 3600 need a blend try the next level 6200 if you want the feel and breathability of cotton the strength and wicking properties of polyester the special drape and comfort of rayon the thinnest and softest shirt tri next level 60 10 tri-blend so there you have it upstate merch is most sold types of t-shirts and brands there are tons of other brands and options

upstate to downtown come", "TyoU3mKwd6g": "over the last three months I only wore three shirts this one from Patagonia that I bought for $50 this one from ever lane that I bought for 30 and this one that I bought from Walmart for a whopping $6 in this video we're gonna figure out whether or not they're worth the money that I bought them for hey team welcome back to another Levi's save the world Hildebrand episode the channel where we prove that you don't need to be a hero to save the planet today I'm going to be comparing a Patagonia ever lain and Jorge t-shirt to see if the price that you pay for a t-shirt actually impacts the quality of the product itself this video is a part of a series where I do challenges and experiments to test out sustainability practices in real life I boycotted Black Friday and Cyber Monday I only ate uber eats for two entire weeks and most recently I documented my experience living without a car in North America for an entire year this video like all of those other videos is brought to you by my patreon supporters on patreon I post exclusive behind-the-scenes updates on these challenge videos and everything else that I'm working on in addition to that you get to see a secret podcast that I release every single month where I talk about sustainability stories in the news and my own personal journey here on this channel trying to reduce my environmental impact so if you're interested in any of that or you just want to support this channel head down to the description to check it out for yourself but here in this video we are going to be breaking down my experience only wearing three shirts for 90 days every single day for 90 days straight so right off the top I have to acknowledge that this is not a mathematical experiment in any sort of way but I did take some measures to try and keep this as fair as possible all of the shirts that I'm comparing are made of a hundred percent cotton they were all made outside of North America and all of these shirts were worn and washed the exact same number of times see I even kept this tally my phone I wore them all in pretty similar conditions from riding my bike around town working out to working all day sitting at a computer I watched them in full loads of laundry and dried them in an open-air drying rack upstairs but one quick note about washing probably a whole bunch of you just thought to yourselves wait 30 wears and 5 washes that means Levi's Wars shirt like 9 times without washing it and I would say that you're wrong because 30 divided by 5 is 6 but the point is yeah I don't wash my clothes very often because you really don't have to in fact I bought that pair of jeans right there 4 months ago and I still haven't watched them yet [Laughter] Leah you love this stuff way too much the reality is washing your clothes is one of the fastest ways to wear them out these three t-shirts would have been in way worse condition if I was washing them with warm water and drying them in a drying machine rant summary you probably don't need to be washing your clothes as often as you are save the planet your wallet and your clothes by just washing with cold water and air drying but anyways let's go s see what happened for the final evaluation of these shirts I based it off of three very random criteria that I invented for the purpose of this video number one is fit does this shirt actually fit me the way that I wanted it to when I bought it in the first place and does it look bad generally number two is wear and tear does the fabric itself seem to have broken down at all as appealing as it stretched out etc and number three is cost does it seem to be worth the money that I spent on the shirt after 30 days of using it well let's start with the most expensive so full disclosure for the sake of this video I love Patagonia I think that they're an incredible company I made a whole video about them and what they do in a video a couple years back when I look like I actually worked for them I'm probably not going to grow my hair it again if that's a word for some people so don't unsubscribe just based on that alone the fit of this shirt has honestly been one of my favorites of the three begin with I know that this is very different and very subjective because every shirt fits every person differently but this cut just seems to really work for my body type wear and tear this shirt has held up extremely well once you get a really nice close-up on the fabric itself you can see that it has been used but the material has retained its shape and retained its fabric integrity really really well for the most part this shirt looks pretty well the same as when I got it 30 warez ago now in terms of cost for me the Patagonia was a very expensive shirt fifty dollars for a t-shirt that's just cotton in today's world seems crazy because that's often ten times the price of what you can get a similar looking gray t-shirt for but this has held up extremely well for that dollar value part of the reason why this shirt is so expensive is because Patagonia is a leader in socially an environmentally responsible fashion but we're gonna get into that later in the video let's move on to ever lane now full disclosure I made a video debunking ever lanes claims to be radically transparent but they are a higher-end brand and therefore they should in theory have a higher quality product fit and feel honestly I love the fit of this shirt as well it's been always quite nice and tight and slimming the only thing that's slightly different from the Patagonia is the fact that it feels like a lighter shirt the material seems to be I don't know how else to put it a lighter it feels like there's less shirt on me right now and that's not necessarily a bad thing but it does feel slightly cheaper wear and tear because it does feel like a slightly lighter material it does have a bit more wear and tear to it you can see some of the fabric coming away at some of the seams but really not that much considering that I've worn it thirty different times number three cost now for 30 bucks I would say that this is a good value shirt it looks good after 30 different wares and it costs less than the Patagonia it doesn't feel like quite the same quality of a shirt but overall I think it's a good value now speaking of value let's see what we get out of a six dollar shirt how is it even possible to design produce manufacture and distribute a shirt for six dollars it honestly baffles me but the outcome is pretty predictable fit and feel this shirt never fit me as well as the first two shirts did but you can obviously see that it's just a bag your shirt maybe this is to appeal to more people but it's clear that over time the shirt has just lost some of its shape now this shirt isn't ripped or destroyed in any way or dirty but I am not very excited to wear this shirt because of the condition that it's in after only 30 wears and honestly this shirt was starting to look used after about 20 wares or so wear and tear even without looking too closely you can tell that this shirt is old it's been worn and you can obviously see that all over the shirt even without looking too closely you can see that there's peeling happening throughout the shirt not just on high rubbing areas there also seems to be some weird discoloration going on around the collar number three cost now for six dollars it's hard to say whether or not it's worth it because it costs less than a burger at McDonalds I mean I guess with that in consideration the fact that it lasted even half as long as the others is impressive but like I said at the beginning how does a shirt like this even exist for $6 farmers had to grow crops materials had to be processed designs had to be created final products shipped delivered marketed and then sold to you for $6 now this is really where price starts to come into play because these shirts not only reflect the quality of the products themselves but the values that the companies that made them try to uphold except for like dolce gabbana and supreme and all that other crap you're literally just paying for the brand name in those cases so I realized while I was editing this video that you can really tell the differences between these shirts super well so I thought I would add in another test to illustrate the differences between these shirts that no one could possibly deny a blindfold taste test well no not at eight like a feel a field test you're gonna get blindfolded now okay go upstairs good there's the stairs wow you're really good at walking blindfolded holy smokes god I wish there was a cooler surprise then here's the first one okay second one okay okay yes here's the stretch test some give the bottom doesn't feel very nice though this feels kind of Pilli it doesn't have as much give still stretchy this one has more stretch than the last one but I don't know if it has as much stretch this one's the most stretchy this is the gorge one this is ever lame this is Patagonia no how did you do that they feel different this one feels kind of chilly in a bit rough okay this one feels this one almost feels a bit like creamier butter people know what I mean and this one's like an in-between I got a right though yeah that's really good those awesome I found that super interesting because without being able to see what she was touching Leah somehow managed to pick them all right I mean I'm not staging this I definitely could have but it didn't somehow she picked exactly the right ones based on yeah can I wear it yeah sure if you want alrights mine now so what's the difference between a 50 a 30 and a $6 t-shirt the companies that created them I chose these three companies very specifically for this challenge because they represent the spread of fashion options available to most consumers we have Patagonia which is a known social and environmental advocate ever Lane which has marketed themselves as an environmentally responsible company but they're not and Gorge that basically couldn't give a about the state of the earth now I've got to be really honest I was super nervous about this challenge because I was mortified that my fifty dollar Patagonia t-shirt was going to be basically the same as a six dollar equivalent unfortunately that's not the case now as you know I'm probably biased I think the Patagonia is an outstanding company because there are very few companies of its size in the fashion industry that have done as much as they have for the sake of people and the planet but right now we're going to talk about this shirt specifically it is the only one out of the three that uses fair trade sewing practices that means that the people who made this shirt likely made a fair wage for the country that they live in they're also the only one that makes all of their t-shirts out of organic cotton a material that is far better for the planet but this shirt is also a Patagonia t-shirt and I bought it three years ago and it's still in pretty awesome condition ever lain actually makes a pretty good t-shirt which I was resentfully happy to see unfortunately their claims of radical transparency greatly mislead a lot of people into thinking that they're more sustainable than they are instead of third party certification through Fairtrade sewing they simply link you to the place where your garment was made but unfortunately none of this can be confirmed because unlike Patagonia they are not a register B corporation but this is not a takedown video about ever Lane I already made that video but all in all I would say that you're paying in part for a slightly higher quality product but also for the idea that you're supporting an ethical clothing company I really wanted to like ever Lane and finally George the crown jewel of the fast fashion industry imagine all of the horror stories that you've heard about fast fashion and that's this puppy right here unfortunately this has become normal unfortunately we kind of proved that you get what you pay for a $6 shirt doesn't last very long so obviously I would love for us all to just buy those really expensive Patagonia shirts because they are the ones that are making a fashion model that works for us and the planet but I understand that not everybody can spring for a $50 t-shirt personally I own a number of Patagonia shirts but I bought them over a period of time I purchased them when I had the means to and when I could find them on sale the beauty of Patagonia and higher quality brands is that if you can find them used they're probably still going to be in very good condition for exactly the reasons that we just outlined here today but the best option is always to find secondhand clothing if you can and support the environmentally focused companies that are out there if that isn't available but I want to thank you for watching this video I don't want to hear your feedback I'm going to be making more videos where I do experiments and challenges to test different environmental practices and so if you have any suggestions please leave them down in the comments below and of

canvas site now this is the deal to buy shirts\nhere you need to be a qualified decorator that's a screen printer and\nReuter er or you sell promotional products or you're a brand a legitimate\nbrand

the long-awaited white t-shirt testing basics thank you so much for your patience with me when filming this one I've done 10 t-shirts in this it's taking quite a long time to get through them all and now yeah they're all playing white t-shirt they're all crew net they're all short sleepe they're all in a size small or equivalent of so I can UK eight or European 36 or whatever all a size small the price margin if this is relatively narrow now the reason for that is that most brands t-shirt price comes at a similar point although they're all around the 10 to 20 pound mark and then what's gonna do really expensive on an ordered a really expensive one this one from James purse which I ordered of Selfridges which was an whopping seventy five pounds I don't know if you can see that that and and I'm sending this back I'm not reviewing this one I'll tell you about it now but I'm not reviewing it because it is see-through and frankly feels like the worst of them all sheiva 20 Hannah's 399 and this feels cheap as a touch so I don't want to wear it and wash it and then not be able to return it when I know this is just not worth that much money so I wanted to mention it in this capacity and just say do not go and spend 75 pounds on this t-shirt and then just also show you that I had bought an expensive one but the reasoning behind is not having a really huge price roads I can normally would so the most expensive one is now going to be 35 pounds instead so everything in this video is really affordable and basically yeah I don't recommend Jones purse t-shirts or going to spend 75 pounds on something hoping you can see there's just like thin cheap see-through just not nothing special and I'm sure it'll just be a hundred percent cotton 100% supima cotton nearly all of them are hundred percent cotton that we have here so that's that now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to try them all on now with them on just tell you the sizing the fabric material the brand and the price the first impression segment it's gonna come as I've been wearing them all I want to try and make this video as short as possible so to avoid any repetition I'm not talking about my first impressions now also been wearing them already so it wouldn't be first impressions and and instead we'll go and as I'm wearing as a warn each of them are giving you my face impressions throughout the past two weeks I've been filming this and then as always I'm gonna watch them all together all in an identical wash and then we shall come together at the end and see which one we think is the winner but yeah what 10 t-shirts here so this is gonna be quite fast snappy informative for this section okay but this time I'm gonna show you them all untucked because I've been waiting topped in throughout the week so that you seem different and I'm not gonna wear a bra throughout this video because I never wore a bra anyway and that's how I would wear them going forward in real life but also and it's going to be a complete level playing field and how they look and how they feel can we just not make any comments about the fact I'm not wearing a bra this is an informative video and the fact that sometimes you can see my nipples for video does no way negate change or influence and information anyway so I just wanted to acknowledge it in terms of how we're making this and even review and leave it that so first up it H&M this is their 399 t-shirts this is a size small this is 95% cotton and 5% a last day from the divided range and this one was requested quite a lot for me to review because it's 399 and H never sort known for having a lot of t-shirts at that price point and so yes H net three pound 99 in a size small 95% cotton 5% last day moving up one is a sauce this was six pounds it's 100% cotton and I have this in a UK sized eight excuse it's very very very boxy posing I literally feel like I look like an emoji or sim waiting to be dressed or picked or something and but yeah a sauce size eight six pounds 100% cotton is our next one do a quick spin spin spin and next we're one up again one week day now at eight pounds also hundred percent cotton in a size small where possible if the t-shirt obviously the specific ones will be linked in the description box some of them have specific names to them this one has a name I can't remember it right now but why most of all I will link the names mention the names in the description box or on the screen now as well so that you if you're going in store you know which ones to ask for is opposed to shopping online so yet weekday eight pounds size small and next up on to you look close from the Uniqlo you range it was nine pound 90 and it is a size small and it's also a hundred percent cotton Uniqlo you if definitely available on store I can lie in store and online so yeah Uniqlo nine pound 90 hundred percent cotton size small okay but the halfway point here this is Topshop this was 10 pounds is in a size small and is so no this is they call this a size extra small small so they do them this t-shirt of bracket so then it was medium to large I think the small medium X this is extra small to small and is a hundred percent cotton Topshop 10 pounds well they're all going to be covered in makeup now after this as well this one is very oversized as we can see I'm a bit closer as well yeah top this top shop that's number five next is this selected firm this was highly requested as a brand this was 15 pounds size small also 100% costume it's a brand that I think is completely new to me I don't think I've had anything from them before but this specific t-shirt came up a lot that selected fab I just don't know why I'm doing this impose I'm really sorry I'm trying to make it as box it was unflattering as possible for them also you can like really see the shape before you see them styled up throughout the rest of it but I'm sort of walking like a robot to do it and selected Pham 15 pounds 100% cotton size small okay coming in at the exact same price point we have cause here this is also in a size small also 15 pounds also 100% cotton and let's just go quickly go back to the symposium they are and how difficult this is going to be to differentiate from them all so that was course 15 pounds so small and they way they're sizing never says small what they're sizing easily correctly on the screen now this might actually say size 36 as opposed to a small so listen to Watson written on the screen here but the cause 100% cotton 15 pounds okay we've got Evelyn here now this isn't dollar so it was 16 dollars so put it in the price in this price bracket for what I paid for it but it would convert to a bit less in pounds but then the shipping is more because it's coming from America so I'm kind of confident that it needs to be in position number 8 price-wise even though a little for currency but yeah this is Evelyn this is also size small and 100% cotton and everything is obviously a sustainable and ethical brand the others are not so yeah every Lane 16 dollars and we'll write the conversion on the screen now but do bear in mind shipping if you uk-based if you're America based I'm not sure well there should be like sixteen dollars size small 100% cotton right second from the top price wise minute and other stories this is 23 pounds I have a size 36 which is the size I always go for and then and it's also 100% cotton surprise surprise it's only been there and H&M one which isn't on there was that cost her I think from me trying order through the face of it you can see the difference the elastic makes it is kind of a t-shirt that's meant to be a bit different I would say because of that anyway yeah this was under the story's 23 pounds size thirty-six hundred percent cotton last one now and our final most expensive one is our kept this was 35 pounds and I have this I forgot chef size on the label it's the size small equivalent again it will be written oh yeah it is a size small European small and it is put their labels were complicated very aesthetically pleasing but not helping you right now this is all 96% cotton 4% elastane this is 35 pounds now arquette do do a cheaper t-shirt haven't always gone for what the cheapest t-shirt is available and they do a more basic one and which I can't under the price of it but just to make that clear I really want us to test this one out and I'd be interested to know you can tell at this point already which ones you guys think look and feel similar I can tell but I don't know if that's because it's on my skin but this is very similar to one of the ones we've tried on earlier in terms of how it feels and so yeah this was our kept 35 pounds 96% cotton 4% the last day so similar composition to the cheapest one interesting mm-hmm and and yes that's all of them were now just going to go straight to the next segment of me wearing them throughout the past couple of weeks before we do fine all use day and night and for the evening I've had on my system denim jeans churches robes the Uniqlo white t-shirt and our cat silk shirt and historic blazer now let me delay us so we can discuss the t-shirt so as I said at the beginning of this had got them all on the sides more for ease of comparison which doesn't necessarily mean it's the perfect size that makes sense so I come a recommendation for this you've got big boobs size up just because it's really tight not comfortably - I have not been noticing it when it is tight and tight and I like aesthetically I'd say through the season under the armpits that's because it pulls at my boobs so if you've what changes true to size bigger boobs hundred-percent size up now I like these enough to say that I would go and purchase it again in it's good enough to work spending the money twice I think that it's really nice thick cotton and look good roots neckline of it and it's a thick cotton without being stiff in the center it's got a texture to it this is just the best way that I can describe it in nipples wouldn't rub on this t-shirt that's like something that Linda's message me about t-shirts of the day and it's such a good way to think of a certain t-shirt and sometimes with the really stiff cotton ones are aesthetically white a lot that can sometimes be a bit uncomfortable if you're not bra wear like I am and also as I said I'm not gonna work brass throughout this video just again that would comparison purposes we can and so yeah I think it's got a great structure to it it's really nice and soft while being really thick and love the collar on it and wish the sleeves were a bit bigger and just a bit longer but I think going size up would do that purpose for me and if you were flat chested you would feel like I just have more space here than I do anyway so that's my advice on this move a little bit t-shirt it's all coming down thickness in the fabric the field that makes this one so good so definitely recommend and would purchase in the medium hey hey hey guys I am just going to raise you up a bit higher I've had on today the selected famine 1000 that I picked one last night actually I'm sort of was just many areas to expound Church Road sweet deck jeans and this ocean under the story's leather bar and then the selected fan t-shirt now to compare this closer to the unit level because that's um you know size-wise the smaller this fits me better than the Uniqlo it definitely has more space into the armpit you think you've got big boobs you could silver for small increases more because the cotton is definitely thinner in the end and then they do declare one I haven't been on any of the it definitely has more creasing in it and it is it feels slightly soft and I think that's just again because it's a slightly thinner cotton but the text from it's almost identical just thinner and then the Apple is rose well my guess it doesn't have that starchiness to it or anything like that but still manages to be thick and the color on this is also really nice but the the Uniqlo I keep saying the wrong word the Uniqlo one that we compared it to is a slightly thicker on the neckline and this is I don't know if that's gonna make much sense but they've both got a nice ribbed neckline but the Unicoi one was just a bit chunkier and felt like more of a feature with it and all of this is a really great t-shirt overall I would say it's come here and it fits slightly more oversized and Uniqlo definitely longer through the body as well so probably a better sizing me because of having big boobs if I have to say which one I prefer think Uniqlo one just do the thickness of the cotton feels a bit nicer but that was down to my personal preference of why I like a t-shirt this I think is a really good fit to it and it's really soft and everything to been around spinning around and kind of Topshop on stage Fashion Week white it's weekday and cardigan from the mayor and the Topshop t-shirt this one is a lot bigger than the rest just speaker means better in some cases potentially but maybe not in a white t-shirt and it is very very boxy which already like it's been very comfortable and feel wise this it is and like a similar thickness to the Uniqlo one I'd say but it's not got the same smoothness to it has a slightly one off the texture but I think because the oversize nity is still very very very comfy and I almost feel like I have important that such similar as either to that war because the bagginess makes me heart it makes it hard for me to compress it in the same way and because it's meant to go up size basically but I really like it in great chopped into jeans because of the shape and as I said really move comfortable and the neckline it's nice and stuff again the Uniqlo one sort of has better detailing on it for things like this but I think this is a really really really good white t-shirt and I think one you know just to wear like this in spring/summer with white jeans on normal denim jeans the bagginess of it and the site details of what the pinned sleeves while this mainly gives it an unfair advantage because it's not identical to the others it's something which i think is a nice little added extra styling wise is the Massimo Dutti I'm Jackee a jumper from jigsaw and stories like trousers Gucci loafers belt big out I've no next time fooling with comparing everything in this video that's so how do we see the light and it's like the price is also similar it's it's so fast to know what detail so this one feels the most delicious let them walk so far today do you know more that's pumping out the stick it's really different to the rest top shop on HSN today and Uniqlo molitor's and its thickness and the feel of it and this is a really lush crouch down familiar a much lighter weight fabric than the Uniqlo wore like I said it's probably actually this one probably feels a finish so far from honest and we're off again sorry about that so yes and this will probably feel that it's finished out of all the ones I've tried so far and probably the least expensive basically it feels like because this do excuse how tight I look right now but yeah it's a great t-shirt but I wouldn't say and you know everything obviously always gets burning point of a budget sustainable but this especially compares the quality of smoothies I've got anything out there in spectacular whatsoever and yeah not no one fastness when I would say it would definitely directly recommend the \u00fanico one more for sure and this one still feels differently actually a long as the H no one is so much tight and have more stretch in it but it just just doesn't feel particularly arduous in any way I would say which is the most expensive one and I just have been out all day with various outfits like this morning back in the Gucci loafers you know me when I something I like I really just stick with it for a while hence these being on so constantly weekday sea otter jeans it my sleeveless ravely you how much make cardigan now this is the most similar now this is the most similar to the unit plan warning terms how it feels the texture is almost identical and say it feels the task think I just feel bit once that's it I don't know if it warrants the reminding is it 20-pound high stiffness that we've got which is a huge sum of money but within this video says you know our price range is so tight and so yeah texture wise it's definitely the most similar to the Uniqlo one it's got a really similar neckline to it and the sleeves are much better than much longer sleeve it's not got the same tightness over the boobs and everything like the Uniqlo one did and so the fate of it is better and yes I would gladly spend thirty five pounds this t-shirt basically I think if you are flat-chested or if I got a medium in the Uniqlo one I'll go for that one over it but that's not said I don't think this one feels like it's worth the money and but it is incredibly more special but I think it is just as smooth simple tasty softball structure without being rough and which is a really nice texture basically and the long sleeves on this thinkin's summer means I'm going to wear it more like I said I can go what a medium or a large going at the man's walk the purpose of this video comparing it to the ones I've got either sack small I think of an intended whale is going forward however because they're so similar you know gets the recommendation of war because it's different enough to warrant what is making this the most expensive one in this video but it doesn't mean that with this for I've passed it that's such a conflict in review I really hope that makes some sense basically I think it's a great t-shirt yes I think it's worth those five pallets of a get up against a tough competition and I think you could save twenty pounds still have a similar styling and t-shirt experience but yeah obviously recommend the Gucci loafers as well these are coming out the most recommended thing in this bloody video [Music] t-shirt wearing it with you can plan cosmetic cardigans sneaky layer taupe traveling and jacket Jesus or trousers and there's broke a belt on frankly just got very much [Music] disheartened saying it but every day I'm like no say about them this one feels different to the are cat and handled stories sorry that are can you declare one it's thinner than the Topshop one it's nicer than H number one one actually it has a nice smooth texture to it to me quite smooth texture to it it's a very classic fit I mean the small fits really well we're going to each size and I actually think this is a very nice like basic fitting t-shirt I want to say neckline nice and thick but not as like chunky feeling is the Uniqlo in arquette but it's kind of in keeping with the thickness of the rest of the t-shirt it's very soft it's not to see through more seasons the others and yeah I really like it I really like it and I recommend this want to help this is so difficult so I think every person rationalize and try one of these on so I'm hoping that once I get basically what I'm going to do is edit this section video before I film I can fill my final thoughts to refresh my memory of them all and then hopefully this final section this is giving a bit more concise but these are also similar so this way I'm just going to recommend to not eh no one but the water from that in terms of whichever surface that's like who I've seen is going because they're all so similar so what's the points that he found more up any more than you need to apart from a computer or iPad hey guys excuse me but to look like very well today I'm just having one of those rough days and I hope on the Animus tour today just with an anniversary is currently at my to ten genes handsome man slip ons earlier just barefoot round house and now I very much like t-shirt like all the others producing refresh my memory the prices come all of this is the second most expensive one and I think it's actually far too similar to the cause one the weekday one they're all part of the same group is all these are partly H&M group and for it to warrant the price difference between there and do you think comparing this to that are kept on the I can't one does feel a lot more expensive so that I price of that just feel more justified then this one compared to all of good ones and I do immensely playing things have got a nice oversized fit to it even though this is a size eight and it's a really soft and lovely t-shirt but it just feel quite similar to like I said because one and maybe less so we don't feel a little bit more structured but like the selected famine 1 which in number 15 powers and so ya know basically this one I don't really see why this is 23 pounds compared to those are the ones so you know under the story's not getting the most shining review which is absolutely you know so not especially from the stories you guys got like the biggest photo that rant and but yeah II just don't see why this one needs to be twelve pounds more no that was wrong maths fifteen eight pounds more and we're talking you know we've small amounts of money here but I need to be this picky with it oft white eight pounds model Soviet ones but still a booty show this morning in read jeans Gucci loafers and to the stories jumper at H&M t-shirt this one is very different to the race it is a much stretches skinnier material now aesthetically that makes me like a less like I've said it several times throughout this video by that and do you prefer a looser fitting kind of style of t-shirt and that's not to said there is no place for this sort is showing in the wardrobe it's a really good layering piece if you've got boobs it is gonna stretch over your boobs like a bit as you can see I'm not gonna brown on us always but this would be hard t-shirt to wear a bra anyway you're either going to see you nipples if you don't you good to see ya I don't promise you have a really good t-shirt bra and so yeah this is much probably my least favorite this is also the cheapest well this was three ninety-nine and because of the tightness of it makes me feel like that looks the cheapest but I do also think hmmm how I think this admission is when they do in this one was specifically requested me to review and but maybe it might have like a size large in this it would make me not feel like it looks as cheap it is literally just the tightness in my and perception of a t-shirt when it which isn't necessarily what you guys would think as well and yeah like I said I think it's a good piece to have any water for a layering piece I think that I wish the neckline was a bit tighter and closer because then I would get a lot more worried about it as a layering top so to put under like crewneck jumpers and things the next bit - Scooby to show up over a jumper and so yeah while it would be the load is against again I have my list here 399 or a source we not worn that one yet but six pounds of the 204 it's of interesting to see whether the tick the box for me and the fabric is really nice it's just got a lot more stretch in it than either one and but you can feel that way if it wasn't so try as well hey guys on the weekday t-shirt today sorry the blazer is from I kinda just got no cashmere hoodie I saw a jeans weekday through some churches my belts a vintage Chanel one and then we did t-shirt which one studies in the will with this because it's so similar to the cause one similar to the end of the stories walk back think I prefer the neckline of this one so similar to the Cosmo not going to recommend this one over it because it's cheaper a sauce nice that it's nice and eh no more knots think it's the uniform of the arc at one very similar to the selectmen ones so again I recommend this more because it's cheaper and so yeah I think this one the Utica and I've had kind of catch mm some ways she probably tell you throughout this video in terms of all the others which she was raised in my life so far I'd say this one's a winner fits really well this leaves our nice length and that clients lovely and it's cheaper than all the others it's the tubing at 15 pounds nice there the other way one yeah it's really hard to do today but this one really like it feels like the right thing it's bit cheaper and and it does have the nice ribs neckline that we keep talking about how oh god I fell over that we mean it's just wait did you see that jiggle yeah the yellow it's just a nice thick and everything tick-tock boxes basically so we get we don't come into it I'm very much into these jeans at the Seattle ones by the way okay guys rusty shirt with a salon which does have toothpaste our neck so that's nice but yes similarly to and we have attained for BuzzFeed a this is a nice teacher it feels like we don't know the stories wanna feel that depend on that whole get to feel all incredibly similar so I'm just gonna stop repeating myself now put them in the wash in sauce that's hope to god but warnings drastically so I have some clearer I do into this video as to what I want to say and not I'm not to go anything about it because this is such as there are certain is so difficult to differentiate or more and when yeah this in the end engineers and judge roads and and that is the last t-shirt I never see a white t-shirt again over too soon okay guys we are now at the end I have washed every single t-shirt unfortunately none of them fell apart in the washer so unfortunately because it would have given me a really clear distinction between some of them which is what I'm struggling with at the moment there's been the hardest testing basis ever done for this reason it has been such a level playing field the price range has been quite narrow the fact is a white t-shirt there's not much disparity between them all anyway it has been so so so hard and even going through them now I am struggling and I just rewashed the whole thing what I've edited up to this point trying to look at like how they fit how and they're so similar like some are slightly more oversized the top shot one's got a bit more going on with it but then kind of gives it an unfair advantage some of the sleeves look a bit nicer but that's such a personal preference and deciding that it's so difficult and they all basically styling wise will do the same thing and the H&M one is the only one that is a little bit different and like I said during the video I feel like it's meant to be a bit different I am gonna review it in line with all the others if that makes sense um so yeah I've done my best to order them but my general thing is that if there's a brand that you've seen in this you feel like you have a particular brand loyalty to whatever reason like either you find that a little stories always pitching you your body type great or I am ever laying always fits your body type great or you come to the shopping sustained delay or something then going with whatever one your brand loyalty lies with because they're all great there's been nothing wrong with any of them really and they were washed fine they would all I think last while and yeah there's none that I'm like apart from the generous person which we've talked about at the beginning and so yeah I have put them in order but that is my general view if there's a brand loyalty and and then I'm gonna go straight against that cuz I've actually thought the end of the store is one in last place and you guys know how much I absolutely adore under the stories of the brand it's my favorite high street brand comes down this jumpers and all the stories actually and and they were all of the time and just absolutely adore it and and there's nothing wrong with this t-shirt whatsoever the fit of it is great it's really nice and soft and texture-wise I'm like feeling them all at once now there's not there's not one that stands out it's incredibly soft I mean normally if it wouldn't be because it's not my kind of a t-shirt it would make it kind of a lot looser and have a bit less structure to it and I think previously I've done t-shirts where I can barely use American Vintage warm oh it's almost like a sloped t-shirt which isn't my edit like that they do all feel really similar and they're all soft and comfortable how does this one the fit is great I like the kind of bigger sleeves it's boxy and everything it's a really great t-shirt it was just up against ones which are also really great that were eight pounds I'm not 23 pounds now and of the stories is marketed obviously as a higher price brand they're like weekday even though they're part of the same group and H&M and things and but yeah for this one I sort of thought I don't know why you'd want just feel like you have to go and spend and eight pounds more than other than on some of the others so I think for the first time ever under the stores is coming in last place and but yeah I still love you one of the stories and I just don't think you need to go spend 23 pounds on the t-shirt seconds last place is going to be HTM 1 and these are 399 t-shirts and I also want to make it clear I'm not getting rid of any of these t-shirts believe me I'm aware of the XS and the fact I've got so many but in the summer a high a white t-shirt is higher rotation for me and I will wear them all equally so that even though I've just put that under the surf on in last place you will see me wear it again it will be tacked on my Instagram and YouTube videos I'm gonna wear them all again which is why I do recommend them all if this makes sense and including this H&M one which I'm going to use more as a layering piece between now and when it gets a little bit warmer because it's got that elastane in it and it makes it a lot tighter and if you like a tight look or like maybe slightly more flat chested so it looks a little bit less stretched over your boobs then stick for a small but I would think I should go for a size up personally but the skinniness of it it just makes it a really good layering piece but because of how it looks it's not piece I necessarily wanna wear on its own which is how I feel about all of the other ones because they just have a nice they're on my body type and and yeah it's got this stretch in it which the others just don't have in the same way so yeah hmm in that in that place for that reason but for $3.99 I think it's a really really really brilliant t-shirt and and you just buy those some of that wear them to bed because even though it's quite tight it's still soft and comfy and so you could wear them around the house and for $3.99 that's I think that's like just such a good piece to go bulk-buy who needed to and get them in different colors but aesthetically it was not my favorite one like I said I was wearing it and in next place I just realised that no this was gifted to me I didn't tell you the ones which were gifted at the beginning I'll write it in description box was really clear this was gifted those - I thought the arquette one was gifted and unfortunately it's coming in seventh place and again similar to the end of the stories one it was 35 pounds I just think there's other ones that were really great which were a lot less than that and equally it does feel more expensive than the rest it feels thicker the texture of it I'm just gonna hold it up and really close to you with this is and all the stories one this is the arquette one and I think you can see the smooth texture of the are kept on quite nicely so that just that just feel like a step up in quality with it and so it's kind of like I don't I understand why it costs more but ultimately from doing this video I don't think you need to go and spend more on a white t-shirt to get what you need out of a white t-shirt basically and so and it's also very similar to the Uniqlo one and how the texture is and how it feels which we're gonna come to that more later and if there hadn't been the Uniqlo in this this would have definitely gotten bumped a lot higher because like I said it just feel a lot more expensive but I don't know that I would repurchase 35-pound t-shirt from marquette or I didn't buy as myself but I don't know if I would now knowing how many different ones there are in their place gonna be the other Lane one which I'm kind of upset about because I'm in love ever Lane as a brand I've got quite a few things from them and I do really really like them and a great brand or less sustainable all that good stuff and this one just kind of looked especially when I was watching it back the fit of it was not as snacks I've been so picky because it was just basic because it sure through the body so when I was watching ours that kind of kind of look as nice as some of the other ones but when I was wearing it on the day it still felt like it looked completely fine and but it does have a slaw I need to scratch your texture to the rest ever ever ever so slightly and so yeah ever lanes gonna come in that place I hope you guys can see how difficult this is because the reasons that I'm having to rank everything or like miniscule reasons and in that sixth place in fifth place have put a sauce it's just six pounds over that two pounds more than the HTM one and and it has a different look to it to the hmm 1/2 pounds less than the weekday one and the similarities between these it's just ridiculous if the weekday one's a tiny bit softer that we do when I've just got here yet but tiny bit softer it's a different texture to the H number one because of the last name I could discuss and things like the neckline on this one aren't quite as nice as on some of the others and I was talking about that quite a lot at the beginning of me wearing them and and then that the discussion of detail sort of waned as I was waning throughout this video and but yeah the neckline on it's kind of not as nice and chunky as some of the others with the crew necks and this leaves a little bit more like a cap sleeve and a nice big sleeve like I was talking about on the end of the stories one which f place lower down than this and now I'm like this doesn't make any sense um well yeah I'm just gonna stick with this a sawsan in fifth place for no particular reason it seems I put Topshop in fourth place I do kind of feel that this one wasn't really fair to compare but I've got this in store bought this in store and and when I went in the shop this was live like in their basic salary this was the basic white t-shirt but then it doesn't feel as basic as all of the other brands basic white t-shirt and I think I'm gonna wear this a lot in the summer I'm learning like the boxing nurse and really like how emphasized it is really nice thick cotton to it as well like they all are and but feels a slight a slightly more like structured starchy cotton I suppose and I just haven't kind of have a different look for it for that and all that maybe you should lose some points with the fact it's got bracketed sizing like extra small to small that's not great is it I prefer to have it like a specific size so maybe actually I should have pushed this down a few pegs for that because the rest of them have been like quite good size and wise and nowadays is there any need for bracketed sizing it's like brandy melville the fact they do one size Emily driving me mental and so in third and fourth no fourth and third place I've put cause and selected FEM they are just a nearly bloody identical I thought that I'd put selected firm up one because it made a statement beginning the video that was incorrect that said that ever Lane was the only sustainable Brandon this obviously Arquette is making big steps for sustainability and they're quite open with their supply chain and and I got an email yesterday about selected them and now I can't what the percentage was it something like fifty percent sustainable on their range that they have and they're pushing that more and more so they're also brand that's going in the right direction with it so the statement that I made beginning say overlay was the only round who was sustainable that's incorrect and but even they're identical because this selected firms a sustainable brand you're going in the direction off I thought that give that a higher ranking than the cause one and but they are both incredibly similar and actually I think if you handed me them and I close my eyes I wouldn't be able to tell any difference and try to look for detailing that they're finishing on the course at the stitches maybe look a bit nicer but the sleeves the same and the cost sleeves are a tiny bit longer can you see that they're teeny tiny bit longer but like spit the fit wise is pretty much the same so yeah and I would say I'm gonna put if I'm above it for the reasons I just stated but they're both really good t-shirts I think fifteen pounds they boast really good for fifteen pounds I would recommend them both and so that was called and selected fair and and yeah I the selected friend was sent to me as well that was the only other one that was sent to me everything else I bought and I think it's online it and they've got shop so if you liked the look of these one but you need to go in and try it on and go for the class one instead because I'm not sure if they have any physical shops noise in the second place that leaves you with the Uniqlo one this was a put your frontrunner threw you out but I've not given it the first place because I figure out the sidings a bit off and the sizing on the rest is really consistent I think he decides up when this is you've got big boobs especially in the fact that it made it kind of tight under my armpits wasn't ideal I should have bought this lower for that because this is the only one that's been in anyway it wasn't uncomfortable but it didn't have that nice oversized sleeve look to it so I'm up size up but I think the main thing is that the fact is I have 10 t-shirts here white identical t-shirt and yet I look this one enough that I would go and get it in a medium so that I had the perfect fit I'm gonna hold this one up to the next to the arquette one and then hopefully you can kind of just see how incredibly similar the textures are almost identical and like the neckline on this the chunkiness it's just a thick really really really great white t-shirt and like I said I would 100% go get it in a medium said it's the perfect fit for me despite having enough white t-shirts to set up a white t-shirt shop and it leaves me in first place with weekday and don't really have a strong reason for putting it here it was 8 pounds I thought gosh that's sober that's under 10 pounds at surgical price and it does feel a bit softer and a bit nicer than the Asus one which was closest to in price it's more classic than the Topshop one which a sauce and the Topshop have two pounds in the side of this and yet felt more nice than the Topshop one is more consistent and sizing than the Topshop one like we just suggested the fit of it is gray it's still got a really like nice neckline to it that's a bit thicker and a bit more and ripped and just feels nicer than the I saw Swan so it does feel nicer than the a sauce 1/2 and it very very very very similar to the Cosmodrome one but yet is a little bit more expensive a little bit cheaper and also very similar to the under the stories one this cos selected foam and other stories one's the ever lame one has a slightly different feel to it those for a sauce as well that's so incredibly similar so this is what I mean like go with where your brand loyalty lies I've opted room for a weekday first place and somewhat helpful I have this awful feeling it hasn't a bit and they basically it seems like runs at just smashing the white t-shirt sector and so they should how can you get it wrong it's just an essential piece in any wardrobe so I I won't part way so sorry the camera doctor just died so I cut Morales was I just had a cup to you on that recharge and i recharged but I just wanted to end this on reiterating at that and you will see all of these t-shirts on me again I now obviously have a lot of white t-shirts I'm confident I can keep running more throughout the summer and but there's none that I'm like oh I really don't recommend it's been really hard to stack of it and I hope this is helpful in some way if there's one that you felt looked nicer in anyway then you guys go for that one linked for everything in the description box as I said that Arquette and selected pheromones are sent to me everything else I bought and that's kind of covering everything I don't think I'm going to be notion to do the testing basics with 10 items anytime soon more than anything around time you get to the 10th I'm like I can't remember what I said about the first one no it's just so long anyway and I really really hope you enjoyed it thank you so so much for watching I'll see the next one", "wPYQAomgG9k": "hey guys it's Kayla from noted arts I run a small t-shirt company right now it's small I'm sure it'll be bigger soon and I make sure it's like the one I'm wearing which is it says blonde on it a cool message and I like it and like this one which we'll be talking about in a second the reason I'm bringing up shirts is because most people are searching for how to find the vintage field shirt or how to create the vintage field shirt on on shirts they have at their house already for stuff that they can find around their house and if you search online like I did over and over again you come across this recipe that says salt water and even baking soda sometimes mixed with water put the shirt in it make it sit and let it sit for three days and then come back and you wash it and it's great and it's good to go in it's perfectly vintage and comfortable and song that is false completely false okay the only thing it did accomplish from what I saw and I tried it a few times with different variations of the recipe same result it does fade color so if you are trying to fade out a dark color that's a good way to do it but it doesn't make it softer and in fact I think a lot of people are saying it makes it a little bit more stark to your rough on the skin so I did my own little research and I found a simple way to do it and it's really good okay so what you're gonna need is a shirt like the one I have here okay now you have to remember certain types of certain are only gonna get a certain measure of softness and vintage feel okay so if you have a hundred percent heavy-duty cotton shirt it's only gonna get so vintage okay or so soft because it it's simply a thick heavy shirt so it if you start out with a good brand then it's gonna get even better okay so what you're gonna need is a pumice stone or a pumice stone this could be found at a lot of stores in the beauty section for like four to six bucks I think and it's well worth it because I've used it a lot and it hasn't even degraded at all really a cool little tool there for what we're gonna use it for and then you have fabric softener which is also four to six bucks I think and I did Google this and ultra downy is actually you want to stick with ultra or whatever it is but ultra downy is actually one of the most effective brands of fabric softener and then surprisingly enough you're gonna want some tennis balls brand new tennis balls don't get used tennis balls I prefer about six maybe more of you if you're doing a lot of shirts okay so the process is you're gonna take the pumice stone first the first step and you're gonna lay your shirt down on the floor on a table and pin it down somehow on all fours or some other method and literally sand your entire shirt okay and starting from the shoulder all the way down and you're gonna probably want to spin this is including the sleeves okay very important even the collar on the collar send it up a little bit it what it does is it's gonna break the fabric up a little bit so that when you do put it in the solution later it'll be more effective okay and it's very soft on the skin when you're done all right so you're gonna sand it up and like I said two or three minutes after you do each side turn the shirt inside out so that it's soft on the inside too okay and do the whole the whole shirt should probably take you seven to eight minutes to do you thorough beat be firm and just do the whole shirt thoroughly and once you're done you're gonna take it and put it into the solution the measurement of this solution is one cup of water to one cup of fabric softener for one shirt tank I guess I should have done one for each of those anyway so you're gonna put that in your tray or bucket and let it sit for 24 hours that's what I've been doing and it turns out great I'm sure if you leave it in longer it's even better maybe a little less I don't think it even matters that much but definitely several hours okay when you're done rinse the shirt out thoroughly okay because it's gonna smell strongly of your fabric softener which is a strong smelling agent then you're gonna take it to the washing machine and wash it again now wash it probably with no soap but if you need so fun but wash it when you're done watching it this is where the tennis balls come in okay I'm gonna take the tennis balls and put them in the dryer with the shirt the reason for this is it's gonna act kind of like the pumice stone did and it's going to be abrasive on the shirt and add that little bit of breaking down to the fabric so that when you do wear it it's gonna feel amazing okay so dry your shirt remember one thing though this is goes for washing and drying when you do high heat it tends to shrink the shirt a little bit sometimes it doesn't last very long but definitely immediately once you put it on it will shrink the shirt so just make sure you wash and consider that little tidbit of information so that's basically how you create a vintage feel shirt from a shirt that you own in your house now out of materials you can grab its view on a DIY and I hope that's helpful once again if you like the shirt I'm wearing or the shirt I showed you earlier go ahead and check out noted art dot weebly.com

nice new t-shirt but we also know it's sometimes hard to\nbeat the feeling of a good old worn in team but what if you could create that\nlook right away without spending all those years wearing it in well today\nwe're a deluxe screen printing to map out the basic steps you need for\ncreating vintage tees so there are a few different types of\nt-shirts and fabrics that work well when going for a vintage vibe poly cotton\nblends and tri blends in particular are great because the yarns take the ink\ndifferently giving it that worn in look today we're going to use our vintage\nslub a fabric with a great tonal texture thanks to the uneven knit to showcase\nthis another great option is to go for a shirt that is pre distressed like our\n3009 from the fast fashion collection this tee is made up of super soft 100%\nairlume combed and ring-spun fabric but features holes throughout for that worn\nin look so the next step is to pair that tee with the right design we've\nconsulted an expert designer Charley Pangus Pangus to showcase how to do just that\nwhat's up guys so for this artwork we wanted to apply a nice vintage look and\nin order to achieve that I needed to find some really heavy textures online\nfor the first texture we use rust and when you apply that above the artwork on\ntop we use the white ink so It blended it right into the artwork it gives it a\nnice broken feel which we love with the vintage look for the second texture\nI like to use an oil splatter and I put that below the artwork which gives it a\neven more broken up look it's also important to note that I applied these\ntextures very very heavy on purpose so when we actually print it and you don't\nlose a lot of detail and then when you actually print it you get this nice\nvintage design that we were looking for and last but not least you're going to\nneed to choose a printing technique that complements both the shirt and the\ndesign so there are two different types of inks that you can use for a vintage\nprint there's either plastisol without a base or water base with plastisol\nwithout a base you typically would like to print on a dark fabric that way your\nbright colors are going to get less bright and they're gonna darken up and\nit's gonna lay right on top of that fabric and you're gonna have a little\nbit of a natural distressed look the other way would be to use water base\nwhich is gonna lay into the fabric and it's gonna have a really soft feel to it\nas if you wash that tee a million times there are two different types of\nwater-based inks there's water base that you're gonna print on white or pastel\ncolors when you're printing on darker colors like blacks reds blues you want\nto go to what's called discharge printing that has a discharge base to it\nwhich actually bleaches out the dye in the fabric with that one it's great for\na distressed looked as well depending on the fabric you're using if you're using\na poly blend it's going to discharge the cotton part of it so that's gonna help\nwith that a little bit of that vintage look\nthank you for going bright it's gonna darken up so be aware with that you\nmight want to do some pre-testing on that because your colors will change now\non 100% cotton that color should be true again you'll want to do some testing on\nthat the two tees that we printed today the distressed tee and the slub tee\nare great options when printing that vintage look let us know what you\nthought of the vintage teens we created in this video in the comment section be\nsure to check out how Charlie completed his design in his

35,000 pins in my my account and many boards and one that caught my eye a few months ago and I've been wanting to do it and show you guys is how to turn a stiff shirt this one is very stiff into one of those soft vintage feel like this one this is so soft it's like a baby's blanket this is my son Jonathon shirt now my boys my boys love to wear t-shirts and they tend to go to like the character t-shirts like these are Batman Marvel Comics and all that stuff because of the way it's made a lot of these shirts are very soft and vintage looking and so when they wear it specially here where we live during the summertime it goes up to like 90 95 degrees it's very hot it's very humid they don't want to wear something like this that's so heavy for them and so thick this is one of my husband's favorite shirts because of course it says Hawaii it's a Hawaiian shirt actually says Hawaiian strength but he had gotten this in Hawaii during one of his visits there and he has a love and hate relationship with this shirt he loves it but then he hates to wear it so I figured I'd wanted to since I saw this on Pinterest I wanted to go ahead and surprise him turn this hard feeling t-shirt into a soft vintage one alright the recipe to turn your hard shirts into a soft vintage feel only requires two ingredients four cups of water and half a cup of salt place everything into your container I'm just using one of my kitchen Pyrex because it's the right size for me and mix it well make sure the salt is well dissolved into that water okay the salt is fully dissolved I have my shirt here my husband's shirt and I'm going to go ahead and fold it nice and flat so that it soaks into that water and just make sure that your um your shirt is fully covered in that water okay and we're supposed to brine it we're supposed to brine it for three days and brining is just a process of just letting it sit I'm going to go ahead and let it sit outside it's a nice weather outside it's not hot it's not cold and then every evening I'm just going to put it put it inside or else I can also place it in my laundry room so either way where you guys decide to place it just make sure that um once in a while every day or two just Pat it in and make sure all the the fabric is covered and I will see you guys in three days Aloha friends it has been three days this thing has really soaked in well it's been brining and now I'm going to go ahead and give it a regular wash and it's supposed to have a vintage feel to it let's go see how it works out alright friends here is the final result went ahead and washed it twice and the result I'm pretty happy with them okay with it I think it actually did work it's not vintage soft soft but it is it is a lot softer than what it originally was and I have to take into consideration that I did start off with a very heavy cotton shirt this was very thick it wasn't just the regular cotton t-shirt this one was super thick but hubby have already tried it and he can't feel the difference specially along along the sleeves this DIY of turning your your regular t-shirt into vintage vintage t-shirt does work at some point it won't turn it super vintage like you know like this super thin but it does you know line it up a bit maybe I'll even try one day of just doing another batch of the the salt and and the water brine and see how it does work but um for now I'm pretty happy with it so I give it thumbs up thank you guys for watching this quick video of how to turn your regular t-shirt into vintage shirts and like I said I think it works and I hope you guys try to Maha", "3dmBEtJXPck": "so in this episode of apparel academy i\nwill break down for you the key differences\nbetween a two-step heat transfer printing method\nand sublimation printing and what are some key considerations\nto keep in mind so that you can make the right choice for your business although i know there are a lot more\napparel decoration methods that involve printing out there i wanted to\nspecifically cover these two types of printing methods\nbecause both of these methods can be done on the ricoma r550\nwhite toner transfer printer okay so before we jump right in if you're here\nfor the first time or you're new to this channel\nmake sure to smash that subscribe button to keep up to date with the latest\nvideos that come out we post every single week\nalso make sure to give a quick thumbs up to this video if you like content just\nlike this so as i said before i'm going to break\ndown the key differences and considerations for these two types of\nprinting methods but before we get into that i want to\nfirst give a quick intro on what heat transfer printing actually\nis now when we talk about heat transfer printing\nwe're talking specifically about a two-step method so what do those two\nsteps actually involve so step number one in this two-step heat transfer\nprinting method is actually printing a design onto a\ntransparent sheet of transfer paper then in step two\nyou actually transfer that design that was printed on\nthat transfer paper onto an adhesive paper using a heat\npress finally you peel away the adhesive sheet from the transfer\nsheet and then you press the design onto the substrate such as a piece of\ngarment using a heat press after pressing the garment you then peel\naway the actual paper and you're left with a design that's\ntransferred onto the garment itself the ricoma r550 white toner transfer printer\nuses this very two-step heat transfer method\nto apply designs onto various light and dark color garments even onto\nhard surfaces such as wood aluminum or even metal if\nyou're interested to learn more about white toner transfer printing and\nspecifically about the ricoma r550 white toner transfer printer packages\ngo ahead and click the link in the description below and check them out\nthere so now that we cover what is a two-step\nheat transfer printing system let's cover what is sublimation printing\nso sublimation printing involves a similar process where you're\nprinting the design onto regular copy paper or specialty\nsublimation paper and then using heat via a heat press to\ntransfer that printed design onto a substrate such as a piece of\ngarment the key difference lies in how sublimation works and the science behind\nit during sublimation when the actual\nprinted design is heated via a heat press\nthe toner on the transfer paper itself actually turns from\na solid state into a gas state and then it embeds itself\ninto the fabric when it cools it actually goes back to being installed\nand then becomes a permanent part of the fabric that means\nunlike a two-step heat transfer printing method sublimation actually adds no\nadditional layer of paper on top of the fabric and you\ncan't feel the difference of the printed image and the rest of the\nfabric okay now that we've covered what these two methods actually are\nlet's go into some key differences and considerations between these two methods\nthe first topic that we're going to cover between these two methods is\ndurability and feel as i briefly mentioned before sublimation does not\nadd an extra layer on top of your fabric versus a two-step heat transfer printing\nmethod actually leaves a thin layer on top of your fabric\nso the feel is going to be much different so right off the bat you will\nfeel a difference between the printed design using these two\nmethods now in terms of durability with a heat transfer printed design\nit can last about 30 to 40 washes depending on how large your design is\nand how it's actually being washed now on the other hand with sublimation\nbecause the ink or the toner is actually infused inside the fabric and becomes a\npart of the fabric it is a much more permanent design onto\nthe fabric and it can withstand a lot more washes\nin fact most sublimated designs will last just as\nlong as the actual fabric itself because\nyou're not leaving an extra layer of transfer on top of the fabric\nyou're not going to see any cracking after washes and the image is much\nless likely to fade with sublimation so in this category of durability and feel\nit is pretty clear that sublimation wins out in this category because\nit can last a lot longer and you don't feel the actual transfer\nimage on top of the garment alright the second item to consider\nbetween sublimation printing and heat transfer printing\nis the variety of substrates that you can transfer images onto\nwith sublimation printing you are much more limited in\nthe variety of substrates that you can transfer images onto this is because\nsublimation can only adhere to polyester coated materials\neven if you use something that is 60 polyester\nand 40 cotton which is really about the minimum amount of polyester\nthat you need in order to make sublimation work in that 60 40\npoly cotton blend you're not going to get as much vibrancy\nin your transfer design versus 100 polyester\nwith sublimation you also have to use only\nwhite colored substrates or very light colored substrates that means you can't\nuse sublimation on a black t-shirt or a dark mug\nbecause the actual design won't show on the other hand\nwith white toner heat transfer printing you can actually print on light\nand dark colored garments and you're not limited to anything with polyester only\nin fact with heat transfer printing you can heat transfer onto\ncotton onto polyester even ceramic and other hard surfaces like wood and\nmetal and therefore in this category of variety of substrates you can\ntransfer onto heat transfer definitely wins out in\nthis one because of the variety of things that you can do finally let's\ngo into the category of the quality of the colors you can print\nusing these two methods first off sublimation allows you to print full\ncolors and this can be super helpful when\ntrying to sublimate a photo for example or doing a particular job for a customer\nthat requires a very specific color such as one for a company logo you can\nalso achieve sharp vibrant designs using heat\ntransfer paper if you're printing your design\nusing a white toner transfer system such as the ricoma r550 so it really is a\nvirtual tie in this category between sublimation and\nheat transfer printing because you can achieve\nfull color vibrant designs with either method the real difference lies\nin the durability and the feel of either method\nalso the variety of substrates that you can transfer onto but fortunately you\ncan achieve the best of both worlds using a white toner transfer printing\nsystem such as the one that we have here at ricoma the ricoma r550\ni kind of alluded to this briefly in the beginning of the episode\nin that you can achieve sublimation and heat transfer using heat transfer paper\nwith the ricoma r550 and that's because you can actually swap out\none of the toner cartridges in the r550 with a specialty sublimation\ntoner cartridge so in conclusion guys both printing methods\ninvolve a similar process but yield very different results\nhowever in sublimation printing the ink or toner actually permeates\nthroughout the fabric and becomes part of the fabric itself in\ntwo-step heat transfer printing on the other hand the image simply becomes\nanother layer on top of the substrate thankfully the\nricoma r550 white toner transfer printing system\ncan achieve either method simply by swapping out\nthe toner cartridge so make sure you keep these considerations in mind\nwhen deciding which method to use to fulfill the needs of your customers\nat the end of the day it really depends on what your customer is looking for the\ntype of material they're looking to get printed on and that will drive your\ndecision on what is best for your customers\nlike i mentioned before if you're looking to get started in the heat\ntransfer printing business or you're looking to add on to your existing\napparel decoration

guys we're going to switch gears a bit and we're going to talk about actually sublimation transfers i've been wanting to do a video on how to actually apply the sublimation transfers to a shirt and so i figured this is as good a time as any right okay so few things to know about sublimation okay sublimation is uh dye sublimation is basically just that you're dying fabric um with these uh sublimation transfers okay so one thing to be aware is sublimation does not print white so if you like you see this white right here that's going to be whatever color your shirt is okay so the other thing is you can't dye dark objects lighter you can only dye things darker so that's why it's important for sublimation to use a white or a very light colored shirt because if you put black on a black shirt you're not going to see it if you have pink on a black shirt you're not going to see it so you have to use light or or white as best but white or very light colored shirts as far as um a little bit darker colored shirts if you wanted to do like maybe a like a blue jean color or something like that you can do that but it's best to do that with an all black sublimation transfer black's one of the only colors that you can kind of still see on a darker shirt as long as it's not darker than the black so hopefully that answers some questions about that that's one of the biggest questions we get is why can't you do sublimation on dark shirts it's just because you can't see it so even if the the dye is transferring to it you won't see it on a dark shirt but you will see it on a white or a very light colored shirt the other thing to be aware of for sublimation is sublimation dyes only adhere to polyester fibers so what happens is when the dyes get heated up heat it up it actually infuses into the polyester so the more polyester content that you have in your shirt or um whatever you're pressing the brighter and bolder the colors are so if you have like a 50 polyester shirt with 50 cotton it's not gonna stick to the cotton but it will stick to the polyester so it'll be like a faded look so that's another thing to keep in mind the higher the polyester count in your fabric the brighter and bolder the colors will be another thing about sublimation is before you press it the colors are going to look really muted especially like blues and mints turquoise those colors will look completely different after you press it's weird so don't freak out whenever you print out your sublimation if you're doing it at home or even if you order one and it looks completely different it changes once it's heated it gets a lot more bolder brighter vivid and the blues and greens those change a lot so hopefully that answers a few questions okay oh another thing for sublimation you want to use a heat press or you can use the easy press 2 because you need 400 degrees fahrenheit and iron will not work unless you're doing like a little bitty tiny thing because you don't want to move it around at all when you press it you want to keep it like and not move it like it's got to stay still so easy press 2 will work because it does get hot enough or heat press is definitely definitely recommended iron and sublimation just do not mix okay so here are some other tips and tricks okay sublimation will go through your shirt okay so you always want to put something in between your shirt or you want to actually thread your shirt onto your press rather than just putting this on here like this pressing it because you're going to see this mama bear transfer all the way through to the back especially for thin shirts so anytime you're using sublimation you always want to protect your press with protective paper and then you always want to protect the inside of your shirt if you're not threading it through so for this one when i say threading it through i just mean opening the shirt and putting it on your press where only one layer of the shirt is on there that's always the ideal way to press if you can because then you don't have any seams messing you up or anything like that so this would be considered a threaded shirt all right so we're going to go ahead and put our shirt on here i'm going to move it to where the collar is not actually on the press anytime you're pressing it's always good to not have the collars or the seams on the press because anything like that can make it where your shirt isn't getting full pressure okay this is a bella canvas let me see this is a bella canvas shirt and it is i want to say 50 polyester 65 actually 65 polyester you want to have at least 50 but like i said the higher the polyester count the bolder and brighter these colors will be all right so we got our shirt on there we have our protective paper right now i'm just going to use this teflon sheet just to do a quick pre-press to get any moisture out of it all right remove that now here's another thing to be aware of for sublimation you'll notice that it's on this square okay now lighter colored shirts usually won't happen but if you're using like a more colored shirt a lot of times if you just put this down and you press it like that you're going to see that square so a good habit to always be in is anytime you're pressing sublimation just loosely cut around your image it just will soften that edge and just make it look a lot nicer another thing is if you're printing your own sublimations or ordering them sometimes whenever it's going through the printer you'll get little bitty dots of ink on the edge if you don't cut those edges off there's a chance that you won't see it and you'll miss it and you'll have like these weird little black lines okay and this does not have to be perfect this is just loosely cutting around so that you can really see where your image is and that you won't have that box around your sublimation okay um let me get one more thing one second okay okay another thing you always want to do before you're pressing a sublimation is use a lint roller and just get any loose fibers or anything like that off your shirt because sometimes if you have some loose fibers or anything like that you'll see these weird little blue and red marks after you press it because we're pressing for a for a full minute for sublimation so any of those little things getting pressed at 400 degrees for a minute can actually change colors and permanently affect your shirt and your outcome okay so we have our shirt ready we have it pre-pressed we have it lint rolled we have our transfer cut out our shirt is at least 50 polyester is 65 so we're gonna put the transfer face down okay so the ink side will be on the shirt now from here you don't want to put a teflon sheet straight on your transfer because what happens is once the ink um gets heated up and turns into a gas and any extra will kind of dissipate so if you use a teflon sheet that extra ink will just kind of sit on your teflon sheet and you'll need to clean your teflon sheet if not you won't notice it until you go to press something else and that ink will actually transfer onto something else so always use some protective paper you can even use um regular like copy paper is totally fine to just put on top okay so we're just gonna put a couple sheets of copy paper on there we're gonna take our teflon sheet and we're gonna cover it all with that okay and we're going to be pressing for 60 seconds at 400 degrees okay and y'all just be careful once this is done it will be hot so just be prepared for that okay once this is done you just want to remove your transfer immediately not let it move and then sit somewhere else or you get like a ghosting all right remove that and that is it so here is our sublimated shirt mama bear this particular design is available on the website as a digital download and it also is available as a ready to press transfer so that is sublimation is super easy it's not just for fabrics you can use it for any polyester coated item so there's tons like there's tumbler cups there's a whole bunch of stuff that you can use um sublimation for as far as washing this is permanent you can wash it and dry it like normal no issues and it will last a long time the other question i get a lot of times too is can you reuse the transfers they're not really made to be reused but sometimes like a darker transfer like this if you're okay with a much lighter version you can put it on there and press it again it won't be as bold and vibrant as the first one but you will still get some ink transfer but just be aware you know if you don't like it you can't take it off so definitely sublimation is permanent the amazing thing is sublimation it has no feel to it so all it does is it actually changes the color of the fabric so i hope this was helpful you guys we get so many questions about sublimation on the website you can order custom sublimations if you have an image that you want printed or if you have questions on how to print your own you're welcome to message us we can give you some recommendations of some good printers and good machines if you all have any questions please comment down below i will try to answer

you'll be notified of all this fantastic information we have on the t-shirt industry now i know a lot of you guys are dead set you know exactly what t-shirt company you're gonna use to get your blanks from and some of you guys are undecided and this is why this video is being made and for some of you guys who are dead set you might see something that may uh change your mind now in this video we're going to be focusing on three main key points when it comes to a t-shirt blank fit feel and price now we're going to be covering quite a few t-shirts in this video so it may be a little lengthy so i took some time and created time stamps for each brand and that's going to be down in the description box okay so something piques your interest you can go right directly to that brand but i strongly suggest that you watch this video in its entirety so enough with all this talking without any further ado roll that beautiful bean footage here we go okay guys this is the ideal by next level you can see all the style number information down in the left corner this is what it fits like on the model we're just gonna lay it out and we're gonna give it the old uh feel test and it feels nice uh it's mediocre it's not the softest and it's not the scratches so it's like kind of right in the middle and it has that uh rip away label which is always good and it says ideal and not next level i don't know why and this is what it looks like uh from the back now the price is 366. and please note you probably can get these cheaper if you go direct to the manufacturer so here we are anvil and as you can see the fit is nice it's a standard fits a little bit more athletic but just slightly boxy but nice the feel is very nice i would say um out of five i would give it like a four uh uh three and a half three point five out of five you know somewhat soft you know and slightly above average all right it has that rip away tag so you can do your branding okay very nice um and here is the back this is the back uh how it looks okay really nice and the price is 326 okay of course you might get it a little bit cheaper now price in general something you want to take into consideration if it's a bottom of the barrel t-shirt um then you want to get a t-shirt that's less expensive so you can even in that lower price you can have some room to make a profit and if you're selling a more premium t-shirt then you want to get a better quality blank to justify selling your t-shirt at a higher price and of course that blank is going to be a little bit more expensive but hey higher price more profit which means you can afford the more expensive blank let's go to the next one okay so this is jerseys okay we all know jerseys all right and it's a slightly thicker slightly thicker shirt so we're gonna spread this bad boy out and you're gonna see that it's nice you just saw the fit it's a nice fit it's um not too boxy not too athletic you know not too fitted nice shirt and a feel it's good it's it's a good middle of the road shirt you understand what i'm saying no complaints and you can see right here that there's no um side seam which is usually um the more athletic um shirts will have a side seam and right here you see that that is that rip away tag which is always a good sign for a blank all right now the field is the middle of the road it's middle of the road about a three out of a five and the price is 431 which is a little a little high and this is how it looks from the back that's jerseys fit all right guys fit this is so very important because depending on your demographic meaning your core target audience meaning the people who you are pushing your t-shirt company to they may want a different fit you may have a young hip demographic they may want a smaller tighter fit you may have a older demographic all right they may want a little bit of a boxier fit you may have an athletic demographic or you may be one of these people that's out here doing a line for people who are bodybuilders or crossfit or something like that then in that case you may want a more fitted tighter uh smaller waist v taper type fit for your t-shirts everything has to do with your core target audience and not all t-shirts are the same alright so fit is so very important all right and this is the hanes tagless shirt um and this one is the epitome to me in my opinion it's a dad's shirt it's a shirt that you just kinda it's just a shirt that you just kind of wear it's really not for screen printing you can see um it's really big and boxy all right and it's very thick a lot of you guys think that thick is a higher quality and not necessarily all right the feel is it's okay it's it's a mediocre and there's no um there's no side seam all right it's very hand feel it's very mediocre not too soft not rough though not rough and this is really important right here the the back neck tag is already heat pressed so you can't brand it so not a good look and um this is how it looks from the back you can see it's very big and boxy so um not for me my opinion not the best for starting a t-shirt business for obvious reason but it does have a pretty good price 279 and you probably could get it cheaper guys the tag the tag is so very important there was a time when hey whatever the brand of the t-shirt was they left their tag in and there was a time when you literally had to pay screen printers to cut the tag out so you could put your branding in it that's not the case anymore they make these t-shirts with mostly rip away tags so you can rip that tag out and put your own branding in there so i always want to call out what type of tag hopefully a rip away is in your blank tee also guys when you doing all the branding and you have your neck label and your hang tags and your boxes and everything matches guys that stuff looks so professional such a what's called perceived value you take your t-shirt line to a whole nother level baby all right guys alternative apparel very nice shirt first thing you're gonna see you're gonna notice that it is a little bit more fitted okay so a very nice fitting shirt all right let's lay it out and let's give it an initial just a field test and it it's very soft guys very soft very nice shirt okay uh you can get in there touch on that feels really good all right and also you're gonna see that it is a you can see that side seam right there which helps with the fit so we're already having some uh some premium things going on you can see that fit you know a little bit a little bit more tapered and fit it to the body and it has that rip away tag so this one is definitely a little bit more on the primo side all right and the price is about 385 okay um and of course you may be able to get a little bit cheaper at the actual website but alternative apparel really nice shirt all right guys this is the hanes nano tee this one totally came out of left field for me uh different than the haines tagless tee all right really nice fit and the fabric is really soft uh dynamite tee all right the fit is not quite um the super fitted but it fit really nice and you're gonna see right here that it has a really nice feel okay now right here you're gonna see that it does not have the side seam okay but it still managed to have a great fit and i think that has to do with the fabric it's a really light soft fabric so this nano t uh surprised me and uh you can see that it also has that rip away tag all right so um really nice and once again the feel was a really nice you almost can see how soft it is right surprise me right because i never heard of the nano t this is it from the back and the price is three dollars and eleven cent once again you might can get it cheaper from haynes uh themselves so that is the haines nano t okay so here we are fruit of the loom now this one kind of surprised me a little bit i thought it was going to be really bad and it wasn't the fabric is actually a nice feel not the best not the worst it's a light it's a light t-shirt guys it's a nice light t-shirt and it gets the job done if you want to just put something out there throw a screen print on it uh for the loom and of course it has the rip away tag all right which any good t-shirt should have and it was nice it felt good has a decent fit and i was presently surprised this is it from the back and the price was 3.49 i thought it could have been a little cheaper but hey you know i got it from a reseller so if you buy directly from fruit of the loom you may can get it cheaper all right on to the next one gildan or gildan all right this one is popular this is usually the shirt that you see that's the lowest price when you're choosing t-shirts on print on demand and there's a reason for that that's because the fabric is not very soft all right it's not nice it's not that nice feeling at all i mean it's okay after a couple of washes but initially um not the best feeling and that's why it's uh the least expensive um but it's a cool tee no side seam and the fit is it's okay um it's not boxy and it's it's not tapered or or like really fitted um fabric [Music] not the best feeling man not the best best feeling but it does have a rip away tag which is always good uh let's take a look at it from the back um cool t-shirt but um i would say low on lower on the quality scale and the price 279 so you can see it's a little bit less and you know hey you get what you pay for guys all right gildan next level check this one out now great thing about next level is look at the fit really great fit nice fitted to the body great i mean you can see it on the mannequin here so let's lay it out and um first you know we're going to give it a nice little feel and um it feels great it's really soft really nice all right it's um definitely a higher quality shirt and also you're gonna see right here that it too has a side seam okay which is a um telltale sign of a higher quality shirt and the rip away tag here it is from the back the price of 439 so uh it's a little bit it's it's up there all right it's up there but it is a higher quality more premium t-shirt next level bella canvas good old bella canvas you've heard about them several times here at t-shirt help desk great t-shirt really light airy soft fantastic t-shirt with a great fit alright and let's take a look as you guys should know bella canvas also has the side seam okay which gives it a really nice fit it's light it's not a heavy fabric and it's really really soft and of course it has the rip away tag and as stated previously bella is one of the softest on the market all right right up there with next level and in alternative apparel here it is from the back and the price 439 but that's from a middleman you can get it from bella canvas as most of these for about a dollar to 80 90 cents cheaper bella canvas next american apparel yes they are still around okay um they are really soft t-shirts really nice all right and just to let you know this t-shirt all the other ones were largest this one is a medium so if it seems extra snug that's because it is one size down okay but it does have a really good fit all right and it has that side seam okay so it is a more premium shirt with a nice fit okay this is it from the side you can see that it is a good slim fit all right and it yes has the rip away tag so great to brand with this is it from the back all right the price 392 all right so it's more on the premium side but a little bit less and like all the other ones if you go straight to the manufacturer you can get it for less all right guys as you can see all of the t-shirts are 100 cotton i didn't want to get into anything crazy i didn't want to get into the tri-blends or anything fancy schmancy like that that's gonna be for another video i wanted to keep it basic 100 cotton t-shirts but there is one exception i am going to show you guys one 100 polyester tee this is a great t-shirt for any of you guys who are doing active who are doing sports people who are working out golf anything where people may be working out and get sweaty because 100 polyester is a natural wicking fabric meaning that if you're sweating it naturally will kind of wick that sweat away and another thing about 100 polyester tees is that they are great for sublimation in fact really it's the only thing you really can use for sublimation all right so if you want to sublimate small and if you want to do those big all over sublimation tees you need a 100 or at least a very high polyester content but one little thing if you're doing sublimation this shirt has to be a light color preferably white all right so let me show you this is the jerseys dry power sport t-shirt great shirt and it feels like a regular t-shirt that's what's so great about it alright so this is it and it feels very similar to a standard jersey t-shirt if you didn't know the difference you probably couldn't tell and it is soft not the softest but it is a soft t-shirt in the back it doesn't have the rip away tag okay so um branding is gonna be a little bit tricky but um the price is also a little bit uh more 563 this is it from the back but if you want to do that athletic stuff this is the way to go that was a lot of t-shirts guys they were in no particular order i really wasn't trying to critique like that i just wanted to present them to you so you can make your decision on what's going to be in your t-shirt line now when it comes to actually purchasing these t-shirts you can go to each brand's respective website but please note a lot of these companies are going to require you to have a wholesale or a retail license they may want to see your website all right so you know you may have to do that but you're gonna get the absolute best prices now if you don't have that no worries you can go to places like jiffyshirts.com which is where i got all of these shirts okay they have you covered you don't need any of that stuff you can just go you can buy as little or as many as you like so anyway guys that's all i got for you today i'm gonna put some butt on my shoes and slide on out the dope cheers to your t-shirts start a t-shirt business or die trying and do something good for somebody and if you don't have anyone to do something good for do something good for yourself god bless and peace shirt man shirt man yeah that's me that's when you take your t-shirt line to a hoe damn that's taking it to another level baby", "aquMaT5PM1Q": "[Music] I'm a summary from Bali canvass and in a recent video we talked about all of our different types of fabric in today's video we're going to talk about the different printing techniques and discuss which fabrics are best with which techniques we're going to cover pasta solving water based discharge sublimation DTG and heat press and talk about which of those techniques work on each of our different fabrics stay tuned so let's start with a hundred percent cotton islander percent cotton is pretty much the easiest fabric to work with industry printing world and it works with pretty much every single technique except sublimation pauses all ink is typically the easiest type of seam to use in the screen printing world and it works great on a huge range of fabrications including a hundred percent cotton so with class assault me you're gonna have a hand to me name the ink lays on top of the garment it works great with hundred-percent Compton along with all that that works interacts with the cotton you're not gonna have to worry about dye migration dye migration is something that happens with polyester and I'll touch on that later but because of that it's gonna work great with it too before cotton white classes all aim this thing's great because it's got a lighter hand to it than some of the inks with poly darkness another technique we love for a hundred percent cotton is water-based so all of our cotton is 100% combed in ring-spun meaning that's got a super soft hand and what water-based is if that is absorbed into the actual fibers at the cotton you're not going to feel it like you will it pass us all in this field the exact same as a regular shirt we feel with no print on it so water base is great for any light-colored Cotton's or any darker colors as long as you're using a shade darker you can't use a leg water basing on its dark fabric for that effect you're gonna want to use a discharge discharge ink is kind of like the complement to water based ink but it's used on dark fabrics so in the sense that you don't feel a water-based print in terms of the hand same goes for discharge with discharge it's gonna work best on 100% cotton compared to you know your tribe lines or your heather's but something you will want to be careful with the test for is on different colors each color is going to take that discharge agent differently so make sure to do a wide range of testing before moving forward with like a big full quarter of a specific discharge print another thing to keep in mind is discharge doesn't work on that garments there's not enough contrast so with a light garment you're gonna want to use water base with a dark garment you're gonna want to use the district this is another discharge print that we did with actual colors so with this one the discharge agent removes all of the pigment from the gray fabric and replaced it with these colors like for the whites and the reds that you see in this print here so let's move on to DG ECG stands for a direct to garment printing we've done a few videos about this in the past and it works best with 100% cotton t-shirt 100% cotton is pretty much the DTG printers ideal garment with these TG is really important more so than the spring hunting to have a really really smooth surface you want to make sure you use a comb to ring-spun garment so a bell on campus is a favorite for GDQ printers as well here's another DTG print with a dart garment you're gonna want to lay down a face and like Kermit you can just go ahead and print the ink directly on the shirt with you to do so he transfers the next process we're going to talk about it also is super easy with 100% cotton heat transfer is if you place the vine olive oil a little variety of different types of heat transfer effects but basically with this you're going to just die when I heat press it for about 15 seconds for a 320 degrees which is pretty standard and the heat press cool lastly we have sublimation so sublimation is a process that only works on polyester so you can sublimate at all on a hundred percent cotton t-shirts so we don't have an example to show you about we will later in the video with so next we're going to cover Heather C we see how their CPC is another favorite among printers and it typically takes a pretty similar to our 100% cotton typically with Heather's you have to worry about the dye migration and polyester coming through ink when you're using classed assault but we did some extensive testing on all of our feathers and found that they were pretty much just as well with cotton white as they do with an ink with a poly blocker with a 50/50 or a poly so what that means for use free printers out there is you can use a more standard name with a softer hand and not have to worry about dye migration like you usually do with Heather's and that's pretty exclusive to the fella canvas collection the same might not hold true for other brands with plastic saw ink we like to use kind of a thinner lines on it that will keep the original feel of the garment showing below but you can also do like a full cover plastisol this technique is really popular especially with kind of like street programs so for this one we have like a puff ink below and this like full coverage class all sudden people like the feel of a print so it really comes down to customer preference on that one so next let's talk about water me spinning with water base it typically comes down more to the color of the garment then the actual fabric so light colored Heather will take water-based paint very similar to a light colored solid we love the feel again because your so discharge printing on Heather's won't work as well as discharge printing on 100% cotton because that discharge agent only works with the cotton fibers of the shirt so it's really going to come down to the color here's some prints that we did with just a discharge each end and you're still going to get a light in effect which is great but it's just really important to do your testing and know that you're not going to get as bright of a discharge result with Heather's as you would as 100% cotton DTG is another printing technique that works better on 100% cotton but it's also possible with Heather's with this technique you're going to really need to do you're testing a polyester yarns we'll take the BT GE differently than 100% cotton so with this print here we got a great result but it took the printer a lot of Rd to come up with the right amount of pretreat and the right ink settings to achieve this effect another thing you want to be careful with when DTG printed on any blends is make sure to wash and scratch test it because someone that ink might come off in the washer when you're scratching it it's not as durable on the synthetic yarns as it is on the natural under the second option moving on to tiger tribe ones are one of the softest fabrics on the market but because there are three types of yarns the poly cotton and rayon and each take it differently printing on them can be trickier than printing on the fabric so you've covered up until this point however as consumer preference continues to trend for the softer garment it's important to know how to print on tribal ones and choose an ink that complements garment so because try one is largely a synthetic fabric you do have to be aware of dye migration again this will really come down to color we tested all of our try once with three types of ink cotton white 50/50 and poly white and we'll be releasing those printing tips on our site by the end of the year but what we did notice across the board is some on some try blends the cotton II work just fine where other colors didn't need a Polliwog here to stop that dye migration from coming through the e so you can see on the blue the results vary a little bit and you actually do need that Holly Walker ink to stop the dye migration whereas the some colors like this play you'll find the 50/50 in the cotton whitening perform pretty much to say on some try ones you'll need to use your gray under base to prevent any dye migration with some of the trickier colors also another tip to keep in mind is using a stretch additive or softener will help keep the stretch with the garment in the soft hand feel we're pretty impossible tripods already have a super soft hands so you don't want to print a bulletproof shield on it we lot of water-based ink for this reason my moms will take water basing pretty similar to 100% cotton we did a past video about doing water base and discharge printing on our heather solids and try it once and you can see there wasn't too much difference between our solid men and our min tripod with water base you always want to be aware of the color different colors will interact they eat differently so make sure to test first discharge printing will also work on tripods but you're not going to get as bright as an effect as you would with 100% cotton so the end result will be a more muted effect you can see this print is with the discharge agent only and this has been discharged plus color added so you're gonna definitely get more of a muted effect than you would on 100% cotton with this charge director garment is usually not recommended on trial on fabric however the Bella cam is tri-blend reacts differently than most brands because the synthetic material acts more like a cotton than a plastic we also have the super soft surface for our dry ones compared to some other brands so it is possible to get a great DTG print but again like with Heather's you're going to want to do a lot of wash testing and scratch testing and basically a lot of Rd to get the levels right it's not going to be as easy as 100% cotton so we do recommend this technique on try blends for expert dgg printers only you can also keep press on our tribe lens one thing you'll have to be aware of is because there's a lot of synthetic material you'll want here it at a lower temperature and for a less amount of time so we usually recommend about 280 degrees for 8 to 10 second so because our time moms are 50% polyester it's actually a really good candidate for sublimation if you're looking for more of a vintage effect so with sublimation the ink is gonna adhere to the polyester fibers only so with this we had a much brighter print and this is after a wash you can see it's got more of this vintage faded effect which is really popular and a try one will feel a lot nicer than 100% polyester shirts so if you're a sublimation printer out there I definitely recommend experimenting with there try buns another cool thing is we're one of the whole new brands to have solid try blends so our solid white try blend is really great for sublimation now moving on to my personal favorite fabrication flowy color business flow is one of our best-selling collections because it's one of the softest fabrics we have but because it's made of synthetic fibers polyester and viscose and it doesn't have the cotton that printers are used to usually working with we know can be intimidating for some printers out there so definitely check out last week's video if you want to learn more about what I'm about to cover pasta salting works great on flowy it's one of the ideas to work with something to keep in mind if you're using pasta sauce Inc is you want to try to keep the original feel of the garment so you can do that by adding in a softener or a stretch palliative and on some darker colors you're also going to want to use the Polly bark of these water base contain is another technique that works really great on our Chloe colleague visco it's gonna keep the soft hand of the original permit so we love this when you're working with artwork that has more coverage like these butterflies here the whites are going to be more vibrant as with any water-based printing than some of your lighter colors that go grey so discharge printing won't work on Chloe poly viscose because there's no cotton content for the discharge agent to remove so if you're working with a darker color garment and you want to get the stopped and effect of a discharge print we recommend this water-based technique that we actually featured in last week's video so what we did is use a water-based poly blocker base and then use a water-based ink on top this print here has an amazing feel and amazing stretch and it's done with water-based ink on clothing when it comes to DC depending on the flow this is another one where we've seen really awesome results so DC you turning on our Chloe is recommended for experts only but because this is such a popular fabrication and you are interested and learning some tricks for how to do it you can check out one of our past videos double link in the description keep pressing on Chloe is actually pretty similar to try one because it's more of a synthetic material you're gonna want to heat transfer at lower temperatures less time some people might not think to sublimate on our poly viscose but it is actually an awesome proverb for that there's much more polyester content than the Pittsburgh one so you're going to get a brighter print than you saw earlier so this is 65% polyester so it's not going to be as bright as a hundred percent polyester but it feels amazing and the colors are only going to be slightly more muted than they would be with 100% polyester and you're going to get a garment that customers respond to a lot better than 100% poly and you can see you can also sublimate on lighter colors like a speech polyester is really big in the athletic market and while we don't have any under percent polyester T's in our Bella canvas line Bella campus also is a line Club allspark so we're gonna touch on the printing techniques you can do with poly using our pulse Portland so with 100% poly you're gonna want to use a plastic salty you definitely have to be aware of dye migration since the shirt is 100% polyester so you're going to want to use the poly e and/or a poly walker base as well just depending on color and if you're seeing the new documentation come through you won't really get great results using a water-based ink on 100% poly and discharge won't work at all because there's no cotton content in 100% poly shirt with etg we've heard it is possible on 100% poly but it's definitely tricky and we definitely don't recommend it as the most DTG from the fabric when you keep pressing on in a percent polyester just make sure you're using a material that's resistant to dye migration sublimation is really great because the ink actually becomes the part of the original garment so it similar to a water-based ink you're not going to feel the sublimation print out we hope you enjoyed this video we obviously couldn't cover a lot of the intricacies involved in each of these printing techniques this is meant to be more of a broad overview so make sure to do your own testing also make sure to ask any questions that you have in the comments below I'll try to get back to you and subscribe to your channel for a new video every week [Music] you", "lgzpQulFVOE": "t-shirts are always one of the main things I feel like we're all looking to buy because there's so many different brands out there there's so much different quality out there and finding good quality basic street wear shirts and obviously sometimes pretty different personally I love to avoid all the cheap kind of brands out there and I like to buy a little bit more premium quality when it comes to stuff like shirts so today's video I want to talk about one of the new brands I've found in terms of basic clothing and that is reporter and today we're gonna be talking about all about reporter t-shirts up without saying too much more let's get into it what's up guys if you're new here my name is Matt I make a ton of videos like this on YouTube twice a week usually if you're new here I suggest subscribing them below it is definitely a growing community and I appreciate all the support I get in every video so let's talk about reporter who is reporter well reporter is a wholesale like dirt hoodie sweatshirt sweat pant company and they really try to capitalize on people who are looking for very basic clothing but a more premium quality so today we're gonna talk to my t-shirt I picked up three of them in my left hand which would be on your right side was gonna be a black I'm currently wearing their vintage wash shirt and on my right your left will be the white t-shirt so something interesting to note about with all these shirts is that they're all made in Portugal there's different levels of cotton that they use all three of the ones I'm wearing right now are more of their like ultra luxury ones which in my opinion are just heavier t-shirts I actually did order two white ones that were supposed to be one in the regular original version and one of the luxury cotton version but they ran out of the white one in my size and the reason why I wanted two of those is really because of how I've been wearing my shirts and stuff lately is I've been wearing stuff like this under like a sweatshirt or something that's what kind of piece of the bottom and picks out a little bit at the top but honestly the guys over at reporters or customer service can reach out to me and actually texted me saying hey like we'll give you an upgrade to the ultra version because it ran out and in my opinion I need to mention that because you don't get that all the time and most people would have just canceled the order they wouldn't even let you know they would just strip just cancel if you get one shirt and be curious on why so for them to reach out honestly I thought was worth mentioning it lets me know what the customer service team cares lets me know the Britain cares about the customer more than it cares about like three dollars in profit and I'm hoping that I can help them of the three dollars of loss and profit for me can go ahead and go back into other people buying their stuff and know this isn't a sponsor post didn't get any of these products to free I just got like the ultra version of this one at a slightly discounted rate but not on purpose so getting it to the actual quality of the shirt some stuff I'm talking about everything else but the shirt quality honestly these are extremely good quality shirts they're very thick they feel way better than gilding they feel way better than American Apparel in my opinion iOS a that they feel better than some of the LA apparel they're better than pretty much any other quality shirt that's like a wholesale division that I felt personally I'd say these are closer to what you will find in an essentials t-shirt than what you will find with the minimal ones and even I'm going on record and saying I actually love the quality of this so much better than the essentials teachers and I think the main differences between these reporter shirts and essentials are kind of twofold one is that these have virtually no branding on these like literally is no branding because you're supposed to put your own branding on this is supposed to be for like a brand to buy but if you look there's literally no tag here at all it's just my size tag which I about these all and a medium i think the other difference between this and an essentials teacher would be that the neck collar is a little bit higher up it is more like kind of reaching more mock neck territory when it comes to kind of how its spinning this is the only thing that i don't really care for on this i wish it was a little bit lower because like my collarbone is down here and it is like way up here you can probably even see that i have like a tan this is where I normally have my t-shirts and it's a lot higher than that something to keep in mind for for summer because if you can have a tan you really don't want this a shirt on at that point cousin you have a tan up here and any heavy either tan down here something to keep in mind now in terms of sizing I went down the size I normally wear a large and all my shirts it's my true to size size I went down to medium just based off their size guide fact I didn't really want arm links that went down past my elbow and for me these fit perfectly how I wanted it to I didn't want super oversize but I did want it more of a drop shoulder relaxed fit and for me personally this fits the cut and with sizing on this for me personally I went down size you can go true to size and I've definitely seen it work the guy that really pushed my hand to buying this was on the Facebook group so looked at someone honey I think is like Luciano and hopefully I'll have like some type of photo up of his Instagram page but he was really the person I saw and he went true to size with his shirts I went down a size and I personally feel like that fits better for how I like my clothing and not looking super duper big and stuff but just looking just right for me I honestly think with this vintage wash I think that could have been a little bit better of a wash with it pairing it to this locusts and wild honey t-shirt that I bought from Paul funny fella when he dropped it this is a vintage watch shirt through and through a little bit softer feel to it I would say that the wash on the t-shirt is night and day you can pretty much see the difference like this is more like a wash black this is in my opinion a vintage wash but then again this could wash down where the wall I haven't put these in the washing machine yet although I do plan on putting this one in the washing machine soon sure suit I can't frickin talk today and just kind of see how that turns out be really interesting to see if I can turn it more into this vintage style look that's kind of why I bought it rather than just like kind of washed black we're just gonna looks like a dark grey in a way I think the only improvements that could be made to this shirt to make it perfect for me personally so just definitely differs from person to person I'll be lowering the neck a little bit probably like an inch down it'd be a little bit more of a normal like look to it but still being able to peek out a little bit under like a sweatshirt or things like that and for me I don't really care for super long what's called sleeves on stuff I like a little bit shorter so having it like in the middle of where your arm and meet with still drop shoulder I think would look really good but being in the minority there but just something that personal preference for all this everybody has their own preferences from me something like that I think it would be my everyday wear for t-shirts I do plan on checking out their hoodies and sweatpants once we drop more the vintage II wash stuff and I'll be giving my thoughts on them in a video once that comes along but overall from what I've seen in the Facebook group with other people talking definitely worth the money you definitely have racer prices a little bit to be very worried about that if you're looking for best quality street wear blanks that you can basically buy a better quality t-shirt for pretty low prices made in Portugal using very high quality Cotton's I would say that reporter is our best bet and I would say they are someone that you should starting to buy from and if all else fails you spend $25 that $30 on a t-shirt and if you don't like you don't like it I guarantee you you spent more on t-shirts that don't fit you well and if all spills can wear it to that there's no branding on them I don't really know it's ink go buy one for yourself I'll leave a link to them down in the description below and well if you want to start a brand with these go ahead you're probably the best feeling t-shirts on the market for like branding with your own screen print on them and that has been today's video about reporter let me know you gets to give them in the comments below if you have any thoughts or different opinions leave them below I would love to hear them and I think would help other people with their purchases and if you want to I would suggest subscribing below really helps out a small youtube channel like myself and worry I'll leave a like on the video to let me know that you guys liked it and want to see more videos like this on my channel and again with all this craziness going around and me being stuck at home for days upon days you just want to say thank you guys so much for watching this video and have a great rest of your day week month and I'll see you in the next video peace", "vnRV3p3Deq0": "hey everybody it's rachel with die press today i want to show you how to use poly t plus for supplementing cotton and cotton blends poly t plus is a one step formula that allows you to prep and sub a shirt in only five minutes paula t plus does two things at once it removes the chemical sizing and it also lays down a polyester resin on the cotton threads let's talk briefly about chemical sizing thread is coated in chemical sizing during the manufacturing process to prevent the thread from breaking while they weave the fabric together sizing can cause two problems one is it will burn and scorch when heated and it will also cause your image to fade after the first second wash poly t plus is sold as a concentrate there are three reasons why we sell it as a concentrate number one we sell it as a concentrate to prevent freezing when we ship it to colder regions we also sell it as a concentrate to extend the shelf life of the product and lastly we sell it as a concentrate to save you money because we don't want you to have to pay for us to ship water across the country since i'm pretty sure you have water where you live here are the four smaller sizes that we sell of poly t plus the four ounce bottle poly t plus will make 16 ounces of spray when you add water and it will coat about 30 shirts the 8 ounce bottle of poly t plus concentrate will make 32 ounces of spray and we'll coat about 60 shirts 16 ounce bottle we'll make a half a gallon or 64 ounces of spray and we'll coat about 120 shirts and lastly the 32 ounce bottle of poly t plus will make a gallon of spray and coat about 240 t-shirts all right so before we spray the shirt we do want to get our heat press heated up because this formula needs to be pressed while wet so i need to make sure my heat press is ready so as soon as i'm done spraying i can press it wet in order to remove the sizing and cure the poly t-plus at the same time so i've set the heat press at 330 degrees and that is currently warming up so while that's warming up we're going to go ahead and spray the shirt the first thing i want to do is i already made up my spray i took the four ounces of concentrate poured it into this 16 ounce bottle and then i added 12 ounces of purified water and shake it up and you're ready to go okay so you want to spray the poly t plus about the size of your image this cardboard is just slightly larger than my image so i'm going to use this as a template to mark to have an idea of where to spray and then you're just going to spray you get it good and wet you need to have it wet in order to see steam and to remove the sizing so this step is actually going to be wetter than the second coat that we will apply after all right i think that's looking pretty good next thing you need to do is cover it with parchment paper any other type of paper will stick so it must be parchment paper uh this is parchment paper from costco the thicker it is the better because if it's really thin and flimsy it will tend to get wrinkles which will press into your shirt so we lay that across there and you should see some steam coming out here okay that's 30 seconds open it up that first coat is dry now we're going to apply a second coat this is the second and final coat this one can be a little bit lighter than the first coat and i'm just i kind of remember where my image is going so i'll just spray that area right and roll it in again all right oh and by the way this shirt is actually a 60 cotton 40 polyester and we recommend starting with a minimum of 40 polyester because you're gonna get more vibrant images uh the shirt that i'm wearing is actually 100 cotton um i did this whole technique on this shirt and it's already been washed but in my opinion it's not as vibrant if there's at least a little bit of polyester in there all right now this time this is the second time we're pressing it wet this time we're only going to press it for 20 seconds and this is to cure and dry the poly t plus so we're ready to subtle mate okay all right now the shirt is ready to sublimate so we're going to set it aside before we sublimate we need to pre-press at 385 for five seconds to make sure there's no more moisture left in the shirt okay i'm ready to subtle mate i got this really cute design from debbie does design and i'm going to put this on the shirt center there and what i like to do is i like to cover my sublimation paper in this case it's just multi-purpose paper cover that with regular copy paper so this absorbs any extra ink that might pass through that way when i do my butcher paper i can keep using this butcher paper over and over again and not have to worry not throw it away and not be so wasteful okay so we have the temperature of 385 we're going to press medium pressure for 70 seconds and actually i just did want to show you here we don't i don't have anything on the press except for the thick rubber mat that came with my heat press and that is because all the seams are off this press if you were doing a smaller shirt like a onesie or kid shirt or even a raglan shirt you would need to lift up the image area higher using a silicone mat so you would lift cut it about the size of your image put it underneath the shirt so that your image area is higher than the thick seams on your shirt like i said medium firm pressure 70 seconds all right 70 seconds is up all right looks good nice and vibrant still feels really soft if you happen to get too much coating on there and it feels a little stiff the softness will come back after the first wash thanks for joining me today be sure to subscribe to our youtube channel also join us on facebook look for the group titled dye sublimation that is sponsored by die press for more details about polyt plus check out www.dipress.com", "mQWlqt4xOY0": "- Hello, everybody. My name is Jennifer Maker. Today we are learning how\nto make personalize tshirts with our Cricuts and iron vinyl on the Great Maker Show and Tell. (soft music) So one of the reasons that many people buy a Cricut in the\nfirst place is to be able to make awesome personalized\ntshirts like this one. And it's really easy to see why. The Cricut is perfect for tshirt making and it cuts out iron on\nvinyl designs like a champ. A couple of months ago I did a full color print and then cut tutorial for tshirts and it was a big hit. But print and cut can\nbe a little challenging for beginners so I wanted\nto dial things back a bit, and do a very easy tutorial on how to make a tshirt using iron on\nvinyl with a Cricut. So for this project, we're\ngonna be working with iron on vinyl, also known as\nheat transfer vinyl or HTV. And this is a special vinyl that has a heat sensitive adhesive that will stick to fabric and other\nsurfaces when pressed down with a heat source like a\nhousehold iron or an Easy Press. And I will show you how to\ndo both in this tutorial. Now the cool thing about the Cricut is that you can cut out a design or a name or really whatever you\nwant from iron on vinyl using lots of different\ncolors and textures and designs like this foil. And if you do it right,\nyour shirt can be washed up to 50 times before you\nstart to have any issues. And I'm gonna show you\nthe right way to do it in this video so that\nyou get great results on your first try. Now because the thing is there's really a bunch of things that can go wrong when you're making an iron on tshirt. You need to remember to\nmirror it or flip the design. You have to put your\nvinyl on the cutting mat with the right side up. You have to weed the right\npart out of your design, preheat your shirt, set your temperature to the right amount, press it long enough, and remove the carrier\nsheet at the right time. The good news is that I'm\ngoing to be right here with you the whole time, by your side, making sure that you're able to do this right. So let's start with the\nmaterials that you're gonna need and then I'm gonna show you\nhow to prepare a tshirt design for cutting on your Cricut. So here's everything that I'll be using in this tutorial to make a\nsimple, basic iron on tshirt. We're going to use 100% cotton tshirts. I bought these from both\nMichaels and Joann's I believe. They are Gildan brand I will link to those in this tutorial. Now there's some debate as to whether you need to prewash or not. Cricut recommends that you prewash and thus I have prewashed these. Some people feel that it's not necessary, especially because it\ndoesn't look quite as good if you intend to sell them. One thing that is very important, however, is that they are preshrunk,\nwhich this brand is by the way. So it's up to you whether you\nwant to prewash it or not. We're also going to need some vinyl. I'm going to use Cricut\nvinyl for this tutorial and we're going to use\nvirtually every kind of Cricut vinyl that I can find, so that you can see the different styles and how it looks and how it works to actually apply it to the shirt. You also need a way to cut out your vinyl and we're going to use a Cricut. And all you need for\nthat is Cricut Explorer or a Cricut Maker, and the\nregular fine point blade. That's all that's necessary. Also want the standard grip mat, that's the green mat right here. As far as tools go, I'm\ngoing use a weeding tool and a tweezer can come in very helpful from when you're weeding. I also recommend a pair of\nscissors or a craft knife so that you can cut your\nvinyl off of the roll easily. And I like to use a brayer so I can adhere my vinyl down to my mat, so\neverything is nice and smooth. And to apply the vinyl to your shirt, you're going to want to use an Easy Press or a household iron. Or if you have it, a heat press. I don't have a heat press,\nso I won't be showing you that in this video, but I will show you how to use the Easy Press and\na regular iron to iron with. You're also going to need\na surface to iron on, not an ironing board. I'll be using an Easy\nPress mat to do that. All right, so let's head on over to Cricut Design Space so I can show you how to prepare your design. So here we are in Cricut Design Space, and we wanna start by\nclicking on new project. And I recommend that you use templates, which is accessible if you're on the desktop version of\nCricut Design Space. And I think it's just really helpful for determining the size\nif you have a template. So I'm gonna go ahead and use\nthe classic tshirt template. And I'm gonna turn off the\ngrid just so we can see that. So women's short sleeve. Medium tshirt. And we'll even change the\ncolor since we're going, since I'm going to start\nwith a yellow tshirt. But this part doesn't matter. This is just for designing. So here we have a yellow shirt. And we need a design for this. Now there's tons of awesome\ndesigns in Cricut Design Space. Just click on images and\nyou can search through various things, you know. Ask me about my beard. Never stop looking up. These are all awesome designs, very cute. There's the Cricut Cutie. But I've created a\ndesign that I want to use for this project. So I am going to upload that and you're all welcome to\nuse this design free as well. So if you go to my blog\nat jennifermaker.com and you click on libraries here. Now if you don't have a\npassword, you can request one for free here. If you've got your\npassword, go ahead and click enter the library and you'll be prompted to enter the password. Now I have everything organized in here and we're looking for\nthe Craft Heart SVG file. I'm gonna go ahead and download that. And we're gonna open that up. And there we go, we have that right there. Okay. Now we go back to Cricut Design\nSpace and click on upload. Then upload image, and then browse. And we're gonna go find,\ninto our downloads folder, we're gonna go find that craft heart Jennifer Maker directory and\nyou may have to unzip it. And we're gonna go ahead\nand upload the SVG file. And if you're not familiar\nwith how to use SVGs I hae a whole training series on that that will walk you through it step by step at jennifermaker.com/svgs. All right, so I uploaded\nthis and now I'll go ahead and save it to my image library. And then I'm going to select it here. And then click insert images and it's gonna show up on my canvas. And I've already sized this\nto look right on a tshirt. Now you will notice that\nI have the design here, which is a winged heart and\nit says craft in the middle. And then I have this little\nheart down here in the corner. Now this heart is here\nfor testing purposes. If you don't want to\ntest, you can go ahead and hide it over here with\nthe I icon, just like that. But I really like to\ntest before I, you know, make a mistake on a tshirt. I like to make sure that my iron on vinyl works well and I have\nmy settings properly set before I go ahead and put it on a shirt. And I highly recommend you do that too. So if you'd like to test, I\nrecommend that you go ahead and cut out this heart. You're not gonna keep that heart there. What we're going to do\nis move this heart down probably to the corner here like this. But it's not necessary\nto do that right now. You can do that later when\nyou're doing your testing. But this is the design, if\nyou wanna change anything about it you certainly can right now. I have it set to red,\nwhich I'm going to do one of my designs in red. Let me zoom in a little bit\ndown here with the buttons in the lower left corner. Now I wanna note one thing here, which is if for any reason you don't want the name Jennifer Maker\nto show up on your shirt, which is fine, I won't be offended. You can totally do that. If you click on the design and then click on contour over here,\nyou can actually select each one of these little hearts, I'm sorry, each one of\nthese little letters. And you can see them here as well. If you select them, they\nwill actually be removed from the design itself. So we can get rid of all of these letters or anything else in the design\nthat you might not want. Fr example, perhaps you don't\nwant the little shine here. So you could get rid of that as well. Perhaps you don't want it to\nbe outlined like, you know, the wings outlined. So you could actually remove that as well. And it would look like this. Okay, but if you do want\nthose things, which I do, you're gonna want to go\nahead and show everything so that's what I've got there. All right, so everything is here and it's all ready to go. Of course, we can double\ncheck that our design looks the way we want. This design is 7.99, it's\nbasically eight inches wide which I think is a really\ngood size for an adult tshirt. You can make it bigger if you like. You can make it smaller, it's up to you, but I have sizes to look good on a tshirt. But you can use this template to determine what might look good, right? So for example, this, which is we could cut this out on the\nCricut, is probably, no. It's definitely too big. Because remember, people are 3D, right? And this would start\nto wrap around the body if it was this big. So I think that generally\nspeaking eight inches is actually a really\ngood size for our tshirt. So there is our design all ready to go. And it's time to make it. So we click the make\nit button in the upper right hand corner right\nhere, just like this. Now there's something very\nimportant that we must do for iron on vinyl. And we must mirror our images. And this is true for all iron on vinyl that I've ever worked with. You have to, when you\ncut the iron on vinyl, you actually cut it upside down and that means that we need to mirror it, which means to cut it, you know, with the design flipped as\nif we were looking at it in a mirror. It's very easy to do\nin Cricut Design Space. Over here on the left, it says mirror and you just toggle this\nso it becomes green. And it flips around just like this. And I also suggest that\nyou take that extra little heart that you're gonna test with and move it over so there's\njust a little bit more space, so just over here like this. You just click and drag that. And then we click continue. And then you'll want to\nconnect your machine, if you have more than one like I do. And if not, it will show\nup here automatically. I'm gonna connect my Cricut Explorer two, you can of course use a\nMaker for this as well. If you're using a Cricut\nExplorer like I am, I recommend that you\nset your dial to custom. That will allow you to\nfine tune your materials in the Cricut Design Space. I actually always leave my dial on custom. And then we need to choose our materials. So for the very first iron on vinyl shirt that I'll be doing in this video, we're going to use\nCricut everyday iron on. So I'm just going to search for everyday. And there it is, I'm gonna\nselect that and click done. And I like to switch my pressure to more. It's just something\nthat works well for me. So we've got it set to everyday iron on and we have it set to more. Now there's a little note here that says make sure mirror is turned\non and iron on material is placed shiny side down. And I will go over that\nlater in this video, but make sure that this mirror\nover here says mirror on. It's very important. All right, so we're ready to cut this. Let's go ahead and talk\nabout how to determine which side of the iron on vinyl to cut. All right, so it's time to\ncut out our iron on vinyl. We're gonna use a standard grip mat. And for our first tshirt, we're going use Cricut\nEveryday Iron On Vinyl. Which I've already opened so that makes it a little bit easier. I could just slide that right off. Now my design is, we'll use the full length\nand it's four inches. And you can always check\nthat in Cricut Design Space if you don't recall how\nmuch vinyl to cut off. You can just use scissors\nor you can use a craft knife to just cut it off, which\nI will do right now. And it's approximately\nfour inches, right there. You can of course be\nmore exact if your like. Go. Tape that back up and\ndon't forget to put your, you can either put back on and tape it or slide it in the\nbottom so that you don't forget what kind of vinyl you used. All right, so now the\nslightly tricky part, which is which side of\nthe vinyl to put down. I've created an entire\nvideo to help you identify which is the side to cut on your vinyl. The easy rule to remember\nis shiny side down. Okay, so we're gonna go ahead\nand put shiny side down. There are some exceptions,\nand that happens when it's shiny on both sides and\nit's hard to tell which side. And my video explains exactly what to do, oops, that's not in the right spot. My video shows you exactly what to do and how to determine the right side to cut your iron on vinyl every\ntime so that you don't waste any materials. I like to use my brayer to make sure that the vinly's really\nwell adhered to the mat. So there's no wrinkles. You don't want any\nwrinkles when you cut this. All right, there we go, that's all set. Now our next step is to cut this out. So we've already prepared\nit in Design Space and sent it to our Cricut. So we're gonna go ahead and cut it out. Now you wanna make sure that\nyou have your fine point blade in and that everything\nis all good to go. And you wanna watch for\nthe flashing Cricut button. And when that's ready to go, you go ahead and you press the button\nand it starts to cut. All right, there we go. And once it's cut, we unload our machine with the unload button. And we have our material all cut out. I don't know that you can see that, but it's definitely cut out. And that looks excellent. So we peel it off our mat. Sometimes it's easier to place it face down on your mat like that. I like to tuck my mats under my machine so they're out of the way, just like that. All right, and then we\nare left with our design. Which we can see here. This is going to be the top of it and this is covered\nwith the carrier sheet. It's stuck to it already,\nso you don't need to have any kind of transfer tape or anything. It's actually pretty awesome in that way. But what we do need to do\nnow is weed our project. So weeding means to\nremove all of the vinyl that we don't want\ntransferred to our project when we iron it on or use a heat press. So that means we remove\nall the extra little bits. And you're gonna want a\nweeding tool for this, and I also use my craft knife because I like to get it started. I find it very difficult to just sort of peel it away from the edge. It never really wants to\ncome free very easily. So what I do is make a\nsmall knick in the corner. You don't wanna cut all the way through. Just cut through the iron on vinyl. And I'm on the matte side,\nthe cut side right now. And then it's easier to peel off once you've made that cut, I find. So I have just knicked\nthe corner right here. And now I can get my fingernail under the edge of the vinyl easier because of that little knick. If you have any problems,\nyou can use your weeding tool to kind of pull it away like this. There we go. And once you have it started, you just continue to pull it\naway from the carrier sheet. And your design will\nstay on the carrier sheet and the part that you do\nnot want will pull away, just like this. There we go. Now if you look at it,\nyou'll see that there are, not all of it has been removed, right? So we've got the parts inside\nthe heart and the wings, and the letters as well. Let's go ahead and cut\nthis off right here. And we'll save this heart for our test. And always keep your little\nscraps off to the side, away from your work\narea so that they don't get mixed in with other things. All right, so here's our\nheart, we'll set that there. Now the design has hollow wings. So we will just use the weeding tool to just sort of scrape\nit away, that's all I do. And then I usually pull\nit away with my fingers, once I've got a good grip on it. And it's not a difficult project to weed. The trickiest part is the letters. I did intentionally put easy things and hard things in this design, because if you're a beginning\nand trying to learn, it's helpful to have both. And then if it turns out that\nyou can't get these letters weeded very well, you could\nalways just cut them out, right? Worst comes to worst. All right, so we need to get\nthe top of our heart here. There's the top. And we keep our bit of\nvinyl off to the side. And the bottom. And then we also have , okay now, kind of usually hold this up to the light to see which parts you need. You can of course use a light box. But I am not using one today. But always, these little\nbits, if they get stuck anywhere on your plastic,\nyou know the carrier sheet they might get transferred to your tshirt, so always keep those\noff of your work surface as you are weeding. And that comes away from the T as well. And there's a section\nbetween the F and the T. And the bottom of the F. There we go. Now as I said, these letters are going to be the trickiest part,\ndown here where it says Jennifer Maker, it's\ndefinitely the trickiest part. You just be patient and if you need to, you could use your tweezers\nto get the little bits off without hurting the letters. All right, there we have\nweeded our whole design. Let's see if I can give\nyou a better look at this. And that's what it looks like. And this is how it will pair\nwhen we put it on our shirt. So now it's time to\napply our iron on design onto our tshirt. I'm gonna start with the Easy Press, because I think many people have it and it's really, I really\nthink it's quite a bit superior to an iron and that\nmakes it a little easier to do. So we're gonna do a test\nwith the Easy Press. And we're gonna make sure\nthat this heart applies and the carrier sheet\ncomes off and it looks good using our settings. So this is our Cricut pressing mat. And we're going to use the yellow shirt. All right, so I'm gonna\nput this heart right here in the corner just like\nthis so that we can test it and make sure that our settings are good. Of course, we need to figure out what the right settings are. So there is a whole\ninteractive calculator online, the Cricut EasyPress Interactive\nQuick Reference Guide will tell you exactly what temperature and how long to preheat\nand how much pressure, and what everything that you need to do to get excellent results\nwithout having to guess at it. I still like to do the test though, because I mean tshirts aren't inexpensive. All right, so here we go. So we're going to use Everyday\nIron On as our material. And our base material is 100% cotton. And we are using a Cricut EasyPress Mat. And this now tells us\nexactly what we need to use for our project. So it wants us to prewash\nitem, which I have. Again, without fabric softener. Set the temperature to 315 degrees, preheat for five seconds,\napply heat and gentle pressure for 30 seconds. Flip the material over\nand press for 15 seconds. Peel off warm. And of course, you know, you need to allow 24 hours before you wash it. All right, so let's do that. All right, so we're gonna\nturn on the Cricut EasyPress with the power button right there. We want to set it to\n315 degrees so we click, we press the thermometer button. Just once, and then press the plus sign until we're at 315. Then press the thermometer button again. And we want 30 seconds,\nwhich it's already set to but if you don't know how to do that, you press the stopwatch button. And then you use the plus and minus signs to adjust it to the proper length of time. And then you press the\nstopwatch button again. So right now we have it\nset to 315 for 30 seconds, which is going to be\nour maximum press time, so that's the right time\nthat we want to use. And the instructions call\nfor preheating our material. And all that means is we're\ngonna take our EasyPress and we're gonna press\nit down on our material for at least five seconds,\nit can be a little longer. I don't think that part really matters. The idea is you wanna heat it up so that it removes moisture, it kind of also preshrinks the tshirt as well. And it gets it ready for the\niron on vinyl application. So that's pretty important. Now you do wanna wait\nuntil your Cricut EasyPress says that it's on the right temperature. But what I love about\nthis is that we can say a specific temperature, which\nwe can't do with our iron. And it'll also time it for us. And it's got, also has this\nreally excellent flat surface that makes it so much easier to use. And this, by the way, is the\nsmallest Cricut EasyPress. And there are two other sizes. But this project is fine\nwith the smaller size. All right, so we're all ready to go. We're at 315, we have our\ntimer set for 30 seconds. We're gonna start by\npreheating our surface for five seconds. You can press this button\nand it'll count down five seconds if you don't\nwanna just guess at it. All right, that's five seconds. All right, so now we want to\nplace our heart, our test, in the corner just like this. Right, now we're placing it, kind of there's a sticky\nside to the carrier sheet and a non-sticky side. You're pressing the sticky\nside down just like this, and make sure there's no\nother little bits of anything, little, you know, parts that you weeded or anything like that. Make sure your Cricut EasyPress\nsays the right temperature and number of seconds again. And then we're going\nto place it on our mat, and we're going to press the green button that starts the timer. And you want to give it gentle pressure. That means that you don't\ngive, you know, lean into it. You don't compress your mat. You're just giving it a gentle pressure. So I'm just gently pushing\ndown right now on my tshirt. There should be some\npressure, but it should be, you know, firm pressure\nor anything like that. Just gentle. And we're going to wait\nuntil we are a little, our Cricut EasyPress will\nbeep when it's all finished. All right. And now we need to flip it over and press it again for 15 seconds. Same temperature, 15 seconds. And there we go. So we can just watch the\ncount down on the EasyPress to make sure that we're doing 15 seconds. You don't need to move it around like you might with an iron. You're just pressing\ndown with gentle pressure for this particular\nsetting, for this shirt, and this iron on material. All right, now our next\nstep is to peel off warm. That does not mean peel off hot. Because right now it's very hot. If you were press your finger on this, you could even burn your finger. You want to wait a little\nbit, until it's warm to the touch instead of hot to the touch. So you know, that will\ndepend a little bit. You know, 10, 15 seconds,\nmaybe 30 seconds. I like to lift up the\ncorner, see how it feels. Does it feel too hot? Definitely too hot, when you press on it and it feels too hot, it's too hot. So you just wanna give it a little time. Don't confuse warm peel with hot peel. It's when a... So the plastic is now warm. All right, so now I would\nsay it's warm instead of hot. So we're going to gently\npeel off the carrier sheet. Just like that. And we have our heart. I'm gonna give you a closer look at this. So here's a closer look\nat what it looks like. You can see that it looks\nlike it's pretty well adhered. I don't see it pulling off anywhere. All right, so we've determined that, so our heart looks good and\nour EasyPress setting are good so we're ready to actually\ncreate this shirt. The next step is position our design so it's centered on the shirt. Because if we just guess,\nwe might not get it right. Let's move this over a little bit. So I could totally just eyeball\nthis and say, put it here. What you can do is use the tag at the top as a center mark for the heart. But there is a center\nmark for your design, but there is a better way, actually. I recommend that you take your shirt and you fold it in half. So match up your sleeves. Like this. And fold it in half. Just like this. And use your EasyPress or your\niron to just put a little, little crease there, just a little bit. Right, just a little bit of one. So that we could determine\nthe exact center. And now with you open it up, you will see that you\ncan see the exact center of your shirt, which is right here. Right, so now we know\nexactly where the center is, and smooth that out so\nthere's no wrinkles. You can still just barely see that. I can, maybe you can't, but I\ncan definitely see the crease. Now we use that crease\nto center our design. I prepared this design\nwith a very easy way to see our center, which\nis the center of the heart. So this is a great beginner piece. Now your next thing that\nyou might be wondering is, where on the shirt do you put it? Do you put it in the exact\nmiddle of your shirt? So this would be about the exact middle. Do you put it, or how\nhigh up do you put it. So especially, you know, I really think that it's best to put\nthis up a little higher. So I like to put it in the\nupper half of the shirt. I think that looks a lot\nbetter when you do it that way, especially on women. So that we can see the\ndesign and it doesn't get hidden or you know,\nmessed up or whatever because of the shape of the body. It doesn't look weird. So I definitely think the\ndesign is gonna look better in the top half. Right, and to determine\nthe top half of the docu, of the shirt, just fold that in half, and then we know that\nthis is the half here. And so we just center\nthat in the top half. So as long as we've got this\ncentered about right here, this is gonna be just right, right here. This will look great. So we wanna just kind of\nremember this position because we need to preheat our shirt before we apply our design, remember. Just like we did our heart earlier. So I'm gonna set this down here and we're going to use our EasyPress to preheat the area for five seconds. All right. Now we're going to place our design right in the spot that we've\nidentified as being ideal, which would be right here. And you can press it down slightly and it'll kind of stick. It won't stick a lot, but\nenough so that you can put your design on and you know, place it here and then do your EasyPress. Okay, so now it's time to do\nthe pressing for 30 seconds. I'm gonna set this right\non top, just like this. And press the timer. And apply gentle pressure. Make sure your whole design is covered. Oh, I see we're just a little bit too far. That's okay. So what I'm gonna do\nthen, is we're gonna do half of our design on one side and then I will switch\nit to the other side for another 30 seconds. Since we're using the smaller EasyPress. And again, I'm using gentle pressure. All right, and then\nI'm gonna slide it down and do the other half. Just like this. So I'm just lining it up\nright in the very center. So I know exactly where\nto do the other half. And again, just gentle pressure. You don't need to use firm\npressure for this project, and it's important that you don't. It's no more heat and no more pressure is not the solution when\nyou're having issues. Usually the best thing to do is to follow the directions in the Interactive\nGuide for the EasyPress. All right, so now we can flip this over and do the other side for 15 seconds. So for this side I'm gonna kind of just move it back and forth a little bit so it has even heat across it's design, so we don't have to do it twice. I wouldn't wanna do that\nfor the front though, in case that we slid the carrier sheet when we were doing it. But it works okay for the back. All right. So we turn this over and just\nlike with our test heart, we want to wait until our\ndesign is warm instead of hot. It's very important. If you try to peel it when it's hot, it will attempt to peel\nthe vinyl off as well, so it's important that we wait until it's the right temperature. Again, I like to start\nby touching the edges of the plastic, until that feels warm. And then when it does, I\ntouch the design itself. Just be careful, you can\ndefinitely burn yourself, your finger when you're testing. So be mindful of that. It's still definitely hot right now. All right, so now it's warm\nto the touch instead of hot. So now we're gonna gently peel it up. And it's like magic\nbecause our pretty design stays on the shirt without any, you know, weird peeling or coming off or anything because we followed the directions exactly as it told us\nto and that's the key. Cricut has already done\nall of the research to determine what's going to\nwork best with the EasyPress and the material that you're using, and also what you're pressing it on. And again, I'm using\nthe Cricut Pressing Mat, but if you don't have one,\nyou can use a folded towel. What you don't want to\nuse is an ironing board or something like that,\nthat does not work. So there is our finished design. Doesn't that look awesome? That turned out great,\nit's gonna be amazing. And that is really it. All right, so what if you\ndon't have an EasyPress, but you have an iron. I'm gonna show you how that works as well, I've already cut out a design\nand I have my iron turned on. We're going to use the back side of the yellow tshirt\nto do the second design using our iron. Now we're gonna do a test again, just to be absolutely sure. Now you need to set your\ndial to the cotton setting. This is a cotton shirt\nand you have to preheat your shirt for 10 to 15 seconds. It's important always to\npreheat and post heat. And you wanna place your weeded image, liner side up onto the preheated material. And you want to apply medium\npressure with the iron for 25 to 30 seconds. Now you'll notice the bottom of the iron and the EasyPress are different. And the heat is not as evenly\ndistributed on the iron, and so you want to get\nyour iron positioned over the center of your\nimage or your design, as much as you possibly can. It really will make a difference. And you'll notice that\nit stuck to the plastic for a moment just right there. So I'm gonna get a\npiece of parchment paper because I don't trust\nmy iron to not be hurt by that plastic. I don't know why it did that. We're just gonna get some parchment paper and then we don't have to worry about it. And this is just plain old,\nhousehold parchment paper. Nothing special besides that. So here we go, I'm just gonna\nlay that parchment paper right over my design just to protect the surface of my iron. And then we're going to, gonna apply medium pressure\nfor 25 to 30 seconds. Again, we're trying to position the iron right over the image as\nmuch as we possible can. And when we're done, we're\ngonna flip our shirt over, and again we're gonna\napply medium pressure with the iron to the back of the material for an extra 25 to 30 seconds. And just like before, you wanna\npeel it off warm, not hot. When it feels good, go ahead and peel off the carrier sheet and there you go. It looks the same as the one that I did with my EasyPress. All right, so now let's also, now that we've done our\ntest and it worked okay, we're going to put our design\non the back of the shirt. Now it's a little tricker\nbecause we already have our design on the front. And this is where this EasyPress Mat comes in so handy because\ncan put it right inside the shirt, it's the perfect size for it. And it fits right in there\nand we don't have to worry about harming our original vinyl design. It's probably fine, but\nhey, why take chances? And I'm gonna use the tag\non the back of the shirt to identify the center of it. Just like before, we need\nto preheat our material for 10 to 15 seconds. And then we place our design\nwith the carrier sheet up, liner up, onto our shirt and press it down so it's in place and\nwe're gonna put that piece of parchment on there again\njust to be on the safe side. I rather like this iron,\nI don't wanna ruin it. And we're gonna cover our design and apply medium pressure\nfor 25 to 30 seconds. And the directions of\neach type of Cricut vinyl are available just by Googling Cricut and then the name of the vinyl. So right now I'm looking\nat Cricut Everyday Iron On and Application Instructions. Which I will link in the\ndescription for this video, as well as in my tutorial over on my blog. All right, so now we need to flip it over, and that's tricky of\ncourse because this is a double sided shirt, right? So I'm gonna turn it\ninside out and then slip my cutting mat into the inside out shirt, and to press it down for\nanother 25 to 30 seconds with my iron. All right, so let's turn\nthis right side out. And again, we wanna wait\nuntil the carrier sheet is warm, not hot. And our design is also warm, not hot. So you know, 15 to 20\nseconds approximately. You wanna go by feel, just\nbe careful with your fingers. When it looks good, go\nahead and peel it off. And there we go, that worked great. It looks good, feels good. Awesome. And here's how it looks\nwhen it was all done. Everything worked great. So you can use an iron or an EasyPress, it's really up to you and what you want. I prefer the EasyPress\nbecause I don't have to guess at the temperature or the time, but an iron also works. All right, so I'm gonna do a bunch more so that you can see what they look like. This is holographic sparkle,\nwhich I thought was so pretty. I love this, it's gotta\nbe one of my favorites. It was not difficult to\nweed or apply at all. Isn't that just so pretty? Definitely very pretty. And this is Cricut holographic\nsparkle iron on vinyl. And this is Cricut mesh in red. And I think that it's mostly used for like jerseys and such, but it also, I thought it was really cute. Now this is Cricut\nglitter, which I just adore how this looks and I had\nno problems applying it or anything like that. Isn't that cute? Look at that, look how shiny that is. It turned out great, I love the glitter. And this is Cricut foil\nin rose gold, I believe, which is the same exact color\nthat I have on my apron. And I love this color\ncombination, this rose gold and the turquoise, ah this is so pretty. These different iron on finishes are just so much fun to play with. Okay, this might be my favorite. I mean, look at that. I love that it was even\ngood enough to transfer the Jennifer Maker because\nsome of them weren't. You know, for the mesh\none and the glitter one, that was much too find a detail. But the foil one did great. The pattern one was not able\nto transfer Jennifer Maker, but otherwise, I had no\nissues transferring its design to my shirt. And for an experiment, I\ntried putting sport flex on my cotton shirt. Now this is not recommended. Sport flex is for stretchy materials, but I didn't it anyways just\nto see what would happen because some people try it. I don't recommend it, it did work. However, I don't know how\nwell it's going to last, but just as an experiment,\nI did it anyways. I love to test things. So the foil, the pattern,\nand the sport flex. Now to take care of your\nawesome new iron on shirt, it's really important\nthat you allow at least 24 hours after you apply your\nvinyl before you wash it. And when you do wash\nit, turn it inside out and wash and tumble dry. And it's important that\nyou don't bleach it because it'll mess with your vinyl. And it should last at least 50 washes. That is what Cricut says\nabout their product, and in my experience that is very true. I made a tshirt for my\ndaughter a little under two years ago. It's been washed many\ntimes and it still looks just as good as when we first made it. And it was my first tshirt then too. So I think this is a really\ngood beginner project and it's so much fun to\nmake your own tshirts that are personalized and\nlook virtually as good as you might be able to buy in a store. Now if you have problems\nwith your iron on vinyl, and it seems to pull away when you pull at your carrier sheet, it\ncould mean a lot of things. The first thing it may\nmean is that it's just a little bit too soon to pull it away, so stop and wait until it's\ncooled off a little bit more. You still wanna pull most vinyls, not all but most vinyls\nthat we do are warm peel, not cool peel. Though not all, you can check\nthe Cricut Interactive Guide tells you whether it's a\nwarm peel or cold peel. And I also indicate that in my blog post about this tutorial. If that still doesn't work,\ngive it some more heat. So put the carrier sheet back on and apply some more heat with\nthe same amount of pressure. And that's typically the only two things I've ever had to do to fix any problems with iron on vinyl. It's either I pulled it up too fast, or there just really wasn't enough heat. Now one thing I want to\nnote is that some people say that it's really\nimportant that you be able to see the fibers of your\nshirt through your vinyl. And by that I mean, you could\nsee the texture of the shirt. Now I did a lot of\ntesting with specifically the Cricut Everyday Iron On, which I think is what most people are going to be using. And I found the only time that I could get the fibers to show through the vinyl was when I applied too much heat. In other words, I did it\ntwo or three pressings, which I know is not accurate. And I did a little\nresearch and I don't think that it's true that every case you want to see the fibers through your vinyl. You wanna see the texture of it. And in fact, Caesar which\nis an iron on vinyl company, heat transfer vinyl\ncompany that know way more than I do about this, they agree with me. They say that you don't always have to see the texture of your fibers through it for it to be applied correctly. So don't fall into the trap of thinking that you have to see that. What I do notice however,\nthat with correctly applied vinyl I can feel the texture. So it doesn't feel totally smooth. I can feel that the vinyl\nhas melted into the fabric of the shirt and it's, you\nknow, it feels very flat. It doesn't feel like it's\ngoing to wanna peel off when I run my hand over it. And there's a definitely\ntexture on the vinyl itself. So that's what I look for because we don't want\nto over press our shirts and burn our shirts or burn our vinyl, because if we have too much heat we could also harm the adhesive\nand that could cause it to peel after you wear it or wash it. So that's not the answer. So just keep in mind you\ndon't always have to see the texture of the fibers\nthrough your vinyl. Now this tutorial is a, covered a very basic and simple design using a variety of different\niron on vinyls, right? Which you might be\nwondering, can you combine and layer colors? Why, yes you can. And you can put vinyl over\nanother layer of vinyl, just so long as you don't try\nto put anything over glitter, or glitter, mesh or flocked vinyl. In fact I have a whole\ntutorial on layering iron on vinyl that you might really enjoy, if you're ready to take your\ntshirts to the next level. And if you have any questions about making iron on vinyl tshirts,\nplease leave a comment below or post over in my Facebook group at jennifermaker.com/cricutcrafters. And if you're curious about how to make longer lasting shirts using the new Cricut Infusible Inks I\nam getting a whole box of infusible ink materials\nand I'm gonna be making tshirt tutorials and all sorts\nof awesome things with you. I am so excited to do this. And that's it for today. Remember, if you can tell\nme what you want to make, I can show you how to make it. Until next time. (soft music)", "Ytg16bt2460": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys kelly walters here with stahls tv and today we are doing video two of our bleaching series and today our focus is going to be with sublimation transfers now as you can see i do have a roll of cad cut here and we will be using it and specifically we are going to be using our cad-cut glitter flake in our hologram gold but incorporating into the transfers this round it's going to be two versions of sublimation so our first is our cad prince sublimation transfer and then our next is our patterns specifically using a sublimation pattern so what we are doing is i am showing you how to play with bleach now i mean that very loosely of course we're going to be bleaching some t-shirts i'll be using our gildan softs or using gildan's soft style tees i'm staying in the heathered colors now i will tell you we will be using the sun outside so when we go outside to bleach bear with me on the outdoor elements and of course hopefully the sun will stay strong and we'll be able to knock it out of the park now the first thing that we need to do is go ahead and cut our art for our glitter flake we don't have anything else to do with sublimation so that is done and ready to go next we will weed and then we will take our t-shirts to the heat press we will apply our sublimation transfer and then we will apply our cad-cut glitter flake transfer and then we will go outside and bleach now before we get started before you get started make sure you do testing of your own with bleach it can be very tricky there's elements that can have an effect on it if you struggle use some heat i know that helps and then of course make sure you wash test whatever you are um trying that way before you sell it to the customer you know it's successful and it can be washed so let's get started hey guys before you get to bleaching there's a couple of things to keep in mind there are a variety of squirt bottles out there i just am using an empty glass cleaner bottle it does have a little bit more of a mist versus a stream so if you are wanting a certain style of bleaching i do encourage you to try a couple of different bottles a little bleach can go a long way and that's something that i've learned throughout this project so make sure you try just a little before you add way too much and then you can't take it back all right so the first thing we're going to do is go ahead and protect our lower platen now i have just folded a cover sheet about three quarters that way if i wanted to use the other side i could cut it off use it for smaller things and because we are using a size small i'm not too concerned you know with the logo getting outside of where our protection is um just because of the size of the logo that we're using so now that we've threaded our shirt we're going to just lightly pull it off we want to try to have as many seams as possible off of our platen and then next up we're going to pre-press for six seconds this allows any moisture wrinkles to go ahead and release from the shirt okay now that that is finished we're going to go ahead and lay our transfer right back down where we wanted it now because i'm going to be adding bleach to this i'm not too concerned about the logo being about two fingers down right now we are about a hand so four fingers down again when i spray the bleach it's going to kind of come up here so instead of the logo shifting upward it's going to be now in the middle more of in the middle of the chest okay we are applying for 395 for 60 seconds now the other thing to consider is because we are on an automatic release press i am actually going to hold on to the press before it lifts up that way i can control it okay now we have about 10 seconds left so i'm going to go ahead and just hold on to the press i'm pushing it down that way when it pops i can control it coming up now of course it's a hot peel all right now next up we're going to go ahead and load our green shirt now same thing we will need to pre-press now i am using a new cover sheet for this shirt but i'm going to go ahead and use that same cover sheet underneath the shirt for the transfer so pre-press now like i said i folded it and as you can see we have a little bit of ghosting here now i'm just going to fold it that way i can use this side and i'm getting multiple uses out of this cover sheet versus just one and done and throwing it away now for ease i'm just sticking it underneath the neck and i really want to make sure this one is in the center now for this transfer our goal is to create a pattern underneath our vinyl so what i recommend doing so you don't have the straight edges is i've just gone and i have torn it's not going to be perfect but when you are bleaching a shirt it's never going to be perfect now if you want you can go back in and of course make it a little bit straighter you can add a little bit more character to it you have really good control over the size that you would like to use and that is exactly what i am going to go with i can feel where my my cover sheet is so i'm just going to adjust this just a little bit now this one is definitely more a center of a center chest and because there's no way to get a good square center on this i'm just eyeballing from my perspective okay again we have 60 seconds and i will stop it once if we are at about 10 seconds and again hot peel okay now that our sublimation is done we are going to go ahead and apply our glitter flake because the glitter flake will not be affected by the bleach it's okay to go ahead and apply that and then spray the bleach on top so i'm just going to go ahead and find my center very quick and i'm just going to place it in the midst of the middle on top of our sublimation we're not quite even in our square but hopefully this will just give us a good idea on what it would look like i am pretty much in the middle if i'm aligning up with the tag i just see that i have a little bit more sublimation on this side versus that side now this is a hot peel just my pressure and especially with the sublimation make sure you use a cover sheet since we're not back at the 395 we didn't activate the sublimation we just have a little bit of ghosting right here so just always take precaution and protect your upper heating element all right let's go bleach this all right you guys we are outside and the best place to bleach is actually in the sun the sun activates the bleach just a little bit quicker and you get to see results faster versus waiting overnight you can do this inside it's just much easier to kind of see where the bleach is um bleaching when you are outside so these are just two um cover sheets that i have used in the past i've just folded them in half um as you can see i am using an adult small in this gildan so i don't really want the full 16 by 20 size i'm just gonna put it in there for protection because it's not going to be the exact size that i need it there might be a little bit of bleaching spilled over but that's okay also ignore my boots i'm just trying to make sure i don't get bleach everywhere okay so i have my my bleach in my windex bottle and then i am just going to lightly spray you don't want to go too much too quick because there's no way of taking the bleach back so as you can see we are starting to get a little bit of change so in the middle of the logo that's where i'm really trying to spray the bleach you can see that we are starting to turn colors it doesn't have to be perfect and of course you don't want that soak through on the other side but if you do it's only going to add some characteristic to the shirt but you can see the characteristics of the shirt starting to come to life i am going to just set it to the side and then up next we have the full sublimation okay i went ahead and threaded our cover sheet like i did previously on that now the same effect that i had with the other one i am just going to spray [Music] all over right around where the logo is okay we're gonna let that one sit for just a bit and then we are going to review what they look like once they are finished hey guys we are done and i cannot wait to show you and review both of these shirts now if you remember i said to use a little bleach because it goes a long way the reason why i said that is because i used a little too much bleach bleach specifically on the go cats logo and i will explain to you why here in just a minute but make sure you just test a little and if it's not turning like i should just be patient be a little more patient than me and you will see some results i promise so the first we're gonna first one we're gonna review is our peace love and rock and roll as you guys know i did have um some cover sheet um inside of this we did have just a little bit sneak through on the back but that's okay i like character so i think it just adds a little bit more to the shirt itself just because you know it's already got a lot of character there's not a lot of rhyme and rhythm in this now the reason i always say just be a little patient is because as you can see down here i got a little bit higher up i was kind of going more for that type of effect but i did creep up to the side and then this actually turned out um pretty decent in size comparison to the logo if you remember we dropped the logo down when we were applying and it's because that bleach just creeps a little bit further up to the neckline i added a little bit of character here on the sleeves and overall i cannot wait to wash this it has not been washed yet literally put the blow dryer on it to help speed it up and now it's a little crunchy it just needs to be drawn uh washed and dried that way we can rid um any of the bleach remaining on it so anyway i think this one turned out great i'm really happy with the overall kind of grunge look that it brings now this one i definitely went really crazy on the bleach as you you guys saw it was just taking a little bit longer to turn well they were both taking too long to turn but the whole point with this was to have the leopard effect so i went about two inches too far past where i really want it to go so the idea was that we would have this bleaching this you know kind of crazy pattern like right along the edge of the leopard so you do see the rip transfer i kind of like it i'm not against it but what we were going for was more of the fade away with the pattern and then the go cats on top of that as you can see we also are now picking up the pink in the leopard which originally was not there when we were spraying outside so once the shirt went white or cream we definitely pick up more color from our sublimation transfers now as far as the rest of the bleaching goes i love the splattered look across the bottom i just wish i wouldn't have gotten too crazy with the bleach and um you know didn't go too far down but a little goes a long way it is um a knit you know it's it's a material that soaks up water or liquids so just keep that in mind when it comes to bleach that it is going to spread just a little bit but overall this concludes the end of our two-part series with bleaching if you haven't seen video one we use just heat transfer vinyl and i hope you enjoyed learning how to sublimate and then bleach on the guild and soft style t-shirt i'm kelly walters thanks so much for watching this video i really hope you have enjoyed this content if you haven't give us a thumbs up otherwise we will see you next time and get creative bye guys you", "BE6hRFqy_a4": "today I'm going to show you how to print on fabric to make these really cool sweatshirts and t-shirts hi everyone so I've always really liked sweatshirts or just t-shirts with like graphics on them or like pictures of celebrities or just people I like or like cool little graphics like this but I've always wanted to kind of customize it and they're really expensive if you buy them at Urban Outfitters or like zoomies or Paxson or something like that so I try to find out a way to make it on my own and I came up with this and kind of something like this for all you believers out there you can kind of wear this just like to lounge around the house if you wanted to like what I'm wearing right now I just have like leggings on and so it's really comfy and really inexpensive to make you can also just like pair them with skinny jeans or like maybe like a pair of leather pants to kind of like dress it up maybe this even looks cute maybe that's a little too much oh I know maybe maybe hey or if you want to just like make a shirt to wear to a concert you're gonna go to like you're going to a One Direction concert or something like that or just if you really like a celebrity and you really like their picture and you want on a shirt you can make something like this the only bad thing though is that you can't really wash these or get them wet at all because we're printing them with like computer ink so the ink isn't waterproof if you get like water on it it's going to kind of bleed it doesn't look good so you cannot get it wet and you can't wash the actual design but I mean if you let that a stain on here or something you could like wash that you just you do not by any means want to get this like the design of whatever you're going to do wet so don't wear it in the rain the only wear it on a nice sunny day and if you're going to wear it do not be a klutz and do not drop your drink on it because you will ruin your Do It Yourself sweater t-shirt things that you made if you want to know how to make this super versatile cute easy creative shirt garment just say you're going to need 100% white cotton fabric which I already cut into strips the same size as a piece of computer paper wonder under feasible web which you can find at Hobby Lobby and Michaels fabric scissors a large bowl super washing soda which I was only able to find at food pyramid I can find it at Walmart or Target a brick softener alum which you can find in the spice section in your grocery store measuring spoons a 9 by 13 inch cake pan and I just use a really old burnt one a mason jar to put your extra DIY bubble J mm liquid we're going to make a measuring cup and iron and I stupidly didn't take a picture of this but you'll obviously also need a sweater or t-shirt to put your design on I get my sweaters at Walmart and my t-shirts are either Hobby Lobby Michaels or Joanne's and they're all really cheap there the first thing we're going to do is make a homemade bubble jet mm solution which gives you a more vibrant color when printed on your fabric and it helps it a little bit from bleeding if your fabric happens to get wet so take two and a half teaspoons of washing soda and put it in your bowl and kind of use a bigger bowl because it's going to kind of foam up later and you'll see what I mean and then you're going to take half a teaspoon of liquid fabric softener put that into your bowl as well now get two tablespoons of alum again put that into your little concoction and then you're just going to take a cup of hot water and I just put this in the microwave for a minute and then you're going to put that in your Bowl and you can see now that it's kind of foaming up and so yeah you definitely want to use a bigger bowl or else it's going to go everywhere then you're just gonna mix mix mix that up just keep mixing just keep mixing just keep mixing mixing mixing and then you're going to put that into your pan and my looks so ugly but then after you put it in your pan you're going to start soaking your strips of fabric into the solution that we just made so I'm just putting the first one in there and then I'm just going to continue like stacking them and then just kind of like washing it kind of and just really getting it saturated and with the fabric and once you have all of your fabric pieces soaking inside the little cake pan you're going to let that sit for about 15 minutes and then you can either just let it dry overnight or if you're really impatient you can just put it in the oven I mean at the oven in the dryer yeah you're just gonna eat those yummy little alum fabric shapes before you dry them make sure you kind of squeegee out all of the liquid and if you have any extra you can put it in that little mason jar or some kind of jar so you can save it and use it next time so now we're just going to take our iron and make sure all of the water is out of the iron you don't want any any water in there so make sure the steam is off and make sure the option is put to dry or else it's going to mess up your fabric and your picture so now take your wonder under feasible web stuff and kind of take your sheet of fabric that's already dried and kind of lay it out so you can get an idea of where to cut the wonder under and you're going to cut it like right down the middle and then my wonder under is the exact same size as my like two sheets of paper so it's like completely perfect so I just cut it once and then I can fold it in half and then and I can just cut it like horizontally I think that's what it is and then it's like two perfect sheets of paper now that you have the correct size of wonder under you're going to take your fabric and put it right on top of the rough side so make sure the fabric is touching the rough side of the Wonder Under and then you're going to take your dry iron and press it onto the paper and make sure the edges especially and really the whole entire thing that make sure the edges are really fused to that wonder under fusible web stuff and you can take like a like a like a clean fabric sheet and put it right on top so if some of the Wonder Under is kind of peeking out it doesn't get stuck to your iron so this keeps it a lot more clean and I would definitely do this on an ironing board but it was late at night and I didn't want to go down the stairs and like wake up my parents by filming and stuff so I'm just doing it on my carpet but I would definitely definitely do it on an ironing board so I'll just keep uhm ironing until it's completely stuck together and then you're going to get these kind of like scraggly little pieces at the edges so just take your scissors and cut it to make a really clean edge there like little like thread things from the fabric now load your fabric paper that you just made into your printer and print off whatever picture or graphic that you want to put on your shirt or your sweater and then you're it's gonna be kind of uneven so just take your scissors and make everything even so it looks really good on your sweatshirt and your t-shirt and now you're ready to turn your plain-jane shirt into an awesome cool beautiful face person on your shirt kind of shirt and then you're going to just kind of peel off the fabric from your feasible web and what this does is the rough side that you kind of felt on your fusible web earlier it gets transferred onto the fabric and so now it's kind of like a glue and then once you iron that like now that like does that make sense now that the rough part of like that glue stuff on the feasible web is on the back of the back of the fabric fabric sheet you made you can iron it onto your actual sweatshirt or your t-shirt oh my gosh that's a lot of words hopefully that makes sense and so now I just am ironing after I kind of measured what was like the best for me I tried it on in it about two inches is really good for like a like a full size eight and a half by eleven picture so two inches down from the collar line and so I'm just ironing it ironed it on with the fabric on top first and then I earned on with chess itself so I could set the ink and again definitely you want to make sure the edges are completely stuck to the shirt and then my Justin Bieber one is done and so here's just a different one that I made it's like a diamond so it's not just like a rectangle sheet of paper what I did was I just printed it on a rectangle sheet of paper and then while it was already on the fusible web I cut around it so I had like perfect perfect lines and so again just measuring you definitely want to try it on and make sure you know where it looks best on you because the diamond was like two-and-a-half inches down from the collar whereas the other one was only two inches so I'm just ironing on again so I can glue it on to the shirt and it looks really really good like I really love this it looks like the diamond supply shirts or sweatshirts at least I think so and it was a lot cheaper this was like seven dollars to make and now you're done with your complete customizable top and that picture is completely fused and isn't going anywhere now let your imagination run wild so I hope you guys like my tutorial and that is in handy for you sometime and if you guys try this out you can leave a video response below of your creations or you can add me on Instagram my username is the same as my YouTube diamond cakes and just tag your pictures with dimy DIY so I can see your creations and if you have any other DIY requests or any other video requests just put those in the comments below and I will definitely check them out so um I'll see you guys next time bye", "D7FqwkG8I10": "what's up guys Lucia Lumina here and in today's video I am going to be sublimating on three different types of shirts so today I have the Cricut and fusible ink t-shirts that they sell at Michaels and you probably can find these Michaels certain Walmart's Hobby Lobby Joanne's all those type of hobby or craft shops and these guys are 95% polyester and 5% I believe nylon or something like diet or spandex 5% spandex and cricket markets this as its infusible inc brand I'll see the camera can kind of focus on that right there but really they sell like their own patterns and be able to cut it with the Cricut and kind of you know print similar to what this guy has well lucky for us we have an actual sublimation printer that will print whatever we want on this guy so the other two type of shirts I was trying to find a 50/50 poly cotton but I couldn't find one anymore like locally so I ended up grabbing a to Walmart shirts but their one was is for women and one for men and one of them is a time and true brand you can see think that sir the woman brand that they have and this guy is and I'll show you guys here it is a 60% cotton and 40% recycled polyester and you guys can see the tag there so you see it so we're gonna be using this guy we're gonna see how a subliminal print comes out on this and then I also got a George brand I say and and this is actually shirts that I use very often with HCV and and heat transfers I actually like the George Brown how the shirts kind of feel and they're very easy to access at least during the summer and spring times and even fall a winter you kind of see this long-sleeve version of these t-shirts but for the most part they're pretty easy to find and this guy is 65% polyester and 35% cotton you can kind of see so we have three different levels of polyester in the shirt and while I kind of know you know I think the minimum should be 50/50 poly cotton this one probably would work this is just kind of my I guess assumptions or or my theory I don't think this one's gonna do too well but this one for sure should sublimate very very good and I actually found these for sale at Michaels 50% off so if you guys actually follow me on my Instagram at Lumina creative I typically post about cells like this so these guys like I said were 50% off so $10 typically at Michaels they were 5 bucks guys is this cheaper than what I can get them like on some t-shirt websites I can be trying to get a hundred percent polyester so it was a really good deal I picked up a bunch of these because I have a huge order and then like I said follow my Instagram and I always pull stuff like this so yeah guys I am gonna get my designer here real quick I'm not really gonna show that if you want to see the process of doing that you can watch my previous video up here that kind of shows you the introduction of sublimation how I set up a image of that nature but I'm gonna go ahead and set up the image and then I'm gonna go ahead and print it and I'm gonna get the heat press ready I guess for so far the settings on the heat press you're gonna do 400 degrees Fahrenheit so if your machine is in Celsius like mine that's gonna be 200 and 204 degrees I definitely recommend having a little legs are going to kind of check the temperature of your heat press at all times because mine is a little off sometimes and you're gonna set your timer at 45 to 60 seconds try to play with the timer typically black ink if your image has a lot of black ink that takes a little bit longer to sublimate as simply the last color that kind of transfers over and again guys if you guys are only a little more about sublimation of the process check out that video I did a few weeks ago but anyways let me go ahead and get to it I'm gonna print and then we'll switch over to the camera over here on the heat press alright guys so I just ran my test print I always suggest you guys to run with your sublimation printer in case you don't use it on the daily like I do like I said I'm more of a few chunks of plaster so heat transfer user and HCV and so I just kind of ran one real quick it's kinda what the delenn's gonna be similar to the one I do with the Neenah 3G opaque when I did a print and cut except I added my domain at the bottom so we're gonna sublimate this guy this is just a regular eight and a half by eleven sheet guys so I'm gonna go ahead and start running the actual one and let's see how it comes out guys I cannot stress this enough I printed these guys wrong so what sublimation always always always always remember mirror your image I just wasted a bunch of ink on three prints that were supposed to be reversed learn from my mistakes guys I got a reprint them let's go alright guys so we are back so I already kind of pre-press this one right here now you're supposed to put something in here and I don't know where 1/2 will happen to my little board I like a little plastic thing that I put underneath so I'm gonna slide our old of use quick and Matt underneath here and just because I don't have my actual thing that I use but I guess this works too right and what this is guys is with sublimation sometimes the the transfer will go a little bit too far or like the it'll go through so you can do this so that that doesn't happen to you this shirts a v-neck so I'm gonna put it up a little higher so this first shirt is the time ensure I'm so sorry the lighting sucks I'm not this is not I intended to do Hey oh cool so one of the transfers now it is a mirrored rookie mistakes guys I'm not gonna measure I'm not gonna try to get this perfect this is literally just to see if it'll sublimate on to the shirt just want to see if it'll work these are just test prints so we're gonna go ahead and press those guys let's see how this goes I guess we're gonna take this one off I'm not gonna show you how everything looks till the end so ye alrighty guys we're gonna go ahead and put the next shirt in which is the George brand and this one is 6535 so we're gonna go ahead and put this guy on [Music] that we transfer same thing guys same process and you'll put it on here slap this narek there you know we're gonna go to town I think that's pretty close to being Center so yeah sorry guys so same thing lift up don't breathe in remember you're supposed to be doing this in a regulated area alrighty guys so last shirt gonna throw on the and this is the cricket one notice every shirt gets bigger and bigger I start from small medium and now extra-large these old cricket Matt's work just fine for this but they do kind of melt so you got to wait a little bit before you take them out and it'll harden up again and take shape so anyways you're gonna impress these get the wrinkles out and the moisture I'm gonna go ahead and do the last print guys Center that like so [Music] again I'm not doing this 100% accurate I'm just kind of eyeballing to see the quality of these prints not necessarily use these shirts for anything [Music] same think I'm breathe alright guys so I know it looks like anyone from day to night I kind of started this little delayed afternoon where there's a little bit of sunlight it's kind of gone down her those prints took a little while to do especially because I could do it twice because my dumb self decided to do them not mirrored again guys learn from my mistakes and I am not ashamed to show you that I to make these type of mistakes three perfectly good sublimation sheets gone to waste including ink don't be like me just see you see these are the ones I used they are mirrored so to you look straight to me here on the camera whether they have been all used and let's see the final results guys I just don't want you guys to see that not because something shouldn't be done doesn't mean just because some people say it shouldn't be done doesn't mean you can't do it there's a bunch of different ways to do things and and you know what guys every customer is different you might get a customer that wants the least expensive route that wants to just as long as the image is somewhat visible they don't care and you know for those type of customers one of these options are going to be great for the customers I want the higher end stuff one of these options is gonna be good too and so like I tell people that comment on my videos because I do get some people are like I bet you if you watch that nina 3g up a paper is gonna fall right off or I bit because it's not pigment in ink it's gonna fall right off after water too and you know what guys I get it it's hard to believe it when you don't do it yourself but if you follow some of these instructions that I'm giving you step-by-step you're gonna get the same results I do and you know the this is stuff that people say shouldn't work on and so I'm gonna show you guys the three results from three sharps and you tell me what you think and which route would you go through would you go for would you offer all these three to your customers we're joining off for one comment in the section below and tell me what are your thoughts so anyways let me grab these shirts so you can kind of take a look already so we're gonna start with the shirt that I thought just wasn't gonna sublimate and that's the time and true brand from Walmart and the reason why I use these specifically showed you guys is because you can go purchase these at your local stores this is not something you have to order from someone these shirts are not something that you have to go find in the internet it's literally available to anybody and at ridiculous prices so this time and shoe came in and think I had four dollars for a shirt and guys honestly if you don't have an account somewhere or like a wholesale account that's a pretty good fish good price for a shirt especially something you can sublimate on so this is the type of shoe brand guys and I'll see if I can ladies all out at the end and you know comparison like I actually do like a panning of them but this is what that shirt looks like and again this was if I am correct 65% cotton about 60% pima cotton and a forty percent recycled polyester so I mean here I know the camera is a little difficult to see but it's definitely a little a little faded type of look it's not it's not a super super sharp image but it works guys some people might have customers that don't mind this you know and this is why you have a few samples laying around will show your your customers and you know for somebody's gonna get these dirty and they're just you know for advanced or for something that's like a one-off use why not why am i go with the least expensive option so anyways let's switch over to the George brand and I try to do a female and a male brand so that's like yeah yeah you know I can't find it for one the other Bailey's this is the George Brown guys right here and this is 65% polyester 35% cotton a little more vibrant you can definitely see a little more details in the print looks good like I said Walmart Walmart Walmart Walmart Walmart I like most of my shirts that I saw the people at one work I use Gildan Walmart and then I want to go to step up like a little bit better quality I go to next level or Bella canvas which Bella canvas is actually now available at michaels if you don't have a whole slit account alright so last shirt okay and this is the cricut brand and fusible ink and I got these guys on sale I got that for style Michaels and they do go I'm sorry once in a blue moon and these these are typically $10 a piece which is a little more expensive than the order from a website or something typically the polyester 100% of like seven dollars or maybe a little less I know you guys probably some of you guys probably have a better host account than I do but for me it's seven dollars for polyester shirt and I found these guys for five bucks guys so I actually bought almost a whole inventory because I had a very large order fulfill but this is how the Cricut this is 95% polyester and 5% spandex guys it is so vibrant like it is sharp it is clean check that out it is a very nice quality image very little bleeding you can specifically tell in the text very little bleeding very clean image and this might be for those customers that don't mind spending a little bit extra you go with the 95% cotton again you can probably find this stuff cheaper online guys but I'm trying to give you a solution to be able to do this stuff from home and if you get like a random customer that pops up and you need a quote quick and they need something turnaround for next day either way you're gonna charge them a premium this is the cost you gotta pay they gotta pay in store prices if not they can wait like everybody else and you can order and get your discounted rates okay so this is what it looks like after a wash and this is the more cotton one the yeah the tiny children and so she watched this one time already so I'm kind of trying to get a little close a little bit looks a little bit like that worn effect but guys like I said it looks good and I printed well the heat didn't fall off you know obviously I don't know we might give it a few more wash tests and see what they come out like the cricket one looks awesome we washed all three of them together and this is the cricket one pretty much the same nice and vibrant looks great so tell ten guys thank you

see y'all on the next video [Music] you", "hFI-HB2bHDs": "what's up guys guillermo here again with another episode of print pros if you're familiar with director garmin printing then you've probably heard that some dtg printers and inks will not print polyester garments well but what if i told you you can actually print high quality photorealistic images on polyester using a dtg printer to show you how it's done i'm going to be using the image armor pre-treatment solution and the wagner spray bottle to pre-treat garments this step is crucial in producing a stunning print on polyester fabrics so make sure to take notes because your final product does depend on this crucial step both the printer and the pre-treatment supplies i'll be using can be purchased as a complete package on our website so i'll make sure to link that down in the description all right that's enough talking let's go ahead and start printing [Music] all right so let's go over what we're going to be using to print on these polyester shirts now obviously first up we have the stars of the show which are these two polyester shirts now i have a black one and a white one since i'm going to be showing you how to print on both and then here we have the all-important pre-treatment solution now as you can see i have two different bottles since we're going to be printing on two different shirts white and black now obviously the image armor ultra is going to be for our black shirt and the image armor light formula is going to be for our white shirt now both of these are available on our online store so if you're interested in ordering this today go down to the link in the description then to do our pre-treatment we have our spray gun now you can buy these in any home improvement store like lowe's or home depot but it is also included with your dtg printer when you buy it through our store in the bundle now like i mentioned earlier for our dtg printer we're going to be using the ricoh ri1000 link in the description and then for our heat press we're going to be using one sheet of teflon and this is going to be 16 by 20 inches speaking of the heat press today we're going to be using the ricoma hp 16 by 20. the 16 by 20 stands for the surface area of the heat press which is 16 by 20 inches hence the 16 by 20 inch piece of teflon all right guys so let's go over how much you can be making by selling shirts like these now first up we bought these shirts online on wholesale for about four dollars per shirt then we have to take into account the cost of the pre-treatment solution and our ink which is a matter of sensing between the two of them so let's just say it's about a dollar to be generous and that brings the overall cost of each shirt to about five dollars now you can sell these shirts online for about 20 to 25 and that gives you a final profit per shirt of between 15 to 20 all right so let's go ahead and start our pre-treatment process i'm going to be starting off with the black shirt and then i'm going to be doing the white shirt now i'm going to be doing them both separately because i do have to change out the pre-treatment solution in my spray gun now this spray gun if i didn't mention it before we got this one at i think it was home depot or lowe's and we got it for around 80 but again it is included with your dtg in the bundle at the time of purchase now for the black shirt i'm going to be using the image armor ultra for black or dark t-shirts again we do sell this at our store if you guys are interested so to do the pre-treatment on this chair what i'm basically just going to do is that i'm going to take my spray gun i'm going to put it on the lowest setting when it comes to output to do that all i have to do is twist this knob out as far out as it'll go and then just do my best to maybe squeeze the trigger as lightly as i can essentially what we're trying to do is just create a very light mist that just covers all areas of the t-shirt or the area that we're planning on printing on so what i'm going to do is i'm going to take my spray gun and i'm going to spray from bottom to the top top to bottom like this and then take it again and do it horizontally as well now when i'm spraying the shirt what i'm trying to do is stay about a foot away from it the goal is just to create a light layer of pre-treat on the top surface of the shirt you don't want to completely soak it and then after this we're going to go ahead and take our shirt to the heat press to cure the pre-treat onto the t-shirt all right so let's press the shirt to cure the pre-treat like i mentioned earlier we're going to be using the ricoma hp 1620 to do this i'm going to pull out the tray it's a very cool feature because this way i don't have to work under the hot element of the press burning my hands and all that i'm gonna place my t-shirt on the tray try to get it all straightened out now there are certain areas of the shirt that i did get pre-treated on that i am not pressing but that doesn't really matter since i'm not gonna be printing on those areas and those areas are the bottom of the shirt and the sleeves for example now i'm going to be pressing this shirt for 60 seconds at 285 degrees fahrenheit now in the instructions for this pre-treat in the back it states that you should press your shirt to cure it for 30 seconds at 330 degrees fahrenheit now because of the fact that i am doing a polyester shirt i don't want to be pressing my shirt at that temperature so i'm going to lower it down to 285 degrees fahrenheit instead of 330. and then it stays to press it for 30 seconds and then if you still see any steam or moisture on top of your shirt to press it for an additional 10 seconds and then do that over and over again until you don't see any steam or moisture now i've already done this in the past and i found that pressing it for 60 seconds eliminates all my moisture and steam in one go all right so then i'm gonna place a sheet of teflon over my shirt to protect it insert it into the heat press and then i'm going to press it all right 60 seconds 285 degrees fahrenheit all right when the heat press is done it's going to automatically open i'm going to take out my shirt remove the teflon and i'm just going to feel the top of the shirt and yep it's nice and dry we can go ahead and print on this take my shirt off and let's go ahead and do the white one now all right so let's go ahead and pre-treat our white shirt now now for this we are going to be using a different pre-treat we're going to be using the image armor light formula this is what you want to use for your white shirts your very light colored shirts when you're doing either polyester or cotton this means that i have to change out the pre-treatment formula that i have on my spray gun and to do that what you want to do is you want to make sure to take this off dump out any of the old formula that you have in since you don't want to be mixing the light formula and the ultra formula together you want to dump that out then rinse out this container put some water in it close it back up and do a few sprays with just water inside of the container what this is going to do is that it's going to flush out the spray gun of any of the old pre-treatment formula that you were using for the black shirts now i already did this so i'm just going to go ahead and fill up this container with the light pre-treatment formula now before you use this make sure to give it a good shake [Music] all right and now we're ready to do our white shirt and the process is basically the same now because of the fact that this is a white shirt versus a black shirt you might actually have to put less pre-treat but if you notice that on your black shirts your print is not coming out as good as you would want it it might be because you have to put more pretreat on a black shirt versus a white [Music] shirt [Music] and we're ready to go back over to the heat press all right so this part of the process is pretty much identical just going to take out the tray load up our white t-shirt cover it with a sheet of teflon and again we're gonna be pressing it for 60 seconds at 285 degrees fahrenheit at light pressure let's take it over to our dtg okay so here we are at our dtg printer again this is the ricoh ri-1000 if you guys want to learn more about it go down to the link in the description all right so first up what i'm gonna do is that i'm gonna take my black shirt and unlike what i did in our previous episode when i printed on the cotton shirt which you can watch by going down to the link in the description i'm not going to just place my polyester shirt right on top of the platen just like that what i'm actually going to do is that i'm going to thread the platen and i'll explain why i'm going to thread the platen by opening up my t-shirt and just pulling it through the collar is going to be facing this way or towards me and then make sure all the leftover fabric is inside the carriage now the reason why i threaded the shirt instead of just placing it on top is because of the fact that polyester is a moisture wicking fabric some of that ink is going to go right through the first layer of fabric of my t-shirt and it's going to land on the second layer of my t-shirt and i don't really want that i don't want any ink on the back of my t-shirt so what i'm going to do is thread the platen so that the ink goes through the first layer and then onto the actual plan of the dtg and then i'll just clean that off after every print all right then i just take my bracket and i place it over the t-shirt so that it stays nice and secure and flat okay now let's go over to our software so that we can send over the design to print all right so here we are on our printing software which does come included with your printer so all i have to do is drag over my design and there you have it polyester is a moisture wicking fabric now what this means is that it does not retain as much moisture as cotton does this is the reason why we like polyester since they're usually used for workout clothing or sports uniforms because of the fact that they keep us nice and dry and cool but this also means that it does not take our ink very well from our dtg printer so what we have to do is that we have to add more ink than we usually do with our cotton shirts so what we're gonna do to get more ink onto our polyester shirt when printing this design is that for the black shirt what we're actually going to do is do a double white layer underneath before we do our colored layer and then when we do our color there we're going to try to get as much ink as possible onto it by bumping up our contrast and our saturation now for our white shirt all we have to do is bump up our contrast and our saturation as high as we can i'm gonna go into our project and i'm gonna start making my way through these tabs now since i'm just going to print the design dead in the center i'm not really going to adjust my size or the position of the design on the garment and i'm going to just go to color and in color i'm going to choose my media which is going to be a black garment now in this specific software you choose this not just for black shirts but you would also choose this for dark colored garments like reds or blues and then i'm going to go to settings now here's where i'm going to make the adjustments to my colors to try to get as much ink as i possibly can onto that t-shirt so for contrast i'm going to bump it up to 100 and then i'm going to go to profiles and set my saturation enhancement to high i'm going to press ok and then i'm going to go to rip and i'm going to check off use document transparency what this is going to do is that it's going to make the software respect the transparency that i built into my design then i'm going to press ok and as you can see there is now a black square around my design meaning that the software is now using the transparency of the design and the black is the black of the t-shirt now all we have to do is press print and it's going to send it over okay so here we have our design we already sent it over using our network it appeared right here and we're pretty much set to go i'm gonna just press set and the machine is gonna do its [Music] thing [Music] [Music] all right so here we have our finished black shirt now we're not completely done with this we still have to take this over to the heat press to press it one more time to make sure to cure the ink but before we do that i'm gonna show you guys what i meant earlier about threading the shirt and why you have to do it so i'm going to take off the bracket remove my shirt carefully make sure that it doesn't get folded or wrinkled or stuck to anything as you see right here there's a little bit of resistance as i remove the shirt because it is a little bit stuck to the platen since we are printing on polyester some of the ink went right through the shirt and onto the platen but that's not a big deal we can easily clean that in between print jobs and that's why take a little bit of either windex or any type of all-purpose cleaner spray it on there i do recommend that you do this immediately after every single print that way you don't allow for any time for that ink to set in onto your platen and ruin it and then we just wipe it off with either an old t-shirt a rag paper towels anything that you might have on hand and that's pretty much it all right so let's go over to our heat press now i'm gonna take out the tray again all right then i'm gonna bring in my shirt place it on my heat press make sure it's nice and flat i'm gonna place a sheet of teflon over it and we're gonna put it in now this time i'm gonna be pressing it for 285 degrees fahrenheit again but for 90 seconds change my timer to 90 seconds here we go [Music] i'm gonna bring it out and there we have our finisher okay so that's how you dtg on a black polyester shirt now let's go over and do it on the white shirt the process is pretty much the same with a few little differences all right so now we're back at our software and we're going to print on our white shirt so let's just make a few different adjustments here we're going to go back into our settings for our design and we're going to go to color instead of choosing black garment we're going to choose white garment we're going to choose settings and then here we are going to still do high saturation and then in the contrast in the color correction section we're gonna do 65 contrast instead now because of the fact that this is a white shirt we don't need as much ink as we needed for our black shirt but we still need more ink than we do for our regular white cotton shirts remember polyester is a moisture wicking material i'm going to press ok and press ok again and we're going to press control print and go over to our printer all right so here we are back out our dtg printer i'm gonna go ahead and load up our white shirt the same way i did our black one i'm gonna go ahead and place my bracket over that again i'm just going to press set and it's going to go right in [Music] all right so that's it for printing on the white shirt let's go ahead and heat press it all right so we're going to throw on our shirt onto the heat press now for the white shirt we're actually going to press it at 285 degrees again but for 40 seconds since it is a white shirt we don't need to press it as long as the black one so i'm going to change my timer to 40 seconds i'm gonna cover it with a sheet of teflon put it in there we go all right there we go we'll pull it out remove the teflon sheet and there we have our finished print all right guys that's it for this episode i hope this video helped you see that it's possible to print on polyester with a dtg printer the key takeaway here is that you have to pre-treat your garment if

housework done here on Labor Day but part of what I'm doing one of my chores or tasks today is to take a shirt that doesn't fit me and somehow make it fit me target has these great new Star Wars shirts but they're in the young men's department so they're all athletic fit and they only go up to a 2x so I got a 2x and I need a 3x and a regular fit but I've got a little method that I use to kind of make a shirt work for me and I'm gonna show you that today give me a second here and I'll show you a full shot of what I look like in the shirt okay so here's a full shot of me in the shirt as you can see it's uh not doing me any favors and the sleeves really tight around the midsection getting some unflattering roll action here you can see the my shorts underneath the zipper and all that kind of stuff so not not perfect a little snug I also really don't like how tight the neck is so I'm going to see if I can stretch the fabric a little or work the fabric a little to make it work for me and I'll show you what the processes that I use okay here's a better shot of the graphic you can see it's really cute it's got sort of an 80s vibe to it the fabric is 55% cotton 45% polyester which means once I get this once I work the fabric the way I want to it'll probably pretty much stay that way we're gonna start off making the neck hole a little larger to me when you see the small crew neck neck hole like this it is a clear indicator that a woman is wearing a man's shirt woman's neck holes even for the crewneck shirts tend to be a little bit roomier not as tight so what we're gonna do is make it a little larger by very gently pulling on the fabric notice I'm not pulling on the seams down here when I pull I'm pulling above it now if worse comes to worse and you have a neck hole that will not budge and it's driving you crazy you can cut the neckline off just above the stitching here and it won't be you know the net well the neckline won't fall apart and then when you have like a seam in here too you want to pull in front of that seam and pull behind the seam so that you keep the seam intact okay let's take a look at it and see what it looks like now that we've stretched it out a little bit Wow as you can see that made a huge difference that opening is much much larger now in the shirt and will look a little bit more feminine so the next thing we're going to work on is the sleeves the sleeves on this shirt are a little short and a little tight definitely really really tight around here so what I'm going to do with this is the same thing that I did with the neckline giving it a good stretch being really careful not to overdo it with the seams remember to protect that seam they're a little widen the armhole a little bit and then to get the length that you want on the sleeve to be a little longer you're just going to stretch the fabric down notice I'm doing I'm like I'm sort of like taking it and gathering it up as I go down and pulling it across you don't want to just randomly rip out it be a little thoughtful the process so that is something I'll do I'll pull down on the sleeve more like that I'll repeat everything I did to the sleeve here I'll repeat widening the sleeve and I'll also repeat this process a couple of times to to make it a little wider here just gently pulling the fabric to stretch it so I'm gonna actually take a moment to go through and do that same process to this sleeve a couple of times and then I'll pull over the other sleeve for you and show you the difference and what a difference it makes just to stretch the fabric a little bit okay as you can see after just a moment or two of doing a little bit of light stretching on the sleeve there's a significant difference in the size maybe about three-quarters of an inch in length and width so this is fantastic we'll do this to the other sleeve and then I'll show you what to do to give you a little bit of more volume around the bottom of this of the shirt so for the bottom hem of the shirt you're gonna work it just like you did the neckline and sleeves you want to be very careful and mindful of your stitches that you don't pop them but you're gonna give it a nice steady stretch like this all the way around I like to do it two sometimes three times and you'll do it the entire hem all the way around and then move up the shirt gather the fabric towards you and start doing the same stretch for width across the front and back of the shirt I want you to stop though when you're stretching across the top of your shirt stop when you get to the graphic you do not want to stretch the graphic if you stretch your graphic it's going to crack you want to stretch the areas below it and you can work the areas above it and if you need to get more stretch in the fabric or for this area here across the abdomen or across the bustline you're going to stretch the fabric on the back of the shirt where there isn't too graphic you can work the living daylights out of this fabric back here one of the other key things I want to let you know too is after you've stretched the width of the shirt across the front you're going to grab the fabric and start stretching it lengthwise don't grab the whole shirt just like open it up put your hand inside of it like that and stretch the length if you only stretch the width of the shirt what you're gonna do is you're gonna make the shirt shrink it'll be wider but it'll be shorter so you do have to work the fabric in both directions both across and both down and just be mindful of the graphic and you should be great okay so I put the shirt back on for you so you can get a better look at it I don't know if you can see I try to shoot this so you can see it better but the neckline is not as tight up here a little bit looser a little more room it's not like choking me to death and as you can see it's no longer clinging to my midsection like it was before it's a tiny bit longer I mean actually have that blouse stuff a little bit but it's a shirts a little bit longer a couple inches longer definitely a few inches wider it definitely has more give in room in the sleeves sleeves still aren't my favorite thing I can still work on those because there's yet another step to this process the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to wash the shirt and then after I wash it I'm going to gently go through that same process of where I will pull the fabric across the width and then also the length to continue to give it length and give it a little more give in areas where I need it probably a little more through here and also the sleeves and the neckline so I'll show you that process coming up next well it looks like the shirt came out pretty good straight out of the wash so when I washed it I washed it in cold water with other bright colors and I did it on like a regular cycle light too regular cycle and now that I have a damp I'm taking a look at it and you notice that neckline that maybe looked a little stretched out before like you could see the waffling is no longer there there's no waffling because when I washed it it just maybe it tightened up a little bit I'm not sure but that's one of the things that you can expect to happen when you wash the garment naturally the fibers will tighten up a little bit so what I'm gonna do now now that it's damp is I'm gonna follow those same steps we had before where I'm going to go ahead and work on the neck a little bit be careful here because when it's wet it's going to stretch a lot it'll shrink up a little bit when it dries but it'll really really really really really stretch out a lot when it's wet so you know you don't want to go too far and stretch it out so much that it's completely out of shape so what you want to do though is when you are stretching the fabric every now and then stop take a look at it make sure it's going in the direction that you want it to go in and not like getting overly big or you know hold up the garment on the bottom and make sure your hem is straight all the way across and like your back your garment isn't longer than the front unless of course that's the way you want it so what I'm gonna do is the same thing like I said before that we did before where I'm just gonna gently pull the fabric out my issue that I had before was with the sleeves and I still think the sleeves look kind of small so I'm gonna work on the sleeves a little bit I'm gonna work on the neckline a little bit and probably the bottom hem or like the center section the midsection of the shirt and stretch it out a little bit and then I'm gonna hang it up and I'll show you how I do that I have finished stretching my garment and I think I have it just about the way I want it so now it's time to hang it up I have a little tip for you I use the joy Mangano huggable hangers I think you can get them at Target you can also get them on hsn.com they're great because they have like a little light flocking on the fabric it keeps your shirts and tops and even tank tops and things from slipping off and they're generously sized so you can if you're a plus size person these are great hangers they're not oversized but they are big enough to really accommodate your shirts so one of the things you get sometimes when you're hanging a shirt is where the end of the hanger is you get like a little point and then when you go to put the shirt on this little point of a little poof of fabric sticks out and it looks a little weird and it doesn't lay flat here's a little tip on how to avoid that so I don't know if you can see what I'm doing here but I'm taking this seam in the shoulder and I'm lining it up directly on top of the top edge of the hanger so when you do that this fabric in the shoulder seam is a little stiffer and it's not going to get that little pinch that you sometimes get with hangers but these hangers tend to be better about that anyhow because they come down on the edges on the bottom a little so you probably won't have as much of an issue with that but that's basically what I do I line it up like that and I hang it up so I'm going to hang this up and just let it dry for a day or two and see what it looks like I'll try it on for you and another day or two and we'll see what it looks like if I'm not happy with that I'll probably dampen it again and do another stretching session and then rehang it but I'll be back in a couple days to show you how it turned out well here it is the finished project as you can see a little bit looser in the neckline definitely plenty of room in the bust a lot more room through the midsection and a little bit more length the sleeves have a little more give a little more room and in general it's just a little more comfortable to wear so normally I would wear a woman's 4 or 5 X and if it has Star Wars on it or Disney on the front of the t-shirt you know it's going to be 30 to 60 bucks so eight dollars for shirt from the young men's section that's a 2 XL that I stretched into maybe the size of like a 3 or 4 X in a men's size shirt you can't beat that price eight dollars so you're not only stretching the shirt but you're stretching your budget and you know check out different places like Walmart check out Target and JC Penney's in their men's and young men sections you're gonna find great shirts anywhere from $5 to $15 so much more affordable and a lot of them are in unisex colors like this aqua there's pinks there's purples there's a little mermaid there's all different princesses check it out don't rule it out and you can save a lot of money so go ahead and try this yourself it's worth the investment of just a few dollars and a few minutes of your time you", "yJyjHF4emOw": "yo guys what is up is Joe and I'm back back for good shout out take that and today we're gonna be restoring a 10th anniversary Supreme a Kate Moss t-shirt which is extremely rare it's like what 15 years old and it's probably worth more than my life so we're gonna be taking a look at restoring that it's currently smelling like post Malone's left armpit I'm a really dirty dirty man and is seriously yellowing and in need of restoration and we're gonna be getting it looking cocaine white and good as new so without any further ado let's just get straight into it and make sure to subscribe and yeah let's go so as you guys may remember I have been doing restorations I did a couple of while back but I kind of stopped doing YouTube for a small break and well I say something break it's been quite some time but I'm back now and the first restoration we did was this brown on brown tonal that went very well people seem to like it next up we did this Yankees box logo which I'll talk about later in the video and then this week we've got the Kate Moss which as you can see the final product here is so white it's making me look like I've got some color and yeah that is just pure white as snow right there and I'm gonna show you what it looked like before hand and then how we fixed her up so just a quick reminder before we go any further as you may remember from the last video I did which was the Yankees box logo restoration I'm actually giving this away so who you got to do is subscribe and follow me on instagram to enter it as simple as that and I'll be giving this away when I get to 35,000 subscribers so make sure to do that paint you free and yeah no reason not to and I'm kind of pissed I said I was gonna give it away as well because it seems to have gone up in a lot of value since I said that I've kind of  myself over but I'm true to my word and I will do it at 35 K also guys just to mention all the products used today in today's video are gonna be linked down below make sure to hit those linked below helps your boy out so please do it Wow Gogi right guys so you're gonna want to get your pot and just fill her up with water and then fill it with the Rit dye color remover stick in a whole box and I'll be good for one to two t-shirts or even a hoodie and you had to slap that in the pot give it a good old mix cook up some taupe in the crock pot and yeah get that on the hob and get it boiling and then yeah I just start water boiling Kate right here and just go ahead first for the water right there just kind of submerge it give it a good old rub something good home wrap and set an alarm for 45 minutes and also guys don't stand over it while you do it for the whole 45 minutes because it made me feel super lightheaded and not in a good way so I don't recommend doing that don't know if it's like fumes or like just the heat I don't know but yeah don't recommend that ya get mixing that every five minutes or so for the 45 minutes it's going to get whiter and whiter with time just like it's Michael Jackson and then it's going to be looking crispy by the end of it as you can see I'm still mixing still whipping and I think this is about ten minutes until the end of the 45 minutes and as you can see it's looking proper white and yeah just keep submerging it making sure the whole thing gets coverage with the dye remover as you can see pretty much out of time so we're going to move on to the next step now I'm just sweet squeezing all that lovely dye remover out before we get on to the next step so just run that water through wring it out make sure it's all out of there and then we're going to move on and get the oxy action vanish stuff on the t-shirt so you're gonna need this vanish powder I'll have this link down below they recommend one scoop obviously Kate's no stranger to a little bit of white powder so I've decided to go for two just for that extra wideness because you know go hard or go home we're whip it up now and just stick the t-shirt in leave this for eight hours which obviously is a long time but that's what they recommend for it to take full effect so you know just do that make sure it's just like submerge the way I've rigged this up you can see eight hours detail and now we come back eight hours layer that is just crystal white very nice now last step just going to want to drain out wring it through again wash it with water and then bring it through you're going to want to hand dry it as well because obviously the crack into the print can be caused by putting it in the other dryer in the lake tumble dryer so don't do that I recommend trying it on the radiator or outside or whatever and then just iron it and it's gonna be looking so crispy so I'll show you the next clip which is gonna be the final product after it's been dried and ironed and it's gonna be insane I think you'll agree it's a lot less yellow and just looks great 100% the best technique for this type of thing [Music] [Music] [Music] if I get the chips tonight and this is to come wish there's only fall and every time I put a month they always fall and now I'm the chance man I'm really rich now I can follow you  man you're a shows Donna's how he's supposed to be cleaned out hi

five popular conscious brands and this is a very in-depth and thorough test we're going to be looking at the quality of the fabrics the sewing how they fit the comfort and also comparing the sustainability and ethics of each brand as you can see this is a long video i go into a lot of the different details and aspects of these brands so if you're only interested in certain parts i will include time codes down below so you can skip around to the parts you're interested in or if you want to just jump to my final thoughts you can do that as well so let's get right into it first at the lowest price point we have this t-shirt from everlane and be sure to stick around to later to hear my thoughts on everlane's ethics then there is this t-shirt from pact and they actually don't carry this exact style anymore but they have a lot of different basics i have this t-shirt from cotton and i hope it doesn't get too confusing with a brand named cotton because we're also going to talk about cotton the material a bit then there's this tea from armed angels because i wanted to have some europe-based brands as well and finally our highest priced t-shirt is this one from organic basics i tried to get the most basic style of t-shirt each brand had and ordered them all in a size medium the first thing i did when they arrived is measure each one to see how they compare to each other and also how they compare to the brand's size guide this chart shows the measurements of each one and the largest and smallest tea in each area i also should note that pack shrunk the most after washing quite a lot in length and everlane and organic basics didn't really shrink at all okay so i have the t-shirts here and they have all been washed once with cold water and air dry but i wanted to wait to do first impressions until after they were washed because quite often things can shrink or shift i have definitely had that experience where a fabric feels super soft in the store and then when you take it home and wash it it feels completely different so the first really obvious difference is the thickness and weight of the fabric the everlane t-shirt which is also the cheapest one is definitely the thinnest fabric it's extremely lightweight very kind of gauzy the armed angels one is also very lightweight but the knit is a little denser then we have the pack t-shirt in the middle and then the organic basics and the cotton t-shirt are quite a bit denser while they are about the same thickness the organic basics one is softer while the cotton one is a stiffer knit the everlane packed and organic basics are softer than the armed angels and the cotton but they might soften up over time they only have been washed once it's not like an uncomfortable stiffness just when you compare them so i've just laid them out from cheapest to most expensive because it is important to keep price in mind because this one is half of the cost of this one so you know there are going to be quality differences just based on that but the next thing i want to compare is construction and what i have noticed is they all have this piece of fabric along the back of the neck which is really good but then if we go into the t-shirts and inspect the shoulder seams the brands have done different things so the everlane shirt is just surged there's nothing else added to the shoulder seam and that's a common place that tends to stretch out at least when i was studying clothing construction we were told to always do something to kind of reinforce the shoulder seam the pack shirt has a piece of elastic sewn in this type of elastic is used a lot in clothing construction and it's added as they're serging the seam to provide some extra support and help with retention the cotton shirt also doesn't have anything added but because this is a much more dense knit i'm not actually sure that this necessarily needs some extra support the lighter and looser it is i would say the more likely it is to actually need some support so the everlane shirt i would be much more concerned about it stretching out versus this one now what armed angels has done is a clever finishing trick where they've actually put a strip of the same fabric and this is great because you're not using extra plastic which this kind of elastic is so this is still totally cotton but it is a slightly higher cost way of finishing it because you do have to cut that strip and line it all up versus just using the elastic and then the organic basics t also doesn't have anything in that seam but again i'm not necessarily sure that this one needs it because it is a denser knit and because this one actually has spandex in it it probably is a lot better at retaining that seam so even though at the higher price point i do think it would be good to maybe see a bit of extra reinforcement i'm not sure if it's actually necessary other than that all these t-shirts are basically sewn and finished the same way something to point out on this packed shirt is the hem is sort of twisting basically it wasn't a even fold it was somehow offset slightly when they sewed it when we compare the stitching the armed angels shirts and the organic basics shirt definitely have a much tighter stitch which is generally a sign of higher quality just because the looser the stitches the faster you can sew something and it's a lot less thread less cost that kind of thing so especially with fast fashion you'll see a really wide stitches often just because it makes it cheaper and faster to sew none of these stitching i would say is bad or too loose but you definitely do notice that the packed and the cotton shirt in particular have wider stitching than the armed angels and the organic basics okay so now i'm going to lay each one out flat just look at how it's cut how it sits and what we want to see is a good shape we want it to look pretty even we don't want anything looking off or crooked okay so the first thing i notice after lying the everlane shirt out flat kind of blocking it out is that we are seeing a little bit of twisting in the side seam so the seams should run perfectly straight this seam in particular starts off at the side and then as we get to the bottom it's sort of curving in a little bit so when you look at a knit fabric there are tiny tiny little lines called whales that run up and down the shirt and that needs to be cut straight or you get this kind of twisting and what also has resulted from that is that one of the shoulders is more forward and one of the shoulder seams is more back so basically we end up with a bit of a battle where if i try to get the shoulders perfectly straight and flat then my side seams are off and if i line my side seams up nice and flat then the shoulders are off so there's definitely something that's cut a little bit crooked with the pattern but what i want to point out though is that that is not really uncommon with knits especially something like a t-shirt and because this is the lowest price point shirt i mean i'm not that surprised i wouldn't say this is something that you would return it honestly most people probably wouldn't even notice unless you really kind of laid it out and blocked it out this isn't something that you would notice when it was on the hem looks pretty good it's about an inch shorter in the front than the back which is fairly common some brands do that with their t-shirts and yeah it's a pretty typical straight t-shirt construction okay so then we're gonna move on to the pack t-shirt this one is a v-neck unlike the others so it is going to be slightly different in terms of its construction okay now right away i'm noticing quite a bit of that twisting that i was talking about with the everlane this one actually has it even more it's actually twisting about an inch on each side which depending on the brand that could be within quality control tolerance and that would of course explain what i mentioned that it looked like the hem was slightly twisted i think it's just because the whole piece has been cut slightly off and this shirt i believe will try to straighten out the side seams is cut with a bit of a curve to it so it's a more fitted cut i find the armhole interesting on this packed shirt it comes in at kind of a i think sort of a unique curve for an armhole so you end up with some extra fabric under the arm here which might be good for certain fit elements and again we'll have to try it on and see how it fits if there is some extra bulkiness under the arm but it's just something i definitely noticed this one is hemmed slightly shorter than i believe all these other ones usually higher quality stuff will have a bit larger seam allowances yeah i'm just curious to see what this one's going to look like on to see if we're going to notice any of those things or not but then we have the cotton shirt and like i said earlier this is a stiffer a bit more dense shirt so we should be seeing a pretty clean even because this kind of fabric is going to be easier to cut it's going to be less likely to twist and stretch out if you want a really light drapey loose knit it does come with maybe some more quality issues maybe some more pattern issues where something is pretty dense and structured will often give you a better shape and it usually is more durable however you don't get that really soft loose drapey look okay so with this shirt we're getting really nice flat even side seams which is good to see this pattern has been cut straight the neckline also looks pretty good it's lying nice and flat there is a tiny bit of puckering or bunching along the back here especially where the tag is i'm probably being too nitpicky because this is a casual piece it's not supposed to look pristine and perfect you know it's not like we're comparing something that is very tailored or very structured like a button-up shirt and let me know if you would like to see a video like this about a different piece so these kinds of things like having a little bit of bunching along the back doesn't really make a difference you're not going to notice it so this one also does have a slightly curved side seam and this one is cut perfectly straight along the bottom there's nothing else really of a note for this shirt so we're gonna move on to the armed angels one this one like the packed one also has that same higher cut armhole with a bit of extra fabric this is the only one that isn't top stitched along the neckline and so what's happening is the serging at the front here is flipping up a bit we're gonna have to try it on to see how that exactly sits we've got that extra fabric in the shoulder which i really like okay so let's move on to our final one so this is the organic basics tee so this one and the everlane one are both cut straight so this is interesting so this one is actually cut with slightly more fabric in the front than the back so when you lay out the side seams the front rolls over ever so slightly because there's a bit more fabric and that is good design because with women's bodies you have more body in the front than you do in the back so the neckline and this one is slightly lower than the other crewnecks but it is lying beautifully flat and something that's interesting with this one in particular is the shoulder seam is actually set back slightly and that is a good thing because again when we're talking about you know how the body is distributed you have more up front than you do in the back so if you set the seam actually slightly back it tends to sit right at the top of the shoulder versus it being slightly more forward with clothing you don't want to actually see the shoulder seam on the front of the shoulder so it's better to set it back slightly and then it's sitting at the top or slightly hidden over the back of the shoulder it's not something that you would typically do with a t-shirt that's more for tailored garments but i like the fact that they have set back the seam slightly overall fabric and construction my first impression is that the organic basics tee is better quality but it also is the higher price point one so i would expect and hope that it is better quality so for the fabric and construction quality here is how i would rank them i think pact and everlane are both tied for the bottom place because while everlane had better construction pact had better quality fabric i do want to note though that pact seems to be kind of hit or miss with their sewing because when i ordered this t-shirt i also ordered a couple other pieces just to show you here's the sewing on one of my pack tank tops and there is a noticeable difference and i've heard this from others as well where some of their packed pieces are great while others have issues so i don't know if it's just the factory where this t-shirt's sewn and maybe their other pieces are sewn somewhere else or what's going on but if you are interested in packed i would encourage you to read reviews because some of their pieces are definitely sewn better than others okay so now i'm gonna compare the fit of them on first up is the everlane tee and i don't know if you guys can tell but you can definitely see where my pants are just color wise so that is indicative of the fabric not being very thick i do have a nude bra on i probably should have worn like a black bra but based on the fact that you can see my pants through it i would definitely say that you could probably see a bra through it so the fabric is not very thick it is really nice and soft though now i do have pretty broad shoulders so with all of these they're probably gonna sit a little bit high but it doesn't feel tight across here which is the biggest thing that i would look for these are all a size medium and with most brands i am between a size small and medium depending on the waist and the bust so these are a slightly looser fit i would say typically than if i went with a small but that's what i like with t-shirts another thing that we're going to try to look for is that the arm sits nice so it should sit nice and straight not really wing out at all we also want to check that the neckline looks pretty good and straight which it does and also that the hips aren't too tight and i think that that is pretty comfortable so yeah i don't have any fit complaints with this i think it fits pretty well my biggest issue with it is just the sheerness and the thinness of the fabric okay so now i have the pack t-shirt on so this is the one where the fabric was twisting the most if you look at the side seam it looks pretty straight you wouldn't notice it what you do notice on this shirt though is that the hem is slightly twisted you can just see that it's sort of lumpy and twisted now one thing that i wanted to look at is what was happening under the arm and i definitely do feel like there is some extra fabric here almost it's like striping down right here now packed in particular does fit larger than the other brands so it is a bit looser and that could also be why we're getting a bit of extra fabric under the armpit here the shoulders on this one actually are sitting on my shoulder point which is pretty uncommon for me so if you do have broader shoulders this could be a good brand for you but if you have narrow shoulders they might be too wide now twice so far i've had to flip down the seam on the sleeve and that has to do with the fact that it is such a narrow fold okay so then we have the cotton one and there is a noticeable fit difference between this one and the one before this one is definitely a lot more fitted i feel it pretty snugly across my body and because this is a much thicker and more dense knit it doesn't have that same looseness and stretch as those lighter knits do so to me this is a very different t-shirt this is a much more structured almost more like formal t-shirt if that makes any sense the shoulders are a little narrow for me i would not want to size down in this one and actually if i wanted a looser t-shirt i might even size up the shaping on the side seam is really nice it is fairly snug in the hips but because it's a denser fabric i mean it's more snug all over so this is definitely if you wanted a more structured and fitted shirt so now we have the armed angels tee and we're back to a lighter knit but this is a more fitted t-shirt than the first two that we tried on something very interesting to note is that when i felt these different t-shirts with my hand this one felt a bit stiffer but on it actually feels really soft so the other ones i think are spun with a bit fluffier yarn so at first hand it does feel like fluffier and softer whereas this one seems to have a tighter sponge fiber so even though it initially feels a bit stiffer it actually is quite like silky feeling almost on so i quite like the feeling of this and i'm pleasantly surprised by how soft it feels and that just goes to show that you can't necessarily judge things just by touching them with your hands you do have to try it on unlike some of the other ones where the shoulders were quite a ways in this to me is at a good point and when i was working as a fit model because my shoulders were a bit more broad this is where they would fit the shoulder points to so this is where the shoulders sit from most narrow to widest and so this one also looked like it had a bit of extra fabric under the arm but the packed one was larger so i think that's why we got that kind of draping and pulling this one actually fits really nicely i think along the armpits under the arm i don't at all feel like there's too much fabric there and the sleeves feel really comfortable the thing that i wanted to check is whether this was uncomfortable at all or looking weird or anything because it wasn't top stitched down that's something that i'm going to make note of as i wear it a few times and as i wear it longer but right now i don't think it's a problem at all so i really like this one as a t-shirt i think it feels really nice it fits well i don't really have any complaints about it okay so now we have the organic basics shirt and this one is unfortunately harder to see because it is black so you can't see the details as well this one is the longest one it hits me right here i'm petite i'm only 5'3 so for me that's a little bit longer than i would want my t-shirt but it's also pretty easy to hem this is the only one that has spandex in it so that is gonna affect the fit and comfort and i definitely noticed just in terms of being able to move around like there is absolutely nothing restricting my movement in any way i know people have different preferences for straight or fitted t-shirts i think the fitted shirts look a bit nicer if you're tucking them in really tight but i also run into the issue which will see if that happens as we're wearing it that the fitted shirts tend to kind of like bunch up around the waist whereas straight shirts don't have that issue and i also prefer the way they look if you tuck them in loosely so yeah just a personal preference but i do tend to like a straighter cut shirt again i don't really have any fit issues or complaints the fabric is really nice and soft and i think everything looks really good here are the shirts side by side to see the fit differences so then i wore and washed each t-shirt at least three times the cotton and packed shirts i enjoyed wearing the least the packed shirt because the hems really bothered me and just don't look very good and the cotton shirt because i prefer looser and drapier shirts so this kind of style just felt a bit heavy and restrictive and they do actually have lighter shirts which i probably should have gotten but at the time i ordered these it was going into winter so i think they were featuring their heavier shirts so i am interested to try some of their other shirts but if you are a person who likes thicker denser and more fitted tees then i do think this is a great t-shirt it's just not the style that i usually like while the everlane shirt was soft and comfortable to wear i didn't like the fabric and that it was so thin and sheer and i had to be careful of what color undergarments i had underneath the armed angel shirt was also really comfortable to wear but the little bit of neckline surging did flip up which i was worried about and it bothered me a bit i don't know why that isn't just stitched down it's just a small thing but compared to the other ones it was noticeable and finally the organic basics tee i liked the best there was really nothing to complain about it was soft and comfortable and really stretchy and easy to move in so now let's compare their environmental and ethical practices and this is all based on what they say publicly so things that we as customers could easily find on their websites for the material packed organic basics and armed angels all use got certified organic cotton which is a great certification cotton and everlane do not use organic cotton however cotton has direct trade practices and they work with cotton farmers in egypt so they have a lot of traceability and transparency around their cotton and they also say that they are working directly with the farmers to improve their systems and get organic certification everlane says that they are moving to organic cotton by 2023 so still a few years from now however i have noticed that they are incorporating some organic cotton into their collection they didn't have it when i ordered this t-shirt but it looks like they do have an organic cotton t-shirt now it's also important to note that the organic basics tee has some spandex in it which is a negative for sustainability in that it's synthetic however spandex also greatly improves the retention so it won't stretch out and lose its shape as fast which is a positive for longevity and sustainability and i have a video that goes way more into spandex and sustainable fashion and why it's often a necessary evil so i will link that if you haven't watched it yet it digs all into that in terms of other areas of sustainability organic basics and armed angels in particular have lots of great information about different things they're doing to reduce their impact like addressing water and chemical use and lowering waste and energy cotton has some good info about what they're doing with water and dyeing and organic basics and packed both carbon offset their shipping pact and everlane really don't have much information about other sustainability initiatives and the ones that everlane does share all have to do with their office or their stores and not really the manufacturing of the garments so overall for sustainability organic basics and armed angels definitely seem to be doing the most now let's look at the brand's ethics so the god certification which i already mentioned does include some social aspects armed angels has fair trade certification and pact is fair trade certification for some but not all their products and they say this is because the products which aren't certified are manufactured in countries where there already is strict wage and labor laws while the fair trade certification is great i do wish that pact provided a bit more specific information about their factories organic basics manufacturers in europe and they are really transparent about their factories they even have information like how many hours a week the employees work and how many vacation days they get and the factories have a variety of sustainability and ethical certifications cotton also has really good transparency around their factories and supply chain but not many certifications everlane also has good transparency about their factories but no certifications that i could find and they also don't seem to really include information about wages or social programs both organic basics and cotton are certified b corps and if you want to learn more about what that means i have a video about that and organic basics and armed angels also both have pita vegan approved products it's also worth noting that cotton does a lot of work building schools and improving literacy in egypt in the communities where they farm and manufacture in so overall for ethics obviously fair trade certification is great because it's a third party that comes in and audits but i also think organic basics has some really good transparency around their manufacturing and i think cotton is doing some really interesting things with their kind of farm to closet approach it's not a business model that we see a lot again everlane is on the bottom for me because even though they disclose information about their factories they really don't say much about the ethical treatment of workers they say that they aim for a 90 score on their internal audit but we really have no idea if factories actually get that score or how close to that score they are and this is probably a good time to chat a bit more about everlane because it's been a bit of a roller coaster i've never recommended everlane initially it was because they weren't really doing anything in terms of sustainability and their radical transparency just was never very transparent however over the last few years they've been doing a lot more with sustainable materials and some people who i really admire and respect in the ethical fashion space seem to love them so i thought maybe i was being too harsh and that i should give them a shot and when i decided to make this video i thought that would be a perfect opportunity now i ordered these t-shirts last year in the fall it's taken me a long time to get this video out but when i ordered them i was approaching everlane with an open mind and then shortly after i got the shirt information came out that everlane had been union busting which is incredibly unethical and then later on more allegations came out about them just having a very toxic and racist work environment so just when i was trying to give everlane a shot it turns out that they're actually not a very ethical company and in short i would not recommend everlane i don't think they're a good brand their radical transparency is ridiculous and just seems like a marketing gimmick and it's not just their ethics and transparency their sustainability and quality is also lacking so now let's get into my final thoughts and if these brands are worth their prices i think it's pretty obvious that everlane is at the bottom while the price point is the most accessible the quality isn't particularly good they don't have a lot of information available and they're just doing some shady stuff based on just this t-shirt i also wouldn't recommend packed the construction quality really isn't very good and they don't have a lot of information available but they do have the gots and fair trade certifications to back them up however like i said i have had some really good quality packed stuff so i guess if you are interested just know that it might be a bit of a gamble try your best to research the quality of the garment and know that you might have to return things for a lower price point option i would definitely recommend cotton this shirt is only five dollars more than the everlane shirt the sewing and fabric is really nice quality and even though it's not organic i do really like what they're doing in terms of being fully involved in their supply chain and manufacturing if you really care about sustainability then organic basics and armed angels are both great organic options they're soft and comfortable the fit is good the quality is good and both these brands are doing a lot of things to reduce their impact armed angels is very expensive to ship to north america though so keep that in mind if you are looking at price however it's a great option for those of you in europe organic basics is also based in europe however they do have distributors in the us and canada which i can link as well so i guess now a big question is is the organic basics tea actually worth almost 40 us dollars and almost twice the everlane tea honestly if you're able to spend that you will get a really soft comfortable good quality t-shirt it's really wearable and i think is going to be a staple in my wardrobe plus as a brand they have a really great mission and practices which i think are worth supporting one of my only issues with this t-shirt is just the lack of colors because it only comes in white and black but i also get that not everyone can drop forty dollars on a t-shirt and actually in canadian dollars i ended up spending fifty dollars on this t-shirt but after comparing it with the other shirts i do feel better about the price however if it's too much for you then i think cotton is at a great price point for what you get and if all these prices are inaccessible for you then definitely check out my videos on building a sustainable and ethical wardrobe on a budget i will link those down below because slow fashion is expensive but there are lots of different ways that you can have a more conscious closet for all different budgets so after all of this organic basics armed angels and cotton would be my top picks depending on what kind of t-shirt you're looking for so this was definitely the longest and most work i've ever put into a video so please please give this a thumbs up if you liked this and found it helpful also i would love to hear your feedback in the comments so would you like to see more of this kind of video with different products and brands and also what aspects of the review were most helpful for you and any other feedback you have like was this too long i know i personally really like lots of details and information but maybe it's too much for most people so let me know this is my first time making this style of video so i just really love to hear what you think of it thank you for watching and an extra special thank you to those of you supporting me on patreon i would not be able to do videos like this without that extra support it's definitely expensive ordering a bunch of sustainable t-shirts and putting this much work into a video so i really really appreciate it and i will see you guys in the next one [Music]", "ecM7Hn2eF0M": "what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel today I'm going to be doing a review on my new favorite shirt from Uniqlo this is going to be a review on the Uniqlo you oversized crewneck shirt and I've been really enjoying the shirt a couple of weeks ago I did a video reviewing three basic white tee shirts from Uniqlo and you guys seem to enjoy it and in that video I mentioned that I would also be doing some non-standard or a little bit more trendy shirts from Uniqlo once in a while and this is going to be the first one the Uniqlo uline is sort of the more trendy line from Uniqlo they experiment with different silhouettes that are not you know super standard a lot of the stuff that they're doing now is sort of more retro inspired so they do boxy or tees they do thicker materials they do all sorts of stuff that you won't find on their standard line which is something that I really liked in that previous video I showed you their standard Uniqlo you crewneck shirt which is again it's very boxy it does have a thicker material and this shirt the oversize Uniqlo you crewneck is sort of a step further than that so if we go through the shirt you have the same thicker material that you get with that previous Uniqlo view shirt but what you get is an even more exaggerated silhouette the shirt isn't as long as the original Uniqlo you shirt is actually a little bit shorter and the sleeves are much longer they actually reach my elbows and they're kind of wide in addition to that you have a nice big pocket out in front and I think this shirt is super cool now this isn't a shirt that I would typically wear on a day-to-day basis because I will do like keeping it more standard but for those days where I just want to be a little bit different I want a different silhouette to what I'm wearing this is the shirt that I pull out when I wear the shirt I like wearing it with other pieces of clothing that reflect the same shape as this so when I wear pants I don't typically wear skinny jeans with this I wear a slim - straight cut Jean I also do like cuffing up the pants to give it a slightly shorter look a slightly boxier look and I paired it up with chunky shoes now I typically wear Doc Martens so that isn't really a problem as most of them do have that chunky silhouette the size that I get in Uniqlo is a large but a lot of you guys mentioned in my previous video that sizes probably differ from country to country from region to region so this large might be more like medium in places like the US so if you guys have a store near you I would recommend dropping by to try it out to see how it feels so yeah that's it guys that is a quick review of this unique low you oversized crewneck shirt hope you guys enjoyed if you guys want me to do more videos like this again leave those in the comment box down below and I'll be sure to make those happen subscribe if you haven't yet like the video share it with your friends and I'll see you guys in the next one", "HUrjHRy4fhg": "what up guys how you doing Brian here with geek skills and today we are talking about basic tees you know buying a t-shirt used to be pretty easy you go to Costco you go to champs you buy like five or six t-shirts at once and you are good to go but unfortunately it doesn't seem like they make t-shirts like they used to the most recent pack of t-shirts I bought from hmmm or horrible quality they shrank and they developed this weird little ribbing thing on the collar here that looks really really bad so I did all kinds of research online to find out what were the best basic men's t-shirts and what I found was pretty ridiculous I mean I was finding t-shirts for anywhere from 40 to 60 bucks a pop like when did it become so hard to find a good basic tee but after scouring the internet for hours and reading hundreds of reviews I think I finally found the best men's tees and the great thing about them is that they're super cheap and you can get them on Amazon now before we get into the actual t-shirt I think we need to define what a good men's t-shirt is first and foremost a men's t-shirt has to fit well now if you're super jacked like some of those guys on YouTube who recommend clothes then honestly you're gonna look good in anything the sleeves a chest and even the stomach are gonna hug you in all the right places if you're super fit and have an eight-pack but if you have an average build then you're gonna want a t-shirt that hugs you in all the right places and avoid certain areas so that you still look good first and foremost a good men's tee is gonna fit snugly with your arms now if you buy a cheap tee at some place like H&M it's probably gonna have this weird Winnie thing I think you know what I'm talking about it means when your sleeves don't fit quite right and so they wing out to the side like this now there's an aspect of that where that fits in with modern street wear but that's not what we're talking about right now having sleeves that don't fit you right make your arms look small and so for a man it's important to have a t-shirt that fits you right especially around the arms and ideally the sleeves aren't too long so that it shows off a little bit more of your bicep even if you don't have big arms having a t-shirt that fits snugly around the bicep area and is scooted a little bit higher will actually look way better than a shirt with one of those weird wingy things another thing that's annoying about t-shirts is that usually they shrink in the wash that means that you'll go to a store and find a t-shirt that you feel like fits you perfectly and then you go home and you wash it for the first time and then suddenly it's like you're wearing a midriff you want a t-shirt that's the right length not too long and not too short you don't want it to be so long so that it looks like you're wearing a dress and you don't want it too short so that it's showing off your Belford a little bit of your belly if you happen to move in the wrong way and another thing that you want from a good t-shirt is enough space around the stomach area if you have even a little bit of a gut then a slim fitting or tight or thin t-shirt is gonna look weird is it gonna hug you in all the wrong places so a good team will be bagged here around the stomach area but will be tighter around the chest area that's why it's important to find a t-shirt that's tight around the chest tight around the arms but loose around the stomach area so that if you happen to have that little bit of extra of gut it's not hugging in a weird way but it isn't the only thing that matters you also have to look at material quality some people like heavy tees some people like thin tees and it really matters about your preference and maybe the weather in your area but generally speaking you're gonna want a t-shirt that's soft and comfortable to wear but also isn't so thin that it's almost see-through and the last thing is price I mean you can get a cheap t-shirt for like five four dollars you can buy a pack of four or five for 20 and you'll probably get some decent tees that you can wear underneath clothes but if you want to wear the t-shirt by itself it probably is not going to look at that good in the same vein you probably don't want to spend $50 for one t-shirt when you could use that money to buy even like a jacket or something a lot nicer so after doing my research I found these next level tees now I mean literally the brand is called next level and they make these awesome t-shirts that are really snug around the arms and give you plenty of space around the stomach so that your gut doesn't show here's a photo of me wearing the t-shirt before I ever wash them the t-shirts were really long when I first got them but after washing them they shrink to a much more manageable size material quality seems pretty good like I could wear this t-shirt every day and I don't think I'd have any issues it's comfortable it's light it's breathable and it isn't folding in any strange places and at the time of this recording you could buy one other t-shirts for about 6 bucks I've been wearing these t-shirts for a while now and I can honestly say that they check all the right boxes they fit super well they are made of great material and they're the right price I honestly plan on replacing all my t-shirts with these tees eventually the one caveat that I should point out though is that I think the white tees are a little bit more see-through than the darker color tees so if you're looking for a good white tee maybe you buy one first try it out and if it doesn't work for your skin tone or it's a little bit too see-through for you then go ahead and return it so if you want to check out the tees for yourself go ahead and hit the link in the description below you'll be able to check them out for yourself do your own research but honestly after doing hours of work into looking to this I can say that these are the best tee shirts I've ever worn and they are super affordable anyways guys I hope that this video helped you out if you have any questions for me hit me up in the comment section below otherwise I will catch you in the next one see ya you", "y-E2mW7mCH0": "hello everyone happy Saturday today I would like to show you quick trick well it's not that quick but it's very interesting trick about sublimation as you all know you cannot print white on on a dark t-shirt on the dark garment with sublimation simply because there is no waiting and even if there will be white ink it will it won't I don't think there will be OPEC enough to to stay on the undershirt you wouldn't die the shirt so you would have to use some kind of discharge before so so if you bored with with printing on just a polyester mags and and stuff that's widely available for your suppliers try to think outside of the box a little bit so I will show you something different today so as you can see there is an image and is white it's on a black background so this is what I hope it will look on my dark t-shirt and this will be printed with tight sublimation printer and with dye sublimation ink there is no special formula formula for those things is just a general sublimation energy used for printing on mags and and other items so let me go to my layers window so here we go this is how it will print you probably won't say it's just a slightly slightly white greyish on it will be on the paper so on the t-shirt you should look like this so I'll go ahead and I print it off on the very special paper and we'll show you well I hope I will show you how it will look one once is pressed to the to the t-shirt ticket will be black well it's not going to be t-shirt I just try to press it on some kind of scrub cotton material so go ahead and print some artwork first and see you in a minute so here I am back so job is printed and hopefully I get the property as you can see is printed lightly gray and ink is still wet so the trick is we as I mentioned there is no no white pigment in the sublimation printer but there is a great so what we were gonna do we're gonna help we're gonna help the ink with white pigment powder so this is how it's done wet image you probably seen similar stuff on YouTube you know the thing is we just won't we just want print where the ink is we don't want anyone else so we're gonna have a go my scrap nevermind anyway so this is the this is the this is like a pigment powder so what we have to do now need to dry we need to dry the image so the in same thing to the pigment so that sink into the pigment so here we go I'm going to put it under the press for a couple minutes just like this so he's a so you dry out I will see you in a second okay so a couple of minutes just gone so the image should be dry I'm not gonna touch it just in case it isn't I don't know if you can see you can see that with the powder here done and just remember guys this is just normal sublimation ink just I just printed it gray there's nothing special in here there's no special inks no special printers is just a special paper and special powder coating so um so I never done it before you might be a failure but you never know until you try so here we go so this is the scrub cotton scrap cotton shirt I'm going to repress it and now it's a big moment will you work oh really no image might be slightly too big for that for my tiny little press off we don't see you in a few seconds okay guys 10 seconds to go six and we'll see if this is a game changer oh this is a failure as I said first time I'm doing it so I have no idea what to expect I just following them I'm just following instruction from the supplier and they say to cool it down don't don't lift the paper when he's warm so we just lay here I'm not gonna turn the camera off so you can see it you just cool it down on the table and beef moment in a minute in tea in theory there shouldn't be an image because as I said is a cotton that's a sublimation sublimation dollar we've gotten and there is no and the light ink doesn't show up on the dark so let's have a look that is quite cold no just give it a few more seconds to be sure oh there is a image there you go there is a image look at that nice there is a image something we made as well he's not sublimated but he's use of sublimation printer he's very very grainy I think maybe I just didn't do enough powder but that's quite cool that it's quite cool that's actually not but let's have a look with another scrap and the other text I prepared I'm not sure if that drawing yet so we give it a few seconds and let's try this craft if the scrap is big enough should be just just big enough just press it and trim it so I can see why powerful places okay apply image class and wait take ten seconds left and no see if that attempt will be also have any good now let's zoom in to that I think we can release an image well there is an image look at this right so now I don't know guys is this acceptable for sublimation I don't think so so I'm not sure if I'm doing everything correctly from the images that supplier send me that image should be dead-on white to me is very grainy so looks like one I didn't apply enough powder oh I may be over dry there but they definitely differently there is an image I don't try to the mean that and he's very very softly no if you have to distress look that's that's good babe that could be your your thing but anyway I've got one more thing to show you again I didn't I didn't try that before so everything is from the PDF that supplier sent me so please bear with me and I will be back with another print in a minute all right so here I am back with living you art won't let go don't know if you can see in fingers there is a unicorn that printed with grey so this supposed to be very attractive effect on the dark or dark government and we're gonna tell you what it is yet but because I wanna I wanna see I'm gonna see if you say so here we go so we with the solution yeah now probably you can see already what it is then yeah yeah very funky very funky oh can you say it now he's a glitch ha here we go so let's see how this glitch I will show up on the dark government so we're gonna try me I can see lots of data around the image so let's try I don't know if you can see these lovely enshrining let's zoom in okay so I've got my scrap look at my scrap pre-press and then for 34 seconds we're going to press a unicorn see you some on a couple seconds left six seconds to be precise and we're going to see if this is a oh boy oh boy effect oh he's a disappointment so I'll let it cool down first actually if you can say hey this is very very sparkly powder so in theory there should be sparkly unicorn show up on the dark t-shirt and this is oh all with the sublimation ink and a bit of a special powder okay so look one two three woo actually unicorn die oh oh I like that I don't like the little little bits of unique sorry glitter around the image by two like that I don't like the sublimated dance already printed unicorn so this is some definitely yes for me let's try the is quite stretchy yeah that's brilliant that's actually I really like it so here we go so we've got semi-decent or maybe not even semi-decent a white print we have we have a distressed look yeah she's not too patterned on this on this artwork and a unicorn nice and shiny glittery okay so I have a one more thing for you one more thing obviously we have to try this powder on white garment so I will be back in three seconds okay I'm back with some white scrap t-shirt I just heard lying around and another image of Isis pretty obviously coated already and these protists is exactly same as with all the ones you just put the paper put the powder on your image paper is exactly the same just trim it and try to apply it on white effect if he's going to be a disappointment let me remind you I'm printing with a sublimation ink on a sublimation printer on a sublimation paper but it's a special paper it's not there's normal paper you could just buy like a tropics orders and on a cotton t-shirt so this is not polyester shirt is a cotton shirt you cannot sublimate to the cotton but you can prefer a kit to sublimate on the treatment so it does work sometimes the old supply is all over the world trying to come up with a better and better ideas all the time but obviously some of them better some of them the worse but this is another one so let's have a look let's give them a chance we want the game change or do we Hey and as usual 34 seconds 3 2 1 beep so let's call it down simple last time a few seconds and we're going to see if you work

so you", "kbaFUHg2UjA": "[Music] [Applause] [Music]", "a7M61pYYlOk": "Hi I'm Kali from Online Fabric Store. Since dye is one of the quickest and easiest ways to add color to a project, or to an existing piece of fabric,\ntoday I'm going to be demonstrating a simple immersion technique using Rit Dye. Rit Dye is great for all skill levels because it contains a mixture of several different types of dye, making\nit a really great option if you want to dye something that's a blend or contains multiple kinds of fibers For this project you'll need: Rit Dye in\nwhatever colors you like, we're using navy and black Something to dye, in our case we're using a cotton bag Buckets, Gloves, some salt, and something to stir with like a stick, or a spoon. Before you start it's a pretty\ngood idea to make sure that you have your workspace covered, so we just have a really cheap plastic\ndrop cloth here they're pretty easy to find at the hardware store, but anything you might have laying\naround your house is a good idea too, so a bed sheet, or a canvas drop cloth, or an old rag, just something to make sure that you're\nnot getting dye everywhere. You also want to make sure that you have some gloves, And an old hoodie, or a t-shirt or an apron. Pre-washing your fabric will get you\nbetter dye coverage so if you can, try not to skip this step. It's also useful\nif your material is still a little bit damp when you dye because it'll help\nsoak up color faster, and with fewer bubbles. When mixing dye colors, it's important to\nstart with the lightest color first, and slowly add in your black or\ndarker shades. To make our dye bath, we're gonna start\nwith our navy blue Rit Dye. Since we're dyeing about a pound a\nfabric, we're gonna add half of the container\nsince the container will dye up to 2 pounds of fabric. To get a darker shade of navy blue, like indigo, we're going to add just a splash of black. The last thing we want to do before we\nenter our fabric into the dye bath is add our salt. It's a good idea to use about 1/4 cup per 1/2 pound of fabric. For this project we're using about a gallon of water just to get even coverage over our fabric. You want to make sure that there's enough water to cover your project easily, so that it can be fully immersed in the dye bath. Once our dye is mixed, we're going to drop our fabric in. Make sure to mush it all around and be\nsure that there are no bumps or bubbles in the fabric. That air will give you some\ninconsistencies which can be really pretty, but ultimately are not what you're looking\nfor with the full immersion dye bath. We're going to let this batch of fabric sit in there for about half an hour, so that we get a nice rich color. After about a half an hour of soaking, check on your fabric and see if it has reached your desired shade. When you're ready to remove your fabric,\ntake it out and gently bring it back into the bucket to get off any excess dyes. To rinse, start with hot water.  This will open up the fibers and make sure that you're able to rinse out all the dye. As the water starts to turn clear, begin to add some cold water. This transition into cold water will help the fibers shrink back up and lock in any remaining dye. Don't be afraid if the shade looks a little darker than what you wanted.  Wet fabric always looks darker. And there you have it, you've added a fresh new color to some fabric. You can wash these anyway you like, Rit Dye is really good at being steadfast in the wash, but if you're like me and you want to keep them looking clean and pristine, you'll hand wash them gently in cold water. Thanks for watching this OFS project!", "pT-l_XSqq18": "especially returning these these don't buy the Hutton these t-shirts are hot garments like don't even buy those YouTube what is going on in Detroit GZ in AEG bean Kesey and in today's video we're gonna be trying on all of these t-shirts all these white tees that are either from H&M Zara in your knee glow and we're trying to find out which one is the best white t-shirt for your essential wardrobe rotation going through different fabrics price and also the fitting so let's go ahead and talk about it before watching this video is that in my personal opinion there really is no such thing as a perfect white t-shirt that can last you for decades not really anyway or not not necessarily one brand name that I have gone to because if there was I would have found it by now and a big reason behind making this video is that a lot of people are curious as far as what the differences are between these white shirts compared to another brand just putting that out there so anyways let's go ahead and do this just a zoom out here real quick okay so the way we're gonna format this I'm just gonna go shirt by shirt try them on and we're gonna go through some categories like fit price comfort ability and also things like fabric if I leave out any of those details in a particular t-shirt we could talk about it in the comment section below okay first up we got these through neck dry color t-shirts by you to blow and I bought a large and I bought an extra-large I've never tried them on as full crew I've never even seen this actually this is kind of like in their pajama section seven dollars and ninety cents almost ten bucks per shirt maybe there's two of them in here I don't know what about to find I was going to open this up I'm hoping that these are returnable though got it fabric is not bad it's kind of soft not bad it does look a little bit see-through mind go ahead and try this one on first this is a size large by the way alright for the sake of this video I'm taking my chain off it's a little too thin for me it definitely feels way more of a kind of feels like a pajama like I just kind of mentioned if I'm looking in the mirror biggest drawback to this is that you can actually see my wife beater underneath like look how see-through that it's like I bet you if I didn't have this wife beater on could totally seen it would I absolutely hate what teachers do that like it sucks it looks really stupid I look stupid you look sooo the Libyan rebels you already know what it is let's just try on the extra large for kicks and giggles anyway but we already know that this t-shirt is just not it okay this one's looking a little more promising as I'm trying it on as far as size goes I mean extra large honestly fits like a large I'm a my true to size is a large I bet you through the camera you can see my pants can you see my pants like if you can see your pants through the t-shirt or through the t-shirt no this it's an automatic no like I just like nipples and pants you can see my nipples and you can see my boxers and pants through your t-shirt then you shouldn't even be wearing a t-shirt doesn't even make sense I would say for sure these are more of like a pajama and I don't even know for sure if they are for pajamas or not the only Plus that I would say to this t-shirt that I do like is that this collar is actually kind of tight the neck area actually stays the same size as the size large which I like because if I end up sizing up maybe to a double X which I don't even think they have double exit you know go for this t-shirt and I was looking at the top and there was just only XL ring of the next day is the same size which is good because if you end up getting two sizes up are size up the the ring of the next not gonna get like you know two inches bigger an inch bigger kind of suck sometimes good then you can see your collarbone I mean that's great but that is enough for me to keep this t-shirt where you can see nips wife-beater boxers and pants no go I'm gonna put this one to the side for now okay so this is the super thin Yuna globe t-shirt you see my hand like you can you can see my hand right okay so then now we're gonna put the thicker one on here hold on now can you see my hand it's way harder so like clearly this one is like way thicker so just the thin t-shirts like just stay away from these these suck okay next brand we got up is we're gonna talk about Zara and we bought one t-shirt out of this whole stack of t-shirts that is from Zara and this is actually a shirt that I'm very familiar with so let's go ahead and try it on first still got the tag on I'm already I'm keepin the shirt I already know I am because I own I own a couple of these and reason why I absolutely love these shirts is because they're not seeing through very different than what we just tried on this one you can't see through it and if you can't comment and let me know that you can see this I mean as far as I know you can't see my wife later you probably can't see my pants either also I like the fit too it's not like boxy not like crazy boxy words like too high here this is a size large but it does fit between like large and XL if that if that's not even like really a size but if I were to just like give you a gauge of what it kind of fits like and I love that I love that it comes down to here cuz it covers up my farmers can just keep it in one it doesn't rise that's too high doesn't rise down too low not trying to be like too trendy I love it the fabric is also very soft these do come in at a whopping $20 and also a very quick tip for this t-shirt from Zara is that they make them usually in like three colors black white I think like a beige color and I think that's it but as far as I know right now these are kind of like year-round because when I first started buying these shirts ending 2017 beginning 2018 I started buying these shirts from Zara and these are not like the cheap shirts because they make like three or four different batches of different types of white t-shirts they have ones that are super see-through they suck they have like elongated ones I pass on those samples with zippers I also pass on those but this is just like your regular mundane white t-shirt but it's like a little bit of fabric softening is actually very nice too for some people you might even eat the size down but for me I just go true to size I go with a large it works for me and also best thing about it is if you wash it and dry it it doesn't wrinkle as much especially for being you know it being a cheaper t-shirt $20 t-shirt it is what it is I love it let's go ahead and move on to the next shirt okay next shirt we got up is another unit load shirt I literally bought these without without even looking at them and I didn't know it came with a pocket tried my best not to buy t-shirts for this video with pockets but you know we're already here at this point we already have both of the t-shirts in a size large and also an XL let me try on the size large first size large it does look a little oversized already kind of even bigger than the shirt that I have on and also it looks a little bit more boxy but let's go ahead and try it on and see how this goes and wow this is very this is like pretty oversized hold on it's all it's oversized I'm very boxy actually well I'm not bad I'm kind of impressed to be honest it's not a bad shirt this is a little longer than what we just tried on but it's actually not really like technically boxy because it has this little I don't know what you call this it has like a break here and then it comes down lower in the back but which is which is kind of cool if you're looking for a boxy t-shirt and if you're at Uniqlo I would try these out in addition to that I would say the fabric is pretty nice the fabric is a little thinner than these are t-shirt that I just tried on I don't know how these will hold up in the wash way better than the like pajama type t-shirt and I don't know if you can see can you see my wife beater through it if I do this and you can see the wife beater then it's bad if I do that obviously because you know you see the crease there but if you can see right through it I'm assuming you can't because the fabric is like a little bit thicker I guess right not bad I would say the only thing pushing me away from buying this is this whole little trendy thing I've kind of stayed away from buying t-shirts that do this like little breakage here because I'm really just not into it anymore it just kind of reminds me of going to Zara and then paying for those are teas that have like zippers and weird cuts and kind of like dated back like four or five years I just try to stay away from those and just try to get like regular t-shirts also if you like cigarette holder pocket King that's also a cool thing too I also stay away from t-shirts that have these pockets I don't know why I don't I don't use the pocket much I don't smoke cigarettes I don't have anything light enough to put in my pocket if that makes sense okay we can go ahead and try on the extra-large anyway even though the large fits we can go ahead and try on the extra-large just to show you the size difference seeing that this is an extra-large I'm already we already know this is gonna be huge but anyways this is yeah it's just it's a little too boxy for me the large fit extra-large probably pass on it let's go ahead and move on to the next shirt okay next t-shirt up is from H&M not much to say about it other than the fact that I just I literally walked right eighty-thousand where's the white t-shirts found it purchased it and I just kind of held it up against my body the launch looked too small I only grabbed an extra large so I don't have large and extra-large to compare today so let's go ahead and try this on and then see the difference so as we know when it comes to like the tiers of fast fashion you talked about hmm chuckles ara you know globe whatever other fast fashion houses there are out there those are like the top three in tears it's like you know close at the top bars in the middle and sometimes they battle between top and middle and then H&M is pretty much the bottom of the barrel when it comes to that depending on the item of course all of you eyes I would say this is way thinner this fits and feels exactly like you know Glo JAMA t-shirt that is super thin it literally feels like it's from the same exact Factory my guess is that if I end up washing this and drying it it's it's like toast like literally it is probably a t-shirt that you can only wear once and then once you dry it comes out of the dryer it's like all crinkled and then on top of all of that hmm ste shirt is see-through you can totally see through it if I didn't have my wife beater on you would see nibbles and I'm telling you right now nobody on my channel would want to see that it is but if you really are I guess Ram conscious or a brand loyal to H&M and if you really want to get these shirts I would say size up this extra-large definitely feels like a large to me doesn't really feel like an XL this feels like more of like a pajama t-shirt not even for sports more pajamas a shirt that you just don't care about next shirt okay so the next and final shirt that we have up here is again from Uniqlo we're going back to Uniqlo really quick I've really wanted to talk about these because these have kind of been in conversation with a couple other channels and then also some of my friends have been wearing these as well and they've been recommending this t-shirt to me these are a little bit thicker than the previous Uniqlo t-shirts that we're talking about here today but they're a different fabric they are called crewneck short sleeve t-shirt I mean I hate when they can you give it a different name let's let's just try it on entertain myself a little bit here I'm gonna try the XL on before I try the large on even though I've never tried XL on before so the XL is actually not that bad sizing wise can't see through it right well I can't anyway it's a little too thick for you to see through this is definitely gonna be a lot warmer of a t-shirt compared to the others I would definitely not name this as a pajama t-shirt a lot thicker than actually a majority of the t-shirts that we try on here today but the only difference between this and the others are a t-shirt and you know glow like trendy fitting shirt which I will maybe give the name here is that the fabric on this is a little bit rougher on the skin it's definitely not like a soft fabric this kind of feels like like recycled fabric if like against your skin it does anyway and then also it doesn't like when you do this I know this is like a straight really strange example but when the fabric kind of rubs against your pants and also either a wife-beater underneath and stuff it just it feels like a fabric is gripping on to whatever other fabric it's touching I still prefer the Zara t-shirt over this one as far as fabric goes and also fit even though this is an extra large not really too bad of a fit I would say but let's go ahead and try all the large this is the XL let's see what the large fits like okay this is a lot smaller okay the large large works I think I think large is what do you guys think it's hard to maybe harder to tell on camera but I guess if you want the oversize fit then go for the XL or go for the size up these fit pretty true to size like this is a very true to size large I would say it definitely has a different feel since it does feel a little bit smaller than the extra-large the same specs as this this is just a large compared to an XL it kind of works out it's not bad whether or not I'll keep this one hard to say I have to I have to sleep on this one I don't know it's not it's definitely not perfect the fit is nice the collar is nice you definitely get a thicker color on these on these you do glow ones and you kind of get like this human-made looking collar the collar is a little bit tighter than the Zara one that I like so much out of this bunch but as far as like fabric goes I don't really like this fabric that much I do like the Zara one a little better because it's a lot softer than this one in particular [Music] it's my shirt here real quick yeah just have to kind of summarize this whole thing and I've been wanting to make a video like this for a long time and making a video like this just before we talk about the rest of this here is very difficult because there's too many variations when it comes to white t-shirt and also there is a lack of affordable essential t-shirts that are good geordie I would say 90% 99% besides the one percent that I want to talk about here today I actually like and I will actually keep I'm literally only going to keep one of these t-shirts and it's actually originally the t-shirt that I liked to begin with the Uniqlo one's fabric really isn't soft enough compared to the Zara t-shirt and also the Uniqlo t-shirt that had the better fabric ended up having like that really weird cut on the side of the t-shirt I'm not really a big fan of that those those type of teachers to me just feel a little bit too trendy and I'd like my t-shirts to just be regular mundane shirt instead of like some like fad fit if that's like the right words for it out of the bunch the best one is the Zara t-shirt I don't always shop as ara I know I've made a couple videos either about Zara I do talk about Zara some of my flannels suffer from Zara but you know Zara has a good like 3% of their products that I like okay the rest of them are a little bit too trendy for me and usually the quality is checked a little bit too low but as far as the Zara teacher goes compared to the rest of them I would say the thick is true to size and also the fabric is soft enough I know for a fact that these kind of last through the storm of washing them over and over and over and over and them also keeping the same shape and not wrinkling so much because of whatever particular fabric this is I think in total today I spent like how much should I spend I probably spent like over 100 it's like 120 if you're wondering yes I'm returning stuff especially returning these these don't buy these don't buy these you see these crewneck dry dry color teeth don't buy these these are these are these are pretty bad trends trash if you want to show nipples in your t-shirt and you want to show your belt while wearing the t-shirt at the same time then go ahead and buy these but if not then t-shirts are hot garbage like well don't even buy those so with all that was said today make sure you guys are girls keep the lock right here for our latest information from clothing music to culture it is your boy and I'll see you next time peace Stosh it minute yeah wait a minute we don't say whatever happened to coming into Thomas baby whatever color whatever happen to come into Dolman that's all I want to know me", "fVJWMmDwH50": "We're talking about the Next Level 100%\nring-spun cotton long sleeve t-shirt. This is one of our favorite long sleeve\nt-shirts for a few reasons. First off, is the price point, it fits great into any budget and for just a\nlittle more expensive than a hundred percent cotton Gildan, you get a much\nsofter shirt. The colors, there aren't as many options as maybe the Gildan one,\nbut they're awesome because they're very standard. Instead of just telling you about the shirt though, about the fit and everything we do have our model. He's gonna come over and basically show this thing off. The first thing you're gonna notice is it does fit great, very tailored side. We have a seam right here that contours to the body just like every Next Level\nt-shirt. Next let's look at the neckline. The neckline on this is, it's bound on the inside, good stretch, a hundred percent ring-spun\ncotton. Just an awesome neckline. There's not too many special things about the neck on this shirt because it's just a standard crew neck. The sleeves though, awesome thing to note here, they're not baggy. How many of us grew up with a long sleeve t-shirt? Maybe you got it in sports and they're super baggy, you know like you think, who did they make this thing for? how many people are they fitting in here? No this shirt looks like it was made for Tyler, right here. Another thing is the sleeves. Normal long sleeve shirts have a big cuff this shirt basically just has a seam right here, so, there will be pictures on our site that you can look at for this but it's one seam right there so it's not a thick cuff. Great for pulling up it's just an awesome sleeve it doesn't feel heavy and as structured as other brands. If you compare this to the Canvas hundred percent ring-spun cotton one, you're gonna find that this one maybe feels a little more like an unstructured shirt a little more casual. I also love the\nring spun cotton in this very soft. Over the course of a good amount of washes it\nwill maintain its softness too. So, if you're looking for a great hundred percent ring-spun\ncotton long sleeve shirt. It fits a great price point, comes in awesome colors and a great fit. You look awesome in it Tyler. Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this  video please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters and so do our customers.", "bla4nI5vea0": "with a worn and vintage look and feel

our different Polly blood sublimation works best on garments with 50% polyester or more so today we're going to do some testing on a poly viscose Club and try blend so Michael can you explain the process of sublimation for us absolutely sublimation is printed on paper first the ink from the paper actually turns into a gas with enough heat and pressure and actually sublimates onto the synthetic or colleague part of the fabric sublimation only uses cyan magenta yellow black so the white or lighter colors is often used as negative space which actually creates pretty cool effect we have some paper in between each shirt what is this used for we put this paper inside it's not mandatory create the cleaner print the sometimes on thinner fabrics to ink and actually pass through to the other side so if you're only doing a front you might get a little residue on the back we are going to start off with our poly visco this is actually a new style to our line the content for this is 65% poly 35% miss Joe Sosa so it has a high content of polyester so what print do you think we should do on this style right now all over prints are really in I think I'll be perfect for this it would work great all-over print top to bottom sleep the sleeve I'm excited let's go do it let's do we like to give it a 10 second press festive blot in the shirt get any wrinkles out of it it's like a basically a giant iron I'm going to go in give it 10 seconds now we have a flattened shirt so you're gonna get a much nicer print here I'll take the paper we want to make sure you're grabbing all the steam and you know we're going to wait 30 seconds but now that we take it off that that first pre-press a lot of times you'll see a lot of inconsistencies around the seams the armpits the next that first 10 second press really gives you a better product so this looks awesome I really love it on our white I'm excited to see it on our Heather stuff let's do one yeah the next program of your club this content is 50% polyester 37.5 per second 12.5 percent rayon so it'll definitely work for sublimation what print do you think we should do on this fabric so the slub really gives a unique effect to the prints we get a lot more highs and lows I would probably do a vintage prints and out which are not really nicely so why vintage print on the club since you're not doing 100% poly automatically you're going to get a vintage affective livings you know print to it it's only sticking a 50% of the poly higher the poly the more vibrant image is going to be of course does the lower the poly the more vintage goes I know it's going to look like it's been washed 20 30 people I personally love a vintage print so I'm excited to see what this is gonna look like so let's go do it yeah so I see that you didn't leave the club in as long as you left the poly disco so is there a reason for that each fabric you're going to want to test temperature and time we're just going to have a little bit of a different reaction to that oh that looks great this fabric really pairs well with the vintage picture so next we're going to do our tribe 1 we're really known for a tri-blend we have the most color offerings in the industry and this fabric is actually offered in about 20 Styles across our line and this is the raw neck which is new to our fast fashion collection so what print do you think we should do on this fabric I think of a more colorful print you know you have the weight you can go bright you know I think a print like this would turn out really nicely on that another reason I would use a vibrant print like this the blend of this fabric of this island is automatically gonna dull it down give it that vintage effect again you want to go with a more vibrant you're automatically going to get a vintage print if you were to start out with a vintage it might be a little bit too low you know so you just want to let the fabric to its thing my favorite design so what catch are we going to have the travelers going for this one's going to be at around 400 degrees Fahrenheit 25 seconds actually you'll actually see depending where the poly the caught in the rayon is in the fabric it's going to each pick up the color a little bit more automatically you're going to get some variances and some uniqueness to each print let's see what we got oh great you can see the blue the green and I mean the detail you'll never get that in screen printing screen printing uses up to a 360 mesh pounds which is actually 350 little meshes per inch per square inch with sublimation you had a much higher rate so it's really a digital print direct to the garment basic print looks like it's actually a part of the shirt which i think is so cool it is actually these fabrics are now dyed with those things as the sublimation turned into a gas they actually turned back in to a solid on the fabric let's turn now awesome this is our vintage looking Los Angeles print on our unisex Roenick scheme Michael thank you so much for having us in today we learn so much about sublimation on all of our different poly blends and I'm excited for us to more videos with you you guys are always welcome here love working with you guys and I love the styles are coming out with if you want to stay tuned to what Michael's up to follow them on dpla print on instagram you can always follow us on our Instagram Facebook and please subscribe to our YouTube channel we have a ton more content coming your way [Music]", "EOpkP-R2CuU": "what's going on guys in this video we're gonna talk about how you can start a t-shirt business from home with as little as five hundred dollars let's not waste any time and get right into it check us out guys we're going by calm type in Jordan shirt and here you'll see a bunch of t-shirts so these shows will cost us around $2 to make you will need around five hundred dollars to buy all the equipment and you'll be able to make these at home these are gonna be professional quality store ready t-shirts so let's take a look at this t-shirt right here let's click on it so this seller didn't do a good job with the listing the image is horrible and the shirt is all wrinkled but still he sold 115 of these t-shirts for $20 and so he's making over $10 per shirt let's click right here and this is how many he sold so just today he sold two three four he sold for these t-shirts so off of one t-shirt he made $40 you guys can make a ton of different t-shirts from athletes and musicians to movies to much more so let's talk about how to make these shirts the first thing we're gonna do is go on a website called jittery shirts calm this is the website where we're gonna buy our blank t-shirts we're gonna buy the Gildan g500 t-shirt this is one of the most common t-shirts and it's good because it has a tare weight label so it's very convenient the show will cost around a dollar sixty cents the second thing you guys will need a special inkjet principle heat transfer paper you can get these in different sizes such as eight-and-a-half by 11 and 11 by 17 the small one is called a four and the large one is called a three you will need light transfer paper for white t-shirts and black transfer paper for dark t-shirts when you're first starting out you guys should buy these on Amazon and then you can buy the wholesale and Alibaba for around thirty cents a sheet for the large ones the next thing you guys will need is a Epson WUF 7710 printer and the fourth thing is a large heat press machine so the first thing we have to do is mirror the image let's click tools flip horizontal and now ready to print alright so when you put it on the white t-shirts we're gonna insert an 11 by 17 white paper into the printer an image I just want you guys to understand one thing even though I'm printing with a inkjet printer the ink will never smudge it will be impossible to make the income off the t-shirt the shirt will have to be destroyed this is gonna be a professional quality t-shirt the ink is gonna melt with a thin piece of vinyl onto the t-shirt so when the paper is printed it's not gonna look too bright but when it's on the shirt isn't look much better the next step is to cut out all the white parts the image you can do this with scissors or if you want better results you could do this with a paper cutter don't worry if you don't cut it perfectly because the white areas are barely seen my friend the image is now ready to be printed on the shirt all right guys the next step we're gonna take a blank shirt we're gonna preheat it to get the moisture out we're gonna put the part of the t-shirt which will print on onto the heat plate wait for the silicone paper and press it for about 10 seconds you guys see steam coming out that's fine don't worry and now we'll do the same thing for some bottom the next step is gonna take the image I'm gonna align it on the t-shirt Airport and then we're gonna use paper tape or you guys can use special heat transfer tape to take the image on shirt and now we're gonna transfer an image onto the t-shirt and now I'm going to press it at 300 let's say 50 degrees for around 15 seconds so right now is a very important part if you guys peel while the shirt is hot you're gonna get a matte finish if you guys have the shirt cool off and peel when it's cold the finish will be glossy for this shirt we're peeling it hot to have a matte finish make sure you take the tape off very carefully and as you guys can see we have a professional finished t-shirt if you guys look on the bottom right there's a very small white scratch this happened because the paper was scratched before printing so always make sure to inspect the paper prior to printing otherwise the prints come out perfectly every single time it's almost impossible to mess with the printer we're almost finished we just have to do one more thing and that's to stretch out the shirt and repress it one more time for about 10 seconds to make sure the shirt lasts a long time now we're gonna stretch a shirt out to make sure it lasts a long time when I press one more time put the silicone paper on and do a very quick five-second press the show zone alright guys now we're gonna do a black t-shirt it's nice on paper for this example we're gonna put the small image on the a4 paper so when you're printing on black t-shirts the image does not need to be mirrored we're gonna use our cutter to cut out all the white areas and that we're ready to eat president image so now I'm gonna press the black shirt quick ten-second press so the next step is to carefully peel the top layer [Music] and now we're going to carefully line the image onto the t-shirt now I'm gonna put it into the heat press and press the image press it for around ten seconds at 320 degrees Fahrenheit now with no move the silicone paper do a quick stretch and our shirt is done alright guys the next step is to make our shirt labels the best way to do this is by making plaster salt heat transfer labels you can get these for around 10 cents if you order in large quantities just make sure the image is mirrored before sending it to the seller we're gonna go into google and type in shirt label template right here you'll get a template for the labels you guys can Photoshop your own if you want we will download one of the sample labels and heat transfer it to the shirt I strongly recommend you guys get the classes on cue transfers if you want flawless results every time but if you guys want to do it yourself and get a special Oki laser printer and special heat transfer paper and try it out there is a learning curve to this and the results are not going to be as good as the plastisol labels let's carefully tear away the gilding tag alright guys so we're gonna place our label onto the shirt place the silicone paper over it and heat presses and now let me slowly peel the label when the shirt is finished you will package it in a plastic bag which will cost you around five to ten cents you will then take photos of the t-shirt let's talk about two very important parts of this business the first one is reinvesting money back into the business so for example if you start with $100 you can make 50 t-shirts and $2.00 each shirt if you sell those 50 t-shirts at $10 you will have $500 if you take the $500 you can make 250 t-shirts if you sell the 250 t-shirts at $10 you will have 2,500 and so on the second thing is you guys have to make t-shirts which don't have trademarks and copyrights this is very important if you want to have a long stable business get creative and make really cool t-shirts I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did please leave a like to subscribe and if you have any questions please ask in the comments below I'll see you guys in the next one", "zwQbjZrJcLo": "[Music] setting everybody boy big brando and today let's talk about one of the mistakes i made when i was trying to pick out blank t-shirts now let me start this video off by saying if you've watched my videos about blank t-shirts or if you watch any of my videos or ask any questions in my live streams and you ask what's the best blank t-shirt to use i always say it's a personal preference when it comes to the best now the reason i say this is because i learned this the hard way now about 10 12 years ago something like that i was launching a brand that brand i wanted to offer the best quality t-shirt money could buy i wanted my brand to be top quality i wanted everybody to be like hey check it out man this is top-notch highest quality you're gonna find that's why you gotta shop with me the issue i had was my idea of quality wasn't what everybody else thought was quality i just thought a soft feeling t-shirt was top quality at some high quality if the cotton is that soft you know what i mean i was thinking all right this t-shirt right here super soft this is high quality four dollars a blank this is the real deal this is what i'm getting so i order in bulk you know what i mean i'm ordering i think 18 dozen t-shirts or something like that for this first run like let's get this going have these really soft hand feeling t-shirts ready to go i'm screen printing all these t-shirts these aren't transfers this ain't nothing else this is regular screen print now that i think about it this is probably like 15 16 years ago because we're in 2021 right now it's about maybe 15 16 years ago so i get these t-shirts in i'm screen printing i'm getting them going man everything is going good i feel good i feel confident in my printing i feel confident in the t-shirts i feel very confident in the designs i got on here and i'm ready to go but this is where i messed up the people i was selling to they don't give a about that soft feeling t-shirt they wanted a thick heavy feeling t-shirt the designs i had were home runs to this audience the t-shirts i were printing on wasn't even a strikeout we weren't even playing the same sport at that time you know what i mean the t-shirts were so far off from what the customer actually wanted so i sold a decent amount of t-shirts on that first run right i sold a good amount of t-shirts and i'm feeling good and then i noticed nobody else is buying all the sales stopped nobody's buying and i can't figure out why i have high quality t-shirt i have really good prints and i have damn good designs on these things what's the hold up and the holdup was me thinking that this soft t-shirt was high quality and i'm advertising it as high quality but the people that were buying the shirts didn't think that was high quality because we had two different ideas of what quality was to me at that time quality was soft hand feel cotton to my consumer quality was a heavy weight t-shirt that was cut a little longer and a little more baggier so now i was stuck with i think like 10 to 11 dozen t-shirts of these super high quality soft cotton t-shirts that i could not sell because i was selling to the wrong people the people i was selling to had a different idea of what quality was and i didn't understand that at the time because i'm thinking this is high quality man the t-shirt you want those things are crap because that's only a two dollar blank these are like four or four fifty a blank this is high quality cotton the other stuff you want is just some cheap swap meet style cotton but to the consumer those swap meet style t-shirts was high quality because that's what they wanted heavyweight t-shirt boxier cut a little more baggier longer sleeves i didn't pay attention to all that because this shirt was a little bit more fitted it was shorter but it was soft as and i just thought soft as meant the highest quality money can buy so i lost on all of those t-shirts i lost this is where things get up so now on my next run what i do is now i'm buying the heavyweight t-shirts that those customers wanted but i'm selling to a totally different group so now my thing is all right high quality means heavyweight t-shirts this is what everybody wants this is what everybody needs but now i'm selling a t-shirt that's geared towards like the people that are into wearing like ed hardy and stuff like that this is how far along this is is the people that were used to wearing those types of t-shirts were into the softer thinner feeling t-shirts but i was offering these heavyweight t-shirts because my research that i did was saying soft isn't in baggy heavier feeling cotton is what's in and that's high quality so now i'm buying these heavier t-shirts selling them to the wrong crowd because now i have these really cool designs that are on these heavier t-shirts and i'm promoting them telling them it's high quality they buy it and they're like this t-shirt sucks it feels like a swap meet t-shirt i don't want this t-shirt and then when i look at what they're used to wearing it's more of a softer fitted cut it's a little bit more thinner it's a little bit lightweight and not necessarily these big heavy t-shirts so once again i lose out and i lose out big because i'm offering the wrong t-shirt to the wrong customer so when people hit me up and say what's the best t-shirt to buy it's personal preference because everybody has a different idea of what the best is what quality is everybody has a different opinion on it so some people out here in la might think pro club is high quality that's something that they're used to wearing that's something that they like but if i tried to offer this heavyweight pro club t-shirt to let's say i'm running a fitness brand and now i want to offer pro club t-shirts to people that are into fitness and wearing these shirts to the gym hell no they want shirts that are tight hugging the sleeves they want lightweight soft feeling t-shirts those are two totally separate t-shirts but both high quality in their own respected space see what i mean so there's no one blank that's the best above all that's made for everybody everybody has a different preference on what t-shirts they like so when people hit me up and say hey man what's the best shirt to buy what's the best blank t-shirts to use and i tell them it's all personal preference they get mad because i'm not giving them an actual brand to buy their shirts from because if i think pro club heavyweight t-shirts is quality and that's the best t-shirt to use and then you buy pro club heavyweight t-shirts because you're going off my recommendation but your audience is into fitted t-shirts or they're into lightweight t-shirts or ring-spun cotton t-shirts you didn't say all that and i recommended pro club to you because you asked me what i think the best quality shirt is who is in the wrong me because i gave you my recommendation or you because you went off on my recommendation and didn't understand what type of t-shirt you were buying so you would waste a shitload of money going off of my recommendation instead of going based off of what your customers want and need because my idea of quality is really really not going to be your idea of quality i base my idea of buying t-shirts off of convenience how fast can i get these t-shirts where can i easily get these t-shirts because think about this say if you wanted to offer bella canvas t-shirts right a certain model number from bella canvas is your idea of the best quality t-shirt so you order these you're using these for your brand you're going everything is moving let's say it is friday night and you're pressing up some orders and you up two of those shirts you're all out of that color you're all out of that size where can you go on saturday to buy that same exact t-shirt if that same exact t-shirt isn't offered around to you locally then you're in a bind because now you have to place an order wait till monday or tuesday to get that order so for myself i buy based off of convenience i use all style and pro club because all style and pro club are easy for me to get my hands on around los angeles i could go to my liquor store i could go to the swap meet i could go to the t-shirt warehouse i could go straight to the distro warehouse for pro club or all style and pick stuff up on my own i personally can buy these t-shirts one by one or in bulk anywhere around me that's why i use these certain brands is it because they're the best is it because of it's the best highest quality no all it is is my idea of convenience is a big part of how i buy t-shirts because i'm thinking of if i these shirts up i need somewhere to go to buy these t-shirts and re-up so i can still get that order out on time because i don't want to have to be like oh you know what i'm running behind i'm waiting for these t-shirts to come in so now the customer has to wait on me now if i mess up a t-shirt the customer does not have to know that i messed up on a t-shirt so if i mess up on a friday night i know saturday morning i could go to my indoor swap meet i could go to the t-shirt warehouse i could go to the liquor store on the corner and buy another pro club or another all-style t-shirt bang it out i'll pay retail for it but i'll still bang it out to get that order out so that's why when people ask me what's the best t-shirt to use i usually say it's personal preference and then when they want to know what brands i use and i say pro club and all style i always tell people order some samples first see if you like the shirt before you even place that order because these t-shirts work for me and my customers i got a customer base that only loves pro club i also have a customer base that only likes all style if i tried to switch the two i would lose customers on both ends because the all-style customers hate pro club pro club customers hate all style so i have to know who i'm selling to and what i'm offering this is exactly what you need to do for your brands and your businesses is knowing what the customer is used to knowing what the customer is used to wearing knowing what the customer likes and doesn't like so that way you don't buy the that they don't like and you can make money because the goal is to waste less money to make more money do not waste a ton of money buying blank t-shirts thinking that's what your customers need or that's what you like or that's what you want to offer then your customers like man these t-shirts suck now you're stuck with a bunch of t-shirts that you can't sell don't do that this video helped you out make sure you leave it in my comments if you got any questions make sure you leave them in the comments because i get a lot of dms and emails all the time and it's hard for me to filter through all those things so it's easier to get a response from me in my comments or you could go on instagram big brando tv and leave it in the comments on any of those videos you'll get a better response that way alright catch you guys on next one man yep [Music]", "AXCh6rW2LbY": "in this short video we will show you our transfer paper for t-shirts it comes in a very simple plastic sleeve and some everything you need is inside transfer paper is used with an ordinary inkjet printer using ordinary inks everything you need is in the pack despite the fact that it's we refer to it as a budget transfer paper this is a very high quality product the reason it's referred to as budget is that we strip away all the packaging from it and any fancy paraphernalia all you get the whole price most of the price that you pay is for the paper itself inside the pack you have the paper that looks like this the red grid obviously tells you where not to print this is the printing surface once you have an image and it can be anything can be photographs can be graphics can be logos it can be anything your imagination or your requirement dictates once you have the paper and an ordinary injured printer with ordinary inks you need to print an image on it on this occasion we've got a silly little silly little dinosaur but anything any image that you can imagine will work once you have your image printed and you notice that we've printed it in mirror mode the reason for it will become apparent but you must be able to print your image in Reverse it doesn't much matter if it's just the graphic but if you've got text in it it's essential that you print it in the mirror once you have the paper ready and printed we can move this printer away to one side what you will need is a suitable ironing surface suitable ironing surface means something that will not be damaged when you apply heat to it so I'm going to put just a cutting board a piece of wood anything anything strong and solid you notice that I'm not doing it on a an ironing board you should not should not do the transfer on an ironing board because you won't be able to apply the correct pressure onto it so once you have your paper ready and your ironing surface what I'm going to do is just put a t-shirt on top just to just to cushion the surface a little bit just to protect it a little bit more and give it a bit of a gift and the t-shirt itself this is the t-shirt where you're going to actually print on I'm going to give it a bit of an iron this is you just smooth out any creases I'll take this opportunity to talk about the iron I'm using a very high-quality iron here but it has to be it has to be an iron that is over about 1200 watts although this is a steam iron will switch to steam off so we're not going to use the steam on it at all and it's set to maximum temperature once everything is ready um and again you can do this at any time you can do this a day before there's no done up to particularly that's sometimes sensitive what we're doing now I'm going to cut out any of the white areas which are not part of the image I'm going to do it quite roughly you can be as careful as you want but it's best to leave as little as possible about three or four millimeters around the image the film will not really be visible but it will the more you leave the more it will be apparent so you can see I'm doing it really quickly showing it to you in real time just to show you how easy this is and how little expertise is required to from nothing to create quite a funny t-shirt personalize something special something specific to an event or a logo or pretty much anything you imagination dictates so remember we had with printless in mirror mode there's the mirror debit text and we're not placing it we're going to place it face down onto the shirt so the orange or the red the squares are visible we pre eye onto the shirt we've preheated our iron this has been heating up for about five minutes at maximum temperature this is a 1400 watt iron we've turned off the steam and now all we have to do is apply the heat and putting quite a lot of pressure on this iron pressure is important as well as the time we take to I run an image like this we're looking at about 30 seconds if you're doing a full a 4 image it takes about a minute but it is a minute on each part of the of the image so you notice I'm making sure that I cover every single part of the image with heat I'm leaning on the iron pressure is very important a lot of mistakes are made by just ironing it with a couple of fingers you will actually transfer the image but it won't be durable unless you you use some elbow grease some weight over it don't need to break the iron but a firm firm pressure on a flat firm surface is essential if you're doing it on a on an ironing board it will not work because the ironing board has got some gaps in it normally has a mesh underneath and you can't really put pressure on it it will it will give a bit so this is about ready about 30 seconds and we will now let it cool down so will that cool this down to room temperature probably about five minutes you can't speed it up by putting it on on a piece of metal but it has to be at room temperature give it a little bit of stretch and peel away if you make a mistake like this not a problem if you have a tear in it if it is midway through peeling just pick pick off the corner and carry on this can be done at any times no not critical if you can't wait too long with this you can do the day later so once we peeled off no ink has been left on - on our transfer paper the hole of the ink and the film has transferred on to the t-shirt and now just to give it a little bit more longevity and washability we need to fix the image and the image is fixed with a silicone paper once you transfer the image we need to finish it there's another little quick stage that we have to carry out to give it a little bit more strength and longevity in the washing machine and this is done with a reusable silicon paper which is supplied in the pack so the pack contains everything you need this is a like a parchment a bit like a grease proof paper so it has a silicon coating to prevent anything sticking to it we put it back on the exposed image back with the same iron we haven't switched it off we're giving it about 20 seconds of heat again again the instructions are very very clear with the tongues and the sizes pressure is again important give it a bit of elbow grease to push the image even further into the t-shirt and you peel it hopped again don't panic about it it's sitting on paper you see not no image no ink has gone on top this silicon sheets is reusable you can see that no ink has come on to it with the after weary iron so you can use that again and again for the amount of transfer paper that you've got in the pack and the transfer paper they transfer itself the image is ready on the shirt and is now finished this can be washed in a washing machine at 40 degrees with a full spin cycle don't do it as a delicate wash don't leave it to soak in the first wash and anytime behind anytime after use it just like it wash it like any other t-shirt and all you hit all you need is in the back to silicon paper to finish and a backup transfer paper", "WnJB0aLjhjw": "hi guys it's Krystal welcome back to my channel today I'm going to show you guys some awesome t-shirts and while I'm showing you the t-shirts I'm going to show you an awesome sublimation trick when it comes to your Sawgrass SG 400 so let's go ahead and get started now I've already pointed out my designs here if you want to see me kind of printing these out I'll have a video linked down below for that we'll get more into that in other videos just brand right here lucky bird clothing reached out to me and wanted to send me some shirts over for samples and I said sure so they had me go on pick a few and these are the ones that I picked out to test out they're the ones that I kind of play with the most on the channel and these are all gonna be you can use them for sublimation you can use them with your heat transfer use them for screen printing iron-on all of those needs so today we're going to use them for sublimation these are 65 35 so 65 poly which is a perfect amount when it comes to sublimation so the biggest question I get here on my channel is where do I get my t-shirts so this may possibly be my newest place and it's not that they sent them to me but so far these are way better than any shirt that I've ever purchased before they're super buttery soft and they're pretty much the same price that I was already paying before so I'm really excited about that so I got our long sleeve Raglan for us to do I got a short sleeve Raglan and then I got like a little tank top here I would recommend this runs a little bit bigger and this is a medium and it seems more like a large so I definitely would go down a size on that everything else seems pretty true to size and then this is like a basic tee so buttery soft the softest t-shirt I've ever had in my life so you guys will see these individually here in a minute but just know the filling of this you have to buy one for a sample and you're gonna foam up so these are perfect to design your own shirts whether they're for yourself or sell in your business because the price is great so let's go ahead and brought in today I'm going to be using my Cricut easy press so I'm going to be using my 14 by 14 mint and I'm going to be using my 12 by 10 easy press I love this one when it comes to sublimation because it's pretty much going to cover the entire design all at one time because the Sawgrass SG 400 prints eight and a half by women so it's just perfect for that all right so first things first I just want to light down the shirt I'm gonna speed this up so this is just really testing it out to see how well they'll go on the shirt and see what they're gonna look like so let's get down the raglan all right now since we're doing four t-shirts today I'm not gonna worry about making sure I have the exact placement once you've been doing these two shirts for a while you're gonna be used to knowing exactly where they are you really don't need a ruler I mostly do that for you guys so you guys can kind of learn from that but today just make it quick I'm not gonna use the ruler on any of these so to find your Center on these you're going to do just like you would your HTV you can fold it just like so and then you just want to kind of figure out your placement so that ready to go I highly recommend that you take some heat resistant tape here and take that down so you can find your tape I like to just put one one at the top one at the bottom this is gonna help from shifting I'm gonna pop a piece of white card stock underneath there just to protect my maps all right you're gonna cover that with your picture paper pick up your machine I already have it on 400 for 45 seconds make sure you cover the whole thing hit go I like to kind of hold mine down just a little bit just make sure you stay still so you don't get any ghosting [Music] so there it is super cute look how cute that came out so this Raglan worked out really really great I'm gonna bring that up so you guys can see a little bit but the colors super cute I love it so that size worked out really really good so like I said just try to get that stretched out to that eight-and-a-half by eleven about a lot of you guys probably already know that this is more just testing out the shirts so that came out really good now if you don't know what sublimation this will not wash out you can wash this over and over and over again and none of this stuff is going to budge like you would with HDTV where it may start to peel or something over time this stuff is gonna stay the lifetime of the t-shirt so let's go ahead on to the next it's the same thing I'm gonna have my cardstock down I just protect my mat there and get this up here like so this is the short sleeve Raglan these are so soft guys you're gonna have to test some of these out on your own love it I was truly impressed about that I'm not gonna lie alright so there's that alright for this one we are doing the Dr Pepper look at how cute these are once again all of these files are over on Etsy I love to share people's files for you guys to go purchase from them right now we all need help and it's really nice for you guys to go over there and help support your creators by purchasing this file over from them on Etsy I don't know them at all but I just love helping out small businesses for example this t-shirt company definitely go check them out alright so here we go so the same thing for this one all I'm going to do is fold it in half that's how I'm going to find my placement once again I don't really need a ruler I'm just gonna figure it out just like so and get that leg down like that and hit go [Music] right so now when should I feel better and ready to go cute I love it how adorable is this and the red matches the red sleeves I just thought it would be a super super cute piece now one thing I was gonna point out you could take some bling so like auntie Tay right now is selling bling you could take some of her bling and you could glue those on the little sparkly spots here and that would be super duper cute also you could cut out a piece of glitter HTV and add it to that so there's so many more things you could do to these things so that came out really cute I love it I'll bring it up again so you guys can really see up close so these shirts are definitely working out so cute I'm telling you guys this one's gotta be my favorite out of all of them I know the church is going to be so comfy it is amazing you could definitely waist you could definitely up sell these quite a bit because these shirts that's the thing about them is trying to find a super cheap shirt that you can afford but the quality is going to be able to upscale quite a bit so this is definitely gonna be it for you guys so let's go ahead and add this one for this one here this is kind of like a super light grey green cousin green in it it's really pretty and then we're gonna do this when I hear this Starbucks so this one is peace love Starbucks once again just gonna fold it in half to find my Center and then I'm just going to kind of eyeball where this is going to go and take our butcher paper get that down second get that down and hit go alright so we're gonna move it over the big reveal we're gonna go honest I'm pretty sick yeah how cute I love it that color on this right here like I said this is like a gray green um if that makes sense I think the color is definitely coming through so that what the Browns really came out good super cute I love it alright so there's that one so for the last one I wanted to show you guys how to make the image bigger I'm going to show you guys that over in creative studio are really fast so now that we're over here in creative studio to show you how to make a bigger than 8.5 by 11 with your Sawgrass g400 so here is the file that we're gonna be using today I'm gonna bring it in really fast so here it is what I'm gonna do is I rotate that like so alright so now I'm gonna do is I'm gonna expand it as big as I can bring it up just a little bit more so you're just making sure so you notice if I come forward I've got some ray going on here I want to come down till it's back in that black area and safe alright so there is my design but you notice it's too big so I'm gonna come over all the way to one side and I would go at this point I would hit print and then when I come back I'm gonna bring it over to this side line it up just make sure that none of this is gray so you'll have a few pieces here but that's what we're gonna trim away here in just a second so you just don't want it to be great you want to make sure that this is in the block these pieces you want to get out as much as you can and that's it you're gonna hit print and then you're gonna have both pieces it's definitely bigger it could be because it's men's maybe I wasn't paying attention but this will be cute if you um so for example our medium this may be something you want to throw over a bathing suit something like that alright so what I have for this one is we have we have lake life obviously so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna trim this down with my paper trimmer and then I'm going to tape them together and then we're gonna press them sort of take two presses and you can also press one and then come back and add the second one that is another option since they are two separate pieces but if you're gonna make ones like this you definitely want to do it with pieces where they're able to be a wear that you can definitely separate them to make a bigger file technically turns your su 400 into an SG 800 if that makes sense alright so let's go ahead and get started so first things first is I'm going to trim off the excess here same thing with this one here so I'm just trying to make sure I don't cut off and the extra I just want to cut off the pieces we're not using because you don't want to accidentally press this stuff on your shirt is take your two pieces make sure they're going to line up okay if you have them like this you may want to have that little bit of gap however you want to so for example with mine I want a gap if you didn't and they're gonna go together like this all you have to do is flip them over line them up everything should be lined up you're gonna take heat resistant tape and you're gonna get that down and then you're just gonna press press so that's how we gonna do it but for me I'm gonna do this in two separate presses it's gonna bring my shirt down just a smidge and actually going to trim a little bit off the top just to make sure I can tell where this is going to go I always like to trim off the excess so I can see where my top is anything I'm going to fold this in him why not say making sure I'm up here get down our put your paper I'm gonna get by easy press down 400 for 45 seconds all right can I go ahead and move this out of our way and remove our peach one just like so look how cute that came through on the color I love it all right so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna very carefully skew this up this one's probably the one I'm most excited about so I've just scooted it up now you can see here hopeful gonna bring that up a little bit this is why you want to trim off any excess if any other piece came through because this is what happened it's real light you can't really tell with this t-shirt so it's not that big of a deal all right and this is not what I'm selling so it's not a big deal like I said all right so now what I'm gonna do is just line up the life underneath here wherever I'm wanting it to be make sure my gaps good I'm gonna get to take down I tried to avoid going on top of the already sublimated in case my iron goes on there because if not sometimes that leaves cyclone work so I'll just kind of leave it in the blank spot like so I'm actually gonna spew that back up just a little bit our butcher paper and we're gonna go back on top 400 for 45 seconds and hit go all right so I'm gonna lift at it how cute look how big that design is that's quite big let me go ahead and measure that for you really quick so that design is about 10 inches by almost 10 so about 10 by 10 that you made with your straw grass s you 402 per cute design and I'll show you guys a picture I'll have a um a really cute thumbnail obviously you guys have probably already seen but the kids wearing these that is a really big design I love the t-shirts so my review on the lucky bird clothing they're very nice shirts um definitely go check them out the link is gonna be down below they're very affordable and if you guys are selling these this is definitely the brand that you're gonna want to put your stuff on that way it's not just a Gildan or

you on the next one", "cqpln6tN_uk": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel I hope you're doing really well today so I'm back today with a different kind of video it's gonna be a little bit of a DIY today I'm good if you go to another adventure trying to dye this t-shirt with coffee yeah you heard me right I'm going to try a natural dye and see if actually works and then see how it holds up I'm really excited to do this it's something that I want to do for a while if you watched my last video which was my fall capture wardrobe you'll know that I express the desire to want to dye this t-shirt a different color because it really stands out too much in my wardrobe it's a super bright white which is good for most people but I really like those muted downtown's and warmer colors and so I'd love to dye this more of a greenish color to more of a brown color I'm not sure yet how dark it's gonna be or how dark I want it but I know I don't want this color anymore so I'm really excited for this so let's see here goes so I'd like to start this video by saying I've got absolutely no idea what I'm doing but I have my t-shirt here it's 100% cotton or maybe it's 95% cotton I'm gonna let me see so this one's by organic basics so 95% cotton 5% elastin and I think their last stands hopefully in the stitching because apparently plastic doesn't take two natural dye in as well as natural fibers like cotton so we'll see how this goes for this I've got my t-shirt a plunger I've just washed and some coffee this is just Robert Harris coffee but just plunge a grind and then I've just got a big pot I think the first thing I'm gonna do that I've watched someone else to on YouTube is completely soaked this with water so that the whole thing's wet and then I'll just make a coffee and put it in here so simple [Music] [Music] [Music] so is to brew for 10 minutes I'm gonna see how this goes I'm slightly pretentious [Music] I've got a little bit steamier that's the most horrifying part done now I'm just gonna set a timer for 10 minutes on my phone so that I'm patient and actually wait and see what the results are and they were trying to submerge the t-shirt in the water with a few spoons and things just to keep it down because I'm scared that if I don't the bits that are out of the water gonna be lighter and I really want an even color who is this so much fun DIY is a-okay so I pushed it um push you don't they don't it's supposed to float and ya pushed it down with with this joke so hopefully it keeps it under the water and dies a little bit more evenly okay so it's been ten minutes and this is the color that we've got so far pretty happy with it to be honest but I think I'm gonna leave it another 15 and just see what happens if it gets any darker but I'm really happy with that so far already so it's been half an hour an hour and I think I'm gonna get this out of the pot and I'm gonna rinse it and then see what it looks like and decide what I want to do and might potentially leave this overnight and check in with you guys tomorrow and such an impatient person sometimes and I just want it to be done and just look the colour I want it to look but I appreciate that I need to let it soak for the colors to actually come out so let's soak it and see what color it is and whether I'm actually happy with it [Music] [Applause] [Music] so this is the color we've currently got which is just like a dirty white it's not quite I was going for so I think what I'm going to do is just literally put this in the pot and just check back in with you whenever I decide to take it back out I think I'll just check on it like every hour tonight and then if not I'll leave it overnight and then check on it first thing in the morning and I'll let you guys know what I think but yeah right now there's just kind of looks very old and like it's not been washed it will sit pop it back in the party so this is going to instantly way doctor visited yesterday so top tip is don't be scared of how much coffee to put in depending on how dark you want it to go I don't know I'm pretty happy with this color it's a lot more of the nude tan color that I was after [Music] [Music] so this is after it's just been in the washing machine and this is a white t-shirt so that you can compare the color and I think I'm pretty happy with that to be honest I'm going to leave this to dry and then we'll have a see what the color looks like when it's dried [Music] so there we go I successfully dyed my t-shirt with coffee here's the proof that it can be done and that it doesn't look blotchy or uneven I was really surprised to begin with when I first put the t-shirt into the coffee that it didn't go way darker so yeah it was a little bit apprehension at first but and you didn't have been and the more confident you put in there and the stronger it is the darker it will go but it doesn't take straightaway so it takes a long time for that color to develop so don't be too worried if you do try and try this at home but I would recommend to try it on some little pieces of material first just so that you know what color you're gonna wind up with otherwise it's a completely gas like what my little experiment was but it worked out well for me in the end I do think I could get a little bit obsessed with this and I really do want to try dye in some more things in the future so I might just go and get some old rags and you know some t-shirts on the child to store and give it a go I've seen people dying with all sorts of things like tumeric the root cabbage there are so many different dyes and colors that you can make out there so I definitely want to give it a go I really hope this video inspired you to have a little go at doing some DIYs at home and maybe die in some of your own t-shirts or materials that you own even if it's a complete flop it really doesn't matter the thing that matters is that you have fun and that you're trying something new that you've never tried before and the outcome could be a really beautiful wardrobe of naturally dyed clones have you ever tried dying before I would like to know if you you know tried this before with tea bags coffee or if you've died you know with other things - I'd love to know what you've experimented with below so let me know and that's gonna be it for today's video so I really hope that you enjoyed this video subscribe for more content about minimalism and simple living and I will see you guys in the next video have a great day [Music]", "AkGBMYyzxRM": "hi welcome to another educational video about screen printing my cat spit productions today's video was a heat-transfer video and I wanted to just talk a little bit about the heat transfers again you know the first couple videos I did on these these avery transfers that you can get at Walmart you can get them you know staples Walmart Office Depot all those kinds of places that carry this kind of thing this is a package of eight-and-a-half by eleven there's six sheets in here I think I got these for about seven dollars you know six and change seven dollars something like that okay and these are just good to have around and and I don't use I don't do any heat transfers for commercial purposes like for selling shirts I don't do any digital heat transfer so I just use these for prototyping which is what we're going to do today or just when I want to make a shirt for fun you know bootleg shirt of something that you know you don't want to set up to prank because it's not yours you just want one shirt you know that's fine but I don't do he transfers on a commercial level the only heat transfer as I do on a commercial level for my customers are the the vinyl film the thermal films for names and numbers that would be on the back of the shirt you know for like athletics and stuff because it's practical rather than all the labor of screen-printing different names and numbers okay but today I'm doing a prototype deal we have have the artwork up in Corel and here's a test print to see that would film on paper right and we flipped it meaning that we reversed the image in the computer so that we print it out and it's reversed like this okay so you get good light on that you see it's reversed so that when we flip it around and place it on the shirt it will be correct okay so that's that's thing you can see Avery has the backside which is if you can see that has you know markings on it so you know which side the print you print the side that doesn't have any Avery printing on it and I've got the craft paper this time finally right we got I got a piece of craft paper which is kind of like a heavy wax paper that can take Heat and we've got the shirts I just use these I like these I'm in Arizona it's very hot I just use these Hanes undergarments and I like these they're very lightweight and they're great for me out here in the desert where it's hundreds of degrees you know so I just use these you know and we have the winter this is good thing to have you gotta let the shirt make sure there's nothing on there get trapped between the transfer because that's lame and I've got scissors and the other thing I wanted to say about this design that you can actually see is I put the big grey oval behind there and the reason why I did that is because I didn't you know it's not a weeding paper doesn't weed out so it would leave adhesive all in these areas so I put a big grey circle so that I could cut it out I'm going to trim it out in a circle okay so let me trim this out and I'll be right back okay so here I cut it I trimmed it and you can see a circle is nice and easy to do that's why I dropped it behind there as opposed to if you guys remember the love shirt right which was very difficult to cut out an intricate design to cut out this shirts been washed and worn several times many times I don't know several dozen times and we're going to show you the close-up of the two transferred shirts I'll show you this close-up when it's done and that one so you can see them side by side and let's move in for the transfer okay so remember that these are avery inkjet heat transfers for light garments you can print them out on any inkjet printer but they do not work on black t-shirt so these are only for white or very light colored garments and you know use your roller I already lent it mine and got it in position so I got all the stray fabric and lint or anything okay we're gonna put this down right and these are like I said they're a 'very inkjet heat transfers they're designed for use at home with an iron so you can use an iron but the heat if you use a heat press application is going to be way better it's going to last longer it's going to look better and it's just way better with an iron it's going to be difficult okay and it's important also to remember that Avery makes cold peels and hot peels this is a cold peel so we have to let it cool and then peel it you know but I've used other Avery's in the past where you peel it hot so always read the instructions here's the craft paper we're going to put that down we're going to press it for about 30 seconds and then we'll be right back guys it's about a 30 seconds we're gonna lift it off and now we're gonna let it cool okay little vapor from the shirt looks okay it's not scorched we'll let it cool and feel it okay here we are how'd you get the corner going because the cold peels are a little harder to do I don't like the cold peels as much okay because you let it cool down and then you gotta peel it and it's it just peel it's a little harder to peel and I just I prefer a hot peel because it just kind of melts off you know it just pulls off so easily and you do it right away it's a lot faster and I don't know I don't know why this everyone is a cold peel I remember the other ones I believe her hot peels so make sure you look at the instructions and yeah the cold peel is going to be a little bit harder to to get off like you know you got to get it started so it was hard to get started I had to tear it up in a couple places to get it started and then you know and then I'm able to peel it off so it's pretty cool I I just prefer the hot feels so let's show you close-up of the two shirts okay so there you go you have the two shirts side-by-side you can see the love shirt is in pretty good condition they when you do them with a heat press that seems that they work out really good and it lasts a long time okay so that's it this is just was just a prototype shirt okay that I wanted to do just to test out this design alright that's it thanks a lot for watching cats bed productions educational videos about screen correcting I really appreciate you checking out my videos and we'll see you next time thanks for watching you", "9h4Cj26ZZB4": "[Music] [Music] hey everybody welcome to another screen-printing video by cats bit productions thanks a lot for clicking on my video today I really appreciate your time and attention and of course if you like my videos make sure to subscribe to my youtube channel right now alright so try to make this a little shorter than the last one if possible just checking out some more shirts little t-shirt reviews remember that this is very casual it's not supposed to be scientific or anything like that I'm just kind of checking them out letting you know what I think about them casually and that's about it doing a couple test prints just for fun and checking these shirts out so today I have a couple of gilt ins and we have a soft style 64000 I think is the model number and then a guild in 2000 I think is this one and a lot of people know the guild in 5000 so I thought we would look at these two gilded shirts so let's take a quick close up look at the shirt itself and then do a couple test prints alright so this is the Gildan soft style it's like six four zero zero zero 64,000 if that's correct guild and soft style soft style delta t and it looks kind of like a fashion cut you know it's not really boxy and the surface is soft feels pretty soft you know stitching looks pretty good you know if you look at the collar on sleeves and stuff it looks pretty you know centered and well-formed you know I don't see any strings or anything hand you know looks like a decent shirt nicely made feels pretty soft this one probably will fit a little you know tighter than the Gildan 5000 would you know but just checking it out the stitching looks pretty decent and everything looks excuse me looks pretty good and I like the soft feel of this one and that it's not such a boxy cut here's the Gildan 2000 ultra cotton adult t-shirt and this one you know feels a little bit how do you say it's not a soft so you know theoretically it might have a better print surface possibly than the other one we were just looking at again stitching looks pretty good these two specimens that I have here look pretty straight pretty uniform stitching looks pretty good there's a little you know spot of bundled up stitch right there in the collar but that's not too bad up here so that's interesting there's a little wad of fabric or you know thread or whatever okay let's see does this one have a lot not really but there are a couple strings hanging here in those same spots not on this side but this one so that's interesting it's a little piece of thread hanging out over here in the collar on these two you know and then this one has some little wad of thread over here or something I'd have to look at it closer because I'm blind I can't see so but you know looks okay you know so you know but I mean in other words it looks like advice well made sure there may be some I don't know I'd have to see more of them you know to make sure of it you know these are only this is only two out of a lot so who knows but it doesn't look too bad you know the true you know what is it the proof is in the pudding when I try them on and stuff like that you really get a feel for how the garment is made okay so here's the Gildan 2000 ultra cotton adult t-shirt preshrunk 100% cotton Jersey net six ounce t-shirt this one printed pretty well it's not as soft as the other one we're looking at the sixty four thousand or whatever that is they're the soft style so it seems to print pretty well and pretty sharp looks good let's check out the spot color okay so again pretty sharp seems like a decent print surface the knit is good you know for screen printing seems pretty decent you should be able to get some fairly detailed prints all right and then the 64,000 Gildan soft style adult tea again actually you know I was pretty impressed it has a soft you know knit or or feeling to it but it actually printed pretty well I think the this halftone design I like the way printed better than the spa color there could be you know much more of a chance for fibrillation on this shirt alright so you know less ink I don't know it just this one kind of looks better to me I think this this halftone print not sure why exactly not sure why let's see sorry alright so here's the spot color and it printed well I thought it would not print as well as it did honestly like I'm saying but it printed pretty good but yeah maybe you know more of a chance for fibrillation than the than the mm okay so the Gildan soft style 64,000 is a four and a half ounce 100% cotton ring-spun t-shirt its preshrunk knit fabric so yeah so that's probably why it feels a little bit smaller than the mm maybe but we'll take these home and wash them and see what happens yeah okay yeah it's already getting warm here this I had to turn the dryer off already so all right so I've got my specimens here I've got them separated marked just in case you know they're actually pretty different I should be able to tell by the shirts but so yeah I'll bring them home I'll wash them bring them back tomorrow and then we'll try them on and give you the kind of you know what I think about the bottom line of what I think about these shirts and like I said before it's just a casual little look at these to give you any information that I can share just by taking a little look at them and sharing what I see what I can feel you know stuff like that but by no means am I trying to be scientific or find the best shirt to print on or anything like that that's not what I'm doing here I'm just checking out some t-shirts and giving you as much you know casual information about them that I can wash testing and printing on them and just a general kind of feel okay so that's it let's get these done and we'll be back okay so I took both of these shirts here all of these specimens and I took them home washed them inside out you know regular cycle not a gentle cycle or anything and dried them in the dryer tumble dry that sort of thing and so now I'm taking a look at them you see sometimes also you know when you have a t-shirt that's brand new it looks pretty good and then sometimes if you wash it and dry it when it shrinks thinks it can happen as well to the stitching even right so it's interesting to do this and take a look at different shirts just to see but I was actually I was actually impressed with the way the soft style you know the 64,000 soft style adult shirt printed is very soft but it printed quite well and the the mm the killed in two thousand printed pretty well also and you know so now I you know let's take a look at these a little bit close-up of course and then I tried them on and that's really where I kind of get an overall feel for the shirt I'm wondering if the Gildan you know soft style is gonna be really tight as opposed to the mm so let's see if we can take a quick look at the print surface and then we'll try them on this is the guild in 2000 okay and yeah actually I was impressed with the way these washed you know printed and washed I think you know compared to the Hanes you know we did the Hanes review and I just think the print looks better after washing with these gild ins than it did on the Hanes but you know who knows I'm not sure if that's you know did you know what I'm saying it just I don't know for some reason I think I like these better as far as printing and washing them they you know they look pretty good so you know also though I noticed the necks the collar on the mm we'll have to see when we try these on but they look really small so let's see about that this is the Gildan soft style 64,000 6-4 of zero-zero-zero Gildan soft style and again I was actually impressed with the way it printed I thought these would have you know more fibrillation problems and you know you can always have fibrillation if you caused it yourself you know what I'm saying but some shirts are more prone to it than others and even though these were kind of soft feeling it they seem to do quite well with that again the stitching on both of these Gildan specimens the mm and the soft style you know they went on the palate pretty well the stitching looks pretty straight and all that and you know once again the wash you know the way the print looks after the wash I kind of I don't know hey I don't know if it's just weird or if it's just the weird happenstance but I like the way this print looks better washed on these guildenstone I did on the Hanes and you know one of the Hanes was a beefy T which is an expensive shirt and it's supposed to have a nice print surface and stuff and it does and it's a really nice shirt but you know I'm actually impressed with the after wash look of the print on these gild ins so that's interesting oh sorry but okay I just put on the the Gildan soft style you know 64000 or 64000 Gildan soft style of del t and I'm just laughing because it's really tight and this is what I was saying before about sizes you know of shirts each brand and even style within a brand can run differently in the way they're cut so this is a medium you know all the shirts that I'm doing are mediums but this is way too small for me I mean it's I mean it's like yeah if this is if I ordered this as a medium and I'd be like I'd be bummed this is this is way too tight for me okay so that definitely is something you know to be concerned about the collar feels okay it's not it's not choking me or anything but I'm getting choked in the armpits and around the chest very tight and you know that can be uncomfortable sometimes you know for people who aren't into the so let's try out the gilded mm okay so this is the gilt in 2000 and it definitely fits much better it's more of the medium you know the collar the collar is a little bit small as I mentioned earlier I do feel the collar it's interesting the soft style the other shirt the collar felt a lot better this one it's definitely a little bit tighter around my neck but the cut is more generous it's it's more of a medium it's probably right you know since I washed it and it's shrunk so it's probably about right but I have to say that it feels when I first put it on I laughed and I said this feels like sandpaper so it's kind of it has a little bit of a rough feel you might need fabric softener with this shirt you know the soft style Gildan 64000 model was much more comfortable in the feel of the fabric but it was way too tight this one seems okay in the cut the neck is a little tight and it's a little rough or something so interesting things I never actually really you know doing these comparisons like this is interesting for me because I've never done anything like this before so to feel the difference is and and what not myself by trying each shirt on and printing them and touching and working with them is actually more interesting than I thought it would be yeah actually I might suggest this for you as a screen printer the person who sells the shirts you know if you actually were able to try them on and test print them I think it's actually a valuable exercise obviously you couldn't do ever shirt on the market but you could do some of the most popular sellers for your particular print shop yeah so very interesting that's it for today that's all I have I think the these two definitely you know they they pass muster you know they're definitely good shirts professionally made the stitching was good they went on the okay seems to have good print ability good wash ability just the major differences in comfort and feel and the way they fit I think are the most important factors in this little casual review here so I hope you found something valuable in this video I hope it wasn't too long it probably was longer than the first one and I hope the focus was okay because I had to experiment with locking the focus and stuff so hopefully it's okay and you will forgive me for any shortcomings in this video thanks a lot for watching I really appreciate your time and attention make sure to

cotton t-shirts I\ngot these from jiffy shirts I will link them below I'm folding my shirt in half\nfirst marking the center line with an air soluble pen and then using my ruler\nto mark the center line I pre treated the t-shirt with terial magic which is a\ntemporary fabric stabilizer now I'm going to cross the chest I lined up the\nunder sides of the sleeves and did a horizontal line and these are going to\nbe my grid lines for hooping for this shirt I use two layers of sheer cutaway\nstabilizer and I did this because it's a white shirt so I didn't want it to\nsee-through I'm hoping this shirt I also put a layer of water-soluble\ntopper over it since it is a knit I'm using my 5 by 7 inch hoop and now I am\ntaking the t-shirt away lifting it up so that nothing gets caught in the\nembroidery machine so this shirt is actually for friend named Melanie and\nthis is her business logo Melanie loves Tampa Bay I'm also helping her and make\na youtube channel so I'm a link her channel below if you are interested at\nall in real estate homeownership and Tampa Bay life videos we've been making\nsome fun things so I had her logo digitized from a shop I found on Etsy\nand I will also share that as well now one thing I did struggle with was the\nheart in the logo it was rather dense which is why I use two layers of\nstabilizer instead of just one that helped prevent it from curling and it\nkept the design nice and flat as I'm stitching out the design I'm\ngoing through and cutting out my loose threads during the process I just found\nit was a little bit easier so that the threads didn't get caught under\nstitching later on and this whole design probably took about 25 minutes yeah I\nknow now I actually had two different\nversions of the logo digitized it cost about ten bucks each I had one that just\ngoes horizontally and then I have a stacked logo as well so we're actually\ngonna do two shirts in this video for whatever reason these designs stitch\nout better when I loosened the upper thread tension I believe this was on 1.6\nor 1.8 and this is again a hundred percent cotton knit but because i\nstabilized it with the terial magic as well made stitching out this design a\nlot easier highly recommend that stuff I know it's probably tempting because this\nis taking so long to like walk away take a bathroom break I would not do that\nbecause the minute you walk away that's the minute something goes wrong so for\nthese shirts I actually literally stood over the machine just to make sure\nnothing was out of place and everything was going smoothly okay now I'm removing more of the\nconnecting threads with my seam ripper and some tiny scissors then I'm going to\ntear away the water-soluble topper flip the shirt inside out and cut away this\nstabilizer and actually the scraps are big enough that I could probably use\nthem using one of these smaller homes and there's t-shirt number one all right\nonto t-shirt number two use the same process fatir ile magic the two layers\nof the sheer cut away and I actually used painters tape to try to keep the\nshirt out of the way the rest of the shirt and that worked out pretty well all right\nsame thing on hooping this shirt cutting away the excess stabilizer here trimming all those connecting threads\nwith my seam ripper and the little scissors and then pulling away the\nwater-soluble topping stabilizer and there's t-shirt number two hope you\nenjoyed that look at what it takes to embroider t-shirts it was actually a\npretty easy project if you have the right

so excited to share this product with you because it's brand new and it's so amazing so infusible ink these are transfer sheets that you can buy and what's different about infusible ink from iron-on is that it's actually going to infuse into your fabric instead of laying on top of your fabric like you normally have with iron-on this is actually going to adhere itself to the fibers of your your shirt which is really neat and it's 100% permanent which is so neat you don't have to worry about flaking peeling and he tears in your material because this is actually ink that you're going to be putting onto your material for this project you'll need some transfer sheets you'll also need a Cricut ez press you'll need a compatible base this is a polyester shirt when you wet your paper a lint roller and a Cricut machine so let's go ahead and get started to get started you want to use a standard grip mat like this green one so I'm going to place this in front of me and open up my infeasible ink and I want to place my transfer sheet pretty side facing upwards so that the liner is facing downward inside of your package oven fusible ink you'll find a piece of butcher paper as well as your in fusible ink transfer sheets so I'm going to choose this watercolor one and something to keep in mind is that once you put heat on your infuse herbal ink transfer sheets it will be much more vibrant so it starts out as kind of a muted color but once you apply heat to it it becomes really bright and bold so I'm going to apply this to my mat and I'm just using a standard grip mat for this project and now I'm going to pull up design space so I've just selected mirror on I'm going to press Continue and select the correct machine and over here I'm going to select custom on the dial for my Cricut machine so now that I've selected in fusible ink transfer sheet within design space I'm going to insert my mat into my Cricut and now that the machine is done cutting I'm going to eject my mat and I'm going to remove the transfer sheet from my mind I'm just going to flip my mat upside down and then peel the mat away from the infusible link what this does is it prevents any damage from happening to your material if both of my transfer chutes are cut out I'm going to cut around the design I'm just going to set this aside and use it on another project I'm going to grab a pair of tweezers and I just want to remove the pieces that I don't want on this design it can be helpful to roll this back and forth until it lifts up off of the transfer sheet and if you want to keep the excess intact you can actually reuse that part of your transfer [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and now I'm ready to get started on my shirt so I want to preheat my ez press over here make sure that it's preheating what prepare my mat and my shirt one of the things to keep in mind when preparing your shirt is that you want to make sure that there's no fibers that are left behind that shouldn't be on the shirt so I have a little mini lint roller that's from cricket and I'm just going to go back and forth across my shirt to where the transfer is going to be placed and just remove any little fibers that might be there and the reason why you do this is because some of the extra fibers that could be on your shirt that aren't supposed to be there could turn a different color when they're exposed to a high temperature of heat so I just want to make sure that this is nice and clean and others not anything on this shirt that shouldn't be there I'm going to stack my invisible ink on each other that way I don't have to go back and do a second press it's best if you just do one press when you're working with us otherwise the color can fade after repeated pressing so I'm turning it over and just making sure that it looks good from the right side and now I'm going to Center my design on my t-shirt like to fold my design in half just to get a better idea of where the center is actually located at I'm going to press this in place at this point you could use some of the heat resistant tape if you want to make sure that it stays in place this is pretty sticky so I'm just going to adhere it to the fabric I'm going to slide a piece of butcher paper inside of my shirt and what that does is it just keeps the in fusible ink from bleeding through to the other side want to make sure that this design is only on the front of my shirt now I'm going to cover this with a piece of butcher paper my Cricut ez press is all the way warmed up I'm just going to place it on top it's set to 40 seconds I'm going to press my Cricut button and apply from heat now I'm going to slowly release going straight up because I don't want to accidentally move my design I'm going to remove my butcher paper and then I'm gonna let this cool just a little bit now I'm going to use a pair of tweezers to remove my transfer sheet it will be a little bit hot and look how beautiful this design is and you can go ahead and remove your cardstock now here's our final result for care of this shirt make sure to wash it on hold and don't use any fabric softener thanks so much for tuning into this video today I loved getting to share in fusible ink with all of you if you enjoyed this video don't forget to like it and subscribe below because I have tons of video tutorials coming out soon also I want to know what are you planning on making with infusible ink I can't wait to see what you guys make go ahead and comment below letting me know what your first project is going to be and share this video so your friends can hear about - thanks so much for watching we'll see you next week on sweet red pulp [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "wwLNVz4Uj2Q": "every one hurricane liz here back for another video and today i'm not only going to show you a t-shirt that made me over seven thousand dollars in sales but I'm also gonna lay out for you my step by step how to get started our merch guide so that YouTube can get up to $100 a day now keep in mind when I'm laying this out it doesn't mean you're gonna make that hundred dollars a day ASAP anyone that tells you that is full of crap and I'm gonna instead show you how with some work and with some effort over a period of time you will to be able to make eight hundred dollars a day and you're gonna see how this shirt just crushed it for me now these are all based on my experiences and I'm gonna show you some of the key things that you can do to get started that way you can make money in twenty twenty specifically designing your own t-shirt so let's go ahead and jump into my screen share and I'll show you the best way to get started making money with t-shirts so the first thing to understand is I'm gonna be showing you using Amazon merch now there are several other ways that you can actually get started making money with t-shirts there's stuff like facebook there's stuff like Pinterest and there's all sorts of ways that you can make money but I'm specifically going to be talking about merch so what are the advantages of merch well it's pretty simple merch is a platform where you can create t-shirt designs and then they get sold on Amazon which means you get to use all of amazon's customers which have their credit cards on file and in exchange amazon will pay you a royalty fee for selling your actual t-shirt on amazon so how much do you get paid well it really depends on the price of your t-shirt so keep that in mind a lot of people prefer to go with a lower price that way they make money just dollars here dollars there but there's a lot of people that put a lot of effort into it so they pick a higher price and really at the end of day it's all up to you and it also depends on what promotional method you're going to try now there's really two big promotional methods the first one is making it a game of numbers what I mean by that is just listing as many t-shirts as possible that's sort of the play that I took now keep in mind I did try the other that witches running ads or doing promotions to the other method that involves a little bit more money and it's pretty much a guessing game so I prefer to do the game of numbers however if you want to learn the promotional method well you are going to need to learn Facebook Ads so that just requires a little bit more time and effort to learn how to actually run ads to your t-shirts but let's go ahead and jump in and look at the very first step that you're going to need to take in order to use the merch platform okay so the very first step is to request an invitation when you do that you're going to have to create your Amazon account you can use an existing one I would prefer to create a new one and then use that specifically just for merch and not anything else once you request the invitation it could take merch anywhere from a couple days to a couple weeks to accept you but once you get accepted then you're all ready to go so that brings us to step two now with step to that is researching selling t-shirts so what we're gonna use is a strategy of taking t-shirts that are already out there that are making money and then trying to make them better or put putting a spin on the design ourselves so let's take a look at this and start looking at a couple different places we can research t-shirts the very first one obviously is going to be amazon.com and what we can just do here is type in t-shirt and see what pops up at the end of it a lot of times it'll tell us what's actually hot like t-shirts for men funny sayings um see what else let's click on that and see what pops up t-shirts for men saying like having something like I don't need Google my wife knows everything might be against some people's Terms of Service I don't know if you can use Google on their free words of wisdom like again this somebody that is actually putting Yoda so that's probably not a good idea he's sorry I'm late I didn't want to come something like that is pretty good to do like it's I've got an actual shirt now I'm even gonna show you guys these shirt that says people not a big fan and that shirt has sold hundreds and hundreds possibly even close to a thousand t-shirts and all it says is people not a big fan so at the end of the day our goal is to go through here and get as many ideas as we can see that are selling and then try and figure out okay can I make this like duct tape can't fix stupid this is a decent one it's kind of like hi with the BS are you want some some t-shirts with a lower B s are like this is a really good one if you met my family you'd understand and it's 17,000 and clothing which means it's probably selling pretty hot so this is a perfect example of one we could copy and maybe change the text and the font I flexed and the sleeves fell off here's another good idea of 120 900 in clothing this can also give you your own ideas let's say for example that you kind of have some funny things that people think are funny that you say this is the perfect chance to say that kind of crap and put it on a t-shirt right this is your chance to prove that you're funny like I found this humorous I don't find that humorous at all but obviously a lot of people do because this thing is 77,000 in clothing looking at my wife I think damn she is a lucky woman that's a perfect example of a good freaking t-shirt so again 136,000 and clothing think about how you could make that better with font or something else and we'll talk a little bit more about designs here in a second now the second way you can find really cool designs is by going to a site called Juanillo comm this is a huge site with all the Shopify guys I'm just gonna sign into here so you guys can take a look and see why I like to use it and what you can just see here is like look at this 1900 saves means that it's pretty freakin popular right now we rhinoceros is just a fat unicorn that's a perfect example of something that you could actually put on Amazon so let's take a look at that a rhinoceros is just a fat unicorn [Music] nobody really has it they have it on a mug but that's about it but this 353,000 in kitchen and dining which is not gonna like really to a freaking house at the end of the year anything but it certainly can sell a couple hundred which a couple hundred added with another couple hundred I can be a good thing so that's just an example of one like there's some of these that have a massive amount of shares Feliz Navidad 3400 I stole her heart so I'm stealing his last I don't know name 4,600 I thought it said last so and I was like that's a that's a damn gold digger right there if I've ever seen one let's see what else leave your worries and your shoes at the door this one hour means I love you in dinosaur not that many saves but you can really just look through here and find ones with a massive amount of saves and then use them for your ideas nerd I prefer the term intellectual badass that doesn't look like it's selling that well but anyways people I want to punch in the face 15900 it's almost like a checklist you could just do a checklist like you can produce something like people I want to punch in the face and then hit lead a little checklist a checkoff box and put my mother-in-law how people might buy that kind of crap so that's already give you guys a freaking example that I know will sell like hotcakes people want to punch in the face my mother-in-law perfect alright so let's go to the third and final way to figure this out that is by using a site by the name of merchants former so I'm gonna log in this is a paid site so you will have to pay a registration fee to actually join this but let me show you why this is super cool it's got a feature in there called merge hunter I'm gonna click in a merge hunter and I'm just gonna straight-up tell merge hunter that I want it to tell me the top 100 best sellers I can even pick more than that I could pick the top 500 and then I can hit search I want to merge by Amazon t-shirts and I want the US market place and I'm just gonna let it come back to me in 36 seconds and tell me what's hot right now and obviously baby Yoda is red hot like who doesn't like whoever doesn't like baby I don't understand who could not like baby Yoda right if you you know like baby odor if you don't think he's cute then there's a problem with you that's it don't watch this video if you know like being Yoda but anyways trump trump is a perfect thing here is an example of one that you can actually do your own design I do what I want it's a freaking cat flipping people off pretty simple to do and to copy that design pew-pew pew-pew pew-pew that's pretty piu e resting pit face there's a lot of a lot of stuff that you can really knock off here a lot of stuff with just words my perfect day and here's a perfect day and there's a reason I keep stressing the words thing and we're gonna learn about that in the next step but already gotten a quite a few ideas that are pretty fairly easy to make and do so let's get into the next step and that step is getting our design mate now I'm gonna show you the absolute most bootstrap method which means it's cheap AF right and then I'm going to show you the higher versions of this method so the first version is go to youtube and google how to how to use photoshop right or even better than that there's another thing called and I can't even spell photo poop I can't even spell it right but there are a ton of tutorials that will show you how to use it so at least you can get good enough to be able to duplicate some of these words right you can do the words ones your stuff so that's the absolute most boostrap method the next thing that you could do if you don't want to do that and you actually want to invest some money instead of some time is go to Fiverr and search t-shirt design and on Fiverr you can find guys that can do your t-shirt for a very little amount of money this one here is starting at 50 which is kind of high like he's the one that's actually figuring out the design I would design a t-shirt and merchandise graphics for 5 bucks these are the guys that I'm talking about look for the five dollar guys and then show them the t-shirt that you want to design and what you want to do different on it and they'll do it so that's a second method where you can use $5 now the third method which is the method that I use is I went to a site by the name of online jobs pH and I hired what's called a virtual assistant I posted a job I hired a virtual assistant there's all sorts of virtual assistants out there they can do things like design t-shirts right so I'm going to put t-shirt and you were to see a bunch of their resumes pop up and now you can read through the resumes you can also see what they want to get paid so I basically posted a job and I offer to pay a t-shirt designer $300 for a full-time job 40 hours a week designing t-shirts not stop that's how I went about it you can see that some of these people have $100 required amount to start designing t-shirts and they can work $10 10 hours a week there's a lot of people that are from a hundred all the way on up to even a thousand dollars you can get some very good people here on the site this is where I've hired all the phenol Filipino v---aids that I have and so you can get a really good deal by hiring somebody here to design your t-shirts and of course like I said before you don't have to start with the 300 like I did you could start very low that was somebody that popped up here for $100 a month for 10 hours a week that's pretty darn good you can get them to design t-shirts for 10 hours a week and again go with the game of numbers you can do yourself the tax version ones and you could have them do the ones that require photos so that's the third way that you can actually get these t-shirts designed because the next and final step is how do you promote your t-shirts now remember I told you there are two ways to do this the first way is just playing the game on numbers meaning the more shirts you can actually post on there the better and I'll show you what I mean I actually stopped selling on merch in 2017 in 2017 I hit as much as $10,000 in a single month selling merch and then I just found out it wasn't for me now the reasons it wasn't for me is because I find that when I managed Filipino workers it just doesn't work out well and they end up not doing a lot of anything and to truth be told I really wasn't good at giving them brand new designs so the last few that I made a significant amount of money on merch was 2017 since then not a single design has been made not a single finger has been lifted but yet I still get paid every single month from Amazon on my multiple merch accounts now take a look at one now this is just one merch account where I did pretty decent on a t-shirt that was made way back when now I'm even gonna reveal to you the t-shirt I'm inside one of my merch accounts and you notice that during 11 1 20 19 to 11:30 2019 I'll refresh it again and again so you guys can see this is legit what freaking happened and you'll see I'm on amazon.com I've never even looked at UK I've never even looked at Dee because again I hardly ever even logged in here and what you're gonna see right here is there's a t-shirt called a turkey face pink bow t-shirt kids Thanksgiving gift I click on that take a look at this and here is the design this shirt crushed it for Thanksgiving 526 purchased and seven thousand seven hundred sixty-four dollars made in revenue and obviously I wasn't selling it for a very high price let's take a look at what it was I don't even remember $14.99 which is really freaking cheap I still made 10 percent which is 732 dollars in cash so this month alone on this account was over $750 and every single month it brings in quite a bit as well as the other ones so every single month I passively and have an income since 2017 since we quit this so for the past two years passive income and sometimes I get a super sweet bonus like that turkey shirt so boom there you have it that's exactly how you can make money with the game of numbers however if you want to do it super bold like we were doing it at one point and we got it to the 10k then you're gonna have to learn how to do extra promotion that promotion can be done through Facebook through Instagram through Pinterest any one of those things and that's beyond the scope of this video if you are interested in me teaching our Facebook method though put a put an actual comment below subscribe to the channel and I will definitely think about it I will show you how we actually do giveaways and rank products through our Facebook funnels if that interests you let me know post a comment and tell me how you like this video other than that merch it's still a fantastic business option if you're willing to put in the work and the effort to make money on merch it can still work for you take a look at me two years later and I'm still collecting a passive check for merch without lifting a single finger I'll see you guys in the next video [Music]", "7S5i1gauywU": "if you're actively using a heat press for home crafting or business purposes you may have worked with heat transfer vinyl often but haven't had the opportunity to press heat transfer paper while the differences are clear between the two in that heat transfer paper can print full multicolored images with a single sheet of paper there are still some technicalities to keep in mind for instance what is the difference between light and dark heat transfer paper is there paper specifically for inkjet or laser printers or how about sublimation I'm a Stephan with the oppressed nation and I'll be covering such questions and more details about heat transfer paper that will give you a better idea of what options will best suit your needs if you're joining us for the first time be sure to subscribe and click the notification bill to be the first to watch tutorials streams and more from heat press nation if you're looking for details about heat transfer vinyl check out our video guide on HTV which you can watch right now by clicking the card above now let's get started heat transfer paper is intended for use on garments or other substrates with cotton cotton blend fabrics or synthetic fabrics as polyester nylon and lycra transfer paper can permanently transfer onto these substrates thanks to the polymer film able to bond the ink and fabrics together it is available in the standard u.s. letter and tabloid sizes of respectively eight and a half by 11 inches and 11 by 17 inches as mentioned earlier using heat transfer paper can bring full-color graphics of multiple layers down to a single sheet making the process of pressing detailed images much easier and efficient than before while some papers can transfer with no visible background or whitespace foremost we recommend to either cut paper transfers by hand or use the contour cutting feature of a vinyl cutter also known as printing cut let's go back to our first question what is the difference between light and dark heat transfer paper more specifically why are there two kinds of heat transfer paper available for printers light heat transfer paper is designed for pressing on white or lightly colored fabrics while dark transfer paper is for pressing onto black or darkly colored fabrics considering that printers do not need white ink for printer like heat transfer paper uses the white or light color of the fabric as a substitute well dark transfer paper prints like normal paper using the white of the paper itself hence why Sommer named opaque due to the way light transfer paper is transferred images must always be mirrored before printing them but this will not be necessary for dark transfer paper prints whether you are transferring on mostly light or dark garments or whether you use an inkjet or laser printer be sure to always have the proper heat transfer paper ready for your garments and press your transfers firmly moving on to the second question there indeed is heat transfer papers specifically made for inkjet and laser printers inkjet transfer paper is best for any inkjet printer at home or work likewise for laser transfer paper with laser printers these papers are specific to their printers as inkjet transfer paper is designed to hold wet ink while laser transfer paper can only hold toner with the inkjet heat transfer paper being as simple as either light or dark paper laser transfer paper is further divided into single or full color and white toner papers single color laser transfer paper is compatible with both light and dark garments while full color paper has separate light and dark offerings similar to inkjet paper white toner laser transfer papers are unique in that they are specifically made for white toner laser printers typically printing transfers in one or multiple colors alongside having the ability to self read the background or blank space of the printed image for both inkjet and laser transfer paper we recommend to use the best available quality settings for printing but keep in mind that over saturating the ink will cause it to bleed upon washing and weight after a day before washing any garment just press with either transfer paper and do not dry clean the garment lastly right after pressing any inkjet and single or full color laser transfer we recommend lightly stretching the transfer on garments to build up its softness and durability so far we've covered what heat transfer paper is available for inkjet and laser printers but did you know that sublimation papers are specifically for sublimation printers such as those from Sawgrass Rico and Epson this is due to the unique ink of sublimation which will print a solid form of an image which can then transfer onto a bright substrate through a gaseous state when you press with this in mind we advise against using any sublimation paper on basic inkjet or laser printers the sublimation papers we offer for sublimation printers are text print are for gel based ink alongside text print xbh are a water-based ink bold papers are compatible with any sublimation printers such as the Sawgrass SG 400 or SG 800 make sure to choose the paper compatible with the ink currently in the printer if you would like to learn more about sublimation visit our sublimation page to watch our guide video and browse our selection of sublimation products all in all if you are frequently pressing detailed images or graphics onto garments or other substrates heat transfer paper can deliver the results with full-color on just a single sheet even being limited to basic inkjet or laser printers still leaves you open with the opportunity to print with inkjet or laser transfer paper just find the paper compatible with your printer and light or dark substrates and remember that white toner laser transfer and sublimation paper will require different printers if you were interested in pressing with heat transfer paper soon we offer sample packs for both inkjet and laser printers with a three sheet variety of around 18 to 21 sheets of paper for both bundles essentially giving you a platter of transfer papers to try printing and pressing but we

all the different ways you can make t-shirts for your t-shirt business let's begin alright guys so we're going to talk about all the different ways you can make t-shirts we will talk about direct garment screen printing how to make t-shirts with a vinyl cutter how to make t-shirts the professional laser printer we will talk about budget ways to make t-shirts and print on demand we will also break down the complete process and talk about the pros and cons of each before we get into all of that let's talk about how to buy blank t-shirts and the different types of shirts you can buy there's going to be many websites where you guys can buy wholesale t-shirt blings in this example we're going to use jiffy shirts.com just so you guys know you don't need any kind of business license anyone can purchase from these sites these sites will sell t-shirts anywhere from one dollar and fifty cents all the way up to around eight dollars if you guys are going to be selling cheap t-shirts on ebay you can go with something like the gildan g500 t-shirt these start at around 1.50 but if you guys are gonna be selling high-end t-shirts for your fashion brand it's better to go with something like a bella canvas or an american apparel shirt these are more expensive also just so you guys know white t-shirts will always be the cheapest if you're getting black or colored t-shirts they will be more expensive if you guys are starting a high-end streetwear company in my opinion one of the best shirts you can buy is the american apparel 2001 shirt now if you guys buy this t-shirt be very careful they have a cheap version of it which is called the 2001w this is a horrible quality t-shirt don't buy it it's nothing like the regular 2001 that's made in the us t-shirts will also come in different styles regular t-shirts and fashion t-shirts regular t-shirts will usually have longer sleeves and the more loose fit whereas fashion t-shirts have a short sleeve and more of a european fit a shirt like the gildan g500 is going to be made out of regular cotton and is going to have more of a cardboard feel to it whereas a t-shirt like a bella canvas or an american apparel is going to be made out of ring-spun cotton which means the shirt is going to be much more higher quality and it's going to be much softer all right guys let's talk about the different ways to make t-shirts just so you guys know no matter which method you choose you will need a heat press machine and i'll leave a link in description the first way to make t-shirts is dtg printing which stands for direct to garment printing this means the blank t-shirt is inserted into the printer and the printer prints directly onto the shirt this is great for one-off prints or if you're making t-shirts with pictures these printers usually cost over ten thousand dollars and one of the best printers is the epson f2100 this is industry standard the good thing about these printers is that you don't have to purchase them outright you can always finance them for around 300 a month just so you guys know websites that make custom t-shirts like printful and teespring they all use dtg printers these printers print extremely high quality and the image will not wash away or fade you can also make black t-shirts without a problem the printers also print in white color so you can make black t-shirts if you're printing a black t-shirt you will print the white ink first and then the printer will print the colors on top each shirt will cost around two dollars to print if you use factory epson inks before you print on the shirt you will also have to spray it with a pre-treating liquid this will make the colors very bright and will also protect the shirt you will then heat press the shirt and the shirt is ready if you guys do buy a dtg printer i really suggest you get a real professional heat press which costs around a thousand dollars so let's talk about the pros and cons of dtg printing the pros are prince professional quality t-shirts very high detail it's very easy to set up and print it's very fast to print you can make black t-shirts with white ink the cost to print is very cheap and you can make one-off t-shirts the cons or if you have bad credit is going to be expensive next let's talk about screen printing screen printing is the oldest way to make t-shirts it's also the most popular way screen printing is the cheapest way to make shirts if you're mass producing one shirt let's talk about how screen printing works screen printing is not for when you're making just one shirt like dtg it's for mass producing one t-shirt first you will need to buy the screen printing machine if you guys don't plan to open up a print shop you don't have to buy a huge one you can buy a small one you can get the machine for a couple hundred dollars you will also need to buy a large format inkjet printer you will need to buy transparent film screens frames a uv light machine and inks the way screen printing works is that you will have to make a screen and frame for each color that's on the t-shirt so if your shirt has four colors you will have to make four screens and frames the first thing you will do is divide the image by color in photoshop and then you will make a screen for each color layer you will buy transparent film and then print each layer separately on your inkjet printer using black color you will also print registration marks on each sheet so that you can align perfectly you will then buy emulsion you will take your screen put a motion on the screen put the film on the uv machine and put the screen on top of it you will expose the screen to uv light for a few minutes the printed parts that did not hit the uv light will then become very fragile and you can easily wash them away with the water hose you will then put the screens onto the screen printing machine and you will use a squeegee and apply ink to every shirt if you guys have a large screen printing machine you can make a lot of t-shirts very fast inks for screen printing are extremely cheap so it's very cheap to make t-shirts the cool thing about screen printing t-shirts is that you guys can also do all kinds of metal colors metal colors such as gold and you can also make fall t-shirts so instead of ink you can use glue and then apply foil and make metallic shirts you guys can also add rhinestones if you want to make rhinestone t-shirts let's talk about the pros and cons of screen printing the pros are you can start a professional t-shirt business with around 1 000 the quality of the t-shirts is going to be great and they will withstand a lot of watches the cost to make a t-shirt is extremely cheap and you can also make all kinds of cool t-shirts like foil the cons are if you plan to make just one t-shirt it won't make sense because the startup time and cost is just not worth it which leads to the next con and that is that it takes a long time to set everything up also screen printing can take up a lot of space and can be a messy process also unlike dtg printing which requires a digital file you have to store your screen somewhere and that takes up space now let's talk about one more thing that can be done with screen printing which is kind of cool and that's plastisol transfer sheets what a plastisol transfer is is basically a screen print that's printed on either a clear film or a white piece of paper and then sent to you and you could heat press it onto your shirt so you don't have to actually do any of the work the only thing that you need is a heat press machine and you're good to go there are a lot of companies that provide this type of service and you guys can get plastic solid transfers for very cheap one color starts around 15 cents the only thing is you guys have to pay a 25 feet to make the screens so if you guys don't want to buy all the equipment this can be a great alternative now the next way to make t-shirts is by using professional laser printers so no guys this cannot be a regular laser printer that you have at home this has to be a special led printer an example is a okie printer which prints white and color these printers can cost up to ten thousand dollars depending on how large they can print and whether or not they print white basically the way it works is that you print the design on the transfer sheet and then heat press it onto the t-shirt you will print the design on one shirt and then heat press it onto a glue side of another sheet and then peel it and press it onto the shirt you guys can also make metallic fall shirts this way simply print on one sheet put the foil over it press and peel the foil the best transfer sheets in my opinion are forever transfer sheets they're the highest quality let's talk about the pros and cons of laser printers all right guys so the pros of laser printing is that it's fast and easy it's not messy and you can also make all kinds of unique designs such as gold metallic foils the cons are obviously it's expensive also the good quality transfer papers are not cheap and to be honest with you guys i prefer the results of dtg printing much more than laser alright let's talk about the next way to make t-shirts and that's with the vinyl cutter alright just so you guys understand with the vinyl cutter you cannot make picture t-shirts the way vinyl cutting works is you insert the sheet into the vinyl cutter and the vinyl cutter will cut out your design you guys can buy different color vinyls and you can also buy unique vinyl such as glitter and metallic you can also buy special vinyl such as 3d vinyl where after you heat press it the vinyl becomes puffy you can also layer different colors together and have a multi-color design you guys can also buy cheap vinyl cutters such as the cricut machine the machine will come with a 3d designing software you will simply make your stencil you will then insert your vinyl and the machine will start cutting it out after that you will need to weed out the parts of the image that you will not be using you will simply take a weeding tool and remove the unnecessary parts you will then heat press the image onto the t-shirt and your shred is ready let's talk about the pros and cons of vinyl cutters the pros are vinyl cutters are cheap and you can make great quality t-shirts easily you can also make unique t-shirts like glow-in-the-dark foil and glitter shirts the cons are you cannot print photos and unless you guys are importing from alibaba in large quantities the photos can be expensive all right guys very quick let's talk about how to get tags for your t-shirts there are going to be many websites such as custom labels for you where you can order woven tags and paper tags free t-shirts these are very cheap if you order in large quantities they can run as little as 10 cents per tag you guys can choose if you want sonar tags or if you want iron on tags when you order your t-shirts off of jiffy shirts you would simply cut the tag off if it has a tag or if it has a tearaway label you just tear away the label and apply the tag we talked about plastisol labels earlier you guys can also order plastisol labels on websites like etsy you guys can get these for as little as 15 cents per label alright guys very quickly i want to talk about a couple of budget ways to make t-shirts first ways you guys can get an inkjet printer and use transfer sheets it's recommended that you guys get a printer that prints a3 which is larger images you guys can get a printer such as the epson wf7710 this is a great option also this printer can be converted to a sublimation printer if you want to go that route you can get a sublimation spray spray it on a blank cotton t-shirt print the sublimation print press and you have a sublimated t-shirt keep in mind this can only be done with white shirts these printers recently went up in price so if you guys don't plan to do sublimation you can get any regular printer that prints a3 for cheap when you guys print on the transfer sheets you will use the original ink now this information ink these are great ways to start a side hustle but if you guys want a real t-shirt business i suggest you save up money and go with either dtg or screen printing let's talk about the next way to make t-shirts and that's print on demand this is one of the best and easiest ways to start a t-shirt business and requires no startup costs but the catches you guys need to be somewhat social media savvy and know how to drive traffic to your store with print on demand you don't have to buy any equipment or blank t-shirts this is all done through a third-party company whenever you get an order they make the t-shirt and send it to the customer make sure the designs you guys upload are in a png file which means it's a transparent let's talk about the pros and cons of print on demand the pros are you guys don't have to buy any equipment or t-shirts and there's no startup cost the cons are if you guys are making these t-shirts yourself it will cost you a lot less also you need to learn how to drive traffic through social media for this to work alright guys let's talk about how to make designs for your t-shirts if you guys know how to design t-shirts yourself that's great but if you guys don't don't worry you can go on websites such as fiverr.com and have your designs made there you can pay anywhere from five to twenty dollars to have a design made when you guys are finished make sure you always get a master adobe illustrator file or a photoshop psd file this way if the files need to be edited you can always do that alright guys i hope this video helped you out if it did please hit the like button and subscribe and if you guys have any

quality combed and ring-spun\ncotton on the market. The result is called Airlume. It starts with clean\ncotton about 25 to 30 percent of the cotton we start with is combed out \nduring our unique refining process. Because it contains impurities or does\nnot meet our standards. It's a common practice for manufacturers to dump some\nof that inferior cotton back in before spinning the yarn. But for us when it's\ncombed out it stays out. We only use long staple cotton in our Airlume process.\nThe staple length refers to the length of the cotton fiber. And this determines\nthe ultimate feel of the final yarn. By using only long staple cotton there are\nless stray fibers which keeps our yarn smoother on the microscopic level. This\nmakes for a tight even knit ideal for screen printing. We continue to innovate\nthrough the dyeing process. Using seven times less water than the industry\naverage and only using the most eco-friendly dyes. There's a right way to\ndo combed in ring-spun and it's through our Airlume process that we're able to\nmake the industry softest cotton. At Bella+Canvas were committed to using 100%\nAirlume combed and ring spun cotton. Be Different.", "Kd1qI1VZ1cE": "[Music] wait whatever it may be those are usually the pieces we end up wearing them.most personally for me the most essential essential it's got to be the t-shirt whether it's for layering color blocking fit with your sneakers or if your pants are the main statement piece you're fit that you need a t-shirt that matches your style I personally like a nice box the oversize fits on my teeth which can be a little hard to find and after a lot of research which just means that I bought from a lot of different brands I think I finally found the perfect one not just for me but for everybody and the best part about it is that it's only $15 and when I just talked about one-stop we're gonna be talking about two different styles from Uniqlo that you need to go get right now now each style is a little different so we're gonna go ahead and compare and talk about the sizing to fit how it looks on body well let me just grab them both and then we can start and here they are now both of these are from the Uniqlo new collection that just dropped this spring this being the air Buddhism oversized tee and this is just a standard T from the Uniqlo u collection but before we start talking about the differences there's one more thing I need to show you and that's this black team this one is also from Uniqlo the reason I'm bringing this one up is because this is you know clothes like most basic basic essential tee it's like five bucks a lot of you may have it and you may be wondering like what the difference from this one to this one is and honestly there's a lot one being that it's just not as good this is like a very thin it's not really made like style to be its own piece personally I wear this to like work out be at home lounge around you know situations where I don't care about what I look like but I'm gonna style a fit these are my go-to now let's talk about what makes these so special first off let's start with fabrics with the basic Uniqlo UT it's 100% cotton meanwhile the arabism oversized tee is 56% con the rest of the polyester blend the basic Uniqlo unity because it's 100% kind it's got thickness it's got some weight to it which makes it feel very high quality it's not as thin or stretchy as the basic $5 T I showed you earlier which means it's much more durable it's gonna last you some time which is what you want in a tea and now the Arabism tea because it's a con polyester blend it's gonna be a little bit more lightweight a little thinner yes a bit stretcher but that does not mean that it lacks quality I would actually compare it to one of my favorite shirts this Acme shirt right here which is a little dirty I gotta get it clean but this retails for 150 and my acne tea is a little thicker but as far as how the texture feels the quality it's very comparable which for $15 is very surprising now because of the difference in fabrics you may be wondering which one's best wishes should I go for it and I say both that's because they serve a bit of a different purpose this is for your casual looks in the springtime when you need a lightweight breathable tee this is it we're in the winter time where you got a layer an oversized tea under a hoodie or a sweatshirt this is it but this this is for when you need a high-quality shirt to complement the rest of your look but that's enough about fabric and aesthetic let's finally talk about sizing and how it fits as far as sizing for this I'm over the medium I'm 6 foot and honestly I could wear small for this I went for a large just to have just to be sure that I would have like an oversized fit I could wear a medium but honestly I like the look of the large one of my favorite details of a nice oversized tee that fits well is the drop shoulder not sure what that is basically on a regular tee that fits well like this the sleeve starts naturally where your shoulder ends this one doesn't have that big of a drop shoulder it's pretty good but on a nice oversized tee it drops past your shoulder and if he gets much lower that's what gives it like the nice box the oversized feel to it and if you want to compare the drop shoulder on these all we have to do is line up the collar and then measure all the way down to where the sleeves actually begin and if we look at this one this one has a much bigger drop shoulder another important detail that we need to take a look at is the length of the sleeve as you can tell here this one also has the longer sleeve but my favorite thing about both of these shirts is the cut both of these have like a very boxy cut and that's exactly what I want in a nice oversize tea usually when I find a shirt that's oversized it's very long it like droops down to like almost my knees and I hate that I don't like that I don't want a shirt that makes me feel like short and small I want something that fits well like the rest of my shirts just has the nice oversized detail and that's what makes these both so perfect if you're wondering which one do I actually like more I don't know what to tell you I like both I love the arabism one so much that I ended up getting two more colors I got one in a white tee cuz you know there's situations where I need a very casual white tee and then I also got this like a blue one but it's got like some hints of green in it I don't know I love the color as far as this one I only have it in white the rest assured I'm gonna be getting a lot more colors I only got this one because I really needed a high-quality white tee I'm so used to having these like thin breathable white tees or you can see my nipple you know poking through and I don't want that I wanted something you know that was a little thicker had some more weight to it and that's exactly what this breaks it's 100% cotton I think I've said that like 10 times but that's what gives it just like much higher quality and feel to it and I know it's something that I need in my wardrobe final verdict go get both like I said these serve different purposes and you need them both in your wardrobe you need essentials different teas for different times for different outfits and I'm so glad I got them and again I think some colors and sizes are selling out links are in the description down below go take advantage it's only $15 you don't want to pass this up your essentials your basics that's the most important parts to your wardrobe in like look these aren't ones that you can pass up usually you find high quality teas like this for thirty forty dollars and then get only 15 and guys

you guys it's Amanda this video I'm going to show you how to make a DIY custom print shirt I'll be doing this using iron on transfer paper in both a light and a dark top and I'll walk you through step-by-step so that way you know the differences between light and dark transfer paper and you can use whatever is best for your project so if you have any questions along the way please leave them in the comment section below I do try to get back to every single one you guys so let's get started so I'm gonna start with my dark top and this is from Bella canvas it's the flowy boxy tee and because I'm using this dark top and my design has the color white in it I need to use dark fabric transfer paper if you use the light one and your design has the color white in it it's gonna come out clear and the vibrancy of the colors may be lost if you don't use the dark fabric transfers so it's important to know that so to get started you're gonna need to choose a graphic I'm gonna open up Adobe Photoshop and I already made my graphic it says blessed it has a distressed worn look to it but I need to add a stroke to this image because it's gonna be printed out on white paper it's all need to outline it so I can see where to cut it out so we're just gonna double-click on the layer and then check the box on the Left panel that says stroke and if you'd like to make the stroke thicker then click on the area next to the box and then I'll give you options to change the size make sure the positions on the outside that way you don't distort your image and now we're ready to print but I do suggest that you print on regular paper first just to make sure you've got the sizing and everything looks the way that you want it to and that way you don't waste any of the transfer sheets now the most important thing to know when you're printing is that you need an inkjet printer it can't be laser Sun has to be inkjet for this to work to get the best image I ended up choosing photo matte paper and I chose the best quality setting that at hand then it's ready to print now one of the big differences with dart transfer paper is that you don't need to reflect the image so it should look just as it appeared on your screen and as you can see by adding this joke now I'm able to see where to cut it up and that is our next step is to cut out the graphic and you can cut it out with just some regular pair of scissors or if you have an exacto knife and a lot of like little areas that you need to get to you can use that as well now you do want to cut this out very meticulously because anything white is going to be transferred as white and now that everything's cut out we're gonna prepare the surface and the shirt you want to use a hard surface that's not sensitive to the heat and protect the surface with a pillowcase or sheet then lay out your shirt and spread it out so that there's no wrinkles if there is wrinkles I'd suggest that you iron it out I did not film this part but I did do that then take your graphic cut out and peel off the back once you've peeled off the back place the cutout on your shirt print side up this is another big difference between light and dark transfer paper is that with dark transfer paper you iron it with the image facing up once you place it where you want it then take one of the tissue papers that comes with the packet and set it on top of the transfer m-z in the water from your iron and make sure that the steam setting is off and for the temperature I set it to the highest setting forgotten now you can start ironing and make sure that you're applying a good amount of pressure I'm just moving the iron up and down side to side as evenly as possible and according to the instructions for a full sheet you want to continue ironing for two minutes half a sheet for one minute and 1/4 of a sheet for 40 seconds so I are mine for about 40 seconds and then you just want to let it cool for two minutes once it's done cooling you can pull off the tissue paper and it's complete alright so that was all about iron on transfer paper for dark fabric now let's move on to the next shirt where I'm gonna use iron-on transfer paper for a light fabric now the setup is the same but we're gonna use light fabric transfers this time and the important thing to know is that anything white is going to be transferred as clear to prepare your graphic there is one main difference with the light transfer paper it's that you need to flip your image so that it's mirrored so go up to image and down to image rotation and then flip canvas horizontal now it's ready to print and I'm just gonna follow the same exact settings that I did in the last example now we're gonna cut it out now as a personal preference I still cut it out carefully because I don't want anything transparent or shiny I just want my design but if you don't cut out off the white it will transfer it as clear so if you're ok with that then you really don't have to worry about cutting it out so meticulously like I am once it's cut out since it is reversed we're gonna flip it over a place it print side down and that's how we're gonna iron it and place it exactly where you want it and we're gonna use the same exact iron setting as the previous example so that's a no seam and the highest cotton paint setting now that ironing time for the light transfer paper is a little bit longer than the dark the instructions suggests that for a full page view iron for 3 minutes half a page 90 seconds and 1/4 of a page 45 seconds iron mine for about 60 seconds just to be safe then I let it cool for 2 minutes and then it's ready to peel the back off so that completes the tutorial for the DIY custom shirt using dark and light transfer paper now really quickly I want to go over how to wash the shirts because I got that question a lot in my previous video and the best way to wash the shirt without damaging the prints is to wash it inside out on a cold cycle so use cold water when using a dryer make sure that you have it on the lowest heat setting possible and if you can hang dry it that's even better but you can tumble dry it I've done it several times and it still holds up thank you guys so much for watching it was pretty simple DIY once you know what you're doing so hopefully you guys liked it and hopefully it helps you on your next project if you guys

"7g27zU0bXnA": "I want to show you how to make a t-shirt facemask this is a design I came up with after looking at a lot of different patterns it has a drawstring as its main feature and ties in the back with like a little Slipknot so it's adjustable and we'll go over your ears and you can bunt it up or unbutton it to get a really good fit on your face I have two sizes this is based on other guidance I found on other face masks and so the finished size of the adult is about five by eight and a half child four by seven and a half what you need is a t-shirt that you're going to cut up and a sewing machine and thread you need a safety pin to help you put this cord into the casings and a chopstick might be helpful when we're turning the corners inside out and also putting into the key scenes if you're if they're clogged with the seam allowance or something to get them open seeking cord through so step one is you want to cut your fabric and so for the t-shirt I tried you really want to cut it with the long way of this fabric going up the t-shirt I tried it the other direction in it and it works fine enough this is the other direction and it kind of made the top a little bit wonky and didn't quite fit as nicely over the front if you have it stretch this way which is the direction the fabric stretching up and down rather than across the face you get a better fit so I recommend cutting it long ways with a t-shirt direction going that way for this is for the adult you want six and a half I mean six wide by eighteen inches long for a child would be five inches by 16 inches long the way that I cut this was I actually just took a little nip where I wanted them to start and end my six inches so I measured six inches out into the clip you can actually just tear hold this down here tear your fabric you can get a nice hair along the grain of the fabric and so it will be nice and even and not skewed one way or another this is also the same method that you need to do in order to make the drawstring later so you get your fabric the right dimensions and then you want to fold it in half with the right sides together and the wrong sides out for t-shirt fabric you can tell that because the wrong side it curls towards the wrong side so this is step 2 so it's folded in half this is the fold side and what you want to do is you want to sew along the edges here but you want to leave 1/2 edge gaps here here and here that become the openings for the casing so on this folded edge I actually started sewing I back stitched about a half inch away from that fold and then a seam allowance is about a quarter of an inch you can make a little bit more if you want like 3/8 all the way up to here and then this by back stitch right here about a half inch away from the seams where the seam is going to start again and I just moved my machine so this is not sewn it's open there jumped it over back stitched here went down this side backstitch tear jumped again another half inch again this is not sewn here it's just the thread where I jumped and then sewed and then you want to leave a couple inches here at the edge to turn this inside out so leave that opening so in step three turn everything inside out and you're going to want to press it so here's that opening that I used to turn I want to press those seam allowances down make those nice and straight press these up and this is where you can use your chopstick to get the nice corners in like that to turn it nicely and then press step four you want to sew again this is to sit on the edges and to make the drawstring cases so I started up here at the top back stitch and I sewed really close to the edge here about an eighth of an inch all the way over here and then I stopped about a half inch from the seam again this is where that opening is at the top and the bottom so a half inch away from the edge to make my casing then came down here real close so at eighth of an inch of the edge again and then that will help close off that opening that we had down here before this helps that edge stitching helps close that off and then I go up a half an inch away and then back stitch here so now I've got casing here and this is sewn down and that openings closed the last step is to make the cord so I showed you how to cut that cord you want a you know a long piece when you stretch this after you cut it it'll get longer so I think mine at least 40 inches now just play around with size to see if will fit you or someone that there but you want it I would say no more than an inch when you cut it or about an inch but you want it to be strong enough so it won't break but not too thick that you can't fit it through the K seams so you're going to want to insert it at the bottom and go at the top and then come out here and again use a safety pin just pin that through it and then go in and go out and then when you're done just not off the end maybe double knot them so they don't come through these are intended for people with like patients the vulnerable populations patients nursing home homeless I'm not intending these to work for healthcare workers I really hope that they get the actual medical grade surgical masks but if there's other vulnerable populations that you know of please make these and donate to them wash them and sanitary before you give it to anybody or make sure that if you're dropping off at a hospital somewhere or place they plan to wash them cotton is really good about that again these are cotton t-shirts just old t-shirts that I use hopefully if you have those around so again make these donate these if you're healthy don't have symptoms you don't need to wear these but there are lots of people out there who are vulnerable and hopefully our health care workers will get what they need but they might need them too so just make these donate these if you have any other questions please let me know or any other ideas of how to make these but I was trying to make something that people have lots of material and we all have t-shirts I've got tons of them so thank you so much if you've any questions please let me know stay safe stay well stay busy and stay positive thank you so much bye-bye", "Tn-RC9xdVM8": "what up guys james here AKA the palm and today i want to go ahead and kick off the clothing and style side of this channel and i want to do so with a series of reviews about kind of like the basics the essentials of everyday like wear and also at just as important i want to go ahead and make these non sponsored videos i want to be able to speak to you frankly honestly and just tell you guys what my favourites are and what I perceive to be the best like products on the clothing market and so today I want to talk about like the basic t-shirt and I will talk about the basic t-shirt because I'm not interested in that like excessive stuff you know I prefer very minimalist approach to clothing and sometimes like a pseudo street wear and so I don't want no t-shirt with like I don't know like a  unhand color on hand like side or super long where you look like you have no torso or like bedazzled back I don't know the like the other people will be talking about what I want is a very simple very minimalist just quality t-shirt and so what I perceive to be the best t-shirt on the market right now is the American Apparel power-washed II based on its like the fabric the fit the price and just how well it fits into my style and so I've tried the full range of clothing I tried like t-shirts from like the 6080 like hundred dollar range down to like the six eight ten dollar range like we have like the APC NORs project and then the more readily available I kind of I would say retail store like rebranded t-shirts like J Crew club like Monaco like stuff like that like I've tried that more range at the same time I've also like worn like the whole gap like pains Gildan anvil and I've seen like the hmm those are like the fast fashion type of things and the American Apparel power-washed tea is what I ended up perceiving to be the best one like it fits most well into what I prefer to have like on my upper body like the t-shirt is like on this loser and the length is like at the crotch or slightly below and like American Apparel stays pretty loyal like the LA's like upbringing like the solid California fit is a very unique thing that I have a hard time finding with many other night t-shirt brands but like this slightly looser fit is what I'm used to is what I prefer is what I'm most comfortable with and so what we have is like a light slightly looser and fit overall we have short sleeves are slightly longer than usual slightly looser a neckline that's also slightly looser and that's also finer and the overall weight is definitely like a medium light and so it really fits well into like like the weather here I mean I don't dress for seasons because in California you don't need to and the thing is like this t-shirt also embodies like most effectively like the minimal list like aesthetics that I prefer like with the North Project t-shirts like they're beautiful they're on the heavier side given that they're like like a company base over in that area and outside of America they also have a different sort of fit definitely longer and slimmer which doesn't really work well with me at the same time a PC another non American brand definitely has a longer fit but has these strange shorts like the sleeves are also loose I kind of give you these like emperor's shoulders almost and like it's a nice t-shirt definitely expensive like eighty a hundred dollars but for the fit I'm not going to pay that much quality is definitely there but for the fit I'm going to stick to like the twenty five dollar American Apparel power wash teeth because it has all the same like accolades but it's definitely like a much better price then we step down to like the gap pains like anvil Gildan range and you get like really cheap t-shirts t-shirts that you can replace on like a monthly basis sometimes a weekly basis but the thing is you only have to replace them because they're so shitty that they just fall apart where they ball up the closest the next runner-up I would consider it to be like the gaps essential tea that one has a similar a very similar like feel also lightweight very nice fabric but the thing is it shrinks sometimes do you wash the pea which monitor you get and if it doesn't is typically the type of model that kind of balls up and just becomes like a shitty and uncomfortable t-shirt so I like their stuff and I would choose it second but with the American Apparel power wash tea being readily available there's no reason for me to opt for one of those cheaper brands and then with the HTM the Zara you're paying a very low price and it typically looks good but it's like the worst t-shirt you'll ever wear I mean those fast fashion places just basically so you cheap what's trending and for a very low price but very low quality sometimes even lower quality and so that's like not even a choice me I don't we consider that and basically like I picked this t-shirt also because like the colors that are available are like very nice and there have a huge range they also have like a section that's kind of muted or like neutral s and so I prefer like the port which is like the wine color the maroon type of color I plan to use this on the next t-shirt we print here at the pump and this is the teacher we use with the bank you baste pump on t-shirt so I know a lot of guys are surprised to quality never the model for and yeah this is what I was talking about the Navy is actually pretty nice under this light normally it's kind of the darker end and I would prefer to be a little bit bluer you have the white t-shirt or course and then you have this like neutral tan gray as type of thing and the color for this one is probably my favorite out of all the t-shirts because many other brands offer this neutral gray like tan greenish I guess color but those ones typically end up low to like much like skin tone and it looks like you're not wearing a t-shirt which is really weird or at least I think is really weird I know some of the other youtubers probably think it's legit but then again they also probably wear fish in it too but this is what I prefer these types of basics are what I wear on a daily basis and like I have like the crazy range of other clothing but at the end of the day I see end up wearing these like almost all the time that's why I have like like over 10 of these I think almost 20 like powerwash tees but yeah so that's my perspective on like the basic tees I proceed these to definitely be like the best t-shirt currently on the market that's a reasonable price and damn good quality and so okay I have something out of this video and the next one I'm hoping to talk about kind of watch my favorite denim my period favorite pair or model of like salvaged jeans and we'll continue down this I whole like essential like everyday wear type of theme and yeah hope you guys got something on this video and peace", "X0Cg_V0PsRI": "what's up youtube jeff your stylo g and on today's video i've got a lookbook for you of six different ways how to rock a white t-shirt if you're new to the channel we release a new video every monday thursday and saturday at 4 pm eastern discussing various men's lifestyle topics such as style grooming and dating i invite you to subscribe tap that notification bell and join us and to my returning friends like dr sean carr now there's almost nothing in a man's closet that's more classic than a white t-shirt i mean for decades men have been rocking this iconic piece and i think it's for several reasons one it's very versatile you can wear it on its own or of course you can layer it and it's just something about that white tee that's casual but still masculine and rugged and that's what i want to show you on today's video on today's video i've got six different looks on how to rock the white tee whether on its own or layered under another piece that i believe you can grab some great outfit inspiration from for yourself so without any further delay let's hop into this lookbook of six different ways how to rock that classic white tee first up we might as well talk about the look i'm rocking now and one of my all-time favorite ways to rock a white tee i'm talking about layering it under a classic denim trucker jacket in this case my levi's one now of course we're talking about two american classics when we're talking about a denim trucker and a white tee i mean come on ultra iconic and i love rocking a look with a great pair of slim black jeans this look is classic it's cool and we add a little edge with a great pair of black leather chelsea boots this is a look that men of almost every age can wear i've been wearing this look probably since i was 17 and i'm wearing it now that i'm years old it has that great rock and roll edge with the black leather chelsea boots love a white tee under classic levi's denim trucker jack now for our second look of the day we're sticking with that classic combination your white tee and a pair of jeans but this time we're doing it without the layering piece on top as we rock the white tee with the medium washed pair of jeans a more warm weather look as you can see here we basically have the same look as the last outfit but it's a different seasonal approach getting rid of the black leather chelsea's and adding on some nice suede chelsea boots this is a look i often rock on a cool summer night still giving me a great classic combo look but i allow myself to have some edge with the chelsea boots for more of a warm weather look with the suede ones and there's nothing more classy than a combination of a nice pair of blue jeans and a white tee this will always be in style and as i mentioned earlier this is one of my go-to summer night outfits definitely can't go wrong with this iconic combination a white tee a pair of blue jeans and a great pair of boots now for our third look of the day we've got our dressiest outfit another great way to rock a tee but with a little bit more polish as this time i rock the white tee under a suit but as you can see we're rocking the suit in a very casual approach i have my cotton suit but broken up the top from one suit the bottom for another love the versatility of a suit when you have the same fabric you can mix and match it like i've done here absolutely love the combination of the khaki and blue in these two separate pieces giving me essentially a third suit of course if you want to bring down the dressiness of the suit you definitely can't go wrong layering it over your classic white tee and of course if you're going to rock the sneaker and suit look there's no pair of sneakers better for that look than a low profile pair of minimal white sneakers to me this is a great look to rock on a spring of fall date night put together but not too stuffy love the combination of a white seed under a casual cotton suit and some minimal low profile sneakers now for our fourth look of the day i've got another look i definitely wouldn't hesitate to rock on a fall date night but this time instead of the dressiness of a suit separate we've got an edgy look as we throw on the white tee under a leather biker jacket now as you can see there's a little bit of a running theme throughout this lookbook i'm pairing the white tee with other iconic masculine pieces i absolutely am a big fan of the black leather jacket and for this look we got another pair of jeans this time a little bit of a darker blue as we pair the blue jeans and finishing it off with a pair of my chucks my comedy garcon chucks i like the contrast of the playfulness of the hard on the sneakers with the ruggedness of the biker jacket it gets no more masculine rugged and classic than a great white tee under a black leather jacket definitely a great way to rock that classic white t-shirt now for our fifth look of the day once again i want to show you what i think is the ultimate power of the white tee that's as a layering piece now earlier we've seen it under a trucker jacket a leather jacket and a suit this time we have it under the quintessential fall shirt a flannel shirt once again we have another great example of a masculine look that any guy can get away with who doesn't look good in a flannel shirt and a pair of jeans this is a look you'll often find me rocking throughout the fall love the nice fall colors in this flannel and as you can see i've paired it with a great pair of dark gray jeans finishing the look off as you can see i've got another pair of my favorite style of boots chelsea boots but this time a nice pair of fall appropriate chestnut suede chelsea boots a flannel shirt white tee and some jeans every guy can rock this look once again showing how powerful a layering piece the white sea can be in a wide range of looks and last but certain not least for our sixth and final look at the day of course we got to give you a more warm weather look as this time we paired the white tee with a pair of shorts nothing says more laid-back cool casual and summertime appropriate than a white tee and a pair of shorts and i love the look of this white tee with this kind of salmon colored lumen lemon shorts and finishing the look of one of my favorite pair of sneakers i've been rocking the last couple of years the nike kill shot 2. now of course i love rocking the white tee as a layering piece but it works just as well by itself especially during those warmer months and the great thing about the white tee because it's such a blank slate a little bit of pop of color like these slamming shorts goes together great add in the versatility of these kill shot tools you got a classic summertime look another great example of how versatile and clutch the white t-shirt can be okay so there you have it my lookbook showing you six different ways how to rock a white t-shirt make sure you let me know in

teach you my way on how to de-stress a t-shirt now I've looked at a lot of YouTube channels and I've done a lot of research and I've done this before a bunch so what I've done is I've taken different elements from different things that people have done I've tried them all and mix it up and made my own deal basically yeah just got to do everything that they do and put it all into one that's what I did so it doesn't work that well on a really stiff t-shirt those really crazy crazy 100% cotton shirts that basically can stand up on their own doesn't work that well on them but about five or six of my other shirts came out amazing sometimes you got to go through the cycle twice even three times but to get a two just properly distress a shirt for most shirts it's gonna work pretty good so let me know in the comments below let me know you think if you like my channel please subscribe [Music] warning the time wasted watching this video is non-refundable [Music] next episode is the full episode a week with Donnie this is a tutorial episodes it's a small one just a little episode I don't want to I'm not gonna put any Trevor cartoons on this so maybe I might put a little one in there but because people want to see tutorials according to my friends people want to see tutorials so I'm gonna do a tutorial they want to see more Donnie I want to see more of you doing art making things doing crafts today is a tutorial on how to de-stress your t-shirts so this bag of salt was about $5 at the nursery basically Home Depot has these and check this out so I got a bunch of my shirts in here and this is phase 1 phase 1 is in salt water so I got salt water about five days I'm taking out right now and I'm gonna be Phase two [Music] okay so first one is my heavy-metal shirts and this was already like a soft t-shirt so the system worked really well in this this is really really super soft of course it was already soft so that was I was kind of a no-brainer the second one was skinny Jimmy's shirt the design with my friend Ken this worked really well too this shirt was um was a pretty standard t-shirt it wasn't a super heavy shirt but it wasn't a like a softie so now it's a softie and system worked on this great this was a hard team this t-shirt was pretty hard Atari Matt to some music for Donnie TV and and I've done an episode on him he's amazing and I really want to wear a shirt nah the system worked really good on this this I ran through twice I ran through this the system two times and now it's perfect I love it this I ran through the system three times this was this was a regular 100% cotton shirt as well and it just was really really really rough it was a heavy one so I'm gonna Hugh I'm gonna use the Puma stone on this King gizzard and the lizard wizard t-shirt I really want to wear it [Music] [Music] again do this at your own risk don't destroy your t-shirts don't get holes in your shirts just be careful I'm not a hundred percent sure how good it is for your shirt to leave it in vinegar and salt for a few days or a day or however long you want to leave it in for but anyways I found that this system works on a really heavy shirts it's just it just really doesn't work that well but you can get some of that starchy feeling out of it anyways good luck let me know you think if you like the channel subscribe and like leave a comment below thank you for watching mm-hmm distress some shirts man [Music] [Music] it is [Music]", "rwrWC55d61c": "hi everyone i am working on a t-shirt that i'm really excited about i love this design and i am going to be using some foil iron-on so many of you have asked me if i can use this in a tutorial and i have finally been inspired to use it i've told you that i'm just waiting for the inspiration and the inspiration has finally hit and i'm so extremely excited to show you um what i'm going to be working on so i am going to go ahead and place some foil iron on on this t-shirt that i have here and i have a weeding tool and a measuring tape and my easy press mat that i'm going to use we're also going to send this through the cricut explore air 2 and then i'm going to use my easy press 2 to place it on the shirt so before we do anything we're going to go ahead and measure out our space that we have to work with i did pre-wash my shirt so it is all ready to go and it looks like i have and i'm just measuring to the bottom which falls off screen a little bit but it looks like i have about 15 to 16 inches to work with and um that i'm just really actually need to focus on my height and you guys will see in a minute why i need to focus on height um only for this design because width really doesn't matter okay so let's go ahead and hop into qriket design space i will show you the design we're going to use i will also link it down in the description box below if you want to know where i purchased it because it's so super cute and i'm just making this for myself alright everyone let's get started okay so this is the design that we're going to be using i think it's gonna look really really neat on this shirt with the foil and i again will link it below so that you can see where i purchased this from again i'm just making this for personal use so i actually was inspired because i've seen this done before i actually saw someone at church in our worship team wearing a shirt similar to this and i think it might have said faith on it instead of jesus but anyway my husband nudged me and said that shirt is really cool you could totally make something like that so i was really excited because yes i totally can something like this so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to size this because it's already a pre-made design all i have to do is size it and get it ready to go okay so i'm doing a v-neck shirt so i don't want this to go down too too low because it already has a lower collar line so i'm gonna see if i can actually just make this a little bit um shorter and a little wider just like this just because i want to be mindful of my length and that still looks really good and it still in is um showing the design off really well okay so i think this looks pretty good so i'm at about 5.5 by 8.6 so that looks pretty good to me so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and select my explore you could do this on the maker or i'm sorry you could do this on the joy but it would have to just be at a smaller um size okay so now i'm going to select my explorer i'm going to click make it and i'm going to mirror my image because i'm working with iron on and click continue okay i'm going to browse all materials and i'm going to go to the iron-on section and i am going to select foil iron on right here so i have foil iron on selected i'm going to click done and then we are going to make sure that it is shiny side down on the mat and we'll feed it through our machine we're also going to be using the easy press 2 so i'm on my heat guide just trying to determine my heat settings we are going to be using the foil and our base material is 100 cotton and then i'm going to use my qriket easy pressed mat so i'll click apply it's going to tell us to preheat to 295 for 30 seconds preheat our material before we place our design down or use light pressure flip the shirt over and press for an additional 15 seconds and do a cold peel okay so i am just unrolling my foil this was a little sampler pack um i think i got this in a bundle so i've had this around and i'm really excited to use it so i'm going to use the gold there are multiple colors in here but i am going to use the gold for this project okay so again you're going to place it shiny side down on the map both look shiny on foil but um think of it as the um the color side down so the side that you are going to be the final color so we are doing gold so the gold side will go down on the mat and i like to kind of roll this up and then on my mat what i do is i just take it and i just drag it down to my line here and line it up and then lay it down it makes it a lot easier to place a roll on a mat okay so opening up our machine we're going to get it all cut out i'm really anxious to see how this turns out because i think it's going to be really really neat so loading my mat and then i'll get to cutting so while this is cutting i'm going to turn on my easy press and i'm going to click the temperature button and i'm going to cool that off to 295 for 30 seconds so we'll go ahead and get that preheated okay so that is already done cutting so i'm going to put my little iron on in my cutter here and i'm just going to trim down all the extras i'm also going to take a pair of scissors and i'm probably going to trim inside some of those pieces as well because there's a lot of extras that we can save and i have another project that i want to use this on very shortly make sure you're subscribed because it's super cute um so i want to make sure that i have enough for that additional project as well so i have my design here i think i might even cut in a little bit on these because come christmas time i'm probably going to want some gold foil so i don't want to waste anything okay so i know that this looks like i have just chopped this up but look at all of the extra pieces that i was able to get off of that design so you want to make sure that you trim off any extra pieces before you weed it out because i will definitely be reusing this so i want to make sure that i have as much extra as i can alright let's start weeding okay so i'm just going to start over here in a corner i'm going to weed out my design i think this is going to be so pretty and it looks like it almost has a little bit more of a matte look once it's off that carrier sheet so that is gonna be super super super pretty okay so i'm just gonna be very careful and i'm going to go around the design just like this isn't this designed so well done i think it's so pretty the second i saw it i knew exactly that i wanted to use the gold foil on this i thought it would be so pretty i think it's going to really contrast too on that dark uh charcoal colored shirt that i have and ironically that shirt has just been waiting for the perfect design too so i feel like we just have a good little match up here okay so i'm going through all the middles of my letters really quick and i am taking out all of the middle pieces i think that's it that was very easy to weed then i turn it over and there is my design how pretty is that i love it okay so let's go ahead and get pressing okay so i have my shirt out and i'm just running my easy press over it to get out any moisture and also just to give it a quick little press it gets all the wrinkles out and makes it look super super nice so i'm just focusing on that area where the design is going to be that looks good okay so now we can go ahead and again we are at 295 for 30 seconds so i am going to place my design on my shirt and i am going about an inch again this is a v-neck that has a little bit of a lower collar line so i am not going to go too low down because even here would be too low i'm going to go about an inch from the bottom of that collar and i'm just going to line up all i'm lining up is the top of that cross with the bottom of that collar so that looks good to me just like this and this has a sticky back on this um carrier sheet so or transfer sheet so once it's on there you can still pick it up and move it around but it's also intact and in place where you put it so you don't have to really worry about it moving around okay so i think we are good so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to take my press i'm going to place it over my design fully and i will click the go button now it does say in terms of pressure light pressure so we don't need to put a ton of muscle into this okay and now what we're going to do is we are going to flip the shirt completely over and we are going to press for an additional 15 seconds so i'm just gonna place that over just like this and pressing okay so i have let this completely cool so now what i'm going to do is i'm just going to peel up my sheet and i'm going to watch and make sure that there are no places that are lifting so i want to make sure everything is pressed down and it looks like it's really good so i'm pulling pulling now if there were any areas what you would do is just place your carrier sheet back on there um and then you would repress it a little bit but that looks really really good i love how this looks okay so here is a close-up look at it it turned out really really neat and i think that that gold on that charcoal gray color is really pretty i think it contrasts really nice i cannot wait to wear this this is so fun i wish we were going back to church sometime soon because i would totally be wearing this to church but in the meantime i will just be wearing it as we are live streaming and it will be really fun so i hope you guys enjoyed this please be sure to give me a thumbs up if you think this turned out really really pretty the foil and it feels really really neat on this shirt too i have to say um i think it turned out really beautiful i'm really excited that my first attempt with foil ended up working out really really nice and i think it looks beautiful all right everyone i will see you on the next video be sure you're subscribed because we have so many fun things coming up", "KgAgKwf641A": "hey guys Adam here from DOS information supplies and today we're going to talk about printing designs onto t-shirts and other garments and what paper to use for what items and I'm going to assume that you've got a dye sublimation printer using dye sublimation inks or either a reco and maybe the superjet are inks are one of the Epsons with the sublimation ink okay and the first paper I want to talk about today time is the standard dye sublimation transfer paper now everybody knows that realistically you're looking at polyester garments anything with a hundred percent polyester well you can't print anything out I tend to go anything over sixty percent polyester you should get a reasonable resort but try and get as close to a hundred percent as you can with this paper the reason being that the ink needs a polymer to bond to and however having said that when you do have the hundred percent polyester the results you get from this paper is absolutely brilliant and obviously there are lots of different types of this paper on the market this is just the one that we use here for all our sublimation is the jet stream digital f-35 paper it's a really nice balance of price and quality and but again you know there are a lot of options alright now the downside to using your standard dye sublimation paper is that you can only use it on man-made fabrics also you can't print anything dark with the ink being transparent em it won't show up on a dark surface the other thing that kind of stops you printing on dark with these that your printer isn't printing white and it will print CMYK but not white so if you want to put a white design onto a black t-shirt for example which is really popular you know bands and stag do that kind of thing you can't you can't do as it's not pretty in white there's no ink to transfer it just leaves the white blank okay however there are options that you can choose for for the situations so you want to print white cotton t-shirts for example or any other sort of natural fabric you could look at something like this this is the Reva media transfer paper for light garments now this is the one I use for light stuff if it's cotton or you know any other sort of natural fabric basically what it does is it has a transfer layer on top of the paper so you print your design out onto the paper well you mirror the design onto the paper lay the paper facedown well you'd cut your design out actually because the whole paper will transfer in the heat press so you need to cut your design out late design face down and close the press it takes about 25 seconds and the surface of the paper is an adhesive and we'll add ear to the garment you then peel back the backing paper revealing the design that's then bonded to the material fantastic for light cotton garments things like that absolutely brilliant and it is compatible with a cameo custom as well or any other form of cutter so you can really accurately cook those designs out if you need to but it's also really easy to cut by hand for your dark and for dark t-shirts cotton t-shirts I kind of think cotton I use this which is the equivalent dark transfer paper this is the river media dark transfer paper now these come in a Falls irrelevant 100 sheets per Park and they do the arc the arc they're not the cheapest thing in the world but the quality is absolutely brilliant so it's it's worth it it's worth it's worth the price tug basically the way this works is slightly different you don't want to mirror your design on the dark paper it put your printed the right way up because what you're going to do is you're going to peel you're going to cut it out and peel it away like a transfer lay it on the garment and then heat press it the back of the transfer layer on this paper has a heat activated adhesive which then bonds permanently with the material underneath and there is also absolutely brilliant both of these also provide that white because the the transfer itself is white you can have white text and things using using this paper without having to print white sideral don't need an Okie or anything like that you can do with this transfer paper and both of them have a little bit of a hand to them when they're on the when they're on the material but it's not it there's very very little it so it doesn't stick out a long way like some of the vinyl which is a nice effect but this is very smooth to the fab it feels quite natural when you're wearing it and things like that they also withstand washing really well recently with the dark fabric transfer actually just as a test I did a jumper and I probe it to my partner who has been sleeping in it and washing it and we've we've really really arrived about and it looks really well I'll stick a photograph of that jumper at the end of this video so you can see what I mean but it has been them it has been washed pretty thoroughly because I don't think she's ever read a garment care label in our life but that's just me alright guys the other thing with these two is they can actually be applied to the heat a standard household iron I am going to look at doing a video on how to do that in the in the future I'll show you how to do that but I can send the instructions to anybody who wants that so yeah so you don't actually have to have a flat press to apply those transfers to you to your garment well I hope that's helped and I hope I felt clear some things up obviously are different variations of this available these are the ones I would use I've tested quite a few of them and these the ones that I found I got the best results with yeah that's it from me today I hope that's cleared some things up here's a question I get quite a lot kind of printing a black cotton t-shirt with my sublimation paper and if you've got any questions get them in the comment section below or

might be like my ideal size that hugs your chest nicely yeah i feel like really strong you might burst out of it at any moment why we also have a couple other kids sections selections such as wonder nation nice i'm excited for that one this right here was from the polo fall catalog white t-shirt collection and after spending a little bit of time with the polo white t-shirt children's large i have to say it's a pretty solid shirt it's you know there's nothing offensive about it it's just it's just pretty forgettable i have to say it's nothing that you'll wear and be like holy lord i feel like a million bucks it's something you'll put on be like yup that feels like a white t-shirt and for that reason i'm gonna have to comfortably sit the polo white t-shirt at a b-tier rating i would just expect a little bit more because this was like a seven dollar white t-shirt for seven dollars i could own the entire gildan brand of white t-shirt so i was really shelling out big bucks for the polo and was expecting big things but didn't find those big things no boundaries there's a lot of room to grow in this shirt and the pocket kind of sags real low like grandma's titties down here that one's pretty see-through is it i can see all of your tattoos right through it no boundaries more like no chance of me wearing this out in public i mean just an embarrassing white t-shirt really i don't like shirts with a pocket like that and especially not a pocket of that size that pocket was big enough to put like a small golf cart in i don't know why you'd need a shirt pocket that huge unless you're trying to like hide a human being inside of it it was absolutely disgusting the fabric wasn't even comfortable it felt like construction paper it was way too big but that's because i bought from the adult section and well there's just there was no chance that i was ever going to enjoy this shirt but i decided to at least give it a try they didn't have like an adult small which i can fit into this was like adults large or extra large don't remember just not a great shirt really not at all i'm gonna have to put this one at definitely an f tier fruit of the loom platinum oh boy that's a nice one my least favorite brand but i've never tried their platinum selection awfully bougie this comes with dual defense technology working a wicking and odor protection what is wicking like moisture whipping ricks it off your body keeps you dry okay boys i can really feel that dual defense technology kicking in you look dry yeah i smelled like a bag of dog [ __ ] before putting this on but now i smell like roses that one's also pretty see-through is it like i i know i know your tattoos are black ink but i feel like i should have been able to see it up through yours yeah but actually this is kind of nice fabric it feels like really flimsy though like i feel like if i just get like one tug here like the whole thing's going up just rip that one off i actually feel like i could yeah you're getting oh yeah i didn't even put a lot of force behind that just just rip it off we're ready for the next one i just ripped so much of my hair as i mentioned fruity loom is probably one of my least favorite brands it's like wearing a handkerchief if it was covered in broken glass i really don't like fruit of the looms fabric at all but this was from their platinum selection which i had never tested before and i do have to say they upgraded the fabric on this it felt much better than i was used to with old fruit of the looms the only real critique i have is how flimsy it is as you saw two big tugs in the entire thing was completely kaput it was [ __ ] you know if you're using this for like sportswear if you're playing like defense on basketball and someone goes up to like you know dunk over you you're they're ripping your entire shirt into shreds it's going to get vaporized because it just doesn't have any durability to it so for that reason through the loom platinum i'm putting at a c tier i would expect a little bit more fruit of the wound platinum not important just to get a full comparison you're gonna have fruit of the loom not platinum okay that's gonna fall apart before it's just part of the loom just really uncomfortable fabric it's like a bunch of sandpaper reminds me of tracing paper yeah it's terrible i could definitely trace your tattoos too that was nice it feels like one ply toilet paper it looks like the torso is far too long for the arm length yeah absolutely yeah it's just a terribly made shirt it's great for your arms and my torso fruit of the loom should just be out of business terrible the platinum selection at least a little more comfortable just a bit flimsy yeah as expected classic fruit of the loom is just absolutely abominable there is nothing redeeming about it if you were trapped in a really cold environment with only one option for clothing and it being fruit of the loom you're better off freezing to death it would be more comfortable than wearing the fruit of the loom t-shirts so for that reason that's going to be enough tier here's here's one that i've never even heard of but it to my untrained eye feels pretty nice this is wonder nation did you want to rip another no i hurt myself the reason you haven't heard of this matthew is because you don't have children this is a child's brand yeah i would do it yeah it's walmart's child's brand i had a little battle getting that over my hulking muscularity but i feel like it's a nice fit that's a good one yeah wow wait wait show us the back again and give us a little like lap flex oh that's ripping see if you can burst out of it like the whole i'll just try and like flex it off more like i wonder how i got this strong you look massive in that shirt yeah this is an s tier can i try that one out those shirt is gonna look really fast does that mean you actually got it on oh yeah oh my man you look like a psychopath that wouldn't be allowed near like that of my arms it's part of the wonder nation anything you could burst out of that no i mean it's a nice fabric i'll give it to him dude i feel huge in this shirt oh my god like a maniac yeah you would be banned near every elementary school it's a nice fabric now all right it's got like barbed wire in the clutch really sharp [Laughter] all right i give up unfortunately wonder nation failed the ballistics test failing or passing that's pretty good the wonder nation children's medium shirt was actually surprisingly comfortable as well as coming with like a plus five self-esteem booster to it because it's so tight it compacts everything and just makes you look like a [ __ ] man so yeah i mean wonder nation i'm actually gonna give like a comfortable eight here as tears being a little generous because it is so tight it's like wearing a woman's corset it's good it's to be a bit hard to breathe if you're wearing it for an extended period of time but for that like short 30 minutes that you have before you pass out or asphyxiate yourself wearing the shirt you're gonna look great in it it just it really just makes you look good and feels good you feel like confident yeah i just don't like v-necks i just don't this doesn't work for me it's a great fabric absolutely won't fault him on that but i just don't understand v-necks is that the most see-through at the top for sure yeah so i can see something like that there's nicer fabric than the others but i can like that's the most i've seen your tattoo through a shirt yeah absolutely that's been every shirt so far so that's good that's part of the the good thing about white t-shirts yeah yeah yeah haynes premium are extremely comfortable i knew that going into it i'm no stranger to haynes premium this definitely was not my first rodeo however however i am pretty unfamiliar with v-necks i've only worn a couple of them in my life the last time being back in like early high school late middle school when i was like 160 pounds like four foot five and i thought fedoras and studded bracelets were cool so a v-neck wasn't necessarily going to be the ideal shirt to wear with that combination of all those factors but honestly as i wore the v-neck around today it really started to grow on me i really started to warm up to the v-necks design honestly i'm going to give haynes premiums v-neck here a nice comfortable a-tier rating it's literally called athletic works dry fit perfect there you go it's not the worst thing in the world but it's not overly comfortable either what that one's the most seat yeah you were gildan right yeah so your shirt so far is the only one i can't just see straight through oh nice like this one this one looks like it could be a fishnet like shirt on this one it kind of feels like it yeah i really don't get the design i guess it's for like sweaty old men maybe but i just don't get it it's not comfortable it doesn't feel like awfully able to breathe you know and then you're right that's definitely an old man yeah like working out at the ymca the ones you see blow drying your balls in the locker room usually i'm not sure more like athletics doesn't work because this shirt [ __ ] sucked i was not really a fan first impressions were far more positive because putting it on and only walking around doing a small 360 to show it off it didn't really really start to dawn on me how uncomfortable the shirt was it's just the design is not conducive to human skin it really gets very grating it just it feels gross it's like wearing little grains of rice across your body i just didn't like it so i'm giving the dry fit athletic works a deter rating maybe if you're like absolutely [ __ ] drenched in sweat it does a good job of not letting that sweat bother you by distracting you with how uncomfortable the shirt itself is i mean i really don't know the dry fit was not for me all right it's just called george this is george's white t-shirt they're multiple-sided like no they're all that's a big smallest there's a rather large small but you know george i don't have a whole lot to say about george pretty inoffensive feels all right not the best not the worst i could i could tailor that and it would fit you guys yeah it's a little big for small right yeah but like it fits you well oh wow that looks good wow george should hire you this is pretty fantastic design actually before matt tortured the george white t-shirt and shoved it through the [ __ ] shredder here it actually fit very well i thought and was very comfortable i granted the torso was a little long for a small unless it's trying to like fit on slenderman or something it was a little disproportionate but the actual shirt itself was nothing but quality george really has outdone himself again with this excellent feeling fabric that they've created here in their laboratory they just need to work on their dimensions of the shirt i would say so i'm just going to give george a b-tier rating so yeah that's uh that's about it for this white t-shirt tier list see ya", "N0fWD0aYpRY": "hey everyone I'm Teen Vogue's fashion news editor Alyssa Hardy and I'm Harrison sea Krait celebrity stylist and fabrication expert and today Harrison is gonna teach us what goes behind the price tag of everyone's favorite wardrobe table t-shirts Harrison is going to use his insight and expertise to compare two shirts he'll walk me through the fit feel and fabric and I'll use this new knowledge to determine the price of the mystery shirt so Alyssa what do you love most about t-shirts t-shirts are really versatile you can dress it up you can dress it down you can wear it with a skirt you can wear it with jeans and it's just something that everybody wants needs to have in their closet a good one having a great t-shirt is just essential and hopefully after today you will be able to determine which one is cheap and which one is expensive let's do it as a fashion editor what did you think about our mystery stay here hmm TAS but I think I'm gonna go for now with cheap okay so the first fabrication we're going to talk about is fiber content and this can be broken down in natural fibers and synthetic natural fibers that are most commonly used are silk cotton linen and wool and these subcategories are alpacas your cashmere is micro fibers and your ball hair for your inexpensive fabrics these are your synthetics synthetic fibers include polyester rayon which is a great substitute for silk acetate which is about as breathable as plastic so if you see that on a label you definitely want to stay away if you're looking for durability and your acrylics if we're gonna look at white white typically is always gonna be made from cotton when I am determining if a shirt is made of good quality I do a light test just hold the fabric up to the light and normally if you can't see through it it's more expensive if you can see through it the material has been processed and nine times out of ten the care label will read synthetic interesting which one of our mystery research is the more expensive this is tough your light test situation and that's kind of got me thinking that this one is the expensive one and this one is the cheap one final answer that's my final sir perfect you said based on the light test this is more expensive 98 dollars for an expensive t-shirt not a bad you know price for these yeah and for this t-shirt it was inexpensive $9.99 the light test was definitely effective yeah so now based on what you know about fiber fabrication does that make you want to change an answer on the mystery t-shirt hmm man this one's tough I think I need to know more so for now I'm gonna stick with you so a known fact about major retailers to produce all those same shirts they put it on a laser cutter they stack materials on top of each other and they cut everything at once a good determining factor when looking at a laser cut t-shirt is the seams before even trying on a t-shirt lay it flat if you see the seams coming in I level and not straight nine times out of ten that's a cheaper material interesting often times the leftover scraps from laser cutting that's where seams are made from that's where the sleeves are made from yeah there have been times where I've bought a cheaper shirt because I just needed something quick and then you wash it once and because it doesn't fit correctly you get a hole in the armpit or a hole on the side see and that's essentially because the shirts were just scraps and the major retailer just did that to produce as many shirts as possible you'll never get that from an expensive teeth as far as the fit if you're looking at a shirt and it already has the outline and silhouette of a body that's probably more expensive because it's already tailored to your body type before even trying it on is that for a woman's shirt specifically or is that like all types of t-shirts it's more commonly found in women's apparel but definitely a higher price a man's apparel you can see cut lines in the t-shirt which one of our misty research is the more expensive it's tough because by looking at it I'm I would have thought that this was the more expensive one but this one seems to have more of that curve that you were talking about so this is really difficult to determine but I'm gonna go this being the more expensive one I think I don't know so let's see if you're right so based on looking at both shirts I would say this is the more boxy silhouette so I would think it is the most inexpensive too much off though yeah 40 bucks based on what you know about fit and construction do you want to change the answer on the mystery sir here based on what you said with the seams and the silhouette I think I'm gonna stick with cheap okay so the next step is looking at the seams and stitching the more attention to detail the same has essentially it's more expensive so when looking at a t-shirt if you happen to not discover a stitch nine times out of ten its invisible literally where the stitch should be pull it apart you'll see the stitch that was done with the mattress stitcher that's a clear indication that the shirt is expensive this is actually a tip that my mom told me when dealing with patterned shirts literally look at the seams if the pattern matches on the same expensive and the pattern is off inexpensive brilliant mom okay those are really straightforward tips so it looks like they're both pretty on point as far as the pattern in the stitch but I would say that the invisible stitch seems like harder to find on this shirt I think I think this is the more expensive shirt it does appear to be expensive but I notice the pattern is off I didn't even check that I am you probably looked at the right side because you're right-handed right always check both seams so because the pattern is off I'm gonna guess that this shirt is the inexpensive based on the double stitching around the neckline and the fact that you have stitching here and as I said the more intricate stitching always is a great determining factor that a shirt is expensive this would be the most expensive shirt interesting so now based on what you know about stains our stitching would you keep the same answer for the mystery to you Wow let's take a look at the seams that looks pretty intricate I think I'm gonna change my answer or too expensive okay all right Alyssa so I'm gonna give you one last test when you're in a store you do the pool test if you hold the fabric and pull it normally if the fabric drops and it does not hold the shape of the wrinkle it's expensive if you do the pool test and it holds the wrinkle nine times out of ten it's cheap got it now that you know about fiber and fabric construction and fit seams and stitching what is your final answer one if the mystery shirt is cheap or expensive hmm I think if we're looking at all of those factors especially this pull test that you're just giving me right now I'm gonna go with expensive for the big reveal okay let's see 122 expensive yeah that's expensive why do you think that is so based on what we learned today as far as fiber and fabrication when would you do the pull test yeah it does not hold the wrinkle which means that this is probably prima cotton as far as the construction of fit aesthetically you can't really go based on the fit because it's a boxy shirt but as far as the construction you have so many elements here double seams all around the neckline double stitching here you have a peplum so it lets me know that it's constructed well this sure is expensive so good job also thank you so much for helping us today I'm going to be absolutely texting you the next time I go teacher shopping yes definitely I'm one text away [Music]", "cIgQpkEkhXA": "hey guys if you're interested in making t-shirts you've come to the right place I'm going to do a little t-shirt one-on-one with you about how to heat press a t-shirt stay tuned first I just want to show you my t-shirt this is my what Condon queen t-shirt that I made I got a lot of compliments on it so I'm going to teach you how to heat press t-shirts I'm going to do a couple of videos a little later on about how to you know print out a design how to make your design on silhouette and you know teach you a little bit so that you won't have such a hard time like I did in the beginning okay guys we are in the basement this is where I have my heat press machine I don't have an office space for this because there's just nowhere in the house for it we don't have an extra bedroom that no one's using so you have to put it where you can so anyway this is in my basement I just have a little corner my basement this is actually like a little window kind of thing in my basement near my storage so this is where I stuck it for now we're not finished with our basement so this is a little station I have a power heat press and you can go to WWE he trusts calm or I got minds off of Amazon and I'll put the price and everything below so anyway here it is and over here we don't have lights over here but this is the power button and as you can see the cord is coming out of the back you want to put your heat press near and outlet because this cord is this short and I'm just gonna go ahead and plug it up here you don't want to put it on an extension cord you don't want to attach your court to an extension cord so it needs to be near an outlet and it's gonna tell you what bolts and all that stuff you know that you need when the power press comes so this is the little book that came with mine and it's real simple it's really thin okay so I use the book and then also I use some tutorials but anyway you're gonna go ahead and flip the switch on and you want it set to 315 as you might have just seen that's what I have mine set on right now it is at 66 degrees and it has to heat up so you have to wait for it to heat up and I have mine set to a 16 second heat press and here are the buttons down here for your temperature settings I hope you can see that temperature settings and your time you're gonna click the tip button first and you're going to see the little arrow on the left hand side and I'm sorry I can't point to it right now because I'm holding down the heat press with one hand they're filming with the other so you're gonna tap that first button it says temp that's temperature and you're going to then go ahead and click start clicking on the up arrow and you will take it to where you want it sets you so if you want to set on 300 you know it might when you first turn it on for the first time it might be on you know 15 to 0 to 15 degrees so you're going to click that button all the way up until it says 300 or 315 degrees whatever you need it to be you're going to click it until it reaches until it says that number and then for the time you want to do the same I'm gonna click the time button and you're going to then go over one where you see the arrow up button right there and you're gonna click it up until it says 16 seconds or however many seconds you need your garment pressed for so most of my t-shirts are 100% cotton so what I do that's the setting that was recommended 315 degrees for 16 seconds so that's what I have mines and preset on it stays on that for the most part okay and this pressure knob mines kind of came already preset I really didn't have to do a lot to it the pressure is the amount of I wouldn't say weight but the amount of pressure that you want your shirts pressed at so that the letters are the vinyl sticks so to increase your pressure you're going to do it clockwise to decrease the put the pressure you're gonna do it counter clock the heat press is heating up to the temperature it needs to be you're going to position your t-shirt on the heat press and it's warm down here but this up here is what's hot that's the actual iron so you want to be careful with your hands and everything but you see where that nabhi is back there that's the center that's where I use my gauge for I don't measure and all of that stuff I've always been pretty good with you know just iron things and they come out well so you want to make sure the center of the t-shirt which this time I'm making a v-neck and this is the first time I'm doing a v-neck so you want to make sure that V is in the center with that retina and make sure that on the sides you have the same amount just kind of eye it make sure the same amount of cloth is hanging off now when you're pressing a shirt for a round neck you want to take about a business card size and that's where you want to start your first set of letters right here since is a v-neck you know scoops down lower we're not gonna go that far we're gonna go like half the size of a business card I'm sorry I'm gonna make go like half the size of a business card right under that V so that's about an inch and a half so we're gonna scoop this up so that all the letters and I'm gonna show you in a second what I'm talking about so that all of the design fits on here as much as possible so we don't have to double press I'm going to scoot this all the way up so we have more shirt to work with on here as you can see I have the V all the way to the back and right now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and it's not on there yet but I'm gonna go ahead and press this for like mmm six seconds to get the moisture out and I'm not even going to clamp it down that's about six seconds alright and that way oh sorry about that way that way you get the moisture out of the shirt and your letters will stick properly okay I have the vinyl here and in another video I'm going to show you about how to weed how to actually do a design and then print the design and weed the design so anyway I have everything cut out right now since we're just learning about pressing okay this is sticky on this side so what you want to do is make sure there are there's no lint make sure that there are no little specks of vinyl on there either because that will press into your shirt I did that one time and I was able to fix it but you don't want to do that okay so we're gonna put this up kind of near the V okay and Center it and then we're gonna do the rest with all the other letters and I'll come back and show you what it looks like so you just you're just kind of eyeing and measuring if you measure you just kind of iron make sure and everything a centered we're gonna get the design on there ready to press here we are with the letters on and the little designs there's one more design I have to put on and that's gonna be at the bottom of the shirt it could not fit on to the platform so has to be pressed again and as you can see it is centered make sure that your shirt is straight hanging off of there and like I said it's equal on both sides and the middle is where that be point is okay see my tip of my crown is where that B is and I can make sure everything is centered also guys the sticky side is down so you'll know when you come across my other videos when I make how to you know weed them out the sticky side is down so that kind of keeps it from sliding and we're gonna put a Teflon sheet over the design and I can't do it on camera because both hands need to do this so basically what you're gonna do is you're gonna cover this make sure nothing is sliding and because you know it's the sticky side is down it doesn't really slide easy but you're gonna put this over the design evenly while you heat press it so that nothing gets scorched or burned or anything like that and of course now it's all set its preheated it's 315 degrees and that is Fahrenheit of course and we're gonna go ahead and press Teflon placed over the design so nothing scorches ever going to lock it down takes a little muscle to do that alright guys and that first press was just for like four seconds that's a pre press and that is so that the letters adhere to the t-shirt but we're going to take this plastic off because if you don't take the plastic off you know soon enough it gets those you ever seen those indentations or blocks in the shirt around the design like squares or rectangles or whatever around your design that's because of the that plastic has been left on so you want to just get the vinyl adhere to the shirt and you want to take the plastic off and this peels away I'm going to do the rest all right the design is adhere to the shirt so I'm going to go ahead and put the teflon sheet on top and finish pressing it as you see this is glitter and this is glitter know the accent at the bottom is gonna be glitter too Teflon is back on for the second press I'm gonna go ahead oh shoot we'll go ahead and press okay by the time you get the handle down to a certain point I thinks it starts counting so you want to hurry up and click it in but anyway I want to let it go two more seconds because it wasn't really pressing when I was okay now you just yank the handle up and it comes up okay and there we go that is so pretty on a purple shirt white and silver so there we go I'm gonna put where I get my vinyl and everything from down in the description box okay I'm gonna go ahead and put on the other part of the design this is the bottom part for the design of the shirt as you do t-shirts more and more you're gonna come up with little crafty designs that you do in your own that no one else does this little trick here I'm not going to tell you completely but I kind of take scraps from my mind lines that I cut and there are always scraps left over we have to weed out designs and stuff so some of the scraps I use and these are scraps actually and I just use them and make little pretty designs on the shirt to add a little extra oomph and originality to my designs so these do not have the plastic on the back because they were weeded out so you do have to put the Teflon on carefully for that okay as you can see that design is straight on there too you can see through the paper and I am just going to put it on there just for a few seconds I'm sorry like 10 seconds because I've already heated this part of the design so I'm not going to overheat it but I just wanted to get this stuck to the t-shirt and now I'm gonna finish pressing it so it's a good press on there won't come off so I'm going to turn the shirt around so that it's you know may might be included in there and that's okay but I'm gonna go ahead and turn it around there we go turn this shirt around my turn turn the t-shirt around see that's that hanging down so I just want to press the bottom like I said may as include it and that's okay so I'm gonna go ahead and put a press on there and I'm not going to leave it on for the full 15 seconds because it's already been pressed a little bit so give that to that I'm gonna have to give it a pretty hard yank and there we go Oh nicely done and here is the t-shirt Oh nicely done and it's all centered looks very pretty I hope you can see it decently I try to get a picture of it kind of further away in a second but I'm letting it kind of you know just cool off it is a purple shirt with white riding and silver glitter crown silver glitter accents here down at the bottom and this writing is white also so came out very nice alright got another one to press but thanks for watching guys and I'll see you right back here next time on traces please subscribe", "yHHWooStqT8": "damn that's a good fit man who doesn't have a white t-shirt in their wardrobe it's a classic goes with everything you can wear it all the time as a base layer no matter the season and i don't know about you but when it comes to important staples like these i want to make sure my t-shirt is high quality durable and with a perfect fit the shoulders need to sit right it needs to be the right length the right sleeve length and it just needs to sit nicely on your body but what exactly is that perfect fit you ask today we answer that question [Music] first off let me start by saying that there's not only one type of fit for t-shirts depending on the way you like to style them and your personal preferences i'd say you can place them into two categories number one a standard slim fit which is the one we'll delve deeper into and number two an oversized fit the oversized fit has more flexibility in terms of how it can fit due to its oversized nature obviously it doesn't matter as much or at least it won't be as noticeable if the sleeves are a little longer or the body is a little wider than intended as long as it has a roomier body longer sleeves and drop shoulders it should look pretty good so in today's video i want to focus more on the standard slash slim fit and why do i say slash slim because that's how it fits it's not baggy it's not skin tight it gently hugs your body in the most flattering way and i say standard because this is your basic t-shirt fit if you're not going for the oversized look and you want that perfect tailored fit that you can wear with anything on its own as a base layer underneath other layers this is how you want your t-shirt to fit and in order to showcase the perfect fit i've partnered with son of a tailor if you've not heard of them before son of a taylor is a clothing tech company that makes custom fitted garments as you know no two bodies are the exact same we're all shaped differently and sometimes the standard five or six sizes offered by most brands is just not enough to fit all body shapes and sizes so son of a tailor customizes the fit of your t-shirt to fit your unique body and they even have a perfect fit guarantee so if they don't get it perfect on the first try they'll go back to the drawing board and make the slight adjustments required to get it to perfection so i tried their service made a custom t-shirt based on my height age weight and measurements and after one round of revisions i present to you my perfectly fitting white t-shirt the shoulders are 42 centimeters wide and you can see the shoulder seams sit right at that natural point where your shoulder ends and your arm starts this is exactly where you want it to be to achieve that perfect fit the sleeves come down to hit that key mid bicep area i wouldn't go any shorter or longer than this for a standard fit and with my measurements they're about 20 centimeters long in case you're the same height and that interests you now the torso is where you really want to get that sizing perfect anything overly loose will start falling into oversized territory which is a great look but it is a different type of fit and in that case you kind of want everything to be oversized not just a torso area but you also want to be careful not to go too tight you just want it to gently hug your chest without feeling constraining at any point when you move around the chest width for my custom fitted t-shirt is 49 centimeters as for your waist area you probably also want to have a different width here than your chest because unless you're literally shaped like a stick most often you'll either have a bigger belly in which case you'll need to increase the waist with or you'll have a slimmer waist than your torso and you'll need to have a slight v taper finally let's talk about the length of the t-shirt i get ocd about t-shirt length because the problem is if it's too long it looks like a dress and if it's too short you can't tuck it in without it coming out whenever you raise your arms and that is the worst the ideal length is about mid crotch that way you can wear it both tucked and untucked and it'll look great both ways and for me the perfect length is 64 centimeters when it comes to white t-shirts especially you want to make sure it's a high quality material the two most common problems i always look for are see-through material that is my biggest pet peeve having a see-through white tee and number two distortion or change of shape after washing it the latter is obviously harder to check for because you can't notice it until after you cut the tags and washed it but let me tell you i have this one primart and it did not last long after only a couple of washes it completely lost its original shape however the son of a tailor medium weight cotton t-shirt passed both tests with flying colors it's fully opaque and so far i've washed it three times and it looks brand new but with that said cotton is not the only material you can go for son of a tailor can also make them in wool yes you heard that right 100 merino wool t-shirts it's actually surprising how comfortable a good wool can feel to the skin and it gives off a more luxurious feel and then you have the tensile t-shirt stencil is one of the most sustainable materials out there and it's more breathable than cotton and great at wicking moisture away from the body so it's perfect on those days when you're moving around a fair bit but it doesn't actually feel like sportswear so you can even wear it with the classier looks you also have the peak t-shirts which are made from supima cotton and have a waffle knit texture which is normally used for polo shirts i'd say this is a great choice for the more sportswear inspired looks or just to add some interesting texture to a simple outfit and finally the standard cotton tee which you've been seeing also comes in heavy weight which can be a good choice for the colder months fabric choice plays a huge role in the final result of your t-shirt and you can really play around with different fabrics depending on your style and personal preferences i'm a sucker for the classics so my favorite probably has to be just a standard medium weight cotton t-shirt but whatever your style is you have your pick of the lot hopefully you now have a better understanding of what to look for in a t-shirt in terms of fit and fabric i've been there before where i didn't really know how things were supposed to fit and i would have liked to watch a video like this so i sincerely hope it helped and if like me standard sizes don't always fit you well and you have trouble finding that perfect fit off the rack i could not recommend son of a taylor enough feel free to check them out by going to the link in the description all of their clothing is made in europe and their t-shirts in portugal and of course they don't only make white t-shirts although that is my go-to color and i love white they also have the other go-to neutrals like black navy and different shades of gray and they even make long sleeves henleys polos sweatshirts and more hope you enjoyed the video guys i wish you a beautiful day keep on dressing with intention and i'll see you in the next video peace i just broke the chair this for a standard fit and for ah damn there's not only one type of fit for t-shirts [Music] and i say uh i feel like the light has changed isn't it brighter than before oh man come on the", "XBadLUHLe6E": "hi guys it's Bob Young from heist embody and today I'll be walking you through three ways to tie-dye your t-shirt we'll be doing three different methods crumpled shibori and spiral first let's go through everything you'll need gloves to protect your hands an apron or old clothes a tarp or plastic cover fabric dye salt or soda ash dye fixative plastic squeeze bottles large Ziploc bags of container and hot water rubber bands wooden dowel and of course your white t-shirt to begin make sure your t-shirts are clean wash them even if they're new new shirts sometimes have a chemical that keeps the dye from taking properly prepare your dye instructions will vary we use the powder that you mix into hot water which we then transfer it into our plastic squeeze bottle you don't need to put your dye in to squeeze bottles but if you're gonna die a t-shirt multiple colors this is the most accurate way if you're dying with just one color you can dye the shirt in a container full of dyeing you're ready to prep and dye your shirts the first technique is called the crumpled pattern start crumpling the fabric with your fingers keep scrunching the tee until everything is in a crumpled Mound hold the shirt in place with rubber bands the tighter you make it the more patterns you'll get apply the dye using the squeezed models and don't hold back you can really soak the tee flip the shirt over and repeat on the other side if you're using multiple colors liberally apply the different dyes for more vibrant random final result once died seal your t-shirt in the ziplock bag to keep it damp as the die sets and let it sit for six to eight hours [Music] lay your t-shirt flat and set the dowel in the center where you want your spiral to be twist until the t-shirt is a spiral shape find the tee tightly with three rubber bands creating six wedge shapes [Music] apply your colors one by one to the wet shapes for the best results make opposing wedges the same color now flip the spiral fabric over and repeat on the back once died seal the t-shirt in the ziplock bag and let it sit for six to eight hours [Music] roll your t-shirt tightly around a non-absorbent tube we use the paper roll which honestly wasn't the best but it worked secure both ends with rubber bands [Music] tightly scrunch both ends of the Roll t-shirt towards the center you can also secure rubber bands along the entire tube applied to the fabric rotating the tube is necessary once died seal the t-shirt in a ziplock bag and let it sit for six to eight hours [Music] final steps once you've got your t-shirts sit for a while prepare the dye fixative by mixing it with warm water you'll want the water to be between 100 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit soak the t-shirts in the fixative the exact time they'll need to soak varies based on the type of fixative so check the packaging after soaking the t-shirts rinse them in cold water you can use some light detergent if you want finally leave the shirts to air dry one important thing wash your tie-dyed shirt on its own the first time you put it in the machine to avoid the die bleeding onto other clothes and that was our quick and easy guide on

be discussing a set of techniques that are\nabsolutely vital for keeping your clothes in wearable condition as long as\npossible, how to remove any type of stain you might encounter. This video is part\nof a series on garment care; the previous installments in the series dealt with\nhow to remove the musty smell from vintage clothing how to wash and\nmaintain wool sweaters and some cheap and easy laundry hacks, you can find\nthose videos by clicking the banners at the right. Today's video is the final\npart in this series and as we mentioned at the top, it covers stain removal. No\nmatter how careful a man may be in his day-to-day life with his clothes, the\noccasional stain is inevitable whether it be from a plate of spaghetti and\nimpromptu tire change on the side of the road or really any time spent with a\ntoddler, you're bound to encounter a tough stain at some point. Fortunately,\nhowever, stain removal doesn't have to be a chore or involve the dry cleaner. As\nlong as you understand some basic chemistry you'll be all set. To begin,\nhere's a breakdown of the four basic types of stains you're generally going\nto encounter. Stains can be organic or inorganic in nature and from there can\nbe oily or not. In other words, the four types of stains are organic, inorganic,\noily organic, and oily inorganic. As examples of each of these, stains from\nliving organisms including plants are considered organic, things like grass\nstains, blood, or red wine. Meanwhile, stains from manmade materials are\ninorganic, things like ink, solvents, or machine dust. Oily organics are things\nlike barbecue sauce or sweat stains and oily inorganics are generally cosmetics\nlike lipstick. With that said, there are a few exceptions as far as treatment is\nconcerned. Coffee and tea are treated like inorganics, for example. For such\nexceptions and really for any case, it never hurts\nto do a little bit of searching on the web but in general, here are the best\ntechniques we've found for getting rid of all of these different types of\nstains. First, standard organic stains are best treated with hot water and a\nsubstance that's commonly marketed as bleach alternative. Bleach alternative\nand oxygen bleach are marketing names for a substance that's scientifically\nknown as sodium percarbonate or SPC for short. It's the active ingredient in\ncleaners like Oxiclean but whereas those types of commercial cleaners\nusually contain fillers, SPC is most effective in its pure form. Here's a\nrelated point as long as we're talking about bleach alternative, never use\nconventional chlorine bleach on your clothes again. Not for stains and not for\nwhitening. Most white clothes are actually treated with agents referred to\nas optical whiteners or optical brighteners. Chlorine bleach, in addition\nto being harmful to the body if ingested or with prolonged contact, can also\nremove these optical whiteners from clothing actually making them look less\nwhite and can damage the fibers of clothes over time. So bleach alternative\nor SPC as we'll refer to it throughout the rest of the video is the way to go.\nFor treatment of an organic stain, start by laying a towel down on your work\nsurface. Actually, for any of the types of stains we're about to cover, putting down\na clean towel is a good idea. Next, add a bit of SPC, we used about 1/2 capful to a\nbasin of hot water and stir to completely dissolve it. Then, thoroughly\nwet the stained area of the garment in question with the hot water and SPC\nmixture. Lay the garment flat on the towel and gently blot at the stain with\na clean cotton cloth, wash cloth, or towel. You can also use a garment safe stain\nbrush on most fabrics as we're doing here. The exceptions to this being wool\nand silk, because these fabrics are often more delicate, we'll cover them\nseparately later on in the video. After pre\ntreating your stain this way, it can be washed as normal in your machine and if\nyou'd like, you can also add a bit more SPC directly to the drum of the machine\nduring the wash process. Next, standard inorganic stains like ink are best\nremoved by the use of a solvent. Rubbing alcohol or more technically isopropyl\nalcohol is best here. Although you can also use different substances like plain\nvodka. Applying the alcohol to the stain with a spray bottle works well after\nwhich point it can be gently blotted. Then wash as normal and as before, you\ncan add some SPC to the machine if you'd like. All oily stains whether they're\norganic or inorganic in nature are best treated by first dealing with the oil. As\noils often surround other staining substances, we'll be looking at these\nstains sort of like a stain sandwich that is oil layer, stain layer, oil layer.\nTo remove the first oil layer, fill a spray bottle with a solution of 50\npercent white vinegar and 50 percent water. Spray the oil layer of the stain\nand then blot. Actually, using a stain brush may work best here. Next, apply a\nbit of water along with laundry detergent or better yet soap flakes and\nscrub again to deal with the main stain layer and for the final oil layer, spray\nagain with your water and vinegar solution and blot or scrub a final time.\nTo finish here, you guessed it! Wash as normal with optional SPC. Finally, in this\nsection, we're going to pay special attention to sweat stains as they're\noften a combination of oily organics and the aluminum found in many commercial\nantiperspirants. They're best treated with a combination of SPC and a stain\nsolution. Apply a few drops of the stain solution to the sweat stain then add a\npinch of SPC, you should create a paste with either your finger or your stain\nbrush. Let this paste sit for at least 20 minutes or longer if you prefer and then\nrinse it out with hot water. In fact, boiling water poured\nfrom a teakettle works best here then wash as normal with optional SPC. Here's\na related tip to prevent stains from returning to these garments, you can\nspray the affected areas with your vinegar and water solution before\nwashing them as normal in your machine. So what about treating stains on wool\nand silk garments? As we said earlier, these types of garments are usually more\ndelicate in nature so you won't want to apply SPC to them directly or scrub them\nwith a stain brush. For these fabrics, it's best to pre-soak for a little while\nin water with a bit of stain solution and then wash as normal. Of course, these\ngarments, if placed in a washing machine, should be individually and tightly\npacked in mesh washing bags. You can add a bit of SPC to the drum of the machine\nwhile washing if you'd like since the low concentration and minimal direct\ncontact won't be overly abrasive. For more information on washing silk wool\nand other delicate fabrics, you can take some tips from our previous video on\nwashing sweaters here. Here are a few final tips for today.\nWhichever stain type and consequential removal method you're dealing with, know\nthat you shouldn't expect to see a complete clearing up of the stain as\nyou're scrubbing it. Rather aim for about an 80% reduction in stain visibility and\nthen machine wash, the rest should come out. As we said in our sweater video,\nwashing on warm and with the express setting should be sufficient for most\ngarments and you can always add a little bit of SPC to the drum if you so choose.\nFinally, it may well be that a given stain isn't solely one type of the\nstains we've covered here today. Therefore, if you've tried one removal\nmethod and the stain hasn't completely come out, just try one or more of the\nother removal methods and you should ultimately be successful. As an example\nof having to use multiple methods, we found both the fountain pen ink and the\nlipstick that we used for demonstration purposes in\nthis video to be especially resilient. They didn't come out with each of the\nfirst methods we recommended so we used a few other methods to get them out. We\nthink that they got to about the 80% stain removal threshold we were looking\nfor and putting them through the washing machine should get the rest of the\nstains out. With these techniques in your arsenal then, stains should no longer\npose a significant threat to you or your garments and you should be able to take\ncare of them completely from the comfort of your own home. As we said at the start\nof the video, be sure to take a look at the three previous installments in this\nlaundry and garment care series here.

informal given\nits two front pockets I'm wearing it over a shirt from Charles Charles Tyrwhitt that\nfeatures a gingham pattern in blue and white the shirt does have French cuffs\nbut I'm wearing them configured in a barrel style today so that they fit\nbetter under the sleeves of the sweater my cufflinks are vintage silver ones and\nthey feature a simple geometric pattern that complements the gingham pattern of\nmy shirt well my plain brown trousers harmonized\nwell with my shirt and cardigan and on that note you can check out our video on\nhow to effectively pair brown and blue here to go along with this color scheme\nmy socks are plain blue in color but they do feature a subtle stripe in their\nweave the outfit today is rounded out by my dark oxblood penny loafers which are\ninformal in nature and also harmonize well color wise I'm not really wearing\nvery many accessories today aside from the vintage cufflinks but if you'd like\nto take a look at some other types of accessories\ncuff links as well as tie pins collar clips\nboutonnieres pocket squares and so on just take a look at the Fort Belvedere\nshop here", "rOosN3qq4O0": "[Music] good morning so I figured this is probably the only sunny day that we're going to get all week and because Michael and I are headed out to see my mom and dad for my grandmother's birthday I figured this is actually like the perfect opportunity for me to shoot my favorite white t-shirts finding the perfect way to shirt is harder than it might seem it has to be you know the right cut it has to be the right amount of loose has to be the right length so the criteria is pretty fast for me anyway so I'm going to just show you the ones that I love I've narrowed it down to five I'm gonna put them all on and just show you why I love each one and then at the end I'll tell you which one I love the most all right first up this is a t-shirt called from a brand called wear Frank so it's locally made here in Toronto by girl named Brandi and this t-shirt it's nice it's long at the back this is what it looks like untucked unrolled on anything so it's nice and soft the fabric feels great I really like that the neckline is pretty high just where my collarbone and this is the t-shirt tucked in so it's nice and loose which is great the fabric is a little bit stretchy so I feel like it's gonna hold its shape really well which I like and yeah the only thing and this might be more of a sizing so this is a size small is the shoulder and you see how that cuts my shoulders actually over here I like my t-shirts a little bit fallen so I like it when they fall a little bit over here but otherwise it's a really great t-shirt it's a really great option it's also ethnic ethically made here in in Canada so that's really important as well so t-shirt number two is by the time is the brand you can buy it at or Ixia again it's about the same length as the where Franklin that the shoulder goes a little bit longer but I don't like about it and it's hard to see in the photo is it's actually quite sheer so although it's pretty comfortable I don't like how see-through it is so if you're not wearing a nude bra you can really see everything and you can even see probably like wear my jeans cut off so that is not super great I can imagine this t-shirt being really nice though in a different color maybe like a grey or black where you don't see through it when you tuck it in it's still it's still good it looks good so yeah this is the Babbitt on t-shirt from murcia this white t-shirt is by a brand called our legacy it's the priciest of all the t-shirts because it had to come in from Europe it's a pretty basic cotton there's actually hardly any stretch it's a very boxy fit that's kind of what I was going for personally so that see here where the shoulder cuts off and it's right um I should say all of the t-shirts that I'm trying on are all in a size small so this is cuts off kind of like right where my shoulder is which I like especially because I like to sort of roll my sleeves up okay so this is the t-shirt tucked in by the way for anyone who's wondering these jeans are high-waisted skinny jeans from Zara but yeah it looks great tucked in and it has that like boxy sort of manly loose feel which is kind of what I was going for like it would be a little bit more masculine uh-oh and the fabric is great it's not it's not see-through and it's not super thin it actually feels pretty nice okay this one is made well this one came highly recommended by a whole bunch of you this leaves are a little bit short I'd like the sleeves to be a little longer than this again ik a little high here in terms of the fit it's pretty nice I think it would look good tucked in there's no opportunity here too those sleeves out there way way way too short fabric wise it's it's a nice it's not overly see-through but it's still nice and soft and here it is tucked in so it still looks good it's a good option definitely a good teacher I think this one was actually on sale so from like a price perspective this is by far the cheapest of all of them again this one's from made well okay and the last one is TNA also from IRISA fabric wise pretty good again the sleeves are longer it's nice it's long enough that I can tuck it in just um definitely a good white basic t-shirt there's opportunity to roll up the sleeves but it doesn't have that really overly boxy fit it's actually a bit tight up top and like I said before all of the t-shirts are all in a size small so I picked the same size and all of them you can kind of see how each brand has got sort of its own thing going on but definitely a good it's a good white t-shirt option okay so that kind of brings us to the end so those are my five top white t-shirts I've tried a bunch I tried some from Old Navy I tried a bunch from the gap I tried one also from H&M and a couple from Zara and I didn't I just didn't love them so the ones that I like the most are the ones that I just put in this video out of those my absolute favorite is the art legacy teeth although it's more it's a little bit more expensive washes really well it holds its shape really well and it has that sort of boxy loose fit which I really really love the second option after that that I really love would be the made well that would be number two number three would be Frank and then the last two would definitely be beat to or bhatia ones with the super thin one from Babbitt on being lost TN 884 so hope you guys mom is helpful thank you so much for watching remember to subscribe below and I'll see you in the next video thanks", "NKSd7Cqsfk0": "Today we're talking about the Next Level\n60/40 CVC t-shirt. Now this is one of our favorite t-shirts by Next Level because it's a great price point and for just a little more than a hundred percent\nring-spun cotton offers a ton more softness. That 60/40 blend of polyester/cotton means it's gonna be so much softer than just a hundred percent ring-spun cotton t-shirt.\nStill offers a great fit, awesome colors. Instead of just telling you though, we do have our model here, he's gonna come over and show it off. First thing you'll notice is just a\ngreat fit. It has this tailored side seam like all Next Level t-shirts have. So that means it's gonna naturally cut in and it's not going to be that boxy shirt we all grew up in. Next the neckline, the neckline is great 60/40 means it does have more stretch than a ring-spun cotton. It's just awesome because it's not gonna be tight on your neck. The sleeve length is also great it hits mid-bicep here, perfect dip right there. We love this shirt for so\nmany reasons. One of the other things about it is the colors, it comes in so many\ncool colors and as you can see it's a little heathered here. Meaning made of kind of speckles of different shades. That's signature to a blend because a blend is made of different fabric types, Cotton and Poly. So, with this we naturally recommend a vintage ink a thinner coat of ink, so that if we do a vintage white this blue color can come through just a little and make it look a little older, because the heather already looks a little aged, so that just plays off of it. We can always do a standard ink, do a bright white ink, but it's a little thicker.And this shirt is just so soft, so thin, it just moves with your body. Great length on the Next Level shirt too. Care instruction wise, you're not gonna have to worry about shrinking it. That polyester means that over the course of a lot of washes, it's not gonna pill. If you're ordering for volunteers or an event that needs to go on week after week after week or maybe\nit's your staff shirt this is a great step up. Go with this any day over a hundred\npercent ring-spun because it's gonna wear so much better over year or two. You're gonna love\nthis shirt! Tyler, you look awesome in it too! Tyler: \"Thank you.\" Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a three. Thanks for watching this video. Please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters and so do our customers.", "3DTegwqbJ6M": "hey guys how you doing this is home with liberty graphic designs i'm gonna make a really quick video on sublimation so don't go anywhere [Music] okay so i always say i'm gonna make a quick video right and end up ends up being like 20 minutes but i'm gonna try to keep it very short and uh like you guys know on my video sometimes i put a lot of information this is not gonna be one of those videos so okay so one of the things about sublimation it has to be 100 polyester though you can use some blends like for example 65 um uh yeah 65 35 right and you'll get like a vintage kind of look but um a lot of whenever we do sublimation we always stick to why well i'm going to be sublimating this fluorescent orange and then we're going to be doing some other colors obviously this is not white right but there's colors that we can use on this one like for example black blues reds you know stuff like that colors uh um dark color colors like that can be sublimated on this type of shirts so let me show you first uh how to do your uh like regular vinyl right on 100 polyester and and then we'll go from regular vinyl hdv uh to sublimation okay so i have a sheet right here and this is sublimation paper as you can see it's pretty big i just printed this it's 24 by 24 uh using the epson f570 so i'm gonna cut my artwork okay so the first one we're gonna make is gonna be this um fluorescent orange uh a jersey or shirt and this is gonna be actually all this i'm going to make like three different shirts i think it's three different shirts a lot of these are a friend of mine not for the same friend right but they're all they're all very good friends of mine so it's gonna be a like say for example a construction construction uh company this is all we need we don't need a bag i'm sorry we don't need a pillow okay so this is all we need you don't need a pillow for this because you're not going over any seams a lot of people will put the color on this side so you don't print it that's that's a really good idea me i don't care so i'm going to press this for one minute 60 seconds and i have other settings in here everybody prints with different settings i have my settings i have everything everything dialed in the way that i want it again everybody prints like for example they'll say 400 for 60 seconds or uh you know 425 for x amount of seconds me i got my own settings and i'm gonna keep those two myself so there you go that's the front and look at that that one's done and this is what it looks like dang it it's hot that's what it looks like it's nice and dark i mean it's really really black so again those are settings that i already already been playing with um and i printed this on an epson f570 so now we're going to do the back and the back is same same thing and you guys are going to ask yourselves juan you don't use a uh t-square no i don't use a t-square there you go that's the back and you see how dark it looks i mean dang it it's hot it's like really hot but look at how dark that is i mean that's like a true black i mean that thing is it's like it's really really black it's amazing right it looks really really good well you're gonna be like well it's a bright color yeah it is look at that it looks really really good so on this t-shirts right here there's no need to make a screen to screen print it none whatsoever you can use sublimation now let's move over to something a little more challenging black it's a black t-shirt and let me show you against this black t-shirt this is 100 polyester i'm going to show you against the t-shirt so you can see how dark my black my black is you see that you see how dark i am on the uh on the sublimation yep it looks really good okay so now on this one 100 poly no i'm not gonna use sublimation so for something like this if you guys have any sublime any uh polyester shirts like this you know you cannot sublimate black so for that we are going to use regular vinyl you're probably going to be asking why are you using vinyl you can screen print it well the reason why is because this is just one shirt that's the reason why i'm using vinyl so all i got to do on this one change my settings because i don't want to i don't want to heat press it for one minute so that's it peel it hot and then i just give it about three seconds without the uh without the the uh what they call it the carrier i'm not going to touch it because it's like super hot so there you go and by doing that that you know five seconds it really pushes the the uh what they call it the vinyl back into the fabric and notice how my shirts i'm not burning my shirts you see that sometimes when we saw blue maid you can see the part where you actually burn the shirt okay so now we're gonna move into yet another shirt and the next one is gonna be this charcoal gray so charcoal gray let's see what happens with the sublimation and the reason why i'm doing this video guys is so you guys can get an idea on how dark you can get sublimation to work so we're going to take our sublimation on a dark gray shirt so a lot of you is going to say it's not going to work because sublimation is supposed to work only on white t-shirts or light colors let me change my settings okay so let's see if our dark um garment worked look at that you see that so a lot of people will say somebody mentioned dang it that's hot it's like really hot a lot of people will tell you sublimation only works on white t-shirts no it does not depending on your settings and how good your you know your printer is this is how good you can make it look so let's throw a logo on the front just to kind of finish that shirt and then after i do this logo i'm going to show you something real quick [Music] also notice when i lower my press i went real slow when you're doing sublimation you want to go real slow if you don't if you didn't apply adhesive or put a heat tape on it you want to you want to lower your press real slow because if you if you bring it down too fast the wind uh that you create by pushing it down can move the artwork and that's the front of the shirt and you can see it's nice and dark really hot too see that so this is a very dark shirt and yeah you can still make it work okay so the next shirt we're gonna make is gonna be this um gray one and the color and this one is actually silver that's the color on this one silver and this one we're going to do a number and do a number on this one um this is a jersey for like a soccer team okay so except for the number and on this numbers this is really cool because on the number i even in i even did the logo of the team um so that's what it would look like on a gray shirt and it actually looks it looks really good okay so but one thing i wanted to show you and i'm gonna show you on this red one is this one's right here they get a logo on the sleeve so a couple of things you got to do on the sleeve if you're going to do a logo on the sleeve do it where the sleeve is actually folded just like that like it is and then put it right there or whatever is going to go right in this case it has to be right in the center of the of the sleeve well if we do that so usually stick your hand inside so you can get it right in the center and then you follow the crease right see that crease okay so when you're working with uh something like that it has seams i'm actually where i'm where i'm placing the the print there's no seam but the seam is on the other side so what you want to do is you use a piece of foam any foam would do just make sure that you put a piece of teflon teflon sheet on top of it so it will be something like this so you will put your sure like that right and see right now the crease or the seam i'm sorry the seam is right here and there's the crease so that that's the center of the shirt now if you put a piece of foam in there the this right here will sink into the foam and you can you can go ahead and sublimate it and you won't have a problem but if you sublimate it directly on the planet the blonde there's not going to be any room for that for the um the song part to go anywhere and you're going to ruin the shirt it's not going to sublimate um it's not going to sublimate properly the best way to do that is if you get a pillow but if you don't have a pillow and this is one of those heat press uh pillows so if you don't have a pillow you can go to walmart um hobby lobby uh joanne's or whatever where they sell a foam and you can buy a piece of foam that would be the cheapest way however if you're gonna go this route i suggest you put a piece of a teflon sheet parchment paper any type of paper to protect the foam from getting sublimation into the foam uh it doesn't matter if you get sublimation on the foam right you can throw it away but if you get sublimation on the foam or any type of um ink on the foam it's going to transfer over to the to the next garment so this is what it's gonna look like okay so if you use a foam make sure that you adjust your pressure because now uh you added a foam this thing is not gonna close see it just won't close so adjust your pressure try it and um and then go from there i already lost my my little crease make sure you put it upside down and now we can sublimate the sleeve there you go sublimate it using a regular piece of foam and you're gonna probably ask yourself oh you're gonna probably say juan you said to use to cover the phone yeah but if you notice i'm only using that little part right there so there's no way that the ink can get over there but just to be on the safe side make sure you use something to cover that foam you see everything is sublimated then this thing this thing is hot so so look at that i mean you can actually tell where the the sewn part was or the seam you can see where this the seam was right there i can actually see it but if you notice everything sublimated correctly so by using a piece of foam you can um you can get away from you know so um from these uh seams right here just by using a little uh cheap piece of foam one thing i forgot to mention guys uh when you're doing multiple shirts this is some sublimation okay so as you can see i went and got another shirt but one thing is very important that you do is make sure you put a protective piece of paper like on the other ones you didn't see me using that but i'm gonna show you real quick because uh sometimes the when you're doing the sublimation sometimes when you're doing the sublimation this is sublimation paper right sublimation will actually bleed through depending on what kind of settings you're using on your paper and what kind of paper you're using so it'll bleed through the paper and actually stain the uh um what do you call this the teflon the teflon sheet and then when you go to apply an or when you go to supplement another shirt or garment whatever it is you're using or sublimating masks t-shirts whatever you're sublimating that image is going to be imprinted on your teflon sheet and you can actually stain the other shirt or whatever it is you're using so i'm going to show you real quick uh what i mean by that because i didn't explain that on the video i was about to edit the video and i was like let me let me fix this real quick so let me show you real quick what i'm talking about okay okay so we're going to do this shirt right let's say for example on this one we're going to do the number this one's going to be number four so i've been doing this for a while if you guys if you guys don't feel comfortable just placing the the number or whatever it is you're gonna sublimate like that uh use a ruler so you're straight i've been doing this for a while so well i i don't use that anymore but this is what i'm talking about grab a piece of butcher paper uh even regular paper will work um let me fix this right so it doesn't slide on me this is what i say i'm look i'm in the market for another heat press because i like to thread my my shirts and this one i can't thread them so if i was to thread it see you know i'll be stretching the the shirt because it's already hidden at the bottom so that's what it means by threading a shard is is where you can put it inside the machine so that's why i'm i'm in the market for another heat press so okay so going back in this right so um several ways of finding your center you know you can fold it in half just make sure that your uh that your edge to edge but in this case we're just going to put it about right there and then the position and the numbers you want to leave enough space just in case they want to come back and say can you add a name so if you put your name your numbers up too high you're not going to be able to add a name in the top you're going to have to do it at the bottom so i usually i usually place my num my numbers about six inches from the color down um that's where it's going to go so and then this is what i was saying put a piece of parchment paper a piece of butcher paper even regular paper however this paper that you're gonna put in here has to go in the trash after you use it and i'll show you what i mean okay so now this is what i'm talking about um i know you're not probably not going to be able to see it on camera maybe you can but there's a very let me get this out of here um so there's a number right number four and what i was telling you about it'll bleed through the number or through the paper um depending on your settings so i don't know if you can see it but there's a very faint uh image in there of the number well if you don't if you don't protect your your heat press that will bleed through and you you're going to put an image on your um on your heat press or your teflon sheet and then when you go to when you go to press the other one you're going to have like for example not all the shirts are gonna be number four but i say for example we'll go to number five you're gonna have the number five and you're gonna still see the number four in there um trust me uh right here you can hardly see it but when you press a shirt and watch i'm gonna show you just so you can see it let me see if i can put a print um i have this material here this is what we use for some of the mask this is white so we're going to try to see if we can get that number to sublimate because you're going to be able to see it on the white print better than you can on this piece of paper so this is just replicating let's say for example you put another shirt in there um like for example the number five or number three whatever you know okay and after you use this paper pla make sure you throw it away um this is pretty cool it actually cleaned the ink that was in this paper it actually took it i mean it completely cleaned the the ink that's pretty cool yeah because i can't even see anything anymore but if we look at our print again it's very light but it's right there again i don't know how good you can see that on the on the uh on the video but it's right there i can see the number four right there it's going right there over here again you can hardly see it but if you're doing multiple shirts that's gonna get uh brighter and brighter and brighter and then you're gonna ruin a shirt okay so again i forgot to uh to show you this i forgot to tell you about putting a piece of uh a lot of people use butcher butcher paper um perfectly fine whatever paper you want to use uh if butcher paper is too expensive you can just buy a rim that's what i call it right a rim of paper regular printer paper and then just put it on top to protect the the heat press or the teflon sheet that you're gonna put in there that way if you transfer anything onto the the um not only the shirt but to whatever you're protecting you can throw this away and measure you can only use this once so use it once and throw it away get get rid of it don't use it again because you'll see how it actually um and this one you can hardly see it see this one i couldn't even i can't even see it but even though you cannot see it trust me you want to get rid of it just in case if there is residue of uh adhesive in there i'm sorry not adhesive of sublimation ink in there again depending on what your settings are and what i mean by settings is what how much ink you actually actually deposit on the sublimation paper i like to do a little extra myself because you get better prints that way so so yeah make sure you use some sort of paper so you protect your heat press so i forgot to put that on the on the regular video that's why i came back i didn't finish editing the editing the video so i came back and redid this one so you guys uh can see what i'm talking about okay now also on the other video i didn't show you uh how i was doing the sponsor and everything so let me show you real quick so it's really it's really easy for you to mess it up once you uh line up everything say for example that's where it's gonna go when you lower this if you lower it too fast did you see that how that one moved so that's what i'm saying be careful you can add adhesive just regular adhesive you don't have to go buy that expensive pro spray that you know you can buy of i don't know i can't even remember the johnson plastics i think sell some on a lot of people sell those you know pro sprays this is regular spray adhesive that we use for screen printing you can use this just spray a little bit so just enough so it'll stick wherever you want it to be at now even if i move the shirt that's not going to move well flip it over it will right um but that has enough enough adhesive for the for the graphics to stay on and it won't mess it up trust me the adhesive will not transfer it'll it won't stay on the shirt and it's just a little bit i mean i just sprayed a little bit so yeah you so you want to apply just a little bit of adhesive so the the um what do you call it the print doesn't move and then don't forget to put your paper on it because remember the reason why we put in the paper is so it doesn't transfer onto the heat press and that's it remember we grab this piece of paper and again on this one i don't see any transfer but even though even though you don't see anything get rid of it because there could be something there that you don't see because i literally don't see any any transfer on there but we're gonna throw it away and as you can see if you add adhesive to it um the adhesive completely leads to i mean it won't you won't have any residue and you don't have to use none of that you know pro spray that they sell and that's it now remove that shirt okay now if you do happen to transfer some ink into the teflon sheet either the bottom or the top one keep one of these bottles handy uh this is just a degreaser and what i do is i take one of my whole shirts and as you can see it's all orange so spray a little bit in there just like that this is just in case if you did transfer some and clean it and just clean your plant and you'll be ready to go the um what they call it the degreaser will take any uh residue that you left in there okay so i just wanted to i just wanted to point that out because i forgot to like let you guys know or you know show you that little trick but yeah thank you for watching guys [Music] you", "w4vbtqpF-DE": "In today's tutorial will show you how\nto get a bright white print on a black t-shirt and how to cure it coming up what is up gang Matt with Mikey Designs\nhere let's dive right into that tutorial ok guys in order to get a bright white\nprint on a black t-shirt the the shirt that we do have that we are using\nthere's a next level t-shirt I'm just going to go ahead and load it up on the\npallet as usual and we are using the shop gnome print we're using a 195 mesh\nwith our epic amazing white bright by will flex this is our go to ink and\nessentially if you want a nice bright white print you just print flash print\nwith your white we coated these screens one-on-one again we're using a 195 mesh\nthe brighter you want your white print the lower mesh you'll use but you'll end\nup using more ink we tend to like to stick to the higher mesh counts because\nwe're not using as much ink and you're still gonna get a bright white print and\nit have a little bit of a nicer feel to it so here we go I'm gonna go ahead and\nflood it using a fairly upright position I tend to like to do a push stroke and\nyou just want to make sure you completely clear your mesh as you can\nsee here our mesh is nice and clear and then there is our first print as you can\nsee it's a little marbled and that's to be expected because you're kind of\npressing the ink down into the fibers of the shirt we're gonna send this over to\nthe flash and then we're gonna go ahead and print it again okay we went ahead and flasher Inc\nnothing is coming up on my finger so I know it's ready to go\nit still has just a slight bit of tackiness you don't want to cure your\nink you don't want to flash it too long otherwise when you do your top print\nthat top print will wash out over time so we're just gonna give it a flood and\nthen we're gonna give it just one good firm press let's go ahead and try a\nsecond one if I see you like it it looks like you hadn't cleared quite completely\nnow it's nice and cleared and we have ourselves a nice white bright print and\nagain this is using a 195 miss let's see if I can get it to focus a little better\nthere we go and that's about it I mean just do a print your first print give it\na few two or three hits until your mess completely clears because we were using\na lower mesh it is a little harder to clear if you're using a 110 a couple\nhits or maybe even a hit well clear it just depends on how firm you are if\nyou're using a manual and automatic probably would clear it in just one hit\nbecause it can put more pressure down then you flash it and to give it one\nmore hit you just want to make sure you play\nyour mess and there you go guys I'm going to go ahead and take this off of\nthe pallet and toss it through the conveyor dryer and to cure ink we tend to like to run\nour somewhere around 350 just to make sure it completely goes through making\nsure the ink really completely goes through the entire layer of film curing\nit completely and here we go it's a nice bright Fred as you can see I'm stretch\nit doesn't crack and we got ourselves a nice bright white print the key to\ngetting a nice bright white print on a black t-shirt is to use a lower mesh\nscreen either a 1 10 156 195 even or 200 it just depends on how much pressure\nyou're putting down your squeegee angle will determine how much ink you're\nactually putting down give it a couple hits flood it hit it a couple two or\nthree times until the mesh completely clears and you're putting that eat into\nthe fiber of the t-shirt you don't want to press too hard that weight you're\nsqueezing the ink through the shirt down onto the palate\ngo ahead and flash that afterwards once you flash it it's nice and tacky there's\nnothing coming up on your finger be sure not to over flash it otherwise when you\ndo your top print that top print will wash out once you flash your underbase\nor your your first hit of ink go ahead and hit it again sometimes hitting it\nonce will work you just have to keep an eye on your mesh make sure all that ink\nis completely cleared that mesh if it hasn't to go ahead and hit it again\nuntil it's completely cleared the higher the mesh the harder it's going to be the\nclearer it and I hope this helps you guys thanks\nfor tuning in guys don't forget to

lot of you guys are trying to choose a t-shirt blank for your business and in this video we are going to compare the Bella canvas three zero zero one to the next level thirty-six hundred coming up right now [Music] what's up guys Gary edging a t-shirt help desk calm and we are getting into the ring all right Bella kam is three zero zero one versus the next level thirty-six hundred all right the tale of the tape all right these two blanks have a lot in common they're both popular styles they both run from size extra small to 4x now there are some differences between the size and how they run between Bella and next level and I'm going to get into that later in the video all right they're both cotton and they're both ring-spun but the Bella canvas is heirloom combed ring spun cotton it's different and I'm going to explain that later in the video they both come in a multitude of colors next level comes in about 30 different colors however Bella canvas comes in 95 different colors and they also have Heather's and different colors of Heather's they both have the tear away labels but there's some small discrepancies in that and I'm going to explain that later in the video so I have two colors for both styles and we're gonna get into that and let you see what we're talking about right now alright guys this is the Bella canvas valve 3 zero zero all right unisex style and I mean great shirt you've seen it all before it has the overlock stitching on the shoulder goes down and it has the side seam which really makes what a really nice fit it's not just tubular all the way around so let's show you the back I mean great shirt so this one right here is the next level all right and you see the back great shirt same thing overlock stitch is very very similar on the surface okay as the collar great collar is the back very similar on the surface to the Bela campus it also has this side seam alright so let's see what that looks like in red all right so this one is the Bela canvas in red okay great shirt right and all and you know we have the overlock stitch and a very nice collar and we're gonna go down to the same stitching on the sleeve now let's take a look at the back I mean great shirt great fit all that good stuff and of course you have that side seem very important because that helps the fit okay a lot of these things are tubular they just go around and this one is the next level these styles are somewhat similar all right all of those attributes when you look at them are the same the fit is a little bit different than nice collar the overlock stitching here's the back very similar on the surface alright so let's take a deeper look alright now that you seen those bad boys let's do a side-by-side comparison let's put them right on top of each other and let's see what we're working with here we go so right here we have the Bella canvas 3 0 0 1 and the next level 3,600 now these are both sides large and they both have the rip-away label now Bella canvas started doing the Ripper ways long before next level so some of the next level stuff you get may still have the satin for the woven label and also the next level as you can see the next level is the one in the back you can see how the shoulder comes further over in comparison to the Bella canvas and that gives it a a more boxy or feel the Bella canvas has more of a fitted fitted look or fit now that depends on your personal preference and what you want to do with your line all right and you can see that the colors are very similar but I used this red so you can really see this stuff a little bit better than on the black so you can see the difference you really get to see the difference when you actually try it on or put it on now the fabrication the fabrication they both use rings cotton LaBella canvas uses heirloom combed and ring spun cotton they comb out 20 to 25 percent of the initial cotton to create high standards which gives a clean nice print surface both of them have sizing from extra small to 4x Belair canvas is considered a true unisex because the smaller sizes are more tailored to a female towards a bigger size as a more tailor to a male another thing is next level is all made everything overseas Bella canvas garments are all dyed and cut in Los Angeles they have a huge manufacturing presence so if American May is important to you go of Bella canvas actually I have a video where I visited the manufacturing plant and there's gonna be a card in the description box and right here so you can click right up there and check it out alright guys that was cool but now this is where the rubber hits the road alright everything looks great everything looks awesome when it's brand new ok when it's as we used to say back in the day funky fresh out the pack ok when it's nice new and crispy but what about when you wash that bad boy a few times alright so now we're going to show you how it is after some washings okay here goes alright guys so I took these and I threw them in my little mini washer here because I wanted to go through the process because like I said everything new looks good but what about the process just like in our everyday lives when we get a t-shirt when your customers get a t-shirt they're going to throw that bad boy in a washing machine and wash it so the wear and tear of washing it just what do you get this is where you really how good the quality of your t-shirt is so I washed these a total of five times I ran them through the entire process five times and I'm gonna show you the end result alright that was the washing so let's see after they're all dry let's see the difference between five washings all right check it out all right and so after wash this is what we are working with for the next level and it's nice you know but there are a lot of loose fibers you know and the the neck looks a little bit worn after the wash you know it loses his shape a little bit but it's still a quality garment but you can see some of the loose fibers so you know just take a look at it you know this is after five washes all right this is the real deal Jimmy so just want to show you everything all right I mean nothing I mean when you wash something nothing is going to stay perfect this is what happens during the natural process of washing [Music] so this is the Bella canvas and one thing you're going to see is that the neck and the collar maintains is its shape and it still overall has less of the loose fibers and still you know maintains a little bit more of that fresh look I mean after washing nothing looks like what it did when it was first purchased all right but higher quality garments do have a tendency to maintain their quality or closer to the quality for longer so we just wanted to give you guys a really really good look at the both of these another thing to take into consideration is the Bella canvas three zero zero one is five cent cheaper than the next level 3600 so you're actually paying a little bit more for something with less quality [Music] all right guys conclusion they're both quality t-shirts okay in terms of fabrication and the quality that's put in it you know have to give Bella canvas the advantage but of course you know everything is a matter of choice and what you want alright the one of the things that really stand out to me is the fit and see this is the thing about fit is everyone wants something different if if you're into something a little bit more baggy and boxier you may want to go with next level if you want something a little more nice and really nice and you know fitted to the body and looks really good and what's happening right now in the industry I would definitely say go with the Bella canvas course after the washing I think that I mean they both look good the Bella canvas does have you know a slight advantage with the fabrication and that that nice smooth printing surface and it really has that you know that favorite t-shirt appeal you know how after you know you had a t-shirt for many of you wash it and wash it and just put it on and this fits I mean Bella canvas definitely has that appeal but once again it's all this stuff is subjective it's really up to you so that is my comparison I hope you learned something from this the one thing that is an absolute constant with every t-shirt business is the blank you have to have a blank t-shirt that's a very important and when you have your core target audience set up choosing a blank is very important and it's up to you to make the best choice you possibly can so you can get those customers to not only buy but to be repeat customers so make the best decisions anyway guys I am Gary a janae I wish you guys all the best cheers to your t-shirts remember do something good for somebody and if you don't have anyone to do something good for do something good for yourself so next time peace and blessings and I'm gonna put some butter on my shoes and slide on out adult god bless and I am out peace the Bella Candice three zero zero one to the next level thrift you [Music]", "9FMvuBStXEg": "hi I'm Rachel you too sis and I'm gonna show you how to make clothes shrink first and foremost obviously you want to try just washing them in hot water if that doesn't work and you want them smaller still you take your clothes put them gonna sink anything at all or you know anything that'll hold water boil some water on the stove in a tea kettle or a pot you know anything you have available once the water is boiling pour it over your clothes and let your clothing sit in the hot water until the water is cool once the water has cooled off be careful cuz the clothes might still be a little bit hot but wring them out just a little bit so you won't be dripping water on the floor before you take them to the laundry room throw them in the washing machine depending on how many clothes you have put the washing machine on whichever setting extra small small medium large you know depending on how many clothes you have wash them in the hottest water you can add your laundry detergent of course you know let them go through their cycle when they're done take the clothes out pop them in the dryer again on the hottest setting possible and pull them out and your clothes should be significantly smaller I am Rachel you choose this and that is how you shrink clothing", "amLhr_KLrXA": "so David we're printing this cheap printing that unto the paper coming up it's a shocker a sprinter but you can use any other inkjet printer to do have sublimation inks but ya gonna have to have sublimation ink in it so Darius under for some cotton shirt they hope you've been catch debt Davis 100% cotton be there be square thank you so I just showed this to another customer you want to buy a truckload give additional free prints for 122 seconds pre-press off five just to get watch out oh three Socrates to touch it right now okay we're just pressing the shirt no attention please so make sure you don't touch James went down wet it looks like it's still wet yeah so you can put it down when it's go away apply it and 95 seconds 25 seconds how many seconds 25 very good seconds we press 25 for the combination to - 13 12 11 and so on so the data paper just looks like yeah so the glitter is also do the same thing look the same way only the works the same way one step and then we cut peel it right away there we go and voila get sublimation ink on shirt yes and then we do a quick quick press hit the two seconds a couple more seconds we recommend up to 30 seconds but actually 10 seconds it's more than enough 10 seconds or so does that does that actually activate the dye more vivid I know it just puts the coating deeper introduce just drop it down anymore yeah I could tell it's a little flattered let's go didn't decide the shirt comes with the shirt or the watcher stretches stretches yeah Jackson stretchered but you won't see any visible cracks afterwards it

T-shirt you are all wearing but it's not enough that everyone is wearing\nthe same thing. They all have to look great. After all, you want to win the game but first\nyou have got to look the part that's where we come in. Avery dark fabric transfers let you create,\ncustomize, and personalize your own designs and then transfer them onto T-shirts, sweat\nshirts, tank tops, bags, and more. The transfer features a unique white layer\nbehind the image so the design doesn't get lost on dark colored cotton polyester blends\nor 100% cotton fabrics. If you need a little design help to make your\ntransfers, try Avery design and print online at avery.com/print. We have got all kinds of predesigned templates\nfor inspiration. Next cut out the design with a very narrow\nmargin around the design keeping the edges rounded to avoid lifting during ironing or\nwashing. Keep in mind that these transfers have a white\nbackground and anything that you don't trim that doesn't have your image on it will appear\nwhite on the final garment. Then find a flat surface that is waist high\nor lower and isn't heat sensitive. We don't recommend using an ironing board,\nglass, granite or any other heat sensitive surface. Place a pillow case down on the surface, empty\nyour iron of water, and set it at the highest cotton temperature with no steam setting. Preheat the iron for 5 minutes then iron the\npillow case to ensure there aren't any wrinkles in it. Then set your garment on the pillow case and\niron it to remove any wrinkles or moisture from the fabric. Avery dark fabric transfers have 2 parts to\nthe transfer, the transfer sheet and the paper backing. Before placing the transfer on the garment\npeel off and remove the paper backing from the transfer. If you have trouble separating the backing\nfrom the transfer, try tearing the edge just slightly to separate the layers then remove\nthe paper backing starting at the tear. Place your transfer with a printed side face\nup exactly where you want it to be located on your garment. Cover the transfer completely using the tissue\npaper provided and then iron the garment using both hands while applying firm downward body\npressure. Iron the garment evenly making sure that the\nentire transfer area is covered. For a full transfer page you should iron for\nabout 2 minutes, for half a page about 1 minute, and for a quarter page about 40 seconds. Once you are done ironing remove the garment\nfrom the heating area and let it cool for 3 minutes then peel away the tissue using\na smooth even motion. To make sure the ink does not bleed or smear\nwash the garment inside out on a cold setting before you wear it, it's just that simple. If you are going to wear it, wear it with\npride and you will when you make it with Avery dark fabric transfers, little things that\nwork in a big way.", "ipRp-wOxOU4": "What's up, guys?\nI'm Rob. Welcome to my channel. Every time I made videos on T-shirt\nprinting you liked it very much.. ..and I always try to bring you\nan easy, simple and new technique.. ..that you can use to\nprint T-shirts at home easily. I feel those techniques\nare pretty easy.. ..yet I have noticed people\nsaying in the comments section.. ..that it would take\nvery long to do this.. ..or that I don't have\nmaterials to make this.. ..or can you tell us of\nan easier technique than this. Guess what.\nI have the world's easiest technique.. ..which I am going to\ntell you and I guarantee you.. ..anybody can print a T-shirt\nat home using this technique. Look, I do so much for you, so, it\nis your duty to do something for me. Do you see a subscribe\nbutton like this one down below? Click on it and\nsubscribe to my channel.. ..if you haven't done so as yet. And if you have done it, don't forget to click\non the bell notification.. ..so that you know every\ntime my new video is out. Also, here are my instagram handles. You can follow me here as well.. ..so you get daily updates.. ..about the things going\non in my daily life or my work. Alright? Shall we begin? Then get ready,\nit's time for some DIY. Why? Because I love it. I am going to show you the easiest\nprinting technique in the world.. ..which we will\ncomplete in three steps. Step one is that you need an image. You can use your phone\nor laptop to choose an image.. ..or you could make an\nimage as I have done over here.. ..using photo editing or by\nusing a jacket design software or app. My image is Happiest in Goa. I made this image as it best\ndescribes my mood of feeling.. ..and I want to wear this on my chest. You can make a print\nof things that you like.. ..or download an image similar to it. The print is here.\nI will simply cut it. All I need is this square design.\nThe size does not matter. You can print any size\nbig or small with this technique. Okay. So, my cutout is ready. Now we can move to step two. In step two we shall\nuse our special material. This is cling wrap or cling film. Basically,\nthis is a thin plastic film or sheet.. ..which we use to wrap foods such\nas sandwiches, salads and fruits.. ..so they remain fresh. We have to use this to\ncompletely wrap our print.. ..that is to say,\nwe have to cover it for printing. So, let's do that. Now I shall take a\nbig piece of cling wrap.. ..place my print on top of\nit and cover it with the cling wrap. Like this. But please ensure\nit does not have any wrinkles. We shall stretch it\nand spread it nicely.. ..and cut off the extra bit.\nJust like this. Make sure there are\nno wrinkles at all. If you see any wrinkles, you\npull it again and remove the wrinkles. Once you have stretched it,\nyou just flip it.. ..and fold it inwards instead\nof cutting it. Just like this. The cling wrap sticks on to it.\nLike that. This way your edges will be clean. I am folding all the\nsides inwards like this. In a way this is similar\nto the lamination technique. I have applied a plastic layer\nor film in front and at the back. When I iron this on to the T-shirt,\nthe plastic will melt.. ..and stick to the T-shirt.\nTo further strengthen this bond.. ..I shall cut some\nmore pieces of cling wrap.. ..and stick it to\nthe back of the print.. ..so that it acts like glue\nand easily stick to the T-shirt. Okay. With this done we\ncan move towards our third step. Let's bring in the T-shirt. Here's our T-shirt.\nThis is a plain black cotton T-shirt.. ..which I have ironed\nproperly so it is wrinkle free. In this case,\nI am using a new T-shirt.. ..but you could recycle\nyour old T-shirt if you wish. I am going to print it in this spot.\nLet's bring in the print. Here's my Happiest in Goa print. Now I shall align it correctly. Once the position is aligned,\nwe will lay butter paper on it. Butter paper is a glossy shiny paper.\nIt is also called wax paper. You can avail of it\nat any stationary store.. ..or places that sell baking tools. Okay. After laying\nthe butter paper on it.. ..I shall iron this with a hot iron. Here's the iron.\nNow we must iron it carefully.. ..so that all the plastic melts and\nour print gets stuck to the T-shirt. The ironing is done.\nNow let's peel off the butter paper.. ..to see if our print is stuck. You must be careful and if possible,\nlet it cool down a little. After that you can peel it off. Okay. I waited for 5 to 10 minutes.\nIt is completely cool now. Now I shall slowly\npeel the butter paper. As you can clearly see, the butter paper is stuck a little.. ..but it is peeling off slowly.. ..and our print is\nstuck well to the T-shirt. There you go. As you can see, our\nprint is stuck nicely to the T-shirt. Look at that. Pretty cool, right? Like I said,\nthe technique is extremely easy.. ..and I was pretty careful. I used similar pressure all\nover on low heat to stick it nicely.. It is slightly untidy at the corners. The cling wrap is\nstill unglued over here. Similarly it is gone\na little crooked over here. You must take a little care.\nThe iron was excessively hot.. ..which caused the\ncolor to fade a little. But it's okay.\nIt has a slightly distressed look.. ..but overall I'm very\nhappy with the print.. ..and it stuck to\nthe T-shirt very easily. With that my T-shirt is ready.\nLet's try it out. You see? Didn't I tell you\nthis is the world's easiest technique? And you can print anything\nyou want on your T-shirt with this. But bear in mind, you cannot\nwash it in the washing machine. It has to be hand washed\nand you must do it gently. It is possible if you use\nextra pressure or brush it hard.. ..the print could peel off. You have no reason to worry though. You can easily fix it. If you apply cling wrap\non the spot which has peeled off.. ..and iron it, it will be reaffixed. It's that easy. I know that many people will\nwrite in the comments section.. ..this will come\noff when it is washed. The color is faded. It won't\nlook good. The finishing is not good. I wish to tell all them. Think about\nit, guys. You made this yourself. It's handmade. It's unique. Quite possibly you will not find the\nprint you made or stuck anywhere else. One of its kind. Maybe the durability or\nthe finishing does not match.. ..the product you buy in the market.. ..which is made using a machine\nin a factory. It is okay, guys. I taught you a technique\nwhich you can use to reaffix.. ..even if it gets spoiled a little\nor you could make it all over again. Not just one design.\nYou can make many kinds of designs. So, it's good to learn\nnew things and try new things. If you just sit there commenting,\nit won't work. Try new things. So,\nI encourage you to try making this. It's super simple. I really hope you guys\nenjoyed watching the video.. ..and found this tutorial helpful. Give me a big like if you value it.\nShare the video with your friends. And if you make it, you must\nclick pictures and share them with me. These are my instagram handles. You can post them to me here\nand tag me. I too will watch them.

Peace.", "x5l_QXPrsKI": "so the first thing you're going to want to do for this DIY is to fill a bucket or a large tote whatever you prefer I use a bucket that was a little too small but next time I will do it better I just haven't had anything else on hand with me so anyways you want to fill it up with some warm water not too hot because this is what's going to be your base and now the next thing you're going to want to add is 1/2 a cup of baking soda and then you're gonna add 1/2 a cup of vinegar if you absolutely hate the smell of vinegar you can add some freshly squeezed lemon juice that works perfectly fine as well I like to add both just because I like the scent of lemon and I don't mind the scent of vinegar but I just prefer to add both in what I do is I mix it around with my hand there's no chemicals so it's not gonna burn you now I do this method only about twice a year usually like two times in the summer because that's the only time I use my white comforter in the winter time I have a heavier tan comforter so this works amazing on white without any chemical so you cannot beat that and yes I kind of struggled a lot with putting the comforter in this bucket but like I said I had to work with what I had I wasn't gonna go run out to the store and buy a giant tote also adding some lemon slices to the bucket because it was just the other half of the lemon so I didn't want it to go to waste I'm also adding some extra vinegar to the top of my blanket since the bucket is so small and yes I am using the other half of the lemon as a little cup I like to do is I like to add it in some direct sunlight because we all know the Sun helps bleach your whites which is kind of weird but it works really well and once when two or five hours passed I just take out the bucket which it kind of struggled a little bit with this it is a little bit of a workout I'm gonna warn you guys but it's so worth it towards the end and it's kind of like a free workout not that bad I just press on it try to get the excess water out of the comforter and then I do bring it to the laundry mat for an extra wash with no soap whatsoever and just put it in there just so it can actually do its job with wringing it out better before putting it in the dryer [Music] like I said I rings it out pretty well because I had to drive to the laundromat to go put it in the washer and I didn't want water all over my car so that's why I rigged it out really well if you guys have a washer and dryer at home consider yourself lucky and then of course I put it in the dryer for 42 minutes always on low and these are the results so you guys are going to get I'm telling you stains come out it comes out super white and I just love the way my bed looks every time I do this there's no smell there's no lemon smell there's no vinegar smell it just whitens it and cleans your comforter it's just amazing DIY and I really hope you guys try it out if you do try this out on your whites let me know on Instagram or even in the comments below if this worked for you as well as it works for me but anyways you guys I will catch you in the next video bye [Music]", "BTD156GXGfw": "a screen printers welcome to another video tutorial in today's video we're gonna be doing printing on performance shirts let's get busy [Music] we're gonna load our shirts here on the platen we're using badger softlock t-shirts these are very soft very silky you know it's a good shirt for baseball season these are moisture wicking and antimicrobial so you know any sports teams out there all of these shirts the color consistency is always you know spot-on and you'll never have a problem of players on the same team you know it's a different color red shirt with badger all the you know the shirts are the exact same color so we've got a poly ink here and we're using a 160 mesh sled that give it a couple strokes here we go spin it on around to the white base for the white base same thing we've got a poly ink and we're using a 160 mesh count the Pollux they do cure to 80 so you know you don't have a problem dye sublimation spin this around here give it a flash probably inks they do flash pretty fast and we've got a little bit of air on our flash unit there that's you know definitely helpful when you're printing on the performance gear the air will keep the shirts from scorching or you know shrinking sometimes with the performance shirts if your leave them under the flash too long they can't have a tendency to shrink so you know if you don't have air or if you just you know really want to sometimes we send our performance shirts through the conveyor before we even print them that way if there isn't it shrinking it happens in the conveyor and not not out here on the press okay there's the high light white that's through a 230 mesh count all the squeegees our triple durometer for the underbase we did convert part of it to half tones that way the the final print is nice and soft you're not laying down a whole bunch of ink got blue here royal blue Pauline let's print it through a 230 mesh count and there you are go ahead and pop this loose send it through the conveyor make sure our inks are fertile fully cured and we don't hit that 300 temperature all right let's move on down to the end and we'll take a look at the shirts make sure that the temperature is you know around 280 right now we're about 289 and that's that's perfect that's you know exactly where we want to be you know like I said once you hit that 300 temperature degrees you know you have a chance of the shirt sublimating and these red shirts the dye and the polyester will turn into gas seep into the white ink turn that white ink pink so you know nobody wants 50 shirts to come back from unhappy customer so just make sure you're using the right inks for the right products you know as I mentioned recent poly inks on the Badger softlocked t-shirt here moisture wicking antimicrobial very soft very silky you know all the sports teams love this shirt so it's a good product to offer your customers you know also have a little bit of sun protection in there so keeps them you know safe out there on the field so hey thanks again for watching the tips of tutorial on poly inks and printing on poly performance garments until next time happy Britton", "HLyFIEzJUxA": "what is up everyone my name is Charlie with char media and today I'm going to be going over the top 4 best blank t-shirts you can use for your clothing line today so let's get to it [Music] alright so coming in at number 4 on my list is a brand called all Sal now when I started my first clothing line I use them first and I can honestly say that they are a great starter brown and what I mean by that is there are there are other brands on my lists that are going to beat them out but the great thing about all style is they're not that expensive and they have several different styles to choose from which is always good when you want to really create a brand that has tons of different shirt colors like if you wanted heather gray Heather black white and all that stuff I know a lot of the brand's you would think would have all these colors but believe it or not some of these brands actually lack color so all style has a great selection to choose from they are great on price I think I remember paying around anywhere from four to six dollars per shirt and the more shirt to buy keep in mind the better the price gets and I I think I typically ordered around 40 shirts so the price wasn't bad even ordering for t-shirts so anyway all styles a great starter brand and that's why they're number four on my list alright guys so third on my list is a brand called Delta now I actually used them right after all styles so I switched from all style to Delta and I can honestly say I really really like Delta I had a great experience with them they even sent me some free sample shirts before I ended up purchasing several different orders from them but they have really good feeling shirts and when you put them on you feel really comfortable which you don't really get from a medium to low range shirt you know like a high range shirt would be American Apparel or something like that so Delta really held up as far as quality goes now the one downside I will say about Delta is they don't fit true to size and that really really ticked me off when I was buying shirts I didn't know that at first cuz the shirt that I bought actually ended up fitting quite nice so I didn't really think that I would need to worry about the sizing or anything like that but um a lot of my customers were saying that they didn't fit true to size so I would have a girl buy a small and she said she needed an extra small now but she normally wore small so anyway I had a lot of complaints about them not fitting true to size so that is one downside to Delta but if you guys can just keep that in mind it's really not a problem you just order a little bit more you just order one size above what you normally order and that's completely okay or just stock every single size and that would fix the problem as well and then let people know on your website that they fit a little small but other than that they fit great the ink really stayed in the shirt really well even after a months of washing the shirt I noticed so that's another good thing and the price isn't bad as well it's around the same as all style and like I said the prices could have changed so you have to check their wholesale account on their website but that was number three on my list and I definitely recommend you guys check and Delta out because like I said they are a brand that I've stuck with for a very very long time alright so coming in at number two on my list is a brand called American Apparel and I'm sure you guys have heard of them because they're very popular but the bad news is they are definitely on the pricier side I've actually bought a few of them and I can tell you right now they're definitely more pricey than all the other shirts I've used for my clothing line but the good news is they are very good quality so that kind of makes up for the more expensive wholesale prices and another thing is they're very popular so people might want to buy your clothing line more because they know that you print on American Apparel because chances are somebody that's buying one of your shirts has already wore a American Apparel shirt so they have that confidence already built up but other than that I think it's a great shirt too if you can get past the price and all that stuff I would definitely recommend going with American Apparel especially if you really want that quality the one downside that I see with them and this is just my preference is the shirts do feel a little thick on and that's just something I'm not a big fan of and they're a little more fitted than I would like them to be but I like my shirts a little bit bigger like I wear a large but I couldn't fit a medium you know so that's just my preference so if you can get past all that I definitely recommend them alright guys so coming in at number one on my list is a brand called Toltecs now this is literally my favorite brand to purchase wholesale blank t-shirts from and the reason why is because they literally have one of the best quality t-shirts I have ever worn in my life and the price is great as well so to me in my opinion this is the goat sure for any clothing line no matter if you're one of the BigDog clothing lines or one of the startups it does not matter this brand is literally the best so definitely Toltecs is number one because I have not only used them before but I've had so many customers tell me that they love the shirt the way it fills and the just the quality of it and everything like that and also the ink stays in the shirt really nice so you don't you know after a few washes the inks not going to look all shitty or anything like that so anyway it is literally one of the best blank t-shirts you can buy and that's why it's number one on my list so that does it for this video guys if you liked what you saw today please consider subscribing if you haven't already and don't forget to hit that thumbs up and also let me know what kind of brands you guys like to print on in the comments section below and I will see you guys in the next one thank you so much for watching", "Hsi_lp0eyRg": "hello I'm cam owner of monument limited we print t-shirts in this screen srinting tutorial I'm going to show you how to print one of these t shirts without using one of these screen printing presses. Here's a list of things you'll need. One exposed screen, covered in a previous video to class 1 12 inch squeeze one roll of screen-printing case one can of spray Jack 100-percent cotton black t-shirts one heat gun one port of place splashes all inc 1 inch spatula one quart of emotion remover in a spray bottle spray nozzle and a 14 x 20 inch three-quarter inch thick for step one take the strength to use the tape to create a damn at all four edges where the mesh meets the screen frames then tape up any pin holes from the bottom perfect to think the screen use a spatula to scooping out of the container and spread it evenly below the image in the screen place your squeegee and the screen and set the screen inside for a light mist spray tachyon to the board and load the t-shirt grab the screen and place it over the shirt use the clamps to secure the screen and board to the tape step 4 time to make the print used to squeeze you to pull inc across the image maintain a solid consistent downward pressure to drive the ink into the shirt below 20 seconds asked to ensure good heat unclamp the screen from the table and lift it from the shirt step 5 carrying wave the heat gun over the image security inc plastisol in needs to hit 320 degrees to achieve a full cure we don't have one here but another alternative is to use your home oven set it to 330 degrees throw that shirt on a cookie sheet and stick it in there for 30 seconds you'll have a perfectly cured shirt ready-to-wear one of the easiest ways to make sure you got a full cure is to do a stretch set of tracks that means that area didn't get cured fully I'm gonna hit it with you one more time step 6 time to clean up great whatever residual energy can out of the screen also placing it back in the container then apply the emulsion remover to both sides of the screen let it sit for three to five minutes and then scour that puppy with scrub pads to loosen the emulsion from the mesh use the water hose and spray the flat side of the screen and so the emulsion is fully washed away now we're going to use the behavior degreaser that we used in our how to make the screen video to prep this thing and get ready for our next coat of emotion thanks for

to another educational video about screen printing by cats fit productions thanks a lot for clicking on my video today I really appreciate your time and attention and if you like what you see please make sure to subscribe to my youtube channel and if you need screen printing equipment or supplies please check out my offerings at cats fit screen print supply.com okay so today's video is about fibrillation okay and I wanted to just kind of talk about this a little bit and maybe demonstrate sort of because I'm not sure that I can really show it on the camera I don't know if I have anything that has fibrillation but what is fibrillation so sometimes you might notice and I think this is probably especially with plastisol inks when people tend to over work or over print the ink on the shirt you know we can see the fibers of the shirt raising up off of the knit surface and you know moving into the ink to where when you're finished curing it and you know printing it and carrying it and you look at it you can actually see the fibers in the ink you know the printed ink and this could be I think it's probably you know more visible on like you know darker shirts where the fabric is dark and you're printing a light-colored garment you know sometimes it can happen with black ink on a white shirt as well where the fibrillation can actually cause the ink to look faded fuzzy you know have a soft look and fur for it for the case of black ink on white shirts it can actually make the black ink look gray okay so fibrillation basically is when the the hairy fibrous you know parts of the knitted surface of your garment get raised off of the knit and become free and loose and able to be up into the ink and it's visible okay so one of the first things that I can tell you is that sometimes it's the garment like if you're printing on a very soft brushed knit that is actually the shirts knitted and then afterwards the fabric or the fabric is knitted and then afterward the you know afterwards the fabric might be brushed to give it a soft feel and that actually is raising some of the fibers off of the of the tight knitted surface you know so sometimes the shirt itself can be a problem with fibrillation and you may even notice it on like test rags shirts that you've had in a test box a box of tucks test rags you know for a long time then shuffling them around you know you go in there looking for a shirt that you can do a test print on and all that action and motion and you know there could be shirts in there a couple of years old you know so when you do test prints on red t-shirts from a box sometimes those shirts can show a lot of fibrillation in the Tusk print simply because the fabric is old or used sort of speak okay and it would be the same case with a washed fabric if you tried to print on a washed fabric you might see fibrillation as well but not only that your ink you know that's a whole nother topic for a video but ink doesn't like the bonds necessarily to wash fabric not not all the time all right so that's the first thing we can say is the shirt or the garment itself you have to look at the tighter than it is the smoother than it is the smoother and finer the knit and print surfaces of the shirt the less likely you are to experience fibrillation but what can you do on press to avoid fibrillation okay so I have my trustworthy cat's bit design and I just have a test rag on here because I'm just going to demonstrate you know a couple things that might cause fibrillation on a garment that might be prone to fibrillation you know because like I said the better the garment is the less likely you know you would have this problem and fibrillation can be seen either you know before you know right when you print the shirt when you lift the screen up or it can happen like after it's washed okay so you know something something to consider but it's not always a problem for everyone but one of the things that can cause it is overworking the plastisol ink on the screen and that's why you'll notice when I screen print I flood off palette I always flood off palette okay I don't even know if the screen is printing I just threw some ink on here and there's some I got something in my ink there it was probably on the screen okay so that's why you notice that I flood off palette because if you flood like this right say I flood like this yeah I don't know if you could guys can see it in the camera but because of the off contact and such as I'm doing this it's actually there you go it's actually you know pulling some ink through you see it that's what off contact is all about so it's actually pulling some ink through and so the more I do this and then I do my print stroke like this what we're actually doing is is causing a little bit of stencil drag in both directions and you know that's moving the fibers on the shirt we're agitating them sort of speak okay so that's something that you don't want to do necessarily some people do that they'll flood on palette but in my opinion this can you know encourage fibrillation so that's why instead of flooding on palette just lift the screen slightly hold it flood with one hand put it down do your print stroke and be done with it okay and that's the other thing is you want to try to get the print off in as few motions as possible so you want to you know not overwork the print don't don't keep setting the screen down and pray it again and again and gun again you know what I'm saying you want to try to learn your groove and know how much to flood it like you might have to flood it the first time you're doing remember you know how I do my putty stroke I push it in a little then I lift it up the second time I do a lot less and I allow the off-contact to pull the ink through right and I want to achieve the print in as few motions or is it few actions as possible and that will also reduce the possibility of fibrillation okay so any kind of motion and you don't want to you know you don't want to do this either oh do a print stroke that way and a print stroke this slide that's the same difference because then you know you're moving the ink and the screen the stencil drag everything is moving in both directions and it's moving much more than if we just flood off palette and then do the print stroke okay so I think that's it really you know fibrillation is is it can be the garment itself and it can be overworking the ink on the screen and finally possibly in some cases it could be the ink if the ink is just so super thin it may not have the opacity or the ability to handle very soft brushed fabrics okay and the other thing that you can do if you see fibrillation on the first print like especially with white on black is you could do a print flash print and usually in most cases the print flash print seals it up really nice because because the fibrillation is active in the first layer like you know you do your first print and blah blah blah blah blah and if you see some fibrillation flash cure it solidify or gel it right and then do another cover print over it and it should cover that fibrillation okay so those are my tips on fibrillation so I was just shooting a video about print resolution and print clarity and I did this really flooded out it's where I overworked the ink on the black shirt white ink on a black shirt and this is as close eye as I can get with the camera but you can see I think you can actually see the black fibers are raised not only does the print look like crap and it's all flooded out but the black fibers are actually raised into the ink the on the printed ink surface so that is what fibrillation is and like I said it can happen you know right away you can see it like this or it can happen after you wash the shirt the fibers can come through the ink like that so just trying to show you an example here because it's hard to do without having like a macroscopic camera capability that's all I have for you today I hope you enjoyed this video please remember to check out cats fit screenprint supply.com if you need screen printing equipment or supplies and make sure you subscribe

a lot of people asking for tutorials on sublimation and so I thought this would be a good chance to show you how to press a sublimation transfer on a t-shirt or tank top or for the most part any fabrics but the t-shirts seem to be kind of the trickier ones and there's a few little tricks that I've learned they make it a little easier so we're gonna start on the computer just to show you some print settings and how to set it up and and then we'll go from there okay so we're starting on the computer and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to open up a new document and show you right from beginning on how to set it up in case this is the very first time you're printing a transfer I use silhouettes to do so there'd be a whole different set of steps if you're wanting to promote different software but basically when you open it chances are it's going to look like this with your mat they're probably not that so you open it up and it's gonna look like this what we want to do is drag in the design so I'm doing a buffalo plaid mama bear tank top and I want the ping file so if it'll load and tell me what that is well I'm thinking this one yeah so the ping files have transparent backgrounds and that's ideal that there's usually JPEGs available too but the white background sometimes can be a different color and you don't even realize it just barely tint in a different color and then it'll it'll print with a different color so the transparent backgrounds are really the ones that you want and they should be a minimum resolution of 300 dpi which is dots per inch and that's the resolution anything less than that I mean 240 is probably okay but less than that you're going to start to see a pretty big reduction in quality but you just drag the design right into silhouette studio and then you want to set it up to print because we're not cut so this when I do these tank tops I've done enough of them that I do them all 11 inches wide so if you come over here to the transform panel and then this little diagonal arrow looking thing it'll let you select on the graphic and then change the size so you hit the little lock aspect ratio and you change the width to 11 inches and then we can want to go back to the page setup I'm gonna turn the cutting mat off I mean it really is a big deal if it's on but it just bugs me and then we're gonna turn the cut border off but show print order is a big deal because you'll it's gonna tell you if it's gonna print like right now if I printed this see the line the this stuff outside that border won't print even if your paper has plenty of space it will not print if it's outside that border so the border is going to tell you if you've got some sort of print settings that are not set up the way that you want now so this is 11 inches wide I need to do it on 13 by 19 sheet of papers so that it does the whole thing because in 8 and a half by 11 there's the print border goes in just a little bit and so I can't actually make it the full 11 and I actually wanted to show you how to print on a scrap anyway so we're gonna set it up for a 13 by 19 I uh 13 by 19 and 8 and 1/2 by 11 sublimation paper that's the only sizes that I buy I just haven't had the need to get anything in between but there's there's lots of different sizes that you can get but set it to 13 by 19 and then we want to fix this border right here so we're not gonna print it yet but go up to file print and make sure you choose your printer so I have the WUF 77 20 and then you go into preferences and I have pre-set saved so I can just come in here and click on 13 by 19 and it'll have everything that I want but I'll walk you through how to do it so I always print out a paper cassette one just because the settings that I use aren't available on paper cassette to the premium presentation mat if I was if I change this to number two I went to the type the premium presentation mat isn't an option so I put it on cassette one I choose the paper size so 13 by 19 I do it portrait but obviously you can change that to whatever you need and then you go to your paper type and go premium presentation paper mat and then go into quality and hit hi and I think that's it for this tab the borderless I don't turn on one it pops up with a warning and says that the quality might not be as good are on the edges but the issue that I've run into is the sizing tends to be off a little bit and I do print and cut sometimes or I do it alongside vinyl and I want to make sure that it's exactly the size that it should be and when I print borderless it seems to stretch it or something so I keep order less turned off so that's why there's this little line here that doesn't go all the way to the edge of the paper and why I'm doing this on a bigger sheets which I can obviously shrink shrink it down a little bit more but I'm just showing you this way anything so second tab this this document size is going to just automatically match what you had on the first tab color correction you want to go into advanced and hit ICM that's like the internal color profile for the printer itself so it's just the default it's gonna let it use the settings that Epson has set for the printer without having any special changes being made by the software so turn on ICM and then down here turn off high-speed and turn on mirror image by turning on mirror image it's going to automatically mirror it for you so you don't have to do it you never have to worry about forgetting to mirror and with sublimation it needs to be mirrored because you put the design face down onto whatever you're putting it on and so if you don't wear it everything will be backwards so highly suggest clicking that and saving a preset so the preset you can come in here at remove presets and once you have everything set on that screen you could just give it a name and hit save I already have some in here but then that just makes life a lot easier for you so thirteen by nineteen Kosmos that's the ink that I use I did have different ink and so I started saving with Cosmo so I know which ink because some of the settings were different with different inks so if you don't use Kosmos ink do some tests Walmart has fabric for a dollar ninety-nine a yard hundred percent polyester I've done hundreds hundreds and hundreds of tests compare and write it down very carefully and figure out what setting works better best for your ink but for the cosmos this was definitely the best for shirts now I changed up a little bit for mugs but fabrics and stuff the premium presentation met so anyway you hit OK when you hit apply but then you hit cancel don't hit print yet so hit cancel and if you look you see that the print border changed that's what you need to look for if you did something wrong in those settings and that print border isn't lining up like this you need to go back and look at them again this is basically the print border is going to tell you if something's messed up and it happens so I highly suggest turning that on so we have the design and I'm just gonna go all the way up see zoom in just inch it up to the edge here and because I'm kind of OCD we're gonna hit the center button so that it just makes placement easier when you're doing the shirt so I'm centering it and there it's good that's how I want it so we're gonna go back to file and print and hit print except I'm going to show you how to set up the printer first then I'll hit print okay now we need to set up the printer to make sure that it's doing what it should in order be printing the right thing with the computer is gonna be sending it so by default the tray is all closed up so you need to since we're doing the bigger sheet of paper pull it out there's a blue tab over here pull the tab and it'll let me extend the whole thing out and you need to have this one pushed back and this one pushed all the way back so you have the full tray size for the 1319 paper if you're using a different size just look at the lines on here and line them up accordingly now I'm not actually gonna put 13 by 19 in here because I am going to print on a scrap because a lot of people have asked me that so we're dual purposing this little this is 13 inches wide but I cut it off I was probably a pillow I have a lot of squares we're gonna pull off the side there's kind of so I'm gonna use a scrap and you just push it all the way up where the paper would be and you make sure your design is up on the top and paper so prints first and then the rest of its blank the printer will just push it out this blank there's nothing that's trying to do there just make sure there's no design that's going to go down beyond where there's no paper and I'm using a sub paper I get it on Amazon it works great and there's a pattern on the back so you want to print on the white side so you put it facedown you should see the pattern then you know you have it loaded right then push it in and you need to tell the printer what size you're loading don't tell them into scrap just put 13 by 19 in here so 13 my 19 is actually called Super Bee or a 3 plus so for paper size you choose that and for paper type you choose premium matte and it's actually working up on my screen and I have it saved as a paper favorite paper setting if you want to save it go into favorite paper settings choose which setting number you want and then you'd hit edit and go in and choose everything and then hit safe but I already have mine all sorts I'm not going to do that but I choose super be premium Matt okay use and they'll pull those settings in and you get close and you're good to go hold this out because otherwise it goes flying across the room I have my printer up on a big tall dresser it's the only place I have room for this giant printer but pull this out and then it'll catch it for you there's a little on the lid that comes with these I took them off the first day I started printing it's it's not necessary and it was just driving me nuts having to take a lid and put it back off so I keep the lid off all that out go over to either printer and hit print okay so the transfers printed what I like to do now I know I censored it on the page so I'm not really gonna worry about the left and right side but just to show you guys I usually cut it out as close to the design as possible so it's easier to line up on the shirt and I mean you can kind of see through the paper a little bit but sometimes it's just a little bit tricky so just for helping replacement I'm gonna cut off the extra on the bottom just so it doesn't kind of mess with my linemen so what I usually try to do is see the space that I have over here and match it over here with whatever is the lowest part so something like that and I just cut it I try not to put my ruler over that so I don't scratch the transfer itself and like I said I centered it in the software so I'm not gonna worry about trimming the right in the left but if it wasn't centered I would trim both sides too okay so one more thing you wanted to mention real quick make sure that you lint roller your shirt really well there's lint that gets on it in the factory or shipping or whatever and you can't even see it but it will show up blue when you press it and it's bad so lint brush lint roller to the front roll over the back go through a few sheets if you have to just to be extra careful that you don't get any of those little blue flecks on there and one more thing I just thought about the butt transfers I cut mine in squares like I showed you if you still have issues with the square of the paper showing up on the shirt you can try tearing the design out and it gives you kind of more of a feathered line that's a lot less noticeable on a shirt I haven't had to do that honestly I don't like doing that because I feel like I can't get it lined up as well and I got my pressure settings I'm Torri I don't have that problem but if you still have that problem try the tearing out thing that seems to work really well for people as far as the alignment I've heard some people will take a ruler or square and put like a plus sign or a big T on the back of the transfer really lightly in pencil so when you tear it you at least know how to get it level of where the center is but again I don't have to do that the foam kind of solve the problem for me but if you still have that issue that's just an idea if we're gonna try okay so now we can move on to the actual shirt process I do all my shirts and fabrics for the most part 400 degrees for 60 seconds I highly suggest checking the temperature of your press this beast for example is like 25 degrees too hot so I have all these little notes written on a piece of paper on the wall to get it to 400 days I have to set it to 377 so don't be confused by that you need it to be 400 degrees but little infrared thermometer works great make sure your platen is bare if you have tough long on the top it won't I won't read it correctly and you just aim it and press the button so it says 396 $3.99 so it just kind of depends this one is so big and it honestly it's a China piece of crap but it gets the job done but depending on where you shoot the thermometer on the Platinum the temperature is going to be a little bit different here and there but this one it was 399 right in the middle so we're gonna go with that now I use foam for all my shirts I have a couple different sizes I have a whole stack of them I just cut them with scissors I got this on Amazon I think I've heard Joanne's I mean really any craft store should have some foam but the foam gives it a nice soft backing so that you can get even pressure without having to do super high pressure and it helps allow for seams and stuff like that now even with paper underneath I have I've stained all of them just the ink that bleeds through some some things are worse than others this is from black sequin pillow and I had a sheet of butcher paper underneath and it still did that so now I always make sure that I kind of press it for a little bit to try to get as much ink off of it as I can and then I always put paper underneath if for no other reason than to protect what you're pressing so for this this little foam pad is big enough to cover the whole design so I'm going to use the smaller one because then I can leave the the seems to be off of the pad and then the shirt doesn't get quite so smashed sometimes you can see the back part of the tank top pressed into the front part of the tank top and so the smaller one works better but I just wanted to show you I have a full-size one sequined pillows I do on this this full one regular pillowcases waffle weave towels pretty much everything else goes on this bigger one and I never adjust the pressure on this press and they never changed the temperature I have another heat press that is a swing-away it's a lot easier to tweak the pressure on it this one is just a little bit I mean I had to add washers to the front part so that it would allow room and still be level with a foam pad so long story short I would recommend getting a nice he press but this works it's a sixteen by twenty four and I wanted the biggest one that I can afford and this is what it was but anyway so I'm going to take this one off it never press without this because this is pretty much those presses all just I use fabrics and so I always use with the foam pads so what you want to do first is get some butcher paper to go on the bottom I'm sorry you've seen my back but this is a big giant roll but your paper that I got from Sam's Club it's like I think I was like twenty bucks a piece that's big enough to cover the whole bottom platen and you can reuse this I got ink on the last one so I threw it away but I'm gonna pull this forward a little bit just so the top tank top strap can drop back there past the phone and put the phone down cover the top to protect the shirt itself so I have to then weigh the very first thing I do is I pre-press the shirt it gets out any initial moisture so I'm gonna take the tank top try not to burn your knuckles I really do like my swing away if you can afford a really big spoon or I get a swing away but this works so I'm just pushing this down so my seams I know you can't see this but right here is the edge of the foam so these seams from the tank top or not above it so they're not going to get smashed by the press nobody take butcher paper I put it over it and they just press it for a second whoa not a second but a few seconds then I pull it out and set it aside and I spray spray adhesive on the transfer now if there's I'm a little bit of a learning curve with this so I'm gonna show you how to do it this is my super high tech adhesive spring box I just use it over and over again I put it like this on the bottom and so what I'm not using it I just fold it back up and tuck at the bar get my kids labeled it sticky box so anyway put the transfer inside the box and this is the spray adhesive that I have found it works the best please for me I know that Conde sells a spray but their shipping was outrageous this was like 20 bucks at Michaels but you can use to 40% off coupon code so it makes it a little bit more reasonable but the trick is one use the box then you could be a little bit more flowy with it not worry about making a mess not to be as careful but there's a little black mark on the lid make sure it's aimed that way and it will get gummy after every time you use it so I take an alcohol swab which I keep a bunch of them on my windowsill here and clean that tip so that it sprays a nice fine mist if you don't clean that tip you don't have it aimed right it'll start to kind of drip and those drips will wreck your transfer so you can actually see it and know before you press it if you wrecked it and I've done it and I didn't clean it because there was only ten minutes since I sprayed the last one and it messed up so I am clean the tip I have the transfer inside the box I usually will shake it up I usually do a little test spray just on the side to make sure I'm getting a nice good mist and then you just kind of make a cloud inside see you could see the fog I probably should have the window open but the kids are outside playing being loud and so it's like a hundred degrees in here but that's all I do for spring so you pull it out and look at it if there's drips on the design those drips will show up when you press it so look at it and make sure that everything looks like it's got a nice fine mist before you waste a shirt cuz it happens I've done it just something to keep in mind so I'm moving the sticky box and not sure how well you can see this here okay so we're going back to the shirt so we pre pressed it it's sitting here looking all pretty quick thing about sizing I have yet to find some cheat sheet size chart that just tells you what size to make the transfer I measure every single one and just kind of get an idea so I thermometer over here I look at thermometer ruler I look at my ruler I might do this 11 inches I've already done this for I'm showing you I lay down on the shirt and I see where 11 inches would hit and no it's you know probably five inches tall and just kind of eyeball it and that's how I decide what size to make it but then I save it so I don't have to think that through every time I do a shirt so um there's a hair anyway so take your nice sticky adhesive transfer and I'm so I'm I'm big on eyeballing if you want to fold the shirt in half to get like a center line and put a careful crease whatever rulers t-squares there's all kinds of tricks but I just eyeball it and another reason why it's kind of nice to keep the extra edges on there's less gap on the side so it's a little bit easier to line up but I usually go a couple inches down from the neck of the shirt and I look up here these corners so it looks even and then I look at it from top to bottom okay I really don't like picking that up once I put it down but the shirts actually going to my sister-in-law and I don't want to mess it up so okay that looks good too so here's here's the really important parts that'll keep you from messing up a shirt you got to put paper inside the shirt on top of the shirt and under the shirt because it could depending on the design the ink can bleed through the shirt onto the back and I actually like to try to save these big pieces so I put paper underneath it as well so the paint doesn't give on this big sheet I have a stack of legal paper and regular letter size copy paper and that's what I use oh we're gonna cuz it's cheap and it's easy and I don't have to cut it so I take my legal paper and I put one on the press where the design is going to be I've kind of move it around as I need to I put one inside the shirt so this is another reason why I really like the spray adhesive is it'll stay put while you kind of mess around with it and you can line it up on the table and move it to the press when you're done it just it stays where you needed to there is adhesive tape high heat tape but I this big press creates like a suction every time I open it and even with the tape I couldn't get it to not move a little bit and once I got the spray adhesive down I'm sold okay so I can actually feel the paper through the shirt and we can pick it up and sometimes see it a little bit better but you just want to make sure that the paper is covering up so you don't send it through to the back cuz I've done that and then I get it as flat as I can and I grab you could feel the paper on the inside and the paper on top I just grab both and I pick it up and they move it over here to the press which I hate this part constantly fumbling the only for that foam again trying to get this stuff not getting smushed but make sure that the foam is underneath your whole design because otherwise it won't press you need to have good good contact okay then legal paper over the top so it saves this big giant piece of paper I just don't want to waste any more paper than have to cover the whole thing now remember 400 degrees 60 seconds but depending on your shirt you might want to you know you might have to adjust that a little bit but I've done the shirt I did this exact one yesterday so I know that this works so cover the whole thing the paper just kind of helps protect the shirt a little bit if you have a really shiny polyester shirt you could put two or three sheets of butcher paper on there it can help it a little bit but this press has a timer built in on it you just close it and starts counting but one last thing before I put it down I have a lint roller handy and you'll see why okay so now we're going to press it okay lift it slowly because it's it's gonna want to try to suck your paper up and make a big mess pull off and don't panic here you're not in a hurry do this carefully it's okay if it sits on here for a second even if you wanted to let it cool you don't have to like being a panic to rip it off so I'm gonna pull this off recycle bin the recycle bin gets filled up like every day okay so peeling this is important now I know we have spray adhesive but if for some reason you don't get enough on there or whatever it can still shift so just be careful in every step of the way when doing shirts I put my hand now it's hot but it's not - I actually my fingernails I can use my fingernail so I don't burn my fingers but I hold it a little bit in place while I grabbed the corner with my finger and then I peel it it just makes sure it doesn't shift while you're doing it um right when you get it out and pull it off I pull the paper out now I should have done this faster but again this is a really forgiving shirt some shirts are not as forgiving but while it's hot lint roller the crap out of it so this one like I said I've got the pressure down really good in this shirt stupid boy this shirt is is really forgiving that's why I like doing these ones so much but white especially it just seems to be harder but if you lit roller it really well and I'll do a video on towels that's where you see the biggest difference of towels but it helps lift up those fibers while it's hot so that they're not so melted down and then shake it out really good and that helps to but really this shirt this one is so easy this is a thread fast Apparel blizzard tank this is silver and down here is white blizzard they're my favorite super easy to do but anyway Oh turn this press off that's it and look at how good those colors look so I've done tests on all the the paper settings and stuff and the premium presentation Matt rocks now of the Kosmos ink rocks - so that helps I used to use a different brand and I won't name it because there's some people who love it but the blacks were kind of blue and the colors were just kind of randomly off some would be awesome and some wouldn't be so awesome so anyway um that's it beginning to end on how to sublimate a t-shirt just don't rush through it and practice but there's just a lot of little steps and I've I've wrecked all of them missed paper underneath missed part of the platen and so the design was cut off that's why I went for a really big press because it makes life easier in that aspect but but that's it and it's right than the fibers of the shirt it's smooth you know it just works awesome this was actually an SVG file and I went through and made some versions with buffalo plaid and I got like a grunge one or something and I can get links to all of those feel free to ask I can get you links for the tank tops the paper the ink any of it so let me know if you have any questions and hopefully you this helps some of you thanks [Music] you", "WBconpSAfDA": "[Music] hello I'm Doug DeWitt transfer paper product manager here at Conde Systems welcoming you to another tutorial video in our series on forever paper products and to help me with this video flying all the way in from Germany is my friend and colleague Christopher segment with forever paper Chris thank you so much for coming in today it's always paid to be here duck thank you the reason I have Chris coming in today is because I explained to Chris that while the forever products that we carry the forever flex off no cut which is your self weeding vinyl compatible with any laser printer correct and then we also have the forever low-temp laser tart which is primarily made for the okie white toner printers we've got a lot of clients out there that are very successful with these products however with any self weeding product there is a little bit of a learning curve involved and we know many of you out there in Conda TV or eager to get in to this white toner technology so I brought Chris in today so he can go over his best tips and tricks working with Fleck soft material and low temp material so that you can basically ramp up your education time so to speak learning how to use these products quickly and you could reduce those wasted shirts too bad attempts so now that Chris is here I'm just gonna let kind of Chris take over from here Chris what do you have on tap with us today so for today we have a little bit of text tips and tricks some little tweaks it will make you successful make a huge different it's often just a little tiny corner that you have to lift up a little tiny little triangle it you have to peel the paper from off the t-shirt it makes a huge huge difference and the final result so to show you this let's go move over to the heat press yeah let's go up on the heat press will show you how this is done so doc the first thing that you want to take care of is that you pre the lower platen when it's ice-cold the first thing you start in the morning just take your heat press give it a short press when it's empty for about 30 seconds up to a minute so make sure you pre-heat the bottom platen exactly you can test it while touching the a lower the lower metal when it's warm luke 1 it's fine lift it up and it's ready to go especially with 50 lays that da glow Tom you have a clear film so you can't see which sides the right size to face up especially when you don't have any text but this could be the right side facing up or this to make sure you have two right there facing up take a corner and scratch the paper when you can scratch it if the side that you've printed on next thing you want to do is put it B paper on top tier mulch is firm put that on top just make sure that you cover the complete design we just cover this up with a little bit of Teflon parchment paper copy paper just to protect the heat press and we're ready to roll so we're pressing just now get 300 degrees for the forever low temp and a 275 for the fire reflect soft for 90 seconds what's happening now is the adhesive gets Morton gets liquid and built up connect to the toner we open the heat press in about 90 seconds and I'll show you a perfect way to peel the paper four three two one so we made 90 seconds we lift up the heat button and move it to a site so now we have full access to a plant that's why I love swing-away heat presses because the full access an easy way to work we've put away the protective paper the best way to peel it is pull towards you not away from you I'll show you later on why we're doing this also take one corner and lift that corner up hold it in your hand don't pull it down otherwise you burn your fingers you have a fair amount of time but make sure that you peel it while it's warm peel it in a flat angle just like this don't stop keep the same angle all the time and at the very end when the image ends you slow down just a little bit we slow down because here we tend to go more vertical up instead of horizontal and we don't want to lose a little image there we go perfectly done we can see if it was we don't have any speckles on albey people we have a clean transfer and the back set is kind of to avoid immolation sheet that gives us much more vibrant color so this is ready to transfer so Chris now that you showed us how to use successfully peel show us some of the common mistakes that beginners do whenever working with low temp laser dark absolutely we are I prefer to open the press so let me show you this when we open the heat press the lower platen and the paper is pretty warm so most common mistakes you take the paper and push it down so you burn your finger so when you burn your finger you don't have to patience to peel it slowly you peel it in a rush when you peel it in a rush you micro small details also you tend to lift it up because you are in a rush when you peel away from you you start to peel it more vertically up and you might lose diddle-diddle-dit eyes over here or it gets too cold like we've seen over there so what can happen is especially when you peel it in a rush you lose small details like dots and small lines when you lift it up especially the very end when the paper has a chance to cool the adhesive the emulsion get to coat solidifies and it rips of the print so these are the most common mistakes so that's why we always need to let the a film rest against that hot bottom ply exactly so we don't nip the corners like we did at the top of that skull exactly sometimes it's work bad like this sometimes a little bit less you just have a little nip but every time you have a nip eve appear to cold your it up for the platen or you appeared too fast at the very end so take your time lift it up at the corner so you don't burn your fingers you have a little bit more time to peel it off those are some good tips hey Chris I noticed she got a white only graphic there with the forever low temp laser dark we have a lot of clients in the beginning that struggled with applying white only graphics so cover your best tips to get a white only graphic onto a dark garment absolutely doc sewed on a white only graphic we have only white white una it's very special it's very unique has a different chemical composition so their little tricks when you have white only graphic the first one is as usual make sure the right sides facing up scratching the corner see that the printed side is facing up putting the B paper emulsion sheet on top as they're used to cover it up with some parchment Teflon or copy paper whatever you have at hand close the press and heat it up get important increase the pressure a little bit so you increase your pressure one revolution to run rebel overturn compared to a colorful graphic because white has a different density and the different density means that the B paper has a harder time to attach to it and build a connection to you to the artwork so we open the heat press put it aside as usual put away the protective paper remember peel towards you and lift up the corner so you don't put your fingers and put it in a flat angle slow and fluid movement the difficult to in white is that it's quite hard to detect if you have successful transfer or not just by looking at the a foil because the adhesive is white and the Torah is white as well a good way to detect a favorite successful transfer is looking at the B paper in emulsion sheet so if you have any leftover emulsion on that B XI then you're probably gonna have a drop out when you try to apply your design absolutely let me show you it close up here we have to transfer two times the March it used on your left hand side you would see that he be paper the moistu it came out smoothly we look here on the right hand side we can see some speckles in there that's an indicator that the adhesive the demotion didn't transfer properly to the white toner you can barely see it at a printer itself because the motion and the tone are white so don't have any contrast but you can see it on these papers okay see the difference duck I see the difference so basically increase the pressure when we're dealing with a white only graphic increase the pressure exactly then you force more reaction more chemical reaction in between the multitude and the toner another thing that you can do is increase the white toner on the printer panel just plus one did you usually print out more white toner so we have a higher chemical reaction if you're using the forever transfer rep what percentage of white channel control do you recommend using when it's pure white graphic minimum 100 by 10 150 you can't increase the amount of light in transcript only to a certain level to the maximum output that the printer is programmed to but you can't change it on the printer panel itself okay so while using a little bit more white toner is helpful mainly it's a pressure issue when we're mirroring the a foil and B she exactly so in creating up to pressure from A to B helps a lot when you have this issue on deep he transpeople already you can't save it anymore so make sure that you the pressure is right when you put my transfer from A to B so the main thing is make sure you study the B sheet after you peel to double-check and make sure you got a clean release of the emulsion absolutely that's a good point so Chris this was our design with the supposed bad we'd attempt show us what happens when we have a bad weed with a white only graphic pleasure so what you feel is that just more resistance when you beat it off and some paths especially where there's no cheese up on the back side of the paper will just stay on the a film especially on her face over here you can see the deep a paint deep white toner sticks to the white foil because there's no adhesive on the back side to back it up so it has no connection to paper this what happens and you said most of these issues whenever we have a bad attempt with a white only design it relates to pressure when we're weeding it relates the pressure when we're weeding exactly let me show you a good attempt so here we can see the drift clean edges we don't have this four drop hotspots in her face in her body let me just show the other side here we have to drop out especially here in the face on on the left hand side well here everything is nice and clean so dis is just overdid bit more pressure during the process from A to B and as far as that pressure setting if you're getting good weeding attempts with a color and white design but you're doing a white only graphic we're saying increase the pressure by one revolution revolution fraternity refine if you have an air operated heat press would you say we're bumping the pressure up by an extra 10 to 20 psi absolutely lovely so Chris cover some other tips and tricks that beginners need to know when working with forever low temp so talk very important is that you have to clean the edges when you look closer to the edges to see sometimes white line from the emulsion sheet when it gets out it leaves a little white line so good practice is also when you don't see the lines just trim the edges if a good sharp scissor just go roughly around it so you don't have to cut all the way to the graphic no no just it's actually better to leave some extra space it uses the peeling technique which is repeated process afterwards gotcha just like this let's say you put a little bit of this white adhesive on your garment there's a way to remove it let me show this so here we have two t-shirt after a press after we applied heat transfer onto the garment very important here peel it cold doesn't matter if you peel it absolutely echoed after five minutes or cold after five days there's no penalty in it sit there for too long just make sure it's nice and cold when you peel it peel it towards you then away from you when you peer towards you you have nice flat angle make sure that you roll it off can you hear that it's just slightly crackling so it likes the peel when you peel it horizontally up the correctly noise becomes much louder let me show this this is a side of the paper screaming it doesn't like it so you might do some small details or Beck nice move it's much less resistant much easier to peel there we go this would be the perfect peel let me show you one more thing we attached here a little white line down here there before got to cut so just take this one you off no you might think oh no I ruined the shirt there's a way to get this white line off let me show this you basically take regular heat tape sublimation tape apply it onto it fold it here a little bit so you can grab it on later on and what this here it's very shiny very glossy needs as repressed to get a much finish in this softer finish we just press this together Wilfred so here we see our t-shirt right before the finishing press we have different options for our finished press e for a matte finish we have a parchment paper or baking paper or a more velocity finish with a glossy finish paper a silicone paper or a Teflon sheet in this case we're going to decide for a matte finish we're going to use the parchment and we probably remember this heat resistant tape over here to get rid of the border line while we repressing it and do the finishing press we just press it together Wilfred we've just covered about a 5 to 10 seconds finishing press this drives a bit deeper in into the garment gives it a much softer touch takes off the shine of the of the print and increase the possibility traumatically but we want to do a finishing press with every transfer absolutely with every transfer so I'm going to take this off we can see the shine is mostly gun now as long as this tape is hot we just take off the white border that is cool and we have finished our shirt nice and soft and very important to repress it to increase the washability so duck here's another tip when you true when you apply to the garment and you trim your edges don't trim too close to the design the reason is we need some space to roll it off the more space we have the easier it becomes to roll off the paper so you can even transfer this little details over here so if we don't leave enough space some of the design may stay to the film restated affirms you can repress it but it's much easier when you give it a little bit extra space like here goes at the very end especially at the end over here the papers tends to tends to flip then you might lose a little dot or a little edge so basically the production process is almost the same for laser tag as a flag soft when we peel in a flat angle with laser dark with low term we also put in a flat angle for flag soft just like this flat angle try to have as little noise as possible what you can do when you have hard corners like pointy etches Duty corners first like over here so we avoid losing deeds when you have us too tight angle start rolling it back keep it tight to the shirt more like a rolling technique and slow down when you have tight edges and that's all you need to know for flag soft otherwise exactly the same process so as you probably know you can transfer lace a dark low trim as well as flex off no cut on the different kind of materials may it be felt maybe paper and cardstock like over here maybe letter as you probably know also cotton but you can also transfer it onto dark poly garments make sure that you check the garment party first even in the table over here or sometimes it's hidden in the inside over here this case if 100% polyester garment while we're pressing cotton with about 320 degrees with low temp we press polyester just with 270 let me show you what happens when you press it too hot I set up the heat press to 320 degrees and a frosty wears 1/2 down to the shirt so you can see what happens so I pressed Bo now both sides of different temperatures under the same polyester garment over here but you can see here on our left hand side is 320 degrees which is actually for cotton shirts on the left hand side 270 degrees both times 30 seconds press we can see that our colors are much more vibrant for lower temperature then we've reached 320 degrees so what's happening over here is impalas the garments they often dyed with so called sublimation dyes when sublimation dies could heal up a certain point they gassed out and these gases will microd into our print color so especially our late colors like our white and our our yellows will somehow fate because the sublimation dyes immigrates into our light colors well Chris thank you so much for coming in today and showing us these tips and tricks with the forever low temp in the forever flex off material even I myself learned a few things that I might have been doing wrong that's gonna save me from making a lot of mistakes in the future yeah what the flesh between here this time so what we want to do now is quickly review the tips and tricks that we feel you need to take away from this video first tip and trick that I would say is make sure you pre-heat your bottom platen correct how long should we go how about 30 seconds sometimes 60 seconds if you heat presses heats up slowly but certain seconds fine for most presses so make sure you pre-heat your platen and when you are peeling your B sheet from your a foil we want to go low and slow rolling the B sheet off the a foil correct absolutely and it's better to do it top to bottom grow to watts you do you always have a flat angle now another tip you need to know is when you're working with a white only graphic in the forever low temp lace or dark increase the pressure on your platen from where you would normally have it set working with the color and white design correct absolutely usually on a few nights he prefers like a weighted DK 20s one full rotation is absolutely fine yeah if you have an air operated press go up about 10 or 15 psi and try that now when we remove the B sheet from the a foil we want to trim that a foil correct absolutely because otherwise can see this white attention lines on every corner okay and if we do get one of those intention lines you showed us a nice tip of removing it with the heat tape yes I hope people like that one you can do a removal step the same procedure as to do the finishing step that additional work now another thing that you need to remember is be mindful of the application temperature depending on the material content of the garment you're going to use a different temperature when you're going to 100% cotton then you are a hundred percent polyester absolutely we have a temperature range of 210 degrees Fahrenheit up to swing of 24 different materials the example of polyester we have a range of 250 to 270 for cotton about 300 320 so we might fall and check the labels on the garments and remember always check your instructions before applying a design remember to check with your account manager or go to kondeh comm for the latest instructions not only on the forever flex soft but on the low templates are dark and are finally our last tip is we always want to do a finishing press no matter the product correct absolutely this improves the feel so much it makes itself makes it look more valuable and improve the possibilities quickly so I hope this video will help you be more successful when using forever paper products but should you have any question about the procedures that we covered in this video don't hesitate to contact our tech support department direct at 1-888-201-1014 that video is going to be called I see split a brand new software product that comes from forever paper so make sure to tune in the conde TV to learn all about it so until then I'm Doug DeWitt I'm Christopher a sigma and our time is up we thank you for yours you [Music]", "nEfcUbDoTDE": "[Music] [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] tough [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "-_3u55y3gm0": "[Music] hi guys it's crystal welcome back to my channel today I want to show you the updated version of the Cricut easy Press reference guide so I figured I would show you using the two different heat settings so what you're gonna do now you can see that they have where you can click on easy press two or the first easy for us how amazing is that so you just click one or the other we're gonna click the easy press two then for your materials you're gonna see there is so much more so they have added tons of different products so now you can see the mesh is on there the fusible ink pens and the transfer sheets are now there we're gonna choose the everyday iron on light hit done and then for the material that you're gonna put it on there's so much more now so look at this I mean there's just everything is on here they even have the stuff once again for the infusible we're gonna choose 100% continent and hit done so now we're going to choose the easy press nuts or you can choose town and we're going to hit apply and now look at this it shows in more detail what you need to do so it says 315 for 30 seconds you can change it from Fahrenheit to Celsius just by clicking the button we're gonna use Fahrenheit and then on this next image here now what it's also going to tell you light pressure and keep warm peel right away at the top then on the next picture is going to show you how to layer it it's gonna tell you what supplies you need Preparation how to prepare your item the application is going to tell you how to apply it the heat all of that information and then it's going to tell you the care so allow it to sit for 24 hours before you wash it I highly recommend that you do that that really does help it says you do not bleach etc so that's how you use them you guide I'm really excited about it so we're going to go ahead and set our machine at 315 for 30 seconds okay so now I know about where I want my image to be I'm gonna remove everything and go ahead and preheat my shirt for five seconds I'm going to use my three by eighteen ruler get that even on there then I can go by the center which is the nine inch mark I can come down and work my way from left to right and that's gonna be perfectly centered I absolutely love this really for this all right I'm gonna pull off all the other layers and start going so I'm gonna do about half the time just to get this temporary tacked down and I'll just keep going adding layer by layer now I'm going to use a Teflon sheet in between just to protect my other pieces of iron on and just keep going [Music] [Music] now that we have all of our other iron on we're gonna switch tick litter so I'll just come back into the settings I'm going to choose glitter it gives us 334 30 seconds I'm going to adjust my ez press and start layering on my winter [Music] I'm gonna flip the shirt over and I'm going to go ahead and do an extra 15 seconds so it's gonna ensure that it lasts and there you have it super cute", "3qQ_oLd9tSA": "[Music] hi guys it's crystal welcome back to my channel you guys see my video the other day where I used bleach with sublimation on a colored t-shirt you already knew I was gonna try it out with the infusible ink Cricut has designed this new product which is cricket and fusible ink it's very similar to the way that sublimation works except for you don't have to have that really big printer you just got to buy the these transfer sheets that are around $12.99 awesome Cricut infusible Inc I use today was this right here so this is Shaylee and I use the black and this color right here so I've designed this out with Cricut design space so I will sure that file down below it's completely free if you're an Access member these were files that were already in Cricut and I sliced sunflower in half and then this little quote here was already there and I kind of shrunk it up a little bit that way they went next to each other now their shirt that we're using today is color and it's going to be the same that I used on the other ones it's the Gildan soft style i'll have them linked down below gilding soft style and they are 65% poly and 35% cotton so you really want a high poly count when it comes to this these shirts have worked out really well with sublimation so we're gonna try it today with the infeasible ink so let's go and get started so we're gonna use the big 12 by 10 Cricut ez press - today it's at 350 for 60 seconds attempt down a little bit because when you're working with cotton you can scorch it so that's why we're doing the 350 for 60 seconds so let's go ahead and prep our area so I've already got these weeded out and they're mirrored and really ready to go we need our big mat down here on the bottom just get this back a little bit so we need our big mat down on the bottom you're gonna need a piece of parchment paper down on the bottom by this end a really big roll from heat press nation so I'll have it linked down below but if you purchase the box Cricut does um they do supply pieces of butcher paper so it like this one right here is a four count it comes with four sheets one two three four it comes with four sheets of the butcher paper so it does come with all four sheets if it's a box or two it's gonna come a tip you're gonna need one of those I've already got one on the bottom this is gonna protect our match we need a piece of white cardstock to go inside our t-shirts I'm gonna go and get that going now this is going to protect the backside just in case any ink goes you're going to slide this in and we're gonna scoot this up in just a second so you want to take your lint roller you do not want to skip this step and you want to lint roll the front of your t-shirt I go ahead and just cover the entire thing because you definitely want to get bigger than an area then your heat press so you want to go do that now thing we want to repress our shirt so you want to put down your butcher paper first this is gonna protect your shirts I'm gonna press my temps not all the way up there but I'm gonna go ahead and pre press at this point alright so now that we've got that I'm gonna move this you want to let your shirt completely cool back down because if you try to put your design on here now you have a chance of the ink coming out and certain to work with the heat and you may mess that up and have an image where you don't want it alright so once again I've talked about using the Cricut ruler it is the 3 by 18 and I do it in this direction cuz it has these lines here the 9 inch mark is the middle it perfectly comes three inches down I get it right here at the top I just get it even I can check my armpit here and see the lines making sure those are even and then I'm just working from this area here so at this point I'm gonna go ahead and lay these down and they're gonna go right next to each other today we're gonna use some heat resistant tape because these kind of want to move a little bit I'm gonna go ahead and get them tape down so now I've got that moved up where we can see what we're doing we're gonna quickly go through here my camera is gonna die so I'm trying to work quick alright so I want to work and see where I'm at all right so say that looks good to me I'm gonna go ahead and take these down stay still I may move my ruler I'm gonna cover this up with my butcher paper I want to make sure this is on the mat so everything's on the mat it's covered with my butcher paper and now we're going to press 350 for 60 seconds light pressure just making sure everything's covered and hit go all right we're gonna slowly with it I slowly move our butcher paper and this is a warm pill so I'm gonna let it set for just a second so I'm gonna go ahead and lift it up at this point just like that all right super cute so you could leave it on the shirt just like this I think it looks really cute you can still see it enough now this may fade out just a tiny bit in the wash you've seen the results on the other one and maybe of my new because of the 35% cotton that it's not gonna cling to but a majority of this is gonna stay but let's try the bleach effect I love this oh I'll probably remake this shirt I definitely want to try to repress infusible ink I haven't tried that like I've done with a sublimation so I'm going to set this aside and we're going to try to repress this again later actually we're gonna go ahead and do that now we're gonna leave this one like this so we can wash it by itself without the bleach so let's go ahead and do it one more time but let's this one we're going to bleach [Music] it says but your paper I've always said parchment paper they're basically probably nothing the same but I I call them so if you hear me say parchment paper it's butcher paper alright we're gonna go ahead and pull it up at this point alright so you can see how light the flour came in I think the black did really well and it's definitely lighter let me bring in the shirt so this is the first one right here - lot darker than this side so I don't really recommend I mean if you want like a vintage worn out look it's gonna be fine but I wouldn't recommend it cuz look at the bright colors the first time let me switch it real quick hold on alright you guys can see this alright this is the first press this is the second press so I really don't recommend it I don't think it worked out very great that way so really just do the one press unless you like this worn down effect so what we're gonna do now it does work on colored t-shirts and I'm gonna wash both of these so we can see how well it'll hold up in the wash let's go ahead and take this outside and bleach this one and kind of see how that effects gonna look and then like I said I'll throw these in the wash and we'll come back and talk about the final results here we are with the Cricut in fusible ink t-shirt so this is going to be the same thing as like the sublimation t-shirts with bleach except for this is the Cricut infeasible ink now this is the second time we press this one the other one we're just gonna leave on the colored t-shirt and wash it as normal but this one we're gonna bleach and give it a worn out effect and see how it looks alright so first thing you want to do refer back to my first video if you need to is basically gonna be the same situation but you want to make sure this is gonna be super flat now if you want some really cool effects you could take and kind of wrinkle them up here here and there you can get some really cool effects okay so but all we're going to be doing is I'm gonna be creating this vintage looks I'm gonna be spraying here kind of creating some sweaters here and there so I'll first start with my splatters and all you need to do is unscrew your cap and you're gonna get like these blobs so watch this so you see how I get like a blob like that I'm gonna get more of a little spots like that now do not put a bag underneath but if you've heard of my first video you can put a bag in between this so that way you don't get nothing on the back but I don't and you'll see how the back looks whenever we get done now to kind of get like some little spritz ins I kind of do this and shake you see and I'm getting some look like that so I'm just kind of getting that look stuff going on first trying to get some splatters that they're on my sleeves so kind of got some spiders so this is what I have so far see how fast to search the bleach it's a really cool once again this is 6535 so you see those really cool spots like that so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to kind of work from here kind of splattering out a little bit so with it kind of twisted in it's more of a mist so I'm just gonna kind of lightly mist going around so you can do as much or as little as you want to to get different effects and you can kind of start slower and that's going to do with this one and then add more as I want to so it's gonna be like a more faded out look so I'm kind of lightly you can see how light I'm kind of spraying that all right so let's kind of let that do its thing so you can kind of see this this wet area here everything else is kind of just more got this crazy bleach looking so we're just gonna kind of let it do its magic and kind of watch it now what's really cool with sublimation and it looks like confusable inks gonna work the same way cuz it will not bleach out so wherever the in fusible ink is so this stuff will not bleach so this stuff right here the infeasible ink is not gonna bleach where the shirt will but look how cool that's looking so like I said you can do your designs however you want to refer to my other video to see how I can I did those I do not recommend 5050 let me show you what braids this again I've sprayed it like five times I've already done it and then washed it and it first started out this dark color here my dogs are fighting hey guys oh let's work together um all I did was this it just turned out to be a really hot mess I do not recommend the 50/50 I do for sublimation like on the white but don't do it with the color alright so you can see where this is going okay how cool that is just kind of a really really light so if I wanted to be super white I would leave it and let it continue to bake in the Sun and then take it in and wash it out but I kind of really like the way they turn out like this let me show you what the backs looking like so far it looks like this you can see the sputter marks you can see some dirt as well you see them blobs it looks cool so I'm really excited so here in a little bit I will shut this down as soon as you're done with this and if you're working on more shirts I recommend having like either like an ice especially with a hot outside guys he's gonna intensify the bleach so you don't want to do that you want like a tote of ice water in there and you can be diving these in your ice water to stop that bleach process while you're working on the next shirts so have you a bunch of them laid out on your cement and getting them done at one time and like I said throw in those as soon as you get it to where you want it to be to stop that bleach get it in some cold water so what I do is I have like my towels ready to go in the washer or have the washer empty as soon as I get inside I put them right into the wash and they're ready to go I'm gonna stop it right here and shut it down get it in the wash I'll meet you guys back at the craft room got the results in Bleach this one this one we did not and I washed it though this has been washed and you can see nothing has washed out I already knew this because this is similar to sublimation and the ink becomes one with a shirt and it will never wash out never fade now this was a 65% poly 35% cotton so whatever was on the cotton is gonna wash away because it will not stick but whatever stuck to the poly will stay and as you can see with these results I mean it didn't fade a bit look at that on the colored t-shirt how pretty is that and then you can see how that black looks bring that up so you guys can see and this shirt says the influence of a good teacher can never be erased it's super cute but I love how bright and vibrant these colors came out super cute once again these shirts right here and I'll have it linked down below to where I buy these from they're about two dollars and something each they are the Gildan soft style they are 65% poly 35% cotton but make sure when you're going through and purchasing these whatever color you're choosing make sure it says Heather so it says graphite heathered or coral Heather it has to say heathered with it or it's not gonna be that 65 it'll be like 50% so make sure it says Heather and Heather it is where it kind of looks like this instead of like a solid color it has this really cool look to it so this is just where we applied it on a color you'd want to do it on like these Lauder colors here and it looks good so just leaving it like that love it bin wash didn't come out and you'll wash it again and again and again one that I bleached out there I love how it came out you can make these shirts however you want to with this design if you spray just a tiny bit of bleach it would just be a little bit and did a few dots here and there you could totally switch up the look but I love the way this one came out it's kind of hard to get the whole thing in here but this did not fade at all so this image here the reason why it's lighter than the first if you remember this is the second time that we had pressed it so we use that same image and pressed it for the second time now had I just pressed this image right here and bleach this shirt it would be this bright so the first time I press it if that makes sense it would be this bright on here but since I did the second one gave it like this washed out throwing it away I got another really cool effect in fusible link will not bleach out so when you bleach your shirt this is not gonna bleach out and it's not going to wash out the exact same shirt it was the exact same color and we just bleached this one so let's go out and look at it and see how cool it came out look at all these different splatters and it's pretty cool because you can see where the tag was sitting but I really love the way that this one came out kind of skeet up the bottom so you can see it a little bit here this is how the bottom came out now check out the back now I didn't put a plastic bag in here if you go back to my first video if you don't want nothing on the back you simply just put a trash bag on the inside all the way up and it's gonna protect it so nothing can get on the back we did that with my daughter shirt and I don't like that she loves it but I don't like just a plain back because in the Front's bleached but if you want something like that put a trash bag in between works great you so much is gonna go through and it's I didn't spray any extra bleach on this this is just from the front but look when we did those spray lines this is how that came out it's really cool and I love like these big bleach spots up here at the top but it really came out super cool but that's the shirt so there's your final results so play with your excusable ink you can bleach on these shirts again I'm gonna have the site that I buy it from I'm not affiliated but I love them number one I could purchase it let's say okay today's Friday I did this last Friday if I purchased because I bought these last Friday if I purchased these on a Friday I'll have them on a Monday if I purchase these on Monday I'd have them Tuesday like I always have them the next day and they're based out of Texas so they're not too too close to me and I always have them like that so now it may take an extra day with you I don't know just depending on how busy they are but literally I have them the next day I absolutely love them recommend them and I always look around and I can usually find a coupon code or I hit their chat button and I'll ask them if they currently have one and they usually give me an extra five percent so they're really good but these shirts are $2.00 and I think it's like free shipping after like $50 I just do that every time and I get a ton of shirts let me go and bring in a few colors you can see bring my my paper out here that says what colors these are so I can't really tell you that this one right here which is kind of like this pink should they say heathered so they're gonna be like this look right here so at this pink I got this quarrel once again they're about two dollars and something you say to 26 to 40 this coral is really pretty so if you're looking at the heathered coral this purple here I don't remember like I said what the name of it is but I don't think it's just purple I love it it's super cute and what I did I buy two of each one and I get them a mediums because my girls now this one right here I accidentally ordered four of them and they're large for me I just needed one dozen ordering two of but I accidentally I guess clicked it I ordered four of them so I'm like so I'll put some of these down at my booth but I love this color and I tried to cancel but once you make your order they're literally getting ready to ship it out right away so you can't cancel so pay attention love this color the same one that I did with the sublimation that color and this is what it came out so if you do one like this this is how it would look now this is with regular sublimation that's how this color would look super cool right party showed you this color which is like a blue or this may be like that graphite and then this green here I don't remember if this was the hunter green a forest green if this is the military green so these are all like lighter tones and they're gonna show up on there this one's a little bit darker so it's gonna show up a little bit darker than this it's gonna work on all of these here so I just wanted to show you really quick these are super soft shirts they're awesome I haven't even showed you this has got like that stretch to it but they're really soft material love it alright so there you go I hope you guys enjoyed this I hope you found it helpful if you did please hit the like button down below and subscribe and I'll see you next", "4PT46otshzA": "Hi it's Michael from Men's Finest, in this\u00a0\nvideo we'll try to keep our white shirts, white! This video is possible because of two people;\u00a0\nAdam, thank you so much for the question and\u00a0\u00a0 Heather, thank you so much for being such\u00a0\nan awesome person. Heather has got a blog in\u00a0\u00a0 America that talks about all household things,\u00a0\nhow to cook, how to fix, how to clean things,\u00a0\u00a0 so thank you so much Heather for contributing\u00a0\non this piece of content. So I've reached out to\u00a0\u00a0 Heather and I've asked her how would you keep your\u00a0\nwhite shirts white and she pointed me out to a\u00a0\u00a0 blog post that she has written a link below. There\u00a0\nare basically two ways to do it it all depends\u00a0\u00a0 on severity of your stains; if your stain is a\u00a0\nketchup stain or a mustard stain on your white\u00a0\u00a0 shirt then you've got a bit of a problem. You\u00a0\nneed to soak it overnight in a detergent of some\u00a0\u00a0 sort (we're going to talk about that in a second)\u00a0\nand then wash it together on probably the highest\u00a0\u00a0 temperature that the fabric will allow. What that\u00a0\nallows you to do is the Turner is going to attach\u00a0\u00a0 some molecules break down those molecules and\u00a0\nit's going to create some oxidizing effect as\u00a0\u00a0 well. One chemical that it's worth mention here is\u00a0\nsodium percarbonate also know it's oxygen bleach.\u00a0\u00a0 There are two main brands that I'm using and I\u00a0\ncan highly recommend because I've used them both\u00a0\u00a0 -one is called OxiClean this has got a sodium\u00a0\npercarbonate in it so actually breaks down all\u00a0\u00a0 the molecules and then makes your shirt whiter, so\u00a0\nthat is available in America without any problems\u00a0\u00a0 you can get in Amazon in America. I struggled a\u00a0\nbit to get this on Amazon UK and have not seen\u00a0\u00a0 a good place to buy these, so I researched and I\u00a0\nfound this - this is a vanished gold oxy action\u00a0\u00a0 so, this is vanish gold box the action this\u00a0\nyou can easily buy in the UK obviously vanish\u00a0\u00a0 did not sponsor this video but I'm telling you\u00a0\nwhat's working for me and it should work for you\u00a0\u00a0 as well. I recommend soaking your shirts in this\u00a0\nbad boy for probably an hour or two and then put\u00a0\u00a0 it all together and add a bit to your washing\u00a0\nmachine as well and you wash it on the highest\u00a0\u00a0 temperature that your clothes going to take and\u00a0\nit should be all good. One thing that I wouldn't\u00a0\u00a0 recommend and Heather doesn't recommend either,\u00a0\nis using normal chlorine bleach that apparently\u00a0\u00a0 and I've tested that myself as well yellows this\u00a0\nthing so it doesn't actually get rid of them.\u00a0\u00a0 Because normal chlorine bleach consists mainly\u00a0\nof sodium hypochlorite and what happens with it,\u00a0\u00a0 it's a much stronger oxidizing agent. So if\u00a0\nyou've got anyone who struggles with keeping\u00a0\u00a0 their white shirts what you know what to do send\u00a0\nthem over here to this video.

So in this video, I thought I would take\nyou behind the curtain to show you one of my\nprint-on-demand sites and my eCommerce portfolio that has sold well over a\nmillion dollars in T-shirts. And I'm also gonna take\nyou through 10 things that you need to do before you start selling\nT-shirts to make money online. Now for some of these\nthings, if you skip them, you still might make money\nin your T-shirt business, but you will lose out\non a lot of extra money that you could have had. But for others on the\nlist, it's much worse because if you don't do these things, then you might end up putting your T-shirt business at risk. And just to clarify for\nthose of you that don't know what the phrase print-on-demand is because we have had a lot\nof new subscribers lately. Here is how it works. It's when you print products individually as customers order them. So, for example, there\nare merchandise companies like Printify that will let you upload artwork to their website and then place it on to\nproducts like T-shirts, which you can then list\nand sell in your own store. And then when a customer comes and buys one of the T-shirts from you Printify will then print\nthe design onto the T-shirt and then ship it out to\nthe customer for you. Automatically without you\nhaving to do anything. So yes, print-on-demand is pretty cool. So we've got 10 things to discuss so let's just jump straight into it. One, choose one niche market\nto zoom in on and master. Now there is one exception to this, which I will explain later, but for most people who are looking to start a T-shirt business,\nI very much recommend that you choose a niche market and you focus in on it. So this is one of the stores\nin my eCommerce portfolio and as I said, this one is quite unique because it's done well over\n$1 million worth of T-shirts. So the sales number that was on the screen was the total sales for the store. This is actually a flex store. It sources and sells\nproducts in multiple ways, but the main way it does it\nis through print-on-demand. So what you can do inside\nof Shopify's report section is choose to filter the\nresults by product type. There are much more complex\nfilters that you can use and honestly, as a store\nowner and marketer, this feature is wonderful and\nI'm gonna be using it a lot in this video. But yes, by filtering the results we can see that more than half\nof the sales in this store came from T-shirts. That's a lot of T-shirts. And you know what? All of those T-shirts were\ntargeting one single niche. Yep, all of those T-shirts were\ntargeting one single niche. And, of course, for those\nof you watching out there that don't know the word niche, which can be also said as\nniche, both ways are fine, means to target a distinct\nsegment of a market. In other words, having specific appeal to a targeted group of people. So, for example, if you had\na store targeting pet owners with products for cat owners, dog owners, fish owners, and dragon owners that would be a general store. But if you were to instead just focus in on one specific\npet owner, such as dogs, that would be a niche store. I was reminded the other\nday why I had personally had a whole lot more success with niche stores over general stores when\nI received this comment from a viewer. \"Hi, Sarah, I want to know\nif I'm on the right track. \"I'm aiming to two main subjects,\nHome Depot and clothing. \"For Home Depot, I'll be\nselling things like paintings, \"cups, accessories and things\nfor each section of the house, \"kitchen, bedroom,\nliving room and bathroom. \"For clothes, I'm aiming for women, men, \"babies and especially pets. \"So am I being greedy\naiming for too many things?\" Yes. Let's be honest, mate. The only thing that women, men, babies and pets have in common\nis that they have a pulse and they all living in houses. So I was recently talking\nto my friend, Fred, who literally spends millions\nof dollars every year advertising his niche stores, and I was talking to him about\nhow I get lots of questions from people in the comments\nwanting to set up general stores and he said to me, \"By why\ndo they wanna do that?\" and I said to him, \"It's\nbecause of the fact \"that they think that if they\ntarget one specific niche \"that they're not gonna be\nable to scale their store \"since they will run out\nof products to sell in it.\" And he looked at me\nbefuddled and he's like, \"But it's the opposite. \"Niche stores are easier to\nscale than general stores.\" and I agreed. The reason why we genuinely believe this is because when you have a niche store you're building up a\ncustomer base of people that you know are passionate\nabout one specific thing and what that means then is it much easier to launch new products again and again, and have your previous customers come back to buy your newly launched products, and this is especially true\nwith print-on-demand stores like T-shirts business where you can essentially\ncreate unlimited products. You are only limited by your imagination or by your designer's imagination. Whereas with a general\nstore, your customer list is very fragmented. It's pretty much summed\nup by that famous phrase. Jack of all trades, master of none. That's why as you can see, this\nis not a one product store. This is a long-term store and it has sold many different designs with lots of repeat customers. I get a lot of people ask\nme about one product stores and I'm sorry people,\nbut those just aren't the sort of stores that I\npersonally invest in to. So don't expect them for this channel. But like with all things in life I've got friends who\nreally like general stores and they can probably\nargue their case very well. So remember, in life\nthere is no best business. There are just different businesses. However, I genuinely believe\nthat niche stores are easier especially for beginners to market, but as I said there is\none exception to this. Two, consider opening a general store on third party eCommerce platform. Yes, this is the exception to that. T-shirt business is on a\nthird party eCommerce website like Redbubble or Merch by Amazon you should very much consider that. Why, well, it's because\nRedbubble and Merch By Amazon are general stores. So you're essentially listing\nyour T-shirts for sale on what is already an\nextremely large general store and you don't have control over marketing to previous customers. It's Redbubble and Amazon that do that. So you don't get the same\nbenefit from niching down and branding your store. Because think about it, here's a T-shirt that a\nseller is selling on Amazon using the print-on-demand\nprogram, Merch By Amazon, and if we use the Amazon sales\nresearch tool, Jungle Scout, we can see in the past month it estimates that they have\nmade thousands of dollars, which is pretty cool. However, when a customer\ncomes and buys this T-shirt they will have other products\nup-sold to them on Amazon, and you know what, these products here they are not the seller's products. They are the products\nfrom their competitors. What this all means then is that on a third party\neCommerce site like Amazon you don't get the same advantage that you get in your own store where you can create a curated\nexperience for your customer where you can control the customer journey and up-sell them to multiple\nproducts by niching down. Three, add simple text-based\nT-shirts as cross-sells and up-sells, and to pad out your store. One of the challenging things about starting a T-shirt\nbusiness is the design part. Even if you yourself are a designer, it still takes a lot of\ntime and creative energy to come up new great designs. So that is why, if you ask for\nany URLs to my stores I own, nope, I'm not gonna give them to you. So that you can come in and steal my IPs. But anyway, moving on. Something I've highlighted\nbefore on this channel is that simple text-based\ndesigns can sell extremely well for humorous T-shirts,\nbut that doesn't mean that they only exclusively\nsell for humorous designs. Nope, so if we come back to my report on the top selling T-shirts in my store. You'll see that sitting\nat number 10 is this one that sold 835 shirts, and trust me, this design, it is painfully simple. Like painfully simple. Now, since I don't want\nto reveal my design IPs for people to steal, I have instead opted to create a similar example product in my example Shopify store Brewed Treets, and here it is. Yep, it literally is\njust a big block of text of a popular one word phrase in my niche on a basic T-shirt. And it's these sorts of\nT-shirts that anyone, regardless of designing\nabilities, can create Just by using simple, free apps like Canva and Pixlr's inbuilt\nopen source free fonts, anyone can create these\nsimple text-based designs, like this one, that made over $22,000. And you know what, that's just\n$22,000 from T-shirts alone. Coming back to the product sale report, I switched up the filters to show all of the\ndifferent types of products that also feature this\ndesign in the store, not just T-shirts, and\ncollectively this simple design has sold over $82,000\nacross all of its products that it's been printed on to. But while that's great and all, I have to stress, this is not a design that I would recommend\nsending paid traffic to. Paid traffic is expensive and so to turn a profit, especially if you're using\nFacebook or Instagram, you really need to have\nan eye-popping design that's gonna catch the attention of the person who's\nscrolling through their feed and you know what, designs like this, they're just not very visually engaging. Obviously as you can see though, preexisting shoppers who are\nin the mood to buy more things will add these simple text-based\ndesigns to their carts too, but they are best left for shoppers who have already found your\nwebsite through other products or free organic traffic, not paid traffic. Teaching how to create these simple text-based designs\nusing Canva is something that I teach in my\npremium training course, The Ecomm Clubhouse. If you're interested in\ncurated tutorial videos I'll have a link to it in\nthe video description below. Four, check what T-shirts you\nare selling to your customers. Here is something to be aware of. When it comes to T-shirts,\nnot all T-shirts are the same. So, for example, if we\nhead on over to Printify, you'll see that there are\nmultiple types of unisex T-shirts. There's this one here,\nwhich is $20.81 a shirt and then there's this one\nhere, which is $8.30 a shirt and then you have this\none, which is even cheaper, $7.10 a shirt. So you might be thinking,\nwhy is one T-shirt $21 and another T-shirt is\na third of the price? Well, it's because of this. Not all T-shirts are the same. So this cheap T-shirt here,\nthe actual make of the T-shirt is listed here. It's a Gildan 5000 whereas this more expensive\n$8.10 T-shirt here, this is Bella + Canvas 3001. These are two completely\ndifferent makes of T-shirts and thus, they have two\nvery different prices. This information is usually available for a free third party eCommerce platforms with print-on-demand\ncapabilities like Teespring, you just gotta look for it. For example, if you come\non over here to Teespring, you'll see that there\nare different T-shirts and you might think well,\nwhat's the difference between the $10.50 Tee and the $14.33 Tee So to find out, you just gotta come to Teespring's product overview page. And here you'll get more detail on what brands that they use. So their premium tees use Next Level whereas their cheaper\ntees use either Hanes or Gildan, depending on\nwhere it's fulfilled from. So how can you choose\nwhich one's right for you? Well, actually it's pretty easy. Five, use Jiffy T-shirts\nto research reviews for different styles of T-shirts. So pretty much all\nprint-on-demand companies will list the different T-shirts that they use on their site. But there is one\nparticular company Printful which has an additional\nfeature, and it's this. Reviews. The print-on-demand store\nowners can leave reviews for different products. They usually aren't\nreviewing the print quality, more the T-shirt brand itself. So this T-shirt here, the Anvil 88VL has a 3.5\nstar rating out of five. Now on the surface that's not great is it? You probably think well, you\nknow, I'll avoid this T-shirt. But here is the thing. Four reviews? Statistically, that is pathetic. All it takes is for some\nsilly reviews to be left. This person here left a three star review with no complaints. They simply rated it three stars because they didn't know if\nthey liked the shirt or not yet. So to them, this was a neutral review. And this person here\ndidn't like the fabric and thinks it's bad. Yet, this person below\nthem really likes it. With such a small number of reviews you can't really know who\nwas right and who was wrong. So what you need to do is you\nneed to come to Jiffy Shirts, a T-shirt wholesale website and do a search for reviews\non that particular style and brand of T-shirt. And that will give you an\nactual true representation of the quality of it, and\nwhether people like it or not. When you do that you find\nthat actually this T-shirt is extremely well reviewed when you increase the\ncustomer sample size. Now when you're starting out and you don't have a strong brand yet, it's fine to use T-shirts like this to keep your starting costs low, but if you have an established\nstore like my one is, then like me you'll want to\nswitch to higher quality Tees with softer cotton. Two good brands that\nbalance cost with quality that are available on a lot\nof print-on-demand websites are Bella + Canvas and Anvil. Six, stop refunds by not\nselling T-shirt that run small. Okay, so if we come back\nto my report in Shopify, check it out, there have been\nover $1.5 million in sales with Tees in the store, after\nyou account for the discounts. And the refunds? Just $24,000, and when you calculate it, that is less than 2% refunds, which is way below industry\naverage for a store this size and do you know how you\nget a refund rate that low? By ensuring that you have happy customers. So when you come to a\nprint-on-demand website and you are choosing your\nTees, I strongly recommend, for the sake of simplicity\nto avoid T-shirts that feature this dreaded\ntext in their description. So, for example, let's compare\nthese two sizing charts. Here is one T-shirt. As the description says,\nit runs true to size. So if you scroll down to the sizing chart, we'll see the different\nsizes go up to three XL. Now, let's compare that\nto this T-shirt here, which runs small. If you scroll down to the bottom and check out that T-shirt's sizing chart, we'll see that the sizing\nis extremely different and that someone who fit a\nlarge T-shirt in the first one will not fit a large in the cut of T-shirt because it, well, is\ndrastically different. Here they are side-by-side\nand as you can see, the T-shirt that runs small does not scale as sizing goes up. And so when someone who\nnormally wears a large T-shirt, gets it, and it doesn't fit,\nthey go, huh, that's weird. Guess there's something\nwrong with my T-shirt and I need to get a refund. And even if they didn't assume that, if you normally wear a large T-shirt and the large T-shirt doesn't fit you, you know what? That's not a nice feeling. And not only will it mean then\nthat customers will feel bad because of the fact that\ntheir T-shirts don't fit them, but they'll also be less likely to order from you in the future because think about it, no-one who normally wears a large T-shirt wants to have to order a two XL. Having happy customers\nis extremely important when running an online store and it's something that I\ndiscuss in my free ebook. \"The Six Tips That Six\nFigure Online Stores Follow To Make Over $10,000 A\nMonth,\" and you'll find links to download that ebook in\nthe video description below. Seven, be aware that not all\nprint-on-demand providers do large prints. This is just a quickie, but keep in mind before you design your T-shirt, not all print-on-demand\nproviders do large designs. For example on Printify you don't order your\nT-shirts directly from them, they just act as a third party service that connects you to the\nprint-on-demand providers, and one of their suppliers that\nwill print onto this T-shirt is DTG2Go, and they have the capacity to print this design onto\nthis Bella + Canvas 3001 Tee. Whereas this other\nprovider, Monster Digital, can only print the\ndesign onto that same Tee at a smaller size. Now oftentimes this doesn't really matter, but there are some of you out there that might be designing your\nT-shirts to be a full print that goes over the whole T-shirt. So keep this in mind before\nyou start designing it. There is a slight work around for this when you're doing your marketing. Eight, pick product mock-ups\nto increase conversions. So here is a sneaky trick\nthat we use in the industry. So when you're using a\nprint-on-demand provider most of them will give you a\nvisual mock-up of the product that you are selling to be\nable to use to market it, but unfortunately these\nusually aren't all that great. So as my subscribers\nknow I usually recommend that you create your own product mock-ups to use in your own marketing. And the place that I often recommend is this website here Placeit. With Placeit, you can upload your design that you plan to print onto a T-shirt, Placeit will then create\nbeautiful mock-up pictures for you featuring your design\nthat you can then use to advertise and promote it. They are infinitely better than standard boring mock-up photos that print-on-demand providers give you. However, when you're choosing which mock-ups to use in your store keep in mind, if you are selling a T-shirt that features a small print or can only print onto a\nsmall area of the T-shirt when it comes to just the\nplain product mock-up photo it can look a little awkward. On a mock-up like this, the\ndesign looks really small in relation to the T-shirt itself, which it can make it\nless visually appealing and not pop as well. But there is a solution. And that is to use crumbled mock-ups or mock-ups where the T-shirt\nis tied in a knot like this. This helps to draw attention\naway from the empty fabric and instead draw attention\nto the design itself, increasing conversions by creating a more eye-popping picture. Nine, choose a T-shirt printing company that offers the services that you need. So here is another quick tip. Do you remember how there\nwere these two companies that Printify work with,\nDTG2Go and Monster Digital, that will both print onto the same shirt, but have different printing size areas? Well, that's not all that's\ndifferent about them. Monster Digital here, the only service that they have on offer is\nthey'll print whatever you want on the front and back of\nthe shirt and that's it. Whereas DTG2Go offers\nseveral other services. Not only will they print\non the front and back, but they'll always print on the sleeves and they will print a custom\nlabel for additional branding. Printing on the sleeves\nis free, I believe, but a custom label is\nnot, so keep that in mind. Now for most of you, the standard label that's\nalready on the shirt is absolutely fine, but\nif you were planning to have your own really\nhigh quality T-shirt brand, then you want to make sure\nthat that feature is included with the supplier that you choose. The same goes for Printful, they do all of their printing in-house, but not all T-shirts are\neligible for additional features like custom tags. So to check just filter the results and now you'll know which\nT-shirts to choose from. 10, check to see if your\nniche is about to die. Or if it is secretly a seasonal niche, so that you don't get catch\nout by any unexpected, unhappy surprises, when\nyour sales suddenly dip. So let me show you how to check this. So Google has a great\nfree tool, Google Trends. If we type in a phrase, such as SpongeBob, we'll see how much search\ninterest the phrase SpongeBob has received over time in Google. So if we set the results to show us how SpongeBob the show has trended over the past five years we'll see some interesting things, and as you can see, interest\nup until 2018 had kind of flattened out, but in 2019\nSpongeBob had a resurgence. So this tool is a great way to\nsee if interest in your niche that you plan to make and sell T-shirts in is about to rise or if it's about to fall. Case in point, there is an\nonline game called Happy Wheels, which has a huge online\ncommunity dedicated to it, but take a look at it on Google Trends. As you can see, the\noverall trend for the game, well, it's not good. So I highly recommend\nthat you come on here and you check out how your niche is doing. And something that I\nwant you to keep in mind is this as well. Even if your niche isn't\ndoing so hot right now, as SpongeBob showed us,\nniches they don't just fall, but they rise as well. So while it's probably a\ngood idea to think twice before you get into a niche\nwhich is in the middle of a rapid decline, if your\nniche interest is bottomed out then this could be a\nreally great time to get in to capitalize when your\nniche trends up again, which is exactly what\nhappened with Minecraft. Minecraft videos or\nrelated merch plummeted, but the creators who stuck\naround when it bottomed out got paid handsomely when it rose again. And by the way, while you\ndo have to be very careful if you want to piggyback off\nof popular IPs like SpongeBob when you're creating your own merch there are some ways to legally do it. Which I discuss in this video. There is another reason that\nyou should use this tool to double check your niche and that is because it\nmight actually secretly be a seasonal niche. So a niche that is seasonal that would probably\nsurprise no-one is baseball. If we take a look at baseball\nover the past five years we'll see that interest in it rises sharply when summer hits. But you know what? I've discovered something surprising. I've see plenty of successful\nprint-on-demand stores that focus on brands of trendy\ncars with big fan bases. And so I wondered how is the\nMini Cooper doing these days. When I did a search for\nit and I took a look back at the past five years,\nI was shocked to discover that this is, well, a seasonal niche. Interest in Mini Coopers\nrise as the summer hits and then it falls down over winter. Now perhaps because I'm\nnot a big car person, this is more surprising to me, so I decided to compare\nit to the Toyota Corolla and while interest definitely\ndips over winter for it, as a whole, it's not as\npronounced or as seasonal as the Mini Cooper. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with seasonal niches. It's absolutely normal. It's just nice to know\nabout this in advance so that when you see sales dip in the fall you don't freak out because you know that they're gonna rise\nagain in the summer.

"ERgE8QFfGnQ": "all right y'all so as promised i am sorry i got to turn my tv down okay so as promised i'm going to show you all a new solution on how to do sublimation on cotton um textiles okay so you're gonna need a spray bottle and you're going to need eight ounces of water in here and then you're gonna need this minwax polycrylic okay i got the clear gloss finish i don't know if the finish matters this is what i happen to get so hopefully it works okay um this is my first time doing it i saw jlo's creations on youtube i'll link her video this is originally how i uh saw this idea she's the first person who i've seen to do it this way and i'm gonna try it so i'll be sure to link her videos so you guys can check her out if you want to see how she did it so at any rate eight ounces of water two tablespoons of this poly acrylic all right so the price for this was 22 this was 17 and some change and then this was three dollars and some change so 22 dollars and look how much you're getting okay two tablespoons is nothing out of this i mean i can use this probably forever and when i bought this these are four ounces so i got two four ounce bottles off of etsy and so again you know you be the judge and i think i paid around it's on sale now because i just look but i paid around 20 some odd dollars for this so price wise they were about the same but what you get and obviously how they work are going to be totally different so um yeah let's go ahead and make the solution all right so we got a really good shake and obviously if you want to make more make more you can fill this thing all the way up just for every eight ounces of water do two tablespoons of polycrylic okay and i'm gonna get our shirt over here i've been waiting wanting to do this project on these two little shirts i got from um hobby lobby they were on clearance so i've been waiting to use them for something so this will be perfect i'm going to do like um a little theme or something on them [Music] i want to spray honey but is it open oh my god wasn't over and pretty much you want to [Music] like really get this thing wet um i don't like the spray bottle i'm gonna be honest with y'all cause it doesn't have the oopsies and i broke it broke this try to get you a nozzle that actually is a sprayer not one that just has this single spray like get one that sprays like evenly because i don't like this um all righty so what i'm going to do is sit this under the um heat press not actually put the plate down but just sit it on the um heat press is our is heat oh it's not even heating up it's already at 400 degrees so i'm just gonna kind of let this i guess dry by that heat while i do the other one and um the tutorial that i saw she actually put her stuff in she let it air dry she let one air dry and she let one dry in the dryer i'm gonna heat press these to dry them but first um like i said i'm gonna sit this underneath the heat press just kind of let it chill there until i'm done with the other one okay probably should use gloves too sorry you should probably use gloves all right and out of that solution we started out with eight ounces i'm probably at like the five ounce line all right so this two will go under the heat press and see you guys over there [Music] [Applause] [Music] so this looks like it may take longer than i was expecting so i am going to throw this stuff in the dryer y'all just to speed up the process because i have a few other things to get to today so we're going to put this in a dryer all right you guys so basically here we have it okay this is our um our prints i got both of these off of etsy i don't know for some reason the quality on this one doesn't seem as nice as this one and i did not distort it a lot but um that's what i have these were in a dryer they do have a little bit of stiffness about them from going in the dryer i'm not sure why that is but they do have a little bit of stiffness to them all right so it's hot i know [Music] okay so see that right there the black hair didn't go didn't get absorbed all the way another thing is that i think i was way too high 400 degrees is way too high for this considering i put a chemical solution on here so look at that see how it's yellowing around there which i know there's ways to fix that um i don't really care to fix it oh that's hot and here's our little boss man so how do i like this they're okay there is some yellowing and y'all i honestly is getting late because this kind of was a long process does it work absolutely does work um oh that's hot but that looked a lot better this looks a lot better than the shirt i did yesterday for corey and this is pink and that was a gray shirt so there's no way that this light pink should be popping to me any more than a gray shirt um i obviously didn't put enough solution there so it's important to saturate well because the black hair didn't really take but you guys it does work and it can be done this black is a little iffy too but overall y'all it does look good i'm actually going to wash them i'm going to wash them and see if this residue comes off and so we can get a test on how they look after they've been washed so i'm gonna do that too so anyway y'all don't forget to like comment subscribe let me know um what you guys think about this do you all think that it's worth you know doing your own poly um poly tea spray or not even poly tea spray but doing your own sublimation spray and doing these shirts definitely will play around with the heat settings i most certainly will be doing this again and i think i'm going to lower my temperature to 350 and i'm going to do it in 60 second increments and then going from there i think 400 is too high especially considering we sprayed a chemical on there that's the first mistake so we'll definitely redo it so anyway all right y'all bye hey guys so i am back and here are the shirts with after they've been washed and i don't know if you all recall this one the pigment wasn't that great to begin with and it's definitely horrible now and i think that the color even bled not think it did the color bled after washing and it set for a few days and you guys can see the splotches where the color wasn't even to begin with with this one and of course it did fade um the image is still there i don't know what's so different about this then have we not treated it versus have we um versus how we did treat it like if using cotton so i don't know how helpful this is to you all but this is the after the wash i will insert a picture of the befores and do i feel that it's worth it no not really could it also be user error most certainly you guys know that that was my first time doing it i can definitely try it again and see how it turns out oh and then for corey's y'all his was even worse i used the um poly t sublimation spray for his did i look at that his face is completely gone you do see the tick tock name but look at that this is completely gone and that's using the [Music] subletty spray from etsy so yeah that's this time i can try it again i may try it again guys using something smaller see if i can get better results and i'll follow instructions by the t for the subletting because i didn't lose it but i did take a screenshot so hopefully possibly i can redo it and follow the directions to the t for the poly t and then for the acrylic for the poly acrylic and water i don't know i can try it again y'all and see what else we can come up with but this was the wash test and they do not pass in my book so yeah um if y'all have any suggestions comments leave them down below and let's talk about it bye y'all", "p0BtNhpLcNs": "I am Danny Harris and six years ago at Bala canvas we set out to educate the industry on

We got a great episode for you today. We got it all. We got pear! - Hello - We got grapefruit! - Good morrow. - We got me. And we got\nthis box of 100 t-shirts! Why, you may ask, cause today we're doing the 100 t-shirt challenge! - Basically, the title says it all. We're gonna put 100\nt-shirts on a lucky someone. And that lucky someone is grapefruit! - Luck has nothin' to do with it fellas. It's courage, it's bravery,\nin a few short minutes I will be wearing 100\nt-shirts, not because I'm lucky, but because I'm\ncapable of doing things that other people can barely\nbring themselves to speak of. - Chill out dude, it's\njust an internet challenge. - Correction, it's an\ninternet challenge I can win! It's been quite some time\nsince I won a challenge, and today I turn things around! - Well of course you're not\ngonna lose this challenge, you're not competing against anyone. - So we agree! - I pay you! - Hey! I got an idea. Let's start putting shirts on Grapefruit. - Love it. - Great! Here we go. - Without me it's just\n'aweso.' Hehehe, I like it. Mainly cause it's so true. - Well, if you like that one, you're gonna love what's in store. We raided a novelty t-shirt place. - Wait, you're telling me\nthat all 100 of the shirts I'm about to put on are novelty t-shirts? - Relax, Grapefruit. Frankie says so. (Apple and Pear laugh) - Ugh. Well, it is quite\nslimming. Ain't so bad. - Glad to hear it. I knew we'd\nmake a Beleiber out of you. (Apple laughs) - I'm not guys! I'm not! Not a Belieber! - Uh, protesting pretty hard there, dude. - I can't have people see\nme in a shirt like this! I got an image to maintain! - Dude, who cares? No one's gonna see it. We're about to put 96\nshirts over the top of it. - I suppose you're right.\nReally, the only shirt that matters is the final shirt. - Exactly. That's the\none you'll be wearing when I take the photo for the newspaper. - Oh, nice! I've always\nwanted to be in the newspaper. _ Well then we gotta keep going! We have to get the photo turned in before they run the presses. - In that case, proceed. Bring\non the next novelty t-shirt! - (laughs) I also like\nthis cause it's true. (laughs) Even better! I gotta say, you guys really outdid yourselves. These shirts are really funny and--hey! What the heck is this? - They were on clearance!\nThey had a bunch of 'em. - Well I don't like it! - Why not? You liked 'em\nwhen they pointed at us. - Well yeah, because they were true when they pointed at you guys. Don't you guys see how wrong it is to have a shirt pointing at me, calling me stupid like this? Doesn't it gnaw at you?\nAren't you overcome with an overpowering sense of dread, that a grave injustice has been committed? - No. - Not really. - Just me, huh? Well then, I\nsuppose this just goes to show what an empath I am. You got any shirts like\nthat in there, little Apple? Shirts that say 'I'm with empath?' Or, 'I'm with a good person?' - No, but I got a shirt that says this! - (laughs) Now this is\nwhat I'm talkin' about. Back on track, fellas. Back on track. - Glad we avoided that clothes\ncall! (laughs) Here we go! (playful music) - Whew! Okay, we've\ncome to the final shirt. - How ya feelin, Grapefruit? - Very squeezed, very immobilized. - You wanna pick out the\nfinal shirt yourself? - While I'd love to, I\nliterally cannot move in any way, shape, or form. - Well that's fine, we'll\njust hold up some options and you tell us what you want. Okay? - Can't wait. - Okay, option one. - Pretty good. While it is a nice day, I'm not sure yellow is my color. This is a big decision you know. The final shirt is what I'll be wearing in the newspaper, remember. - All right, option two, then. Yes, that's the one! (laughs) This one is so me! I'm a classy guy, and this T shirt reflects that. I've made my decision. I\nwant to be immortalized in the newspaper wearing a tuxedo t-shirt. (laughs) So witty.\n(drumroll) - Okay then, here we go.\nT-shirt number 100, coming up. Uh oh. - What? What's that uh oh mean? - It's too small. - I'm not fat, you're fat! - No one's calling you fat,\ndude! You're wearing 99 shirts! - Oh, right. Sorry, had\na flashback to fat camp. Err- I mean nature camp. - So what do we do? We\ngotta get Grapefruit into a hundredth shirt, and quick! The newspaper goes to\nprint any moment now. - I'll go back to the store. - Okay, hurry! Get the biggest shirt they- Wow, you're back. Okay,\nI'm ready with the camera! - Here it goes! Say 'cheese!' - Chee--what the heck is this? - I'm sorry, it was the\nonly one they had in stock. - But--\n- No time! I gotta take this to the newspaper, STAT! - Hey! Hey, don't publish that!

The arrow isn't pointing at-- - Don't you tell me where\nthe arrow's pointin', I can see where the arrow's pointin'. Cause I ain't stupid, now you gonna point that arrow somewhere else, or do we got a problem? - Sir, I regret to inform you\nthat I cannot point this arrow anywhere else. - Then we got a problem. And\nme, I deal with problems. - You're just eatin' birdseed,\nhow's that dealin' with me? - Oh, you'll see in about 20 minutes. - Couldn't even win this\none, could ya Grapefruit? (guitar music)", "3UmS2zWXrLc": "hey guys this team of style I'm Jose Zuniga and for this week's video we're going to be talking all about t-shirts so like you guys have been pointing out in the comment section I've been wearing a lot of t-shirts lately and that's for a specific reason I've been test driving a lot of brands lately trying to find the perfect t-shirt for you guys then for myself as well now I already know where you're going to say but Jose you told us not to wear t-shirts like three years ago and you're right however my feelings towards t-shirts have drastically changed I feel that a good t-shirt that fits really well can be a suitable casual option for men especially in hot humid summer heat one of the biggest reasons why I didn't like t-shirts was the fact that they shrunk so easily here's a prime example this is an H&M t-shirt that I bought literally less than six months ago honestly after three washes the t-shirt was already two sizes too small and this is what I did it light I have a drawer full of about five to ten hmmm t-shirts that I just don't use because they're two sizes too small and why I love their six dollar price point I don't love that I have to be buying new ones every four wears or whatever it may be so the reason why you've been seeing t-shirts so much lately is because I've been test driving t-shirts trying to find the perfect t-shirt under two categories one quality I wanted a t-shirt that's so well-made that it's not going to shrink after one or two washes but instead fit great always and then the second one was that fit a t-shirt that actually fit well and stayed with that proper fit for multiple wear so I wasn't looking for disposability I was looking for quality t-shirts that look good and feel good and I've never in my search to three brand recommendations for you guys and some of the best t-shirts out there for men and there are multiple price points and I did that purposely my three recommendations are going to be Tanny trim menswear and black socks also in that order of price point so let's start with tani tani is going to be my high-end recommendation of the three I'm going to be talking about the reason why tani is that the high-end one is because their t-shirts can retail anything from 65 to 145 yes I said $145 for a single t-shirt so this is definitely for the guy that's comfortable paying that amount and why it is the high-end option you also must understand those that you're getting the best of the best there is when you invest into tanning the owner was nice enough to send over a discount Konan if you use TMF 25 you'll get 25% off your order which is a hefty discount considering the price point of these t-shirts the t-shirts you're seeing right now are they're lower priced t-shirts at $65 the great thing about tanning t-shirts is that they feature a moisture wicking fabric called micro motor air fabric all their shirts are made in Europe with natural materials the fabric itself is super lining cool it's actually softer and thinner than silk giving the user a remarkably comfortable and soft feel these two models you're seeing have been washed twice already and as you can see their Fit is still excellent and I really didn't experience any shrinkage with these two t-shirts most in part because these t-shirts features 6% elastane and their shirts that really helps for the shirt to return back to its original shape and that shrink or stretch out which are two things you don't want in a t-shirt next up we have trim menswear trim menswear as a handcrafted brand that's tratar 'get it for the athletic man so if you have an athletic build this brand might suit you best it's also it also Falls second on my list because it's it falls right in the middle price point wise at around $45 at t-shirt given that I usually recommend this shirt more to the Henri crowds a high earner not rich yet and of course we snag the discount code for this brand as well and if you use TMF trim 20 you'll get 20% off what I love about these t-shirts is their design and fit for around $45 you're getting a luxurious model supima cotton fabric that is natural and breathable the deep crewneck design is a refreshing twist from the various deep v-necks I already own as for the fit the t-shirt fits perfectly in all the right places I mean look at it it has a nice and snug fit around the chest and region area however it doesn't pull or constrict that it looks like I'm wearing a t-shirt that's a size too small it also has a relaxed fit through the midsection so this really adds to the breathability and the coolness of the t-shirt which makes it perfect for summer I washed both of these t-shirts you saw the both the black and the white one before this video and as you can see they're fit and quality is still on point which is the reason why they made the cut for this video and finally we have black socks black socks for Falls last on our list because it is the lowest priced model of those three we're going to be talking about this is for the guy that still wants that quality t-shirt but doesn't want to break the bank especially on a college budget black socks produces two shirts I really like their deep V Claudette model which retails around 125 dollars and their regular v-neck Suzette model which retails for around $23 and of course the good news is since you're a viewer you can use code TMF ten off and you'll get 10% off oh and then I mentioned they also have free worldwide shipping so it's really a great price point and great value the great thing with black socks is that the t-shirts even at this unbelievable low price point you're getting amazing high quality pima cotton that is naturally breathable in a fit that is perfection what I really like about the shirt though is that it also has that 5% elastane and I usually like this in shirts for two reasons it really helps make the shirt more resilient so this helps it keep its original shape even after several wear so it doesn't matter how many times you wash it the shirt always bounces back to its original shape I also like it because it hugs the arm area a little bit closer this helps gives the illusion I'm having fuller arms than you really do which almost all of us need a little help in that area when we can get it so that's it for this week's video guys I hope you enjoyed it I'll have the link down below all the t-shirts I spoke about in the order that I did with their corresponding discount code if you're interested in any of the t-shirts I spoke about so I hope you enjoyed this video if you did remember to hit up the like up I'm also let me know what you think down below which tee shirt was your favorite that's it for me for this week's video guys see you guys next time", "iEQsTaa8mME": "[Music] hey guys it's Dana from made everyday calm today I'm going to show you how to easily dye fabric from a white color to a really fun color at your house in a bowl without a lot of fuss [Music] guy in fabrics is really fun and I think sometimes there's a misconception that it is super messy and complicated and it ruins your washing machine I don't even do to my washing machine I love to do it in a bowl in my kitchen it's really easy and it's kind of an adventure every single time it turns out slightly different and I love doing them on these little baby onesies because it doesn't take much fabric they're super fun cute great to give as a baby gift and sometimes for girls and for boys it's hard to find that perfect shade you want I mean this cool teal or a fun gray color you have lots of choices you can also dyed fabric you could dye elastic all sorts of things that might need just a little bit of sprucing up with a fun shade so here's what you need some white fabric or a garment fabric dyes a bit of salt a mixing bowl and spoon and some gloves stopper guy comes in a lot of different shades and then a few different types I purchase these at my local jo-ann fabric and craft store and I love the variety that they have there I'm using the RIT die today that is in liquid form which makes it really easy to just mix with your water and this is best used on cotton type fabrics now Joanna also carries this other kind made by RIT and it's meant for synthetic fabrics that's something that you want to be aware of if you're dying say some elastic that has some polyester in it or something like that which I have died elastic before it's super fun if you're making a cute circle skirt and you want an orange last book or some other color now you can also buy dye in the powder form I prefer to liquid a little bit better just because it mixes really well but if you want to use the powder that is fine I would recommend mixing the powder in a small amount of water first before you put it in your large die back that you're doing okay so let's get to it now typically I would dye fabric in my kitchen in a bowl in the sink but for now in my studio I have a plastic bag protecting my table and going to put on some gloves here to protect my hands which is really important because you don't want to end up with crazy-looking fingers later there we go now you want to get some really hot water pour it into your bowl and if you're just doing one one onesie or a piece of fabric you don't need a lot of liquids so that picture was just enough then going to take your garment and these onesies I also got it Johanna I love that they carry that there they also carry t-shirts which makes it easy to just pick up everything at once now you want to get your fabric wet first I'm just going to put it right here in the water and that's important so that when you put the dye in it absorbs everything evenly and then you also want to end button this so that everything can just flow through both parts of the onesies or your fabric or whatever you're doing okay it looks like it's saturated an F and wring this out take it back out next thing you want to do is add some salt now you want to read the instructions on your dye packet and it will tell you some of these details how much salt - add per pound of fabric etc etc I don't know how much this weighs I'm just doing one thing so like I said this is an adventure every time that I do it but I think that's kind of fun so I'm just adding some amount of salt and to be honest I don't always know how much good this does but hey salts cheap if it says to add it I'm going to ask okay that looks good mix that up okay that's pretty good and then comes the fun part adding ends die I'm going to do yellow because yellow of my favorite color oh I forgot I need to shake it first okay now we can pour them here we go for low roof your bowl doesn't splash up on you and that's pretty good the amount that you put in again will vary how dark you want it how light you want it but I think it's better to err on the side of adding more dye limited idiom it's better to buy a lighter fabric dye and leave your garment in for longer than to buy a dark fabric dye and leave them for shorter if that makes sense because they will evenly distribute better the longer that you leave in the dye okay mix it up really well and then kind of magic okay we're ready to put our little piece of fabric in here here goes all the way down in okay there you go oh okay but that's not going to be long enough you want to leave it in here and now I'm taking my hands and I'm just kind of rubbing it all around and pushing it all around and kind of fun it's kind of like massaging a little piece of fabric swirl it around the instructions on your container will tell you to stir it constantly for a certain amount of time I don't always do that again I'm a little experimental with this stuff I like to just mix it around for a while and then sometimes I'll walk away and you know go load the dishwasher we'll put kids to bed whatever are the bazillion things that you're doing at home with your kids as a mom then I come back and I stir it again and then I walk away while and I come back sometimes I do these for about 15 minutes you can do them for longer you can do them for less but like I said it's better if it's in four I know probably at least five to ten minutes than just one minute and I think it will do all sorts of fun stuff like you can get an hombre effect if you put it let's see yes put it all the way in and then put in a little bit more and then put it it kind of takes a while but it's kind of cool also okay so we're going to let this sit for a little bit and I'll stir it off and on okay this has been sitting for about 15 minutes and I think it looks like a great shade something else that is kind of fun with these is that like I said this is for cotton fabric this type of diet and sometimes the thread is a more of a synthetic fabric so it doesn't die and stays white or the little tag I think it's kind of cute fun element okay now keep in mind that whatever shade you see here it's going to be slightly darker than it will look after rinsing it and after washing it so if you start rinsing and you feel like it looks too light well just stick it back in and then do it for a little bit longer that is the fun thing about dyeing fabric and since I only have a little bit I could still use this a bunch more time okay I'm rinsing this out into my bowl now I'm going to take it to the sink and rinse it with some water I'm just prints in here with some hot water and you just want to do this for I don't know a few minutes you just keep filling it with water wringing it out you just want to do it until you see that there is no more dye coming out into your sink I like to open this up make sure it's going through the inside times you can hold on to the bottom or it's also nice if you have one of these kind of things to bring it down just kind of really get the water in there this yellow is a really pretty color and I love how it works great for boys or girls [Music] okay so when you ring it out and the water is clear which it looks like it is now then you're done now I'm just going to lay this here for a second while I go make sure my washing machine is ready for watching okay our fabric is ready to be washed and I like to just throw it in the washing machine with other things that are similar colors that need to be washed I always make sure I put I want to do the color catcher sheets and if you were giving this to someone as a gift you might include a couple sheets and just mention to them this is in hand dyed and they might want to use those the first few times okay let's stick it in and then we'll see how it looks and here we go there's the finished product washed and dried and that is such a beautiful shade I love this I don't think you could find a premade one be like this in the store that is the fun thing about Dyne your own fabric you can decide what you want okay now if you were given this as a baby gift I would recommend adding some other items to it like a baby circle skirt in confetti fabric yeah maybe a bib to go with that most certainly or if you have a little boy it's beautiful minty turquoisey onesies with some little baby leggings and a little pom-pom hat wrap it on up and your gifts are ready to go so go grab a bottle of fabric dye and have fun on your adventure is to die for too much too much for more ideas and tutorials visit my website made every day calm and for all of your fabric dye craft and fabric needs head to your local jo-ann store or visit jo-ann calm I'll see you next time bye [Music]", "zCD_bssV4ak": "how's it going everyone we think it's really important that people think about wear clothing comes from and how it's made so today we're in India and we're going to go and meet some of the people that grow the organic cotton that gets turned into our t-shirts [Music] so here at Agena factory which is where cotton gets separated out with a usable part of fiber loaded so the guys are showing us here the end product of this process where the cotton seeds are pressed and this is what we end up with and it's used to feed cows [Music] [Music] completely closed the water recycling facility so the guys will eat drink [Music] when you make cotton about two percent of the material in the spinning factory ends up on the floor so we're going to go look around and see how this cotton waste we turn it to paper and that's the kind of paper we use in a packaging there for us [Music] what's amazing about that if it that's just high-quality is any other part that I've ever seen and it's just cotton and water when Perez arrived with us they're stored in a factory on the Isle of Wight and here for us are made in real time that means the printed in the seconds after their orders and because of that there isn't any waste [Music] this is the last stage in the process we're finished products are sent out to our customers but it's not the end of the journey because every product we make is designed to be sent back to us when it's worn out and we pay that material and ream manufacturer into new products that can be worn again new products like this remanufactured t-shirt that I've worn throughout the journey", "BPBCYXjfMNU": "hello everyone welcome back to my channel today i am going to show you all how i created the silk looking sublimation on the cotton and this is what you're going to need you're going to need you some satin material some heat and bond ultra hold make sure you get the ultra hold a lint roller some scissors your cotton t-shirt and your image and i'm going to be doing a kids t-shirt fortnite for my nephew his birthday is coming up he's going to be having a four night party so i'm going to make this one for him so first you want to do is take your satin material on the shiny side and go ahead and do your sublimation on top of it you're going to do it as you would do any regular sublimation you want to heat press this for 60 seconds at 400. there we go so [Music] we are waiting for that we are going to go ahead and get our length roller and remove everything from our t-shirt that static material once you cut it it does stretch straight like some strings so it's going to get all over the place all over your t-shirt but not like so bad that you can't deal with it so just remove it from your shirt and wait for that look just about almost all of the ink came out of this paper i'm trying to remove this tape here but there you go there's your image on the satin material that's how you get that shiny look then you're going to go ahead and take this material and flip it over and then you're going to take your [Applause] heat and bond and place it on the back you want to cut this down and make it a little bigger than your image but not too much bigger you can also cut down make sure you cut your static material a little bit bigger than your your image as well so you don't waste that much material and then i'm going to go ahead and heat press this onto my setting so again this is the back side and you have to actually work a little fast but not too fast with this because once this get under the heat it automatically starts to melt and stick so you want to place your material in your heating bar it has a rough side well shiny side and then it has a paper side this paper side is going to be facing upwards the rough shiny side is the adhesive so you're going to make sure that part is laying flat on your material and this paper side is facing upwards and then lay that on top of there and press that for about a few seconds not long at all so it's like make sure it fits real quick like that then once you have your image on there you're going to go ahead and cut it to size now i did not cut this out straight but [Music] so once you have your image cut to size you're going to go ahead and remove the paper from the back and that's your double-sided adhesive that's why you don't want to press it for too long just quick real quick just to stick it because if you press too long your temperature is hot like it is at 400 for 60 seconds which is too hot you will melt the adhesive it will seep through to your image and then the back adhesive will also melt and your paper will stick to it you won't be able to get it off so make sure you doesn't you don't press too long in the temp if the temperature is high like mine right now because i did the sublimation 460 you just want to close it pop it back up so here's the image remove the paper so that's the back adhesive and you're going to place that on your t-shirt now this once you press this my temperature is too hot right now so same thing just close it and open it [Music] and there you go sublimation on dark colors and cotton at that still soft smooth feels real good nice shiny dope looking nice now if you do this on a white shirt the colors are going to be a lot brighter it's going to be darker on a dark color shirt because it has a dark background but on the light color shirts it's much brighter than this but either way it's still dope no matter what kids is going to love this adult's going to love it it's just dope i'm using vvi and i will put the link in the description box so you can go ahead and support my small business and i will also be carrying vinyl soon different type of vinyl

"hi guys I'm Alison from crafting boss and today I'm going to show you how you can use heat transfer vinyl along with your Cricut to design t-shirts and other apparel alright so some of the things that you're gonna need today a t-shirt or whatever apparel you're gonna be ironing on the heat transfer vinyl and the colors that you've selected a cutting machine today I'll be using my Cricut along with my design space I also have an ironing and an ironing board ready to go the first step in the process is going to be figuring out what you want to design you're going to want to use your design space to upload images or text or a logo or other document from your computer once you have all that loaded into the design space you're going to size into the appropriate size in this case since I'm going to be designing a small t-shirt with my company logo I size my design to be about eight inches wide by just over two inches high now that I'm happy with the size and placement of my design I'm gonna come to the upper right hand corner and click the green make it button this will take me to the next screen on this screen I'm able to see exactly how my HGV needs to be positioned on my Cricut map in order to cut the full image one thing that's really important to remember for every HTV project is to hit them nearer for iron-on button what this does is flip the numbers so that you're not ironing on in Reverse after you've done this you're going to come to the bottom right hand corner and click continue at this time I go and I grab my cricket map and I get my HTV in place where it needs to go okay so from my design I'm actually going to be using two different colors so I'm going to be positioning them as they would need to be once the images in the ER you'll notice that for my pink and my white there is a white backside for both and then a clear plastic side for each you're going to want to make sure that the clear plastic is the side that goes facedown so now I'm going to work on getting my vinyl into place [Music] and now I'm ready to load into the machine and start cutting okay once your HTV is on your mat and in place you're going to want to make sure you set the dial on your Cricut to iron on once you see that iron has correctly been selected you can load your machine you'll do this by taking your mat holding it flush to the bar and hitting the blinking button once the machine has adjusted itself you'll see the crooked button start flashing your next step is to press the cricket button to start your hub [Music] once your machine is done cutting you're going to want to pick the flashing button again to release the map from the cricket the next step is to take your weeding tool and weed out your excess HTV so once your mats been removed from your cricket you're going to want to appealing your HTV off the map and start reading reading basically means removing any extra material that you don't want iron on your shirt you'll see that while I'm pulling up the extra material the clear plastic backing is staying in place [Music] all right when you're done you're going to want to keel your design off your mat all right so once your design is fully weeded the next step is to prep your shirt for ironing what I've done is I've laid out the shirt that I plan to use and I use used chalk and a ruler to measure the center of where I'd like my design to be placed and then also measured and marked the center of the shirt when going to iron my design on this will help me with placement that way it's absolutely perfect when it's done okay so your next step is to get your iron on and warm and get your t-shirt in place now we're going to take our design and sticky side down you're gonna use your graph to position your design on top of the shirt you're going to press your design onto the shirt the next step is to take either white cloth or even a white pillowcase will suffice you're going to put it over your design and then you're going to take your iron and you're going to apply pressure this process will take approximately 30 to 45 seconds depending on how thick or thin the lines are in your design and how hard you're pressing what I've noticed is that thinner lines usually take a little bit longer to iron on than thicker lines [Music] one thing I forgot to mention is that you want to make sure that with your iron settings you have it on a no steam settings when you feel like you've ironed enough you can pull up your sheet cover and slowly peel up around the edges you'll be able to tell pretty quickly if you need to iron more or if your iron iron-on letters are fastened well to the shirt you're going to slowly peel at an angle and if you find any spots that stick you just want to go back over them lightly with the iron [Music] after you've pulled it off your plastic sheet you're gonna want to make sure that you put your pillow clay case or white cotton towel back on top of the design and re iron for another 10 to 15 seconds this just ensures that your design is placed on the shirt extra well [Music] after that you're all set to wash and wear and here's our finished product if you liked today's tutorial

My apprentice...", "S6YtopdX9H8": "what up crew kid lips seaboard groovy and groovy Zeus about to welcome you to downtown LA but instead I'm going to do it today we're going to talk to you about choosing the right t-shirt for your brand we're not going to necessarily talk at all we're going to speak on a couple that we're familiar with that we can recommend suppose what you rock in the comment we want to hear other ideas other shirts that are popular other materials and things you guys want to hear about or learn about cool so we've got a couple t-shirts here today we're going to run through them we're going to show you a couple the details and then we want to hear from you what are you working with what's your t-shirt oh let's do it around for stuff is the Gildan t-shirt this is definitely the most economical garment it's really like a heavier weight garment and it has like an a box ear cut to it very traditional kind of square cut t-shirt heavy collar and heavier material heavier in a coarser material tell us which that cotton one cool thing is it does have the tearaway label so if your real label in it you can easily rip that thing off and make it your own next up we have the Toltecs if that is widely known as the Gildan I would kind of think of it as a step up from the Gildan it's made in Mexico has a more fashion-forward that cut to it it's also a little bit softer this one is also 100% cotton the cut really reminds me of like an American Apparel t-shirt but since it's not made in the US it's a little bit cheaper price point is a little bit more than a guild in but less than the American that's it that's what pill Tech's all about I have an American Apparel 2001 in my hand this is the standard American Apparel t-shirt a great shirt it's got a nice thin collar super high quality cotton construction fitted for sure like American Pie was famous for their fit they're all about the fit solid standard a little bit higher price point you know it's not going to be the lowest of the low in America so if that matters to you you know spend a little bit more on it but it's going to be worth it in terms of quality this will hold up it's a good quality shirt next I have American Apparel 50/50 tee the BB 401 it's a great product good to know super soft at 5050 I love not going to shrink as much Records got 50% poly 50% percent cotton pretty much the same cut as the 2001 but because it doesn't have that shrinkage and because it's this material it feels like it sits on the body a little bit looser or whatever reasons it's like the vibe of this thing so it kind of has a little bit less of that rigidity that on a percent cotton has this is american apparel triblend which is a rayon polyester and cotton the TR 401 very popular shirts super soft really great texture to it you can see it's just like got this amazing speckle most of the colors have this kind of Heather which I love but in terms of printing if you're doing digital printing or even screen printing these aren't necessarily going to be as vibrant as a hundred percent cotton so most printing is really vibrant on cotton keep that in mind when you're going off the prints but as far as the fit of a shirt you want throw a pocket on this thing go and do your label on it this is a beautiful t-shirt really nice quality and definitely going to pay for it you know this is the Heather tee and the cost of it made in America just like getting American Apparel's and just like you paid for that crispy fit now really excited about Bella canvas we only have one shirt from them in this video but their product is on point they have incredible fabrics they have a factory here in LA they have other factories in Honduras and other parts of the world but they use solar panels to power the factory they pay their workers well they really pride themselves and kind of environmental and economic sustainability across the board so big fan of Bella canvas and we use them for their long tea see it's got that we've done a long team review to look out for that you can check out I'm able to link to long to you if you get a little info on that but this logs he's super fashion forward right obviously long it's cut lower in the back it's you know narrow more loose-fitting you know it's not like the tight-fitting American Apparel shirt but the scalloped back is really fresh 200 percent cotton so it's good for prints it's definitely higher on the price point made by a great company but you are going to pay for that so as you're building your brand you can kind of build brand equity with a product like this they're good so we hope that this gives you a little bit of the story shirt options for your brand what might make sense for you and just help you make those decisions post your comments ask your questions subscribe subscribe to us be part of this community let's start brands together and from the heart downtown in Los Angeles these kid whips over and out honey no no no with you", "d3xLHFeX-JA": "I'm going to do a little video today on hand-washing which arm is a pain it's something we don't do very often because most of the clothes know do go in the machine occasionally you get a lovely jumper like this one here and it does say quite specifically cool hand wash and the reason it says that is because sometimes if he's sitting in the water in the washing machine for too long or if the water's too hot it shrinks the fibers and it's such a beautiful jumper these sometimes a bit worrying to pop it into the machine however today a lot of the machines do have settings on there for woolens and I do know that sometimes that works out quite well however my machine is quite old and my woolen set is 40 degrees and that would be too hot for it so just have a look my daughter's washing machines much better her woolen or hand wash setting is 30 degrees or 20 degrees that's better because you're saying hand hot because you don't want to be you can't put your handle it in it's not too hot so you know you're not going to shrink the fibers so if you do decide to take a chance on your washing machine have it on the lowest setting and the short is spin alright but if you decide you're going to give it a wash because this is brand new and I don't want to take any chances with the machine you're going to have your water Poppaea your dies or whatever it is if you use for everything you know soap powder years and as I say that's handful and then you're very gently you just sort of immerse that evening up and then you're just very conceiving soap coming out of that it's quite grubby because we keep leaving it because we can't be bothered to try and wash it and you're just very very gently just going to be almost squeezing the dirt out all right now don't leave it leave it in there at all just very gently you can see all that coming out there shows you how bad it is if you've got any little marks very very gently take the edge of your calf might be grubby just very gently but don't over rub it otherwise you're going to end up spoiling spawning your top or your jump or whatever it is and just round the neck sometimes gets a bit worse so now that's going to come out I'm just going to squeeze it okay and then I'm going to mix it so we have our water again it's not too hot otherwise at hand hog that's the key all right thing you're just going to gently squeeze out the soap powder big for the dirt coming out and we're going to take it out and then you're going to rinse it again you can see how dare tables mighty host and now we've got our water again hand temperature I'm just going to really very carefully just leave that out if you've any surface mucky water okay lastly you can see now I got water in hands yeah okay so just adding a little bit of conditioner just enough to soften it otherwise water makes it quite hard and we're going to say man altering and then just doing six really fabric conditioner okay now I'm just going to very gently squeeze actual and that lovely flavor which is going into jump and softening and making it less static addition so just know Jake you do that again don't leave it sitting on there it's absorbed that water that lovely fragrance so now I'm going to take it out I'm just going to slay them literally whatever you do don't ruin it because otherwise that is going to back up all the fibers and causing it to go crooked I'm just going to gently that water out right now this has got a lot of water in it now they do to stay in here on the instructions to lay it flat I've yet to find a way of learning that flattening and where to put it I mean in this day and age we've got our radiators you hang it up it's going to stretch you pop it on the radiator it's going to drip water everywhere what when you've got something that's so that's a lighter fabric yeah you can pop it on a hang drip-dry it is perfect to pop it out and garden all on the line or over the bath you can do that with this but just be very careful with anything like this because it will stretch okay and then you're going to lose that lovely shape what I do is I pop it in my washing machine on a very very short spin so I pop it in there and then close the door and then I've got a very low a short spin so I know that that's delicate and a short spin so I've set it out ready here and that's what I'm about to do now put it on a very short spin okay so it's how do a short spin it's still my love watering it's still quite heavy so what I wouldn't do i wouldn't recommend you get your clothes also peg it up because for stop you're going to get those awful pin marks in it and can you see the shape it's just going to be all out of shape so don't do that I wouldn't recommend either you drag it across because what's going to happen is this mark here is going to run through the back of the jumper make it look pretty awful some they say to lay it flat you could get yourself a towel or something that's lights and no color runs out of that into what you're drawing and you could dry it flat let me suggest how long is that going to take to dry I think that's pretty nightmare if you have only bought clothes and have many radiators what you could do is you could pan out your bar here and then hang it over so you don't get that Ridge running through it we will still want to stretch slightly so just be careful and I would hang if you were going to do that I'd put it serving it with kind of this so the way that this isn't too heavy bearing that's almost like you find the center of balance personally I'd rather pocket on the radiator that I've turned down with the stats if you've got radiators like this with the rich cross again I would put a towel across it till it softens these edges if you've got the edges with the round radio to the a radiator they're the best one so here's our radiators got a nice curve I've got a styling so I've turned it down it's not going to get a blasting heat on it you don't need too hot otherwise again you're going to damage the fibers you can't write like that alright but I personally be inclined to get as much of the weight off it as I can and I've been kind to dry it across like that and then just take the weight out of these arms by popping them up on the radiator and then turning it over so I hope that it's of some use to you we've got some amazing clothes in this day and age and they cost a lot of money and sometimes they all just hand wash so very very good delicate on the washing machine the newer models of washing machines are gray you like mean you've got an old one that's the way around it so I hope it's been of some help to you so freely about our videos please tune in 2033 thank you", "ylepXks8Ti8": "what's going on YouTube welcome back to the video blog one more time dogs and friends right gang real quick video in this one got some Gucci stuff in one's room once fake which one do you think it is I'm gonna give you a real quick look into these items so that you can kind of decide make a decision and then we're going to look and see how we can tell which one is the fake and which one is the real okay listen check [Music] [Music] right guys that's it you've had a look at way for the t-shirts which one do you think is real which one do you think is fake not going to keep you guys in suspense for any longer the one which is the fake one is actually this one right here this is the fake right here this is the fake Gucci t-shirt which I actually got from eBay wait for it guess how much I paid a hundred quid oh listen I want to repeat that 100 quid for this fake right here now the funny thing about this fake is the guy that was filling it was had 12 he has 12 items and he sold every single one for a hundred quid but let me just get into it let me just show you guys exactly how you can tell these two items are fake okay what first things first if we look at this Gucci label that you can see on the neck now what get you've gone and done it they've gone impor here on the neck and you can see the red stitching it goes across guys okay it goes across it's quite straight it's a straight line across if you look at the fake one they've put it in a diagonal line to the side okay that's the first thing that I would notice you would always see Gucci do it in a straight line if you look at the stitch print you can see that it's going across like that okay you can see the little kind of grooves and the lines going across and if you look at the fake one you can see there are lines going across in one direction but if you hold it this way you can also see there's little kind of slight lines going across in the other direction as well I know that's really going to be quite difficult to spot but just to look carefully at the Gucci just look carefully at the Gucci you can see that it's only going one way these little faint lines in the background it's going down look at this one again you can see it looks like it's going in multiple directions not only just down okay also if you look at the main Italy tag you can see it's in black it should actually be in white in the background and the writing is in black okay it shouldn't be all black like that the next thing is if you look at the actual Gucci logo to the front itself this is actually meant to be like a vintage inspired top so they've actually got an affair get out the colors here people on the Instagram they looked at this one because the print of the fake one seemed a lot more clearer than the original a lot of people thought this was the genuine one if we look at it the the print is just too bright man the colors too bright okay should beat up right should be a little bit faded so if you're looking at some Gucci shirts and you're seeing that it's really bright and it reads out then that's incorrect guys okay the whole print even the gold bit it's it's a little bit faded okay the other thing to notice as well is that on the screen print at the use for the t-shirt you can see that the print itself is just too thick okay is too thick it shouldn't be that thick look at the size of the real are look at the size of the fake are totally different if we look at the size of the Gucci logo you can see that it's a little bit smaller than the original okay it shouldn't be as big as this it's a little bit smaller if you don't have a genuine one next to it it's going to be really difficult to tell so that might be a tough one another quick way to look at is to simply look at the labels inside if you look at the label as you can see there's lots of information it's a nice long slim tag it says Made in Italy right there and we've got lots of information now this is a three hundred and forty pound shirt and I'm a little bit disappointed that Gucci haven't taken time out to put them all off indication labels especially now that Gucci has got a lot bigger over the years so obviously there's going to be more counterfeit especially around the Christmas time and why haven't DG implemented 30 logo or a hologram or something to help their fan base identify that the items are genuine because remember what if you have a duty top and you want to sell it and you have to receipt anymore or something like that you know this should be something on this garment that can help the second-hand market which I feel is a bit of a letdown brands like Gucci that haven't taken precautions to protect their items fully and to be honest with you it's the pre-owned clothing market that's really messing up these brands with the counterfeit so you should really be looking into stuff like that you can see there the tags are completely different really really lazy tag on the fake it says they're made in Italy by it's not it's it's made in China they even try it long tag and on the side there similar to what like Montclair have a little kind of small slim label and it's got the size large there so here they've actually attached the size label on to the label itself and it's it's it's in black so it's in the wrong color okay this very much looks like an old Gucci tag to me doesn't like one of the new ones this is the new Gucci tag right here so you can see it's a lot more slick but more modern-looking compared to the fake label I mean to be honest it's a really plain t-shirt so there's not too much else to differentiate between this two I mean what I would say is that this cotton hair is a really really nice feeling cotton it's so nice and even look at it you can see it's almost like a little bit opaque and a little bit see-through but it's got a really nice feel to it I would give it that I mean 440 it's got to have something that really kind of stands out is it where free fully hell to the no but there you go some people are going to end up you know that's that shirt right there is more or less sold out in most places now you you know really see me running around and design a t-shirt too tough to be honest with you it's not really my thing that's it going on out there lots to do so yeah hope you enjoyed it like subscribe share with a good stuff yeah peace out [Music]", "k1YXb_Fk4l0": "no guys this is not clickbait in this video we're actually going to show you how you can print t-shirts from home using a home printer that's right guys you're literally going to be able to do this at home and we're actually going to show you how to do it in less than one hour and all you need is some transfer paper some scissors some t-shirts blank ones like iron tape measure and some ingenuity know all you need is a design and some of you guys may be wondering why would you do this and to that I answer speed the speed of getting an idea to market whether it's to attend an event or in my case we actually got to get to my niece and nephews birthday party and they want me to go out there put on a presentation for them and you know just give them a good time and we literally have to leave in less than one hour from here so we got to get this entire process done and we're going to show you how to do that in a few minutes so in order to really get started the first thing that you're going to need to do start with the design process so but even before that let's set up a timer real quick one hour timer so you guys know exactly how long each of these steps take so the first thing that you're going to want to do in my case guys since I have no idea what design I want to create we're gonna get started with Pinterest and since I know that they're having a prehistoric theme like they told me hey we want dinosaurs we want all this what I want to do like the first thing that came up to mind was Jurassic Park so I'm gonna look up Jurassic Park and to see what comes out on Pinterest Pinterest is such a good place to just get ideas once you guys have exactly the direction for the direction that I want to personally take is using the Jurassic theme but actually showing the two dinosaurs since I have a niece and a nephew and they're both twins I actually want to create two dinosaurs one of them a female one of them a male dinosaur and how do we tell them apart we're gonna put a bow on one of them and and then from there we're gonna write prehistoric right on the Jurassic thing so I literally will just open up Photoshop and manipulate the original logo in order to create that and it's as simple as opening up the the actual software if you guys don't have access to Photoshop just go ahead and use the affiliate links right below this video it help you do this super quick and it's as simple as just manipulating some simple images adding a bow creating the font that looks similar to Jurassic Park and we are now good to go you know what I wanted to kind of explain how the science of this works but then I was like wait a minute my brother is actually really good so let me explain what's going on please how's it going what are you guys doing so like john was saying you guys need some explanation I'm here for that wait first of all my little okay alright so real quick before you guys get started if you're printing on black or printing on what you're going to want to use depending on which one you have different tranche of papers so the black shirts or dark colored shirts you're going to want to use this one the reason being is if you have any white InDesign it's gonna show up since printers don't print out white will just show up as white on your design but if you were to use this light color design this white that's here will actually show up as a back of the shirt because this this fabric transfer paper for white shirts is clear so just keep that in mind please don't make the mistake of choosing the wrong one for your design because don't blame him or me for your not explaining correctly follow these directions and you guys will be good alright so now the printers these are pretty big yeah so these printers there's a big difference too as well please keep this in mind you can only use these transfer papers on inkjet printers some of you may be wondering well what's a inkjet printer this is an inkjet printer and this is a laser printer well how do you know what my ass is it says laser right there okay anything do the sanity then they're gonna have to open it up and if it looks like this then its laser you have all the toner here laser printers use toner and if you don't use the right printer don't come crying to us okay cuz we've got enough without already so please use this paper and then don't use regular paper that's in your printer will not work you can't believe how many people are trying to follow in these instructions using regular print paper doesn't work I've tried it alright so we're doing the wipes colored for shirts first and with whites if you read the instructions you actually have to invert the image because if not when you'll find it on it's going to come out backwards let's go ahead and print out some printers actually have the option to revert the image too so you might be able to do it just on your printer but just to be safe just make sure you do it on Photoshop so we got this thing now you see that actually came out really good I'm actually happy sometimes our printer likes to mess things up so this one came out really nice so I don't want to mess this up so I'm gonna take them on a little time here make sure I got a good one so this one is actually gonna go that way flip it that's the reason that we inverted it question where'd you get the shirt this shirt actually yes these shirts are actually blanks from Bella canvas so we're gonna be using Bella canvas as a blank for this video they're actually an amazing sponsor of the channel and they just launched a retail side of their service so for the longest time you can only buy it through distributors or you have to be a wholesaler to get access to all they're blanks they now allow anybody watching that means you to actually buy it from their entire website and I'll actually link that right below in the description so you guys can get access to a lot of different shirts I'm using the 3001 Bella canvas sure just because it's a hundred percent cotton and that's important to note to guys is you want to make sure that you're using cotton shirts or you're using a cotton blend shirt it doesn't print on this this stuff doesn't say you could print out anything else so just kind of make sure that you stick to the cotton it's the most popular size anyways so I'm gonna just go ahead and iron a little bit just to make sure I get the right little placement right there on a chest go ahead and do that before you get started and now that that's flat I'm gonna measure out with my measure here do this thing up we're gonna measure three inches from the neckline this is going to be important if you guys are doing multiple shirts like say everybody and their mom's wanted it you can kind of eyeball it I'll do exactly like a little bit less than three inches on this one and then you just kind of Center it and did a bad job ironing that but I'm eyeballing it we're really crunched on time but since I'm making a couple people more consistent with where I place them by using that eyeball the straightness of it it's a little bit that's right look at that yeah the fluid look that's how you now you don't mess it up guys students do it right the first time and what I'll do is I'll kind of just lay this heater on there just move it around very slowly to just kind of get it set in there first think I'm ready so now let it cool and I like go for 2 min I'm gonna let it cool for two two minutes that's what it says on here guys two minutes and then peel once it's cool all right at this point in time I think it would be really good to say do not copy designs 100% and print them on a shirt like this and then go sell them at school don't do that you might make a lot of money but I think the other part is you might get in trouble for it but the other part is who's gonna find out Google's gonna find out it's right there watching you they they watched you watch me make this shirt and as you can see as long as you kind of change up the design enough you're in you're within like a copyright boundary so if you could change around 40% to 60% of the art then your kind of in the clear you could be good to go and sell these on your site but if you're just straight-up stealing supreme stickers and your freakin iron them on there guys it's not going to be cool people are gonna know it's a fake still can make some good money but don't do that and now we are going to peel this thing off so it says to start at the edges go really slow you want to go super slow on this thing any of the image start to peel up only check that out guys that looks fresh prehistoric all Mainland a printer from home you guys to see super fresh we're going to do this we're going to do the same to the dark colored shirts and this thing started [Music] [Music] yeah yeah it's good look at that actually hold up what a good test even though it's an accident it holds up pretty good it actually seems like it's not peeling off so I thank you guys for watching this video if you enjoyed it make sure you stick around for the latest videos coming to this channel where we continue to show you guys how to build your brand new business and no twentieth of these kids actually wanted to start up their own line so we might actually

Okay?", "zrdg_HoXxAA": "what's up everyone in today's video i'm gonna give you my top five t-shirt blanks for printing your vintage designs we're gonna rank each t-shirt on how it fits the wash and overall feel plus i'll let you know how much you can expect to pay for each option let's go [Music] what's up everyone so first of all thank you to all the new subscribers that are here thank you to everyone who's been subscribed the last three or four weeks have been pretty amazing in terms of how this channel has grown and how my instagram page has grown um so i only have you guys to thank for that so thank you very much so in today's video i'm going to answer the number one question that i get now if you've watched my top 10 faq video this was deliberately left out because i didn't have a good answer at the time this required me to do some research and like really source material for this video so the question we're gonna answer in today's video is what is the best t-shirt blank for printing vintage designs a lot of the tutorials on my channel are based on you know bootleg style designs vintage graphics that sort of thing so this is obviously a question that has come up a ton and i wanted to make sure i had the right answer for you guys um a few of you had already dm me and i tried to give some advice and i was pretty much correct on the advice that i gave but this basically solidified that for me what we're gonna do today is essentially rank each t-shirt in terms of its overall fit and its overall wash and feel then we're going to look at how much it's going to cost you per t-shirt blank so without further delay let's get into this list so the first t-shirt that we have is the next level inspired dye t-shirt this color is called shadow so a few things about next level um they definitely have some more like contemporary sort of fashion forward garment styles so if you're looking for garments that are a little bit more unique not just like standard t-shirts and hoodies and long sleeves the next level inspired dye t-shirt is not made in the usa um it's probably safe to say that none of the next level products are made in the us so that's something that's important to you you'll want to look elsewhere so let's get into the fit of this t-shirt first um i generally like my t-shirts a little bit more baggy especially my vintage tees so for me this is like a two out of five it's pretty tight the length is also fairly short um the sleeves are short and they're pretty tight so that's why i'm giving this a two out of five i personally like a neckline that's a little bit tighter but this was so tight that it was like hard for me to take off like i had to like struggle to get it over my head so that's probably not a good thing the wash and feel of this is probably a 4 out of 5. it has a nice fade to it it's relatively lightweight so if you don't mind you know t-shirts fitting a little bit tighter this would be a pretty good option the color on this uh definitely looks vintage to me i've gotten plenty of shirts that are true vintage t-shirts that are like this exact color so um that's great the price on this is about in the middle of the spectrum leaning a little bit more towards the more expensive side it's about six dollars per t-shirt one thing you really have to keep in mind when sourcing blanks is that you get what you pay for so if you don't have the biggest budget um you know it's going to be really tough to get super high quality t-shirt blanks that being said you know there's nothing wrong with starting at the low end of the spectrum saving a little bit more money so you can invest later you know as the brand grows and then maybe you know you'd get better blanks or you outsource for custom blanks um but this is a pretty decent starting point there's also this random green shirt in the box that sns activewear sent me so uh shout out to them for the free uh green shirt that i'll never wear so next on the list we have the comfort wash by hanes t-shirt this is um new railroad gray this was the closest thing that i could see to you know anything that sort of had a vintage look to it um yeah i mean we all know that haynes is sort of a brand that is not necessarily known for the highest quality products you know they've been around forever they're you know probably what you go to if you're like at target or walmart you need like a quick five you know blank t-shirts you maybe get a pack of hanes shirts um so this is going to fall on the lower end of the spectrum in terms of quality and price that being said since this is part of the comfort wash series um it's definitely a higher quality t-shirt than your standard hanes blank so this particular t-shirt the comfort wash by hanes is also not made in the usa so again look elsewhere if that's something that's really important to you the fit on this one is definitely better than the next level option but it's still on the tighter side i found that the length was good but again the sleeves and just the overall fit was just like too tight for my taste the wash and feel of this one is decent i'm giving it a three out of five as well um it's more so for the feel and less for the wash i don't love this new railroad gray color it sort of has like almost a purplish tint to it so yeah personally i'm not really into that this t-shirt would be a good option if you were just starting out because price wise it is on the lower end of the spectrum this is around 450 to 5.00 per t-shirt so if you're looking for a budget-friendly option that still sort of has you know an overall look and feel of a vintage t-shirt this would be a good bet so moving on to the next t-shirt we have what i would consider the best option in terms of a t-shirt actually looking like it could be vintage this is the alternative apparel um distressed heritage tea this color is smoke gray and then i also got um dark pigment blue this looked a little bit darker on the website so i don't think i would print on this necessarily but i just picked it up because i have seen um plenty of vintage t-shirts that had sort of like a blue tint to it so i just thought i would try it out but the um smoke grey option is good like it has a nice fade to it it's um you know obviously leaning more towards pure black as opposed to gray the overall fit of this t-shirt i'm giving a three out of five it's decent it's a little bit snug but the length is good um the sleeves are good they're not too tight the best thing about this t-shirt as i already mentioned is that it does have a look and feel of a true vintage t-shirt um i don't know if this will show up but there is distressing on the collar there's also distressing on the sleeves and then at the bottom on the hem here there's um distressing as well so it's very light distressing it's not um overly done so you know it's not gonna like tear or anything like that um but it just adds a nice touch and gives us a overall solid vintage feel the alternative apparel distressed heritage t-shirt is super lightweight and it's not paper thin but it is definitely the thinnest t-shirt out of any sample that i got so if that's something that's important to you guys um definitely consider this one the other cool thing about this shirt is that it's single stitched so if you know anything about vintage t-shirts um you know anything from the 80s or you know the early to mid 90s maybe even the late 90s is going to be single stitched that is extremely hard to find from wholesalers in terms of blanks so you know if that's important to you this would be a great option now the issue with this t-shirt is you know i've mentioned all the things like the distressing and the single stitching now that comes with the price so this is going to cost you about ten dollars per t-shirt which is obviously at the other end of the spectrum in terms of your budget like you really need to save up if you're going to use this blank next on deck we have the bella canvas fast fashion heavyweight street tea bella is a company that is very uh conscious of trends and this is uh this is dark gray by the way um but they're very conscious of trends i remember when like the drop tale t-shirts were super hot like 2013 14 something like that and they were one of the first wholesale companies that i saw who offered them and i think maybe american apparel did as well at the time but uh yeah they're pretty uh fashion forward and um they are made in the usa so i think that's um a big reason why they're popular at least here in the states i probably use bella canvas more than any other company in terms of um you know designing for artists and bands so let's talk a bit about the fit of this t-shirt um i'm giving it a five out of five because it is a boxy style t-shirt and it's fully committed um some of the other t-shirts kind of played with the idea it felt like of being like a boxy style shirt but this one fully commits to it the sleeves are loose the neckline is good it's you know shorter than your standard t-shirt but it fits looser so yeah i have to give this a 5 out of 5. i'm probably just going to wear this blank in terms of the overall wash and feel i'm going to give this a 3 out of 5 only because this is all about printing vintage designs and if i saw a design printed on this shirt i wouldn't think that it was vintage whatsoever um i would i'm almost leaning more towards i'd give it like a two and a half if i get i was doing half but i'm just giving it a 3. like it has a good feel to it like it has a nice weight um it's it's on up the lighter side of heavyweight if that makes sense like it's it is lighter than the other heavyweight shirts that i got um but yeah i would give this a a three out of five one thing i will say about this t-shirt is that it's very well constructed it's super high quality i think you can say that about most of bella's products um so if you're looking for something that isn't necessarily meant to look vintage you're more concerned about the fit and having that sort of boxy style look to it this is going to be a really great option for you price wise we're pretty good like this is around five dollars and fifty cents to six dollars per shirt so overall considering the quality of this garment and um you know the style of it i think that's pretty decent so if that's sort of the vibe you're going for um yeah i would highly consider this option the final t-shirt blank on this list is my personal favorite it is the comfort colors garment dyed heavyweight t-shirt and this color is pepper so i don't know if you can see this but there's a small like lighter area here that's because i like this shirt so much that i wore it a couple times and i already stained it i'm not like a super grubby guy i just spilled some  on it so whatever but that just goes to show you how much i like this t-shirt so i feel like comfort colors has sort of made a name for themselves because of their pigment dyed garments um you know they have hoodies long sleeves unisex t-shirts women's t-shirts and they all have this pigment dot process essentially pigment dyed means that the colors are washed down so that they will age and soften over time so that really lends itself to the overall vintage uh feel and look of these t-shirts another cool thing about comfort colors is they offer a variety of colors so along with this pepper uh shade i got graphite as well and this sort of has um more of a purple tint like i was mentioning earlier and then i just got black just because i was hoping that it would be a little bit more faded uh than this but it's pretty much just true black um that being said this is my favorite um for a few reasons the overall fit in my opinion is a five out of five um this fits almost like a like a 90s bronchum t-shirt if anyone's familiar with that um they're like one of the most iconic vintage uh t-shirt brands from the 80s and 90s and this sort of has that like loose like boxy esque feel the sleeves are on the looser side of things so for me like that's pretty clutch this is honestly close to like a contemporary brand like yeezy or like fear of god where like if you wear a xl t-shirt normally like i have to buy large and yeezy or fear of god because they're an oversized fit so this is sort of on par with that the wash and feel of this one i'm gonna give a four out of five um i would give it a 5 out of 5 but i'm comparing it to that alternative apparel example which you know had the distressing throughout and it was a little bit more thin you know to the touch so it had more of a vintage feel but this one is still really really solid again this is just my personal preference for what i'm looking for in vintage t-shirts um anything that i buy i like to be a little bit looser feeling i don't like  that's super tight on me so um yeah this is gonna be my go-to if and when i do a brand you will know that they are comfort color blanks finally the price on this one is pretty good it's five bucks a t-shirt so it's kind of right in the middle of the spectrum so i mean overall man like between how it fits and the feel and wash and the price this would be my go-to so that is it for today hopefully i was able to answer this question that so many of you guys had um i did give suggestions to a few of you prior to making this video and um if you look at my message it was pretty much right on i i suggested comfort colors and bella so you know that's what kind of came up on top today if you like this

it for today i'll see you guys in the next video peace you", "BNwbg5lxhOA": "[Music] hello guys and welcome to our second tutorial this time I will show you how to do t-shirt printing at home using your ordinary flat iron I receive a call from a friend a week ago and he's asking me if he could use a flat iron in t-shirt printing and I said yes as long as for personal use only if it's for business I will recommend to buy a proper heat press to save more time in transferring the design so without any further ado let's start our procedure first we need to create our design let's open our Adobe Illustrator and open the piles which I have downloaded earlier and make it personalized let's make a new canvas by selecting a pore size 21 centimeter weed and 29.7 centimeter for the height change the unit is centimeter and choose CMYK as a polar mode raster effect should be set to 300 PPI it is more easier to create a design nowadays because of the Internet you just need to search in Google or Pinterest to get some design ideas there are even websites that are offering free designs like free vidcom or big TV sitcom I'm normally using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator in designing because it is more user friendly than other software in the market these are the parts that I have downloaded earlier I'd suggest that you measure the shirt printing area PERTs so you'll be able to adapt the size as per the requirements [Music] let's copy the text and paste it on the main design check thoroughly the past because there are times that some images are having some issues like this one the colors are misaligned [Music] to make it more personalized let's put the name like which boy change the font and the color to match the design you can also resize it if it's necessary I put a white background to emphasize with a boy however you can also have your own preference we will be cutting the design manually hence it is needed to put a stroke or a line at least 1 millimeter or 2 millimeter offset path set the stroke to at least 5 pixel and grayish color this will be our guide during our cutting process [Music] it seems that everything is set so let's wind it now as I standard procedure in finding make sure to select the proper printer especially if you have two or more printers installed in your computer change the document size to a pore size and select plain paper as your paper type as I have mentioned in my previous tutorial paper type depends on how you calibrate at your individual computer then select highest quality since we're using a sticker paper we don't need to reverse our image before printing it out then finally press the print button you [Music] [Music] make sure to cut the designs by following the team grey line otherwise it will be also transferred on the sure to impress [Music] you can use this or cutter as for me I prefer to use cutter emergency sirs it is easy for me to control it enter boy the jagged cap outs cross-species source if you're going to use a cutter as much as possible try to cut it lightly so the blade will not cut the back of the sticker just like this one [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] everything is done so it's time to transfer this to our t-shirt let's try to map the design toward t-shirt to make sure that it will fit actually this should be done earlier before we cut it seems okay so let's start the class where this undershirt let's remove the mat and change it with a thicker fabric or towel to support the shirt set the flat iron the maximum heat and make sure to remove the steam options otherwise it will ruin our sticker iron a towel to make sure that this flap and this sure to remove the moist of the shirt [Music] [Music] put at least three centimeter gap between the neckline in the design make sure that is in the center of the shirt use an extra plain white paper or any fabric to protect the sticker to touch directly your flat iron hold for a couple of seconds while I'm using the design to melted this event a strap earlier in your shirt remove the paper and check if the design is pasted properly check the edges to make sure that all the edges are platen properly on the shirt then iron it once again for the final patch [Music] now we're done with our personalized shirt [Music] I hope you enjoy watching and learn something new in this tutorial

I am going to be showing you how i sublimate on a t-shirt using cricut design space I've had this printer for about a month now and using inkjet this ink on the supplement paper and their tech support they walk me through step by step how to convert this printer into a sublimation printer if you're looking to get into sublimation I really highly recommend going through inkjet bits if you have questions on how to turn a printer into a sublimation as they they walk me through everything with without a problem because I was actually afraid to do it on my own so if you're looking to turn your

[Music] [Music]", "tOZiNkbNUbI": "it's always been our mission to find new\nways to make some of the softest tees as humanly possible well we just launched\nour new sueded tee that makes our already soft fabric even softer so what\nis the sueded tee tee and what makes it feel so amazing it all starts at the\nthread level with our Airlume combed and ring spun cotton we created an\nincredibly smooth surface by using long staple cotton fibers and eliminating all\nimpurities once our heirloom fabric is knit and dyed it goes through a special\nfinishing process to get that sueded hand feel the fabric is run through a\nsueding machine with ceramic tip bristles that pull out tiny fibers to\ncreate that peach fuzz feel when you run the fabric surface over this bristles it\ncuts and tears and pulls millions of tiny little fibers out of the fabric\nthreads and it creates a really soft even hand there is no chemicals involved its just a mechanical operation the ceramic tipped bristles something unique to BELLA+CANVAS are what create that sueded face of the fabric without causing pilling of\ncourse printability is incredibly important so we tested multiple\nvariations of this sueded fabric until we landed on a version with both the\nsoftest hand feel and the best print ability so LETS PRINT LA was one of the\nprinters that was given a sample of the suede fabric to print and some of the\nthings that we were looking for was the evenness of the sueding right we've\nprinted on tees before that haven't uneven sueding and so what happens is when\nyou're printing to the hand feel it's a little uneven you can definitely tell\nthe difference one thing that we're also looking for is just the fibrillation\nthere's been other sueded T's that we've used in the past where the sueding\nprocess isn't even throughout the shirt and so some of it is raised a little\nmore than another and so with this one as we were printing we found there was a\nconsistent print across the tee every time we didn't have to prep our inks\nwith any additives or do anything outside of the norm to get a nice even\nconsistent print we did the same thing we did for any\nother 100% cotton tee and the results were great if you're looking for a\nhigher quality retail tee the sueded tee is something that's gonna give you a\nnice soft hand feel which is gonna help elevate kind of your brand and that kind\nof that market that you're looking for it's softer than anything like it on the\nmarket so you'll have to feel it and see for yourself Be Different", "2AOnHPxoLDs": "[Music] setting everybody boy big brando and today let's talk about a standard street wear t-shirt now as most of you guys know if you've been watching my videos or you've seen a bunch of my videos where i talk about blank t-shirts i always say it's a personal preference when i say personal preference i mean people have different ideas of what quality is how shirts supposed to fit what they want to offer their customers what they like in a t-shirt what they don't like all of that stuff plays a big role in ordering blank t-shirts but on this channel i always talk about running a brand from home i don't know much about running like a fitness brand or running different brands like with unisex t-shirts and stuff like that i don't offer any female t-shirts one of the big reasons why i don't offer women's t-shirts is because there's way too many options and you got to remember every woman is shaped differently and at the same exact time women respond better when they can try something on because sometimes they might wear medium but then sometimes in certain shirts they might wear a large or might be opposite maybe they wear a medium in certain shirts and then a small insert shirt so that range is very hard to gauge i personally don't offer exchanges and returns on my online stores so it's hard for me to send a shirt to a female that has to try it on before she buys it or if i'm vending it's hard for a female to pick up a shirt and be like yeah this is gonna fit me because sometimes their chest size might be a lot bigger or a lot smaller but their body size might be the same as somebody else so it's gonna make wearing the shirt a lot different also there's tank tops racerbacks halter tops crop tops unix v-necks crewnecks slouch necks there's so many different options when it comes to female shirts that it is very overwhelming so for myself i stay away from women's t-shirt and that's why i stay away from them because there's way too many options and it's hard to get the sizing right for females on top of that printing on t-shirts for women very hard also you gotta remember i use a standard rule of putting four fingers down laying the design down on a women's shirt a lot different if they're using a v-neck you can't do that five-finger down thing because then the design is going to land over their chest and then it might stretch it out depending on the size of their chest also if you put a design on there sometimes the chest might be a little bigger where the design wraps under and it's not really being showcased sometimes it's stretched out sometimes it doesn't land in the correct spot to be legible you know what i mean so for those reasons i stay away from women's shirts so let's get back and talk about a standard streetwear t-shirt a lot of people say hey i want to start the streetwear brand what's the best blank to you you got to remember there's a ton of different ideas of what street wear is you got that high fashion street wear stuff that's like fear of god and off-white and all those other brands and they might have some sort of like premium feel and then you have street wear that's kind of like the old like hundreds and diamond kind of skate street wear sneakerhead streetwear type of stuff so for myself i like to take the middle road of streetwear the streetwear companies that did like graphic tees like the hundreds and diamond and crooks and castles and a lot of these other brands undefeated all of those brands have really really cool standard street wear feeling t-shirts right not really like the high fashion stuff but it's also um like an everyday wear t-shirt for me that's what i like to compare when it comes to street wear that's what i'm thinking about so if you were trying to create a brand like that or you wanted a t-shirt similar to that i would suggest the all style 1301 this t-shirt right here let me see if i can focus in all style classic all style 1301 same exact thing very standard cut very standard fit very generic t-shirt so for myself if i was doing a street wear brand or i needed just a generic style t-shirt that's true to size it's not form fitting it's not really super baggy it's not heavy weight but it's not lightweight it's kind of in between it'll be considered a heavyweight t-shirt but compared to like real heavyweight t-shirt like pro club this shirt is not as heavy as that feels good on body straight generic fit a lot of your favorite brands use this same blank a lot of your favorite brands based their blanks around this t-shirt like if you ever took this t-shirt blank to the mall and you compared it to like the hundreds logo t-shirts or if you compared it to diamond or whoever else you're into or any of those skate street wear type brands chances are it's going to look and feel similar to this 1301 and i'm not saying i know exactly what blank every company uses there's always people that hit me up and they're like hey man you know what blank does off-white use what blank does supreme use i have no idea i just go based off of feel and fit right so if you wear a lot of supreme stuff obviously you know the fit and feel of a supreme t-shirt so buying a blank you would compare it to that right i personally don't wear supreme t-shirts so i don't know what it feels like i don't know what it fits like i don't know who they use but i have bought stew c t-shirts before i've bought the hundreds t-shirts before undefeated crooks and castles a lot of these other brands i've bought their t-shirts i've seen what they feel like i've wore them like a lot of brands in hawaii defend hawaii hawaii's finest a lot of these t-shirt companies use the same exact t-shirt these all-style t-shirts man so i know the fit i feel i i understand it i know my size in it if i was doing like street wear type of brand this is the t-shirt that i would use and this is the t-shirt i recommend a lot of people when they say they want to start a streetwear brand and they're looking for a good blank this is a perfect example of a t-shirt to use now there's a lot of people that are gonna be like well all right what's the best workout t-shirt or what's the best tri-blend t-shirt or moisture wicking t-shirt i have no idea i use 100 cotton t-shirts for all my brands i like to buy the t-shirts that my customers like to wear none of my customers wear tri blends or dry blends or moisture wicking shirts so i have no idea the best advice i could give if you wanted to do that or if you wanted a form-fitting t-shirt or if you're looking for a more lightweight ring spun cotton t-shirt is to order samples you could go to companies like alpha broder and tsc mission imprintables sanmar all of these third-party suppliers carry a bunch of different brands under one roof if i were you i'd create accounts with them and then i'd buy one t-shirt that is you know bella canvas and one that's next level one gilding and one all style in my size and the color i wanna offer and then i'd wear it press on it test it out so that way you have an understanding on what t-shirt you want to offer and what you're looking for out of these t-shirts asking some idiot on youtube like myself what i prefer and i tell you all style 1301 you go and you buy a shitload of these and you're trying to do like some fitness brand or something like that geared towards people that work out and you're like man this t-shirt's heavy it's thick it's stiff i don't like this shirt you asked me what t-shirt i recommend and i'm giving you a t-shirt that i recommend but you have a different idea of what you want so you have to just do your own research when it comes to these blank t-shirts this video is for the guys that are talking about street wear style t-shirts i'm not talking high fashion street wear i'm not talking i'm talking just that regular ash street wear regular generic fitting t-shirt you can't go wrong with this all style 1301 the classic all-style t-shirt you can also find these at your local swap meet a lot of times they go by aaa because the name is all style apparel and activewear triple a aaa their old logo used to be like a big a and then there's like three little a's in there that used to be their logo so the t-shirt was called aaa if you want to swap me t-shirt warehouse stuff like that they'll have them that's usually the generic you know three for 10 t-shirt that you could buy or whatever it is so once again basic street wear generic fitting t-shirt all style 1301 is a good t-shirt i know there's going to be a bunch of people what do you think about the gildan 9301 or whatever t-shirt that could be comparable i have no idea right i have no idea about any other t-shirt all style is the what this video is about that's what i'm talking about all style right now i don't get paid by all style this is just because i always get comments asking about i want to start a streetwear brand what t-shirt do you recommend it's easier for me to just make this video and be like check it out man if i was starting streetwear brand tomorrow i'd be using all style 1301. reason being is just because it's true to size people that wear extra large will fit extra large people that wear double x will fit the double leg they understand this fit and feel because chances are they already have this t-shirt in their closet from some other brand this is a very generic t-shirt a lot of people use it same goes for like gilding a lot of people use gildan i hate the sleeves on gilding i hate the way that it's cut i hate that boxy feel of a gilding t-shirt this one fits me a little bit better that's why i use them all right hopefully this helps somebody out out there because there's a lot of people that hit me up if you ever cruise the comments of any of my videos chances are there's some guy that wants to start a streetwear company and he's looking for this blank and that's why i made this video was for those guys that are in my comments asking about streetwear t-shirts now if you're asking about what blanks all these companies use i have no idea i have a system on how i figure out how certain companies use their blanks it won't work for everybody but if i ever needed that information there's ways that you can look on youtube and find that information you got to do a lot of digging and searching but sometimes it's out there you know what i mean and the way i do it is whenever any of these companies have uh warehouse sales or whatever it is i look for videos of people going to their warehouse sales or sample sales or whatever it is and then they have the [ __ ] boxes stacked up in there if they're using all style t-shirts all the all style shirts are bagged up put in these all-style boxes they cut a hole in them so you can grab the shirts you're seeing what blanks they're using you know what i mean it'll be a shitload of gildan boxes or next level or or bella canvas or whatever company they use that's how i figure out what brands use certain blanks is just by searching their warehouse sales or end of the year sale or sample cell when they show their warehouse you're seeing the inner workings of what they're doing that's how i find out what certain brands are using what blanks because all the boxes are there right there's just like a shitload of all style boxes in their warehouse chances are they're using all style you can see the logo on the side of the box but there's also a lot of these companies that use their own cut and so program they have their own custom cut t-shirts and they're not using a generic blank or a already made blink so what you have to do is you have to try to compare certain blanks to what they're using to get something similar but it won't be exactly the same it's like trying to compare hats to new era hats you're not buying a blank new era hat what you're doing is you're buying a blank hat and trying to compare it to a new era hat trying to figure out how it fits and feels how the how the bill looks how high is the crown all of that stuff so same goes for somebody that's using you know their own cut and so program their own custom t-shirt program you're gonna have to get blanks and then match it up to that if you own that brand's t-shirts like i said if you own supreme and supreme uses their own custom t-shirt program you would have to buy some blanks and then match it up to your supreme t-shirt to see if you could kind of match up the fit and feel and get something close to it but you're not going to get something exactly like it if they're using their own program so hopefully this helps somebody out out there if you got any questions leave it in the comments follow me on instagram big brando tv catch you guys on next one man yep", "IvxaCYaYnD4": "hi everyone this is rene romeo of rene romeo calm today you're going to learn eight different ways to repair a hole in a t-shirt so my t-shirt has three holes in it because the kiddies have been climbing on me and if you have an old t-shirt that's been relegated to the back of the closet well go ahead and grab it and use one of these eight methods to repair your t-shirt so you could start wearing it all over again so I'm starting with an old t-shirt here and I have a very sharp pair of scissors so I'm just going to go ahead and poke eight holes into this t-shirt now what this is going to do it's going to allow me to put each one side-by-side and then I'll go ahead and I'll actually launder this when it's done just to see how well that repair held up now I'm using a 100% cotton t-shirt today and six of the repairs that I'm going to make are going to involve some type of polyester or polyamide along with some type of adhesive to make that repair but if you want to keep this 100 percent cotton then you're going to grab 100 percent cotton thread and you're going to make those repairs with a needle and thread now I've taken the t-shirt I've turned it inside out so I'm now working on the backside of the t-shirt I've taken a piece of craft paper and I've slid it underneath the hole and this is going to actually make the hole a little bit more visible for me to work on and it'll protect the ironing board cover from any adhesive that I might get on it so I have three different versions of 100% polyester fusible interfacing my versions come in a lightweight medium weight and heavy weight and that also means that there's a lightweight version with lightweight adhesive medium weight adhesive and heavy weight adhesive so we're going to see which one works best on our 100% cotton t-shirt so here's hole number one now I'm taking a toothpick and I'm just going to kind of coax this together a little bit before I get going here and try to get this hole to look as small as possible once I do that I could take my iron set on the wool setting and with steam at this point so we're going to try to get this hole to come together as much as possible and iron it nice and flat flat I have a square piece of interfacing cut out this one happens to be the lightweight version so the one side that has the adhesive on it I'm going to stick this straight down on top of the backside of that fabric and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a press cloth now my press cloth happens to be flannel it's just a white piece of flannel and it's dampened with water and wrung out I'm gonna take this damp cloth place it over the top of this and try not to move that little piece that I cut out then the iron comes straight down wool setting with steam and it's going to sit there for 10 seconds and I'm going to look at this and see how well this stuck to the fabric now that seems really good now I'm going to press it from the right side and see how well I did in comparison you can kind of see that it's still there so let's see if we could do one better on the next one and this time I'm going to take a little more time with the toothpick making sure that this fabric gets close together before I iron it this time I'm going to go back in and I'm going to make sure that these little pieces of thread are almost touching before I press it one more time now this is my medium weight interfacing I have the adhesive on this side and I decided to trim this in a circle this time just to see if there was a difference so it gets placed straight down on that fabric I have my press cloth again that's nice and damp that gets placed right on top of it and then the iron goes straight down for 10 seconds looking pretty good I'll flip it over and iron it from the front side now this one looks a little better than the first one so let's see if we can get even better with the third [Music] so the next two t-shirt repairs I'll make are with a fabric called poly amide and this poly amide is really a wonderful aquella and the reason why is because it's adhesive on both sides so the first thing you're going to do is you're going to make a patch out of some type of fabric so mine happens to be flannel I don't have a corresponding knit fabric that'll match this so I'm going to use flannel for this then I'm going to take the poly amide and I'm going to put it directly over the top of this patch and I'm going to cut it exactly the same size now here's the patch so I have the flannel underneath and I have the poly imide on top and I'm going to place this directly on top of that hole just like that then I'll take the pressed cloth and I'm just going to lay this down again this is damp and the wool setting is chosen on my iron for ten seconds now hopefully you can see here that this isn't the greatest way to make this patch because it doesn't exactly adhere to all the edges unless you have that cut out perfectly so let me show you a better method to make a patch for the next hole so this next product is also a poly amide but this one happens to be nice and evenly transparent all the way through and it comes with some parchment paper so this parchment paper is going to help us get the best patch possible so this next version of poly imide is really transparent all the way through and you know what you can't stretch it as much as the other versions so it may be --have a little bit differently and I'm also going to be using a smaller patch this time just to see in comparison how all these work out in the wash so I've trimmed it out a little larger than the patch I'm going to set it right on top of that so I've got my craft paper my patch the poly amide and then here's a little piece of the parchment paper that came with the product so this is going straight face down on this I'm taking my wool setting on my iron and setting that in place for ten seconds and I can lift that off and now this has become the perfect patch so what I can do now is I can trim this all the way up to the edges and now I can very carefully peel off that parchment expose the adhesive underneath now I'm ready to go ahead and patch it on to this hole well that looks really nice you know what the entire surface is stuck all the way around let's see what it looks like from the front so the next product I'll demonstrate for you is called mending tape now this is the product that people would probably point you toward if you told them you had a hole in your shirt you needed to mend and the thing about this though is that it's for woven fabric so that means like a dress shirt type of fabric it comes in all different colors depending on whatever type of shirt you have but the thing about this is that the reason why it might work for this is because the adhesive is a heavy adhesive on the back of it so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and cut this out and I'm going to do a small circle again because I think that was the most successful of all the patches so far well this one might be the best yet it's the thinnest but you know what it took about 30 seconds of dry heat to get here along with a little bit of pressure so the last two holes are going to be repaired with some cotton thread you see I have some cotton thread I have a very very thin needle I have a magnifying lamp you don't need this but you know what it makes the job so much easier you can look through the magnifying glass and you can actually see every single thread as you go through so now that the thread is through the head of the needle I'm going to the long end of the thread and I'm just going to make a knot so I have thread between my index finger and my thumb I'm going to wrap it around just like so and then I'm going to take it up and twist it and you can kind of see I'm kind of twisting it there take my third finger pull it nice and tight and now I've got a nice knot right there so your engineers the same exact way so the real trick here is to grab one thread from one side and then one thread from the other and pull it through just like that now don't do it so that it's you know so super tight you just need to grab one little end here and we're not wanting to pucker the fabric so much so you're just going to go ahead and kind of go back and forth until you can't see the hole any longer so just back and forth here grabbing a little loop on either side running that needle through the loop till you get to the end of the hole all to finish it off I'm going to go through this kind of mending area not into the t-shirt fabric itself do one loop and then try to pull that a little bit tight and then come back through go through the loop and pull that nice and tight now I can trim it off the repair is complete but let's see what it looks like from the front side well there you have it let's iron it and see if we can get that to flatten out now I'm on the last hole I'm working on the back side again I'm getting this all set with my toothpick and I'm going to press it in place this last one I'm going to do with fabric glue so your typical fabric glue that you can get at the fabric store I'm just going to dab it on there and let it dry so here's the t-shirt fresh out of the dryer now I have this on a normal wash cycle along with a high heat dry cycle so let's do a side-by-side comparison on the backside of the shirt and see how these repairs held up so here's the 100% polyester lightweight patch here's the 100% polyester medium weight patch here's the 100% polyester heavyweight patch here's the poly amide patch that we made from the loose weave fabric here's the poly amide patch that we made from the transparent fabric and here's the mending tape and here's the hand stitched version and then there's the glued version so you can make your own mind up about what looks best from the back and what you think is going to hold up over time but then let's look at the front and they all look pretty similar these patches are going to actually prevent this t-shirt from unraveling a little further but you can see as you get a little heavier weight in your patches from underneath you're going to notice the outlines so in looking at this t-shirt not only from the front but from the back I really think that there are three successful repairs here the first one being the 100% lightweight polyester patch this one actually blends in seamlessly with the t-shirt fabric you can't even tell it's there the second one I would say would be the glue now the glue there's only one problem with it it dries shiny so if you have a little opening in the front of your shirt you might have a little glisten of glue that you can kind of detect there but otherwise it looks really great and the third one is the hand stitch version now this one is going to definitely be the most secure over time they look identical all of them from the front so you can choose whichever one you want and here your old t-shirt and wear it again and again and even during laundering this will hold us and if none of those options appeal to you well then you can go ahead and you can get a bunch of beads and you can bedazzle your shirt wherever you have a hole well there you have it eight ways to repair a hole in a t-shirt you know what this is such a great life 101 lesson you're going to extend the life of your

Adam Sachs from ed hardy the first thing that almost always has to go is the collar so we're going to cut that off and remember you can always cut more but you can't cut less so just cut right on the other side of that seam holding the collar on and stretching is another thing that we're really going to be doing a lot of the next thing we're going to do is decide where we want our cuts so we're going to take some right down the middle here in order to do that if it's not on someone and you can't just see where the middle is we're going to fold it in half and line up your shoulder seams and your side seams if you have them if you don't just line up your arm holes and your shoulder seams and try and get your shirt nice and smooth like so then it's all about cutting little stripes into your shirt in any shape you want so we're going to go strip strip right down the front about the same width until we get under the bust then we're going to make them a little wider so we don't mind showing the belly a little bit you want to keep them about the same distance apart but you can just make them deeper cuts again you can always cut more but you can't cut less also want to cut off the bottom of the shirt and then we're going to stretch so now I'm going to show you basic weave stitch for t-shirts so you want to take reach underneath your first one pull up your second one and then pull it over so that you can pull the third one up through the second one and down then grab your fourth one up through their third one and just carry on like that it's very simple all the way making sure you don't skip any just reach your fingers through grab the next one pull it up carry it on all the way once you start getting towards the end whether that's the top or the bottom what you're going to do is bring your last one through you can either cut it off and tie it to itself around each side or get another strip of fabric from somewhere else on the t-shirt like along the bottom stretch that out which will make it much longer and loop it through there and then this is going to tie around behind the neck and to do that we can make a little hole in the back here for now we'll probably put another weave in the back and then this can attach to the top of that one and it will be glorious but in the meantime we will just tie it around to the back this has been mo of mo West creations ciao Hey", "TvnGuNt06b8": "what's going on guys Cameron with monument limited welcome to our brand new garment review series today I'm going to do an in-depth breakdown of one of our most

will talk to you guys next time take care you", "GxZVoImp03M": "[Music] hey everybody and welcome back to the embroidery news network my name is sue and I am from oml embroidery and today we're gonna be stitching on an old t-shirt so what I'm doing here the first part of placement now we are placing this design on the back of the shirt so you want to get the middle of the shirt and usually with new shirts you can just hand press it down and get a nice line but as you can see here it's pretty hard to do I'm gonna try it anyways just to show you guys print out your template now if you're using PE design 10 you can also print out your snowman sticker it's not a sticker but it'll show you exactly where to place it general rule of thumb and the person tried on this shirt it's three fingers down from the collar so on the back or the front depending on what you're doing so I'm trying hard to place this and I'm really having a hard time and there's really no point in doing it if you can't have it straight and have it perfect so yeah I fiddle around a little bit I mean hooping is if you can't hoop something or if you don't hoop it properly the embroidery is gonna end up looking crappy so I placed it down and I thought hmmm that's okay but it's it looks a little off to me so I grabbed a ruler feel free to do that and I realized it was about an inch off on one side so scrap that that's not gonna work I don't iron so and I and I think when you use the seam at much steam it might stretch it out a bit so I double-check everything and I'm like now so here's a little trick to doing it take off your sticker because it doesn't matter anymore turn your shirt inside out grab some cut away so cuz you won't cut away on a t-shirt you have to base it down a little bit of spray and press it down give it a good press so it stays carefully turn the shirt the correct way now fold it in half now take your time because you want this line to be straight and you can finger press it and the cutaway stabilizer underneath look at my sharp line how cool is that that is how you do it the better way so I fold my template so it's easy to line up the Snowman sticker I had to straighten it up just a little bit and voila how fantastic is that I measure it just to make sure cuz I'm really picky loosen up your hoop I'm using the 8 by 8 hoop for ragnar which is my brother 1000e and make sure it's straight in and I press down and the hoop was too tight so you wanna loosen it off so you don't have to use too much force now with the Snowman make sure that it fits properly in the hoop you don't have to do it straight or anything but you do have to make sure that it fits in take it to the Machine pop it on make sure take a few minutes and make sure that nothing is gonna get caught up I double-check everything now tell your machine if you have a brother I think it's an X you have the Snowman stickers tell your machine where to find it it's scanning it right now and it's gonna straighten up the design because I didn't hoop it straight and it finds it no problem make sure you have enough lighting and once you do that it tells you to take the sticker off now do this really carefully I look like I'm being careful but I kind of got under there and I made a little wrinkle and I didn't like that because I'm again really picky so I just smoothed it out remember we have a little bit of spray on it so I just smoothed it out and it's not gonna be any problem so let's get stitching [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now how awesome is that look there's no puckers it's an old crappy t-shirt and I did some beautiful embroidery there's no problems with it it's it's not puckering it's not bubbly it's not anything that's how you want your embroidery to look so remember hoop carefully and get your designs to look exactly like this on t-shirt so thanks everyone for watching I hope you guys like this video I hope you guys will stitch out one of these designs on a t-shirt and try it and I'll see you guys in the next video you", "t1UyJYES1J8": "hey guys welcome back to my channel\ntoday's video I am super excited about I'm going to be showing you how to make\nsome custom print t-shirts so anything you can think of you want on a t-shirt I'm\ngoing to show you how to do it without any transfer paper needed and I

A\npair of scissors, an iron box and obviously your prints. You need to have\nprints because this is what you're essentially sticking onto your t-shirts.\nSo for my prints I just typed 'aesthetic' pictures and chose the ones I loved and\nonce you have a selection of prints just cut off the white bit because\nyou're not going to be needing it I printed this off on normal paper so no\nspecial paper is needed for this at all once everything was nice and cut, I had a\ncouple of prints to choose from which actually took about five hours to choose\nwhich prints I wanted to use - that is not the point of this video but now I'm\ngoing to show you what went wrong the first time I did this. So I followed all\nthe steps and when it came to ironing my prints down, I ironed away. I took my\ntime, I was not rushing this at all but when it came to lifting off the\nparchment, 'they ask you how you are and you just have to say that you're fine and you're\nnot really fine and you just can't get into it because they would never understand so now I'm going to show you what\nexactly to do to make sure your print sticks onto your t-shirt and you have a\nfire t-shirt in your hands. So all I'm doing is I chose a print I liked and I\nwanted to stick onto my t-shirts this is the second one obviously the first one\nbackfired and all I'm doing now is I'm wrapping the print in some cling film.\nOne mistake I did in the previous attempt is I only wrapped part of the\nprint in some cling film you're supposed to wrap the entire thing because\nessentially what you're going to do is melt the plastic onto the t-shirt and\nthis is what makes the print stick properly so make sure you cover this bad\nboy from all angles possible so if your wrapping paper is not sufficient on the\nback just add some like I'm doing and you will be good to go. Cut off any\nexcess, you also don't want any lumpy bits when you're ironing it down that\nway there's no bumps on the back of your print and once everything is nice and\nwrapped you're going to position your print exactly where you want it, take\nsome parchment paper and iron your prints down. So what I did in this\nsituation is I started with moderate heat and then ironed it a bit,\nmake sure you focus on the edges that way it really sticks down and then I\nturned my iron to the highest setting and started ironing. This in turn burnt\nmy parchment paper a bit but it's completely okay because the marks do not\ntransfer onto the t-shirt so just be careful and make sure you're doing this\nas you lift your iron up that way the t-shirt does not get burnt but this is\nwhat burns the plastic and melts it onto your t-shirt and this makes the print\nstick so I do recommend doing this instead but just make sure you're super\ncareful that way you don't destroy your t-shirts once everything was nice and\nironed, I took out my parchment paper and my print was stuck on I celebrated\nat this point and I really love how this turned out and this is the final result.\nOne advice to you guys if you're going to wash this, make sure you do not wash\nit in the machine, hand wash this and air dry it because the machine is going to\ndestroy the print. So yeah, this is my first t-shirt. I love it. It says 'captured\nbecause one day they'll all be memories again' and I also did this with a pink\nt-shirt and I just used the 'Good Times' print. I love how vintage-y and aesthetic\nthese prints are and I just love how this two t-shirts turned out. Anyway, that is it\nfrom me today thank you so much for watching let me know how many t-shirts\nyou're going to be making... I recommend a thousand so yeah! Get to it right now. I\nreally hope you enjoyed watching this video and I'll hopefully catch you in my\nnext one but until then - agressively make meme t-shirts, I am with you on this! Love\nyou guys, see you soon. Bye!", "140vNQ3pDVw": ">> In this video,\nwe're showing you how to make your own\ncustom clothing designs. Surprisingly,\nall it takes is a little bit of bleach\nand some freezer paper. [Captions by Jeffrey D. at Y Translator] Here's what you're going\nto need to get started. You'll need a shirt\nor other article of clothing that is mostly made of cotton or linen. Other types of cloth may not\nreact very well to the bleach. A household iron,\nsome freezer paper, a spray bottle,\na razor blade, and of course, the bleach itself. I have here printed-out\none of the King of Random logos, and this is the design that we're\ngoing to put onto one of these shirts. To transfer this design from a piece\nof paper onto the cotton shirt, we're going to be\nusing our freezer paper. Freezer paper is just paper\nthat's designed to wrap stuff up before you put it\ninto the freezer. It's pretty much\nplain paper on one side, the other side\nhas a shiny waxy surface. When I first started\nresearching this project, I thought it was probably\ngoing to be better to just use something\nlike contact paper. Contact paper is a sticky clear sheet\nwith a backing that comes in rolls. I thought it would be\nreally good for transferring a stencil design\nonto a shirt. But it turns out,\nthere are some real advantages to using the freezer paper instead. Because one side of the freezer paper\nis like normal paper, you can write on it with pens,\npencils or markers very easily. Contact paper being plastic, that doesn't work so well. We're going to stick\nour freezer paper onto our shirts by using heat from an iron. And again, that's one of the advantages \nof the freezer paper, is it doesn't stick until you\nhit it with the iron. So you have all the time\nin the world to perfectly position it just where you want it. Combine that with the fact\nthat the roll of freezer paper is usually really big\nso you get great coverage. Which prevents\nover-spray onto your shirt. Let's tear off a good size sheet\nof our freezer paper and get ready\nto transfer our image. You want to take the design\nand place it face down onto the waxy side\nof the freezer paper. Despite the wax coating, a little bit of masking tape should do a great job\nof holding your design in place. Now you can see that with\na black printed design, you can see right through\nthe freezer paper on to what you're going\nto want to cut. To help increase the life\nof both your razor blades and whatever\nyou're working on, it is best if you have \na cutting mat that you can use. Now, how this is going to work\nis you'll cut out everything that you want to\nbleach onto your shirt. It's kind of going to be\nthe reverse image of what we've got here. I'll be using a black T-shirt\nand the bleach will turn it lighter. If you cut the design entirely\nout of the freezer paper, it may be difficult to keep\nall of the pieces aligned just where you want them. Small pieces will be harder to keep\nflat when you lay them on the shirt. For example, if I were cutting\nout this T and K piece which is all joined together, I would cut most of the way around it. But in the corners,\nI would leave a small piece where I don't cut. That will leave the design\nconnected to the rest of the paper until I'm ready to remove it. You may want to trace over your design using a pen or pencil \non the freezer paper, or maybe you prefer\nto just use your knife, and cut directly onto the pattern. Either way works just fine. Using a sharp knife \nwith a good point, carefully cut out \nall the pieces from your design leaving a few\nconnecting points so that they don't completely\ncome off of the freezer paper. With our design prepped,\nwe now need to move on to prepping the T-shirt\nto be ready to be bleached. Before you bleach\na new article of clothing, you want to be sure\nyou wash and dry it to remove any coatings\nthat may be on it. We now want to cut out\na piece of cardboard that can fit inside this shirt. That will both help it keep its shape, and prevent any bleach from getting through\nthe front onto the backside while it's being bleached. Since my cardboard does have\ngaps in a couple of spots, I'm just going to cover\nthose with some duct tape. [Music] Once you have your piece of cardboard cut to the right size and shape, fit your T-shirt over it. It's not necessary to have\na piece of cardboard that fills the entire shirt the way\nI have it on this one. It really only needs to be large enough\nto fit your whole design on it. But this way, I'll be able to use\nthe same piece of cardboard for any other design\nI do in the future. With the cardboard inside the shirt, you want to take your iron\nand press the whole thing down, so it is nice and smooth. This will help the\nfreezer paper stick to it better and your design\nwill turn out nicer. With the T-shirt nice and flat, it's time to position\nthe design on the shirt where you're going to want it. First, let's remove our pattern\nfrom the back of our freezer paper. Now we can position it\nright where we want it, and this part right here\nis why freezer paper is much better than contact paper. 'Cause for contact paper, it would stick as soon\nas it touched the shirt, and you wouldn't be\nable to reposition it at all. The freezer paper covers a pretty\ngood amount of the T-shirt, but it is possible\nto get some over-spray. The bleach solution could\ntravel through the air a little bit, and land on parts of the shirt\nthat you don't want bleached. So it's a good idea to make sure\nthat every part of the surface is covered. You can use some old newspapers, some additional cardboard or more freezer paper to do this. [Music] With the whole t-shirt covered, it's time to remove the pieces that we've cut out from our design, and expose the t-shirt underneath. Carefully go through your design and lift up the cut-out\npieces by the edges. If you've made your connecting point\nsmall enough, they should tear through easily. But if not, you can very carefully\ntake your razor blade and finish the cuts. Be sure you don't cut down\nthrough the T-shirt itself. [Music] Just to be sure that\nnone of the edges have peeled up so the bleach will get under them, let's hit it with the iron again. You may have noticed\nthat I haven't removed the second half of the design yet. And that's because\nwe're going to try and make this\nin two different stages, so we have two levels\nof brightness on our t-shirt. We'll use 1/2 bleach and 1/2 water\nin one of these little Spritz bottles. We'll also want to be sure that we have\nseveral paper towels easily at hand. [Music] Be sure you don't have any excess\nbleach on the outside of the bottle. [Music] With the mix of bleach\nand water in the spray bottle, you're now ready\nto spray it over the design. I really like these Spritz bottles because the evenly \ndistribute your solution without laying it on too heavily. If you get too much of it on, it can soak through the shirt, and down under\nthe edges of the design. So you really only want a light\nmisting on the surface. We want to dilute the bleach\nbecause chlorine bleach by itself is actually powerful enough that it can dissolve the fibers of the shirt. If you apply it directly,\nit can eat right through the cotton. We'll spray on our bleach solution covering all of the\nexposed parts of the design. And then immediately, we'll dab off all of the extra\nliquid with some paper towels. We do that to make sure\nit doesn't soak down into the cotton, and under the design, and to try and keep our freezer paper from getting too wet. If it gets soaked,\nwill have a very hard time pulling it off of the shirt later. In a matter of seconds,\nwe can see the effect of the bleach on the black shirt. It's obvious that some areas have received\na little bit more bleach than others. So we'll do a second layer\nand try and hit those darker spots more. Our first layer\nhas changed pretty well. Generally you can keep\nadding more and more bleach and give it a little bit more\ntime to react and it will\nget lighter and lighter. You have to decide\nwhat color you want. When bleaching a black shirt,\nit will usually start out sort of orange, and then as you get more\nand more bleach on to it, it will turn peach\nand then almost white. After a few separate\ntreatments of the bleach, the first half of our design\nis where I want it. Now, we'll peel off the right side\nand cover all of it with more bleach. That should leave us\nwith the left side being very light and the right side\nbeing sort of a dark orange. If you want a very light,\nalmost white color, it can really help to iron over\nthe bleach as it's drying. Be aware though,\nthis puts chlorine gas into the air. So you should never do it indoors, where you'll end up breathing the fumes. Once your design is to the\ncolor and shade that you want, it's time to remove all\nof the masking and stencil, and stop their reaction\nusing some cold water. The pattern doesn't look\nquite as good when it's wet. But after a quick trip to the dryer,\nit should look good as new. If you don't feel like using a stencil, you can use other methods\nto apply the solution onto the shirt. You can spray it\ndirectly from the bottle. Maybe flick some drops on with your hand, or even use a paintbrush. If you want to add the bleach\nto a lot of the parts of the shirt but just mask off\na few portions, you can use tape, and either cut out\nyour design from that, or just lay the tape down\nin the design that you want. Something else that's\nfun to do with these shirts is after you've stripped\nthe color out with some bleach, you can add a little bit\nmore back in if you want to. I have here  some alcohol based ink. This is basically blue\npermanent marker ink, and some rubbing alcohol. I'm going to add the rubbing alcohol\ninto the Spritz bottle and then several drops\nof our blue ink. At that point, we should be able\nto add that on using the spritzer to our shirt\nonce it's been dried. To test how much color we get,\nlet's try spritzing onto our freezer paper. We can see that the blue is very subtle. It doesn't change the color\ndrastically or quickly. That's better if you're \nspraying onto these shirts because if it's too concentrated, and you don't have your sprayer\npositioned exactly where you want it, the color is going to go\nin the wrong spot. Having a very dilute color\nas much more forgiving as you can go in and add little bits of color\nat a time until you reach the shade you want. YouTuber NightHawkInLight\nhad a video on bleach shirts as well. And in his, he had a shirt\nwith a rocket on it. I thought that sounded\nlike such a cool idea that I wanted to try on my own. [Music] As a reminder, don't store your bleach \nsolution in a plastic bottle long-term. The bleach could do damage\nto the bottle causing it to leak. This method of shirt designing is fast. It's fun. And combining a bunch\nof these techniques, you can come up with\nsome really cool stuff. Guys, there's still more\nfor you to see.

with print to cut then you know there is a difference between doing a light-colored shirt or a white shirt and then a dark colored shirt or a black shirt so we're going to be using pin plus gear fabric transfer sheets and in this package you get 10 white or light transfer sheets and then five of the dark or black transfer sheets so I usually always buy this package because if you buy a regular package but this is Avery but if you buy a regular package separate it would still be fine with the dark sheets in one package and then the other package will be ten of the white sheets for the same price if you choose to buy this so we are using this this is my favorite favorite brand and this is what I use for every single print to cut shirt I do so we're gonna go ahead and get right into the video okay so as usual we're going to start with the blank canvas I'm gonna go ahead and go to upload I'm gonna go to upload and browse what one of the images were doing the other ones are right loaded set Cricut just gotta find the second image right here always complex that gets all the details of the picture and we're gonna keep [Music] see the thing was you're gonna go ahead and keep the whole picture continued safe now we're going to upload these two images for our shirts okay so as you can see over here to the right hand side you will see a triangle a yellow triangle and that is telling that something is wrong with this image and you need to fix something so you're gonna go ahead and click on it and it says image to large reduce image size to six point seven five by nine point two five four let's so with this image we're going to go up here and go to lock/unlock it everyone do exactly that six point seven five by nine point two five once you change the sizing of the image that triangle no longer appears there so now you know it's good to go to be able to make it and then with this image we're actually going to do six by six okay then now that we have the size that we want we're gonna go ahead and go to make it alright so these are the two images so with our first image the bear we are doing that on a light gray shirt and we are using light or white fabric cheats so we will have to mirror this image and now the second image you see which is mother Goose club image with that we are putting on a black t-shirt so with that we're going to use dark fabric sorry dark fabric transfer paper so we do not have to mirror the image so I'm gonna go ahead and first thing first we're going to continue got a sense of printer we are going to print this without the bleed all right so I'm actually not going to use the crickets that cut out the image so I'm going to go ahead and go to the next print to cut image everyone send that to printer take the bleed off and go ahead and print that and so now we just cut it with scissors as you will see in the video okay so this is where I do my printing that so as you will see if you read the directions for the transfer paper you will know the difference between the dark transfer paper and the light transfer paper because the light transfer paper will have red lines on the back and the dark transfer paper will have blue lines on the back so when you print you wanted to make sure the blinds are facing out which way you call in but the lines will be facing out your printer so same thing you put your paper in the lines will be facing away from where it prints out it because you wanted some prints on the plain side of the paper so for your red army for your light fabric chairs like I said once again red lines on the back for the lights or the white inner shirts or fabrics and then blue lines on the back for dark shirts or fabric alright so now we have both images printed off the printer and I'm not going to use the Cricut cicuta I'm going to go ahead and just cut it by hand with the scissors so you'll go ahead and cut it now for these if used to cut it with the Cricut it's going to cut the black line so you could either keep your black line and keep the border and just peel it and use it that way or you can go ahead and cut it so I'm gonna go ahead and cut that off though okay so these are two different images this one is the light transfer paper and you know that because remember we have the red lines on the back and then this one is the dark transfer paper and remember that because it has some blue lines on the back okay so first one we are going to do is the light transfer fabric or the light fabric transfer paper sorry okay so you're just gonna lay your image lay your image on the shirt or whatever blank you're using okay and then even though it has the sheet on there to protect it I still always use my what is this my I cannot think of the name of it right now okay whatever so go ahead and press it okay so here we go pressing it we're gonna go ahead and just do 20 seconds for right now so with your light fabric transfer paper it has to cool down before you take it off or it will mess up the image so we're going to go ahead and just put it to the side while we do our second t-shirt so as you may have already seen from my onesie video usually for kids t-shirts almost always have to use this receiving blanket just to raise up the middle of the shirt so with your dark fabric transfer paper you want to turn it over so this comes off so you want to take this off before you press it onto the t-shirt sometimes it's kind of difficult to get you guys there now you're just going to lay the image onto the t-shirt all right so in here um package you will get protective sheets these and you're going to go ahead and use that to go over your image this will be twenty seconds as well all right now that it has time to cool it down I'm gonna go ahead and peel it very slowly here's the outcome for the light fabric transfer paper and then the dark fabric transfer paper okay so that was the print to cut tutorial I hope the video was helpful and I hope it was

which is literally so easy to do you can choose any graphic that you liked even a photo so let me show you what you need to get started so the first thing that you're gonna need is a blank shirt you can use any shape that you have I'm using a slouchy tank by Bella canvas this is kind of an upcycled for me because I've used this shirt so much this is style number 88 38 and I really love this brand because it has a huge selection of styles colors and super soft materials the next thing that you'll need are iron-on fabric transfer paper you can find these at pretty much any office store Walmart's and they work with any inkjet printer and these specific sheets are designed for light fabric and all that really means is that the color white will not transfer so anything that's the color white will come out transparent and that worked with my design but if you have something in your graphic that's why that you want to stay white then make sure you buy transfer paper for dark fabric then you're also going to need an iron to activate the transfer paper as well as a pillowcase to protect the surface that you're using some scissors and then I actually use an exacto knife to get into like the little grooves that I couldn't get to with the scissors but definitely not required and besides that you're also going to need an inkjet printer and a computer with a program that can reverse an image and I'll show you what I mean by that in a moment so the first thing that you want to do is choose your graphic that you want printed on your shirt and I already chose my graphic so I'm just gonna pull that up in dobe Photoshop no shows to keep mine pretty simple I just typed out the word blessed using the de-stress type of font now has like a 70s vibe to it so once you got your graphic you're going to go up to the image tab down to image rotation and then flip canvas horizontal so then your image is going to be reversed and that's exactly what you need so once you have that you're gonna go to print and first you want to print this on regular paper so you want to make sure that everything is good make your adjustments on the regular paper because the pack of transfer paper only comes with six sheets so you definitely want to make sure that everything's finalized once you have everything good to go you're going to print it out before the printer settings you definitely want to change the quality to best and then for the type of paper I chose fotomat paper and this gave me the best results with no streaks or some of these other settings and gave me streaks so definitely see what works best for your printer and then hit print and it should come out the way that you hide it on the computer so if all looks good and you can start cutting it all out [Music] [Applause] and then there were some areas that were pretty hard to get to with scissors so I just used an exacto knife to get like in between your letters and everything and it worked out really well then lay out your pillowcase on a hard surface like a table or the floor and then just start ironing it out to get all the wrinkles out and then place your shirt directly on top and start ironing that as well make sure that your iron is set to no steam and that you emptied all the water then you're gonna place your graphic on your shirt with the print side facing down to make sure everything is placed where you want it to be and to make sure everything stayed in place I literally just took the iron and sat it on top of the print for a few seconds and then just start ironing back and forth up and down using a good amount of pressure and making sure that the iron is on the hottest setting for cotton and according to the instructions if it's a full page you should iron for about three minutes it's half a page 90 seconds and a fourth page 45 seconds so I earn mine for about a minute and then let it cool for two minutes and then start peeling it off from one of the edges and that is it guys my last piece of advice is to make sure that you wash on cold and hang dry but if you do use tumble dry make sure you use very low heat thank you guys so much for watching I hope you guys like this video and if you did please give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel for more DIYs I'll leave all the details in the description box below but if you have any other questions please feel free to leave them

just feeling blessed so I hope you guys have a wonderful day and I truly truly appreciate it's watching Mike [Music] you", "Rw-rseVKSSg": "T-Shirt Folding HACKS Fold Shirt In Under\n3 Seconds 4 Ways To Fold Tee's [0:00:00]\nThe t-shirt, a classic item in every man\u2019s wardrobe, but how to properly store your t-shirts\nbetween wears? Well, it turns out there are actually at least\nfour ways to properly store and fold your t-shirts. In today\u2019s video, I\u2019m going to teach you\nall four methods including a trick to fold a t-shirt in less than three seconds. Method number one. The basic fold. This is the simple method that most people\ndefault to. Lay the t-shirt out flat face down, fold the\nshirt in half from left to right. Then, fold the sleeves in towards the middle. Now, fold the shirt in half from top to bottom. You can either stop here or fold it in half\nagain to take up a little bit less room. The advantage of this method is it\u2019s simple,\nit\u2019s well-known, and it\u2019s equally useful for storage or travel. The main disadvantage is you\u2019re likely to\nhave some wrinkles and creases develop where you folded the shirt. The second method is known as the marine roll\nalso called the army roll, but, hey, I\u2019m a marine here. It\u2019s popular in the military for its efficient\nuse of space. Lay the shirt out flat face up and then fold\nthe bottom of the shirt up three to four inches. Smooth out the fabric to minimize wrinkles,\nthen fold the shirt into thirds, start on the left side folding it over the center,\nthen take the left sleeve and fold it back over the center. You\u2019ll now do the same with the right side\nbring it over before folding the right sleeve back to the center. Now, you\u2019re ready to start rolling. Start at the collar making sure you keep the\nroll nice and tight. Once you get to the end, you\u2019ll undo the\nfold you created at the bottom of the shirt and tuck it over each end of the roll to keep\nit in place. This roll takes up very little space, so it\u2019s\nperfect for small storage spaces or you\u2019re traveling light with a small suitcase. The disadvantage of the marine roll is it\ntakes more time than all the other methods. Method three. The hanger. The third method doesn\u2019t require any folding\nor rolling, you\u2019re simply going to put your shirt on a hanger and place it in your closet. Make sure though that you use plastic hangers\nfor this. Wire hangers can cause the dreaded nipple\neffect which isn\u2019t a great look and you don\u2019t want basically to have to throw your\nshirts into the dryer or launder them again so that the cotton goes back to its original\nshape. The main advantage to using the hanger method\nis you\u2019re going to avoid the creases and wrinkles that are sometimes caused by folding. In addition, if you\u2019ve got a closet with\na lot of space, this may be a great place to put it versus into a dresser drawer. The disadvantage of the hanger method is if\nyou have a small closet, it\u2019s going to end up taking a lot of space especially if you\nhave a lot of t-shirts. And if you travel quite a bit, you\u2019re going\nto have to take the shirts off the hangers and then fold them. Method number four and my favorite, the two-second\nfold. So, this final method creates a great-looking\nfold so fast it\u2019s practically magic. Lay the shirt out flat, smoothing it out to\nremove any wrinkles. You\u2019re going to imagine two lines; one that\ngoes across the middle of the shirt, one that goes top to bottom between the collar and\nthe sleeve. Where the lines intersect is going to be point\nA, the top of the shirt is going to be point B, and the bottom of the shirt is point C.\nPinch point A with your left hand. Make sure to grab both the top and bottom\nlayer of the fabric. Pinch point B with your right hand, then bring\npoint B down to point C. You will now uncross your arms and lay the shirt face down on the\ntable. Use the table to fold the shirt until you\nhave an even amount of fabric on each side of the shirt. If you want, you can fold it again in the\nmiddle to take up a bit less space. With a bit of practice you can become lightning\nfast with this method. There is truly no faster way to fold a t-shirt. There you have it gentlemen, four effective\nways to fold and store your t-shirts. So, whenever you need them whenever you\u2019re\ntraveling, you\u2019ve got them ready to go.

page this exact thing that i got and this is what came in the mail okay yeah that's all i'm gonna say about that so needless to say it took me a little while to get to the point to make this video because i had to get a spray bottle because oh terrible does not have a spray bottle so i finally got my lazy butt together and i got a spray bottle from walmart and we're gonna pour some of this into here and we're gonna go on to vexels.com and pick out an easy design and print it out and see if we can submit it on a shirt using the solution on a cotton 100 cotton shirt and see how it comes out

right let's get this started guys please excuse the ashy hands had to go over to the rental property and um change my my tenant had an issue with the hot water heater there was a um there was a hose disconnected hot water heater that um had a hole in it so squirting out water a little bit of water so i had to uh get a new hose from lowe's and replace that no problem easy fix oh look at this this fits perfectly nice i like it when it's perfect like that what's up dub nation hit that like button when you get a chance so guys now we are just going to go ahead with our pre-treatment of the shirt we have 100 percent poly what am i talking about we have a hundred percent cotton gildan shirt right here we're gonna pre-treat with this solution handy-dandy solution that we purchased um a good idea would probably be for you to get a lint roller and roll all this stuff off but i'm not going to do that we're just going to do it like as if uh a worst-case scenario type of thing to give you guys a full idea of what would happen just gonna try to get the hair off though so it's already shaked up we've shaken it up already good we're just gonna try to um oh we gotta put this on spray okay there's a single mist off and there's our misti mist with the three sprinkly lines things all right so we kind of want to spray it on evenly kind of sort of it's kind of weird a good thing would be is if you had a roller but we're just going to spray it on and latches i think that's should be enough i don't know and we're just going to let it dry all right i think we gotta let it dry i'm not sure because this thing came with no instructions came just like this so we're just gonna lay it over our sublimation printer to dry for a little while while we go to our next step guys for those of you guys that use this before let me know if i'm doing it right because i really don't know but um it didn't come with instructions so this is just like this video is just like if one of you guys would have got it in the mail and you guys are just going along trying to figure it out right common sense you have to get a spray bottle and spray it on so i think you got to let it dry that's common sense you

polyester on press one on a treated shirt and one on a non-treaty shirt so you guys could compare the two but i think we already know how it comes out when a non-treaty shirt so i might not even do that i don't know we'll see polyester text print r that's the type of paper i'm using high quality photographic i'm gonna leave it on photographic because when i put it on vivid it tells me to change

launch and when print manager launches uh successfully cued what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and select print manager to bring it to the front most open program that way when it pops up we

the treated shirt for the non-treated shirt and guys we are letting our heat press heat it up and while while we let our heat press heat up i'm gonna um go ahead give you guys a little short story real fast so pay attention okay the other day a company named ouidro contacted me on instagram and they actually sent me out a pair of their 300 dollar premium step rails for the 2020 jeep wrangler unlimited for those of you guys who have jeep wranglers and are interested in step rails like the ones that i got from ouidro then i'll put the link down below so you guys can my amazon affiliate link down below so you guys can purchase yourself some of these step rails it was a really really easy install to be honest with you guys if you know if you're a little bit savvy about um about tools and things like that you know how to work way around just nuts and bolts that's it it's just bolt-on easy no cuts had to be made or anything i did it myself in a parking lot the other day i'll also put the link right here as a matter of fact of the video of me installing the whole thing so you guys can check it out it's on the other channel subscribe to that channel by the way but um it was an easy easy process and i got to tell you guys i was i kind of did not want to change the um the the step rails but now that i've had them on for a little while i really really like the look of the aftermarket step rails and i'm glad that i went ahead and took them up on their offer and got those step rails installed on my 2020 jeep wrangler sport unlimited guys more upgrades to that truck is coming up is coming up because we have big plans for that truck i was supposed to do some stuff this summer but due to cover 19 everything just fell through and it's ruined our plans as far as you know the whole audio system with the microphone and everything those you guys don't know about that look in the channel um in the other channel and you guys will see all the upgrades and stuff that i did to the jeep and more upgrades to come like i said so guys this heat press right here this heat press right here you guys saw the review that i did on it and all the things that i didn't like about it and the more and more i use my godzilla press which we're not pressing on today we're using our regular craft press plus whatever the heck this is called that i really more and more dislike to be honest with you guys i do not recommend you guys um buy this i would much rather you buy a walleye press from heat transfer house which i should get one to demonstrate it for you guys matter of fact i will get one to demonstrate for you guys because why not um if i'm gonna tel um advise something that that's a worthy purchase for you guys i should have it in front of you guys to show you all right so stay tuned for that while i press coming up but they're always sold out they're really really good presses heat transfer house link down below anyway i'm always saying i feel like anyway guys um i really feel like the more i use the godzilla press with the auto open feature this 15 by 15 is even though it has a slide out drawer it's just not it anymore guys it's just not it anymore i'm going to suggest it if it's in your budget if it is in your budget and you um are in the market for uh your first heat press that you just go ahead and buy an auto open press or save your money just a little bit longer and go ahead and buy the johto on a heat transfer house that's that's a good auto open press solid build and i think that's what we're going to switch to guys i think i think this is going to go bye-bye and we're going to get the jodo press if we can get a 15 by 15 because they're always sold out too because they're extremely extremely good presses um so we'll see what happens all right let me let this thing finish heating up and we will do our test i'm excited are you excited you should be excited so while the heat press is heating up i went ahead and sat the shirt on to the platen because it's still a little bit damp and i think it's supposed to be dry i'm not sure but i'm just going to go ahead and hover a little bit hover shout out to the hover squad it's going to go ahead and hover and if that does anything um it should help it dry so yeah just hover a little bit and i'll be right back after it's heated up aida productions so now our shirt is dried bone dry to the max so now i'm going to go ahead and put in my one layer of butcher paper let me roll it up a little bit like i always do pardon the hand guys i should get you guys another angle but this will do i don't know what happened right here i got a little something right there on there on the shirt but it's okay because we're just doing a test put that butcher paper up in there up in here nice and flat all right grab my first llama all right slide this out because i don't want to start heating up all right now we're going to go ahead and put this llama on here like so boom good enough looking good feeling good line up sideways yeah it looks good all right put this at the top slide it in we're going to do a 60 second press on it 20 second 24 second mark guys and because i do what a lot of youtubers don't do of course we're going to waste a shirt i know it's going to come out crappy but we're going to put a one of the limas on a untreated shirt just so we can compare the two for those of you guys who have never seen what it looks like to sublimate onto 100 cotton untreated all right go ahead and let this thing up boom all right let's see what we got here okay didn't get caught that's good look at that he already it's kind of like stuck like sticky okay i'm actually i actually i hold on now guys let me do the other one first aida productions hannah i'm kind of uh surprised now kinda surprised kinda pleasantly pleased to be honest with you i am pleasantly pleased let me go ahead and roll this up i'm gonna get the other one ready just so you guys know that there is a difference between using that substance versus not using that substance all right so what i did was i sprayed it on there the downside to um having to spray it on yourself is that you're not you can't with a spray bottle get an even coat of of of that material on there so they do have something available that's like a kit keep on forgetting i got the slide out it has a kit where like you can spray it on and no roll it on and it rolls on evenly i know that's available on the market somewhere i've just never used it i think stan banks shouts out to stan banks have uh has i think he's used it in the video before but i don't have that available right now to me obviously so boom pre-press let's put on our second llama and we get you got to lay it on there because we pre tr press the shirt so it's already warm which means it's already going to activate the sublimation stuff lay this down on here slide it back 60 second press for this one aw productions some of you guys are going to purchase this stuff man i think some of you guys are going to purchase this stuff it's not that bad even though it didn't come the way it was advertised and feeling some type way about that but it's still you know we'll see 60 second press just to be fair i did leave the first press on a little bit longer so i'm going to leave this one on a little bit longer now we're going to bring it up all right and no sticky no sticky uh sound like the other one all right actually not bad either not bad either but let's compare the two guys let me get this heat press out the way so we can compare the two adap productions all right so let's talk about it let's talk about it let's talk about it you guys should immediately be able to see the difference in what's what 100 cotton non-treated cotton transfer still bright and vivid on the paper very very light on the shirt lightly transferred but nonetheless it did transfer personally i think that if you want to sublimate onto 100 cotton if the design calls for it i would think that if you want a vintage look and you guys would have to test this out and do it for yourself to see what i'm talking about i'm going to try to get some close-ups for you guys but i think it's very much worth still sublimating on 100 cotton non-treated that's what i'm going to say now whether it's going to wash off after one wash i don't know i would think that it maybe maybe not based off of the back i mean you could see that it did kind of go into the fibers but it's not as vivid as the treated shirt but if you want a vintage type of faded type of look which that might you know that might be a look that you want for a shirt i don't know but i think it's uh if you're going for that look that you could possibly still do this non-treated now let's go to the treated one and let's see uh the results and i'm gonna kind of have to give you guys a close-up of this because there's a lot going on with this all right so the first thing that's going on with this thing that i'll tell you guys i can see that even though it transferred better than the non-treated shirt i still have blotches blotches on the transfer where you could see like the spray that i sprayed on i guess that's why they make pre-treatment machines when doing dtg you know and even on the transfer you can see all the blotches from the uh from the chemical that we transferred onto the shirt and even when you touch the shirt versus the other shirt you can feel like almost feel like a stiff type of chemical on there right versus the one that was not pre-treated all right so um yeah still a lot on here not as much as this not as much as this one but still a lot all right there's still a lot of ink on here not as much as not as much as this one all right but if you ask me the faded look is a cleaner image it might be a lighter image it might be a faded type of effect of an image but it's still a cleaner image because it doesn't have these blotches in it so that's something to consider guys um but i don't know if you want to do this if you can think of a creative way to apply this stuff so it doesn't put these blotches on there which you guys are creative you can come up with something use a paint brush or something roll it on there so it's even i think that's what the system has it has a paint brush or something like that if you could use a paint not a paint brush but a paint roller and that will put an even coat on there you know maybe something that's not fuzzy or something like that something's cloth i don't know but um it could work let me know what you guys think what is the proper answer for the question when somebody asks you can you sublimate onto cotton is it yes because clearly you can very very light lighter than the treated shirt and way lighter than a polyester shirt but i don't know if the camera's doing it any justice but it's still usable you ever see like a vintage papa smurf shirt or something like that or my little pony something like that or faded it's usable guys i really think that this is fine if it's the look that you're going for you know it's light but it's still it's still usable i've bought shirts like this like the real soft light cotton shirts like almost thin that have that vintage type of faded look it's still useful it has its purpose now of course does this spray-on stuff work the answer is yes because it's bright it's it's somewhat vivid you can see the colors better but you have these little blotches which means you need to find a better way to apply the uh material or the liquid to your shirt guys so i hope this video was helpful hope it wasn't too long i hope i didn't talk too much which i know i did if i have to if you have to say you if you have to question yourself on something that you then you know you did it okay so give this video like subscribe to channel comment down below let me know what you guys think about all this stuff that i did let me know if it was useful

follow me on instagram instagram.com backslash aw productions [Music] peace [Music]", "WUqvMrRxA_I": "hey folks review and make review face here and today we're making our whites than whitest [Music] so I wear a lot of white t-shirts and like a lot of guys I have problems with these white t-shirts getting discoloration underneath the armpits now know this is not a cleanliness issue this is a deodorant and antiperspirant reacting with your shirt issue so I had a lot of white shirts that have some big ring around the underarms and I'm not sure what to do to change that so what I did is I went online and looked at a couple of different alternatives of things I could do to get my white t-shirts back to looking new again so I've got four different alternatives here that I'm gonna test out today and see which one works the best number one is one of the Internet's favorites for cleaning white t-shirts and it's a combination of hydrogen peroxide and dish soap there is let the cat out of the bag number two is going to be our control noting not adding anything to it number three is OxiClean we're gonna try oxy clean on the armpits see if that helps and number four is bleach oh god how can a man be so dominant Lin which is what everyone says you shouldn't do to deal with yellow armpits let's see how bad it gets so the recommendation for all of these is to mix it up put it on to the stained part and let it sit for 24 hours so that's what we're gonna do we're not all of these sit for 24 hours and to test if there's any difference between scrubbing it in and just letting it sit on the left side we're gonna be scrubbing on the right just letting it sit we'll let that sit there for 24 hours and then we'll wash and see what the results are all right so we're gonna start off with t-shirt number one note the one on the collar they're mixing up a little hydrogen peroxide and dish soap that's lavender dish soap in case you're wondering so we're gonna do is flip that t-shirt inside-out grab that left armpit and we're just going to dump on some of that solution that I very carelessly measured together and then give it a good scrubbing with what I learned later was the wrong type of scrub brush for this and then of course we'll flip it over get that other armpit out dump the rest of the solution on there and then just let that soak in kind of dab it around make sure it covers up as much as possible and then let the whole shirt sit for 24 hours and see how it turns out the next day pull that up and toss it to the side shirt number two of course has nothing going on so we'll ball that up and throw it off to the side as well shirt number three coming up and this is our oxy clean shirt so we're gonna grab that left armpit again flip it inside out give it a good soaking with the oxy clean and give it a good vigorous scrubbing now I probably didn't scrub these quite enough but it was for the test I think you did all right for the scrubbing we probably could have scrubbed a little harder and of course go over to the right again just give it a soak but no scrub just gonna dab it in there make sure it's all saturated and then of course ball it all up toss it to the side again and finally shirt number four and this is our bleach shirt so we'll grab again that left armpit and very carefully so I don't splash all over my clothing I'm gonna pour on some bleach onto that stain and again give it a good vigorous scrubbing with our very stiff brush flip it over do the same thing on the other side except of course no scrub and just let it sit for 24 hours and get it ready to go into the wash and we'll see what happens tomorrow all right so pop in fresh out of the dryer shirt number one this is our internet concoction and look at that there is a clean spot in that armpit it's got rid of some of the stain now the non scrub side didn't do as well so we definitely want to scrub those shirts shirt number two coming out of the dryer here and we'll take a look at that armpit surprise surprise no change that's probably because we didn't do anything to this shirt looks exactly the same looking on the right side where we also did nothing of course no change what a schock shirt number three and again this is our oxy clean shirt so take a look at that left armpit and it's definitely lighter stain with a big clean spot in the middle I'd say that that is a definite win on the non scrub side maybe a little bit lighter but you know what that stain is still pretty prominent so again scrubbing required and finally shirt number four this is our bleached shirt and we take a look here and you can see there's some big bleach stains there and the stain is a little lighter but the rest of the shirt looks really really bad and then of course if we take a look at the non scrub side the stain looks still really dark and lots of bleach spots that is a downside that one is going right in the red container alright so here are our four shirts now as I showed you as they came out of the dryer the non scrub side did significantly worse on every single shirt so the first conclusion we're gonna come to is whatever treatment option you use make sure you take a scrub brush to it okay alright so we're gonna go through from worst to best obviously the worst one is the one that didn't get any treatment at all it is as as ever no change there at all second worse of course is the bleach no surprise there even on a white shirt you can see you get bleach stains who knew now there is a slight reduction of stain right here but the shirts all blotchy this one's going to be used for rags definitely don't use bleach to try to take out stains on you my t-shirts good then we come to our to actual competitors we have our oxy clean and we have our mix of hydrogen peroxide and dish soap and I've got to say it's a close race but if you look at the clean spots here and here this is where the scrub brush really went to town they're pretty close I think the stain is slightly lighter it's a little yellow err but it's slightly lighter here but I would say either one of these solutions would work hey that's pretty good pretty good pretty good hmm it's perfect so OxiClean maxxforce you know it is gonna be the more expensive option than going with the hydrogen peroxide and some dish soap those are things you probably have around the house give it a good scrub let it sit for 24 hours and you're gonna do all right but at the same time OxiClean didn't do too bad of a job either either one of these are going to be a much better solution than either one of these after that there isn't anything Marta thing but hey I'm not trying to sell you anything I'm just telling you my review on review we make review face and I'll see you next review [Music] [Music]", "qST-tWStGnk": "hey guys welcome back to my channel i hope you're doing great i am doing fantastic thank you for asking you don't care do you anyway today we're going to be doing super easy revamps to your old t-shirts and the first one is going to be a split t-shirt i had a red and yellow t-shirt and i thought this color combo would be beautiful and they could be great together i like me and my ex so first things first is i cropped my t-shirt obviously i love my stuff cropped it's still summer please let me live in quarantine still but let me live okay if you want this to be as long as your legs you live your life and let me live my life and let's be peaceful with each other so i'm just cutting through the line i just drew i basically went below that point because i got a bit scared she would be a bit too cropped and after i done everything i marked nine inches which was my midpoint and to the right of that point i marked half an inch so you need this half an inch she's going to be your seam allowance she is going to allow you to be great and she is the reason you're going to get into law school okay so you need to do this and basically i just draw a straight line through the half inch mark and i'm going to cut through that straight line and divide my t-shirt into two so the reason we're adding in the half inch is it's going to be our seam allowance when you move on to joining it with the other piece so just do it to be safe i also got rid of the tag she was a bit toxic i didn't like her vibe her energy so i used a red t-shirt on my second t-shirt to just get a rough idea of why i'd crop her and i drew a stray line through the point cut that out to crop this t-shirt as well and it's basically the same thing we did with a red t-shirt and after you're done cutting get rid of the bottom bit or make a house from it it's your world and you do whatever you want so now i just marked the midpoint and then half an inch from that midpoint on the left side this time so you need the seam allowances to be on the opposite sides that way when you join the two pieces together they make a complete t-shirt that actually seems like it was meant to be two t-shirts in one don't let it be weird and people are asking questions and they wonder why you saw your own clothes why you're always broke why you're forever alone just avoid the questions you know that not everyone needs to know that so just do whatever you need to do to seem profesh so i also got rid of the tag in this t-shirt and i split it in half as you saw and now it's time to join the two pieces together forever they're here to stay whether they like it or not so i'm just joining the back pieces and i'm putting the right sides together and i'm going to pin that entire edge together and we're going to sew it and our t-shirt will be attached at the back so pin everything together so a zigzag stitch to join the two pieces and now for the front bit you're going to flip this inside out that way you can join the right sides together so when sewing your right sides always need to be together unless it's a different concept and in that case i will tell you but here we're doing right sides together and i also marked a five inch mark because i wanted my shirts to have a v-neck you know show some cleavage a bit but not too much a very subtle v-neck and i pinned all the way down from the v-neck and you're going to sew along the pins a zig-zag stitch as well because she's stretchy and this is going to join your t-shirt together and you will basically be done so i'm just doing my zigzag stitch nothing fancy make sure you backstage make sure you're paying your taxes make sure you're quarantining and everything will be fine so once i'd sewn my zigzag stitch your t-shirt is basically joined together but as you can see mine's longer on one side it's a whole mess but let's fix that so i just drew a straight line through the longer bit cut the excess bit of fabric off and you're basically good to go so i decided the shirt wasn't enough of whole material for me i needed to deepen the v-neck you don't have to do this it's totally optional i just wanted my v to look neat and pretty and actually look like it was meant to be there so i just decided to cut off excess fabric from it this was super simple to do and once that was done i made sure to stretch all the cut edges and your t-shirt is now beautifully done i also folded in the sleeves because i'm super cool and i couldn't help myself if you're not cool enough to do this i understand not everyone can do this i'm kidding if you want to fold in the sleeves you do that someone might actually take me seriously so i do have to be cautious but don't feel limited do different colors do purple and black do yellow and red do white on white no actually don't do that because that is pointless and they're just wasting your time be creative but use your common sense so now i'm going to show you how to revamp a v-neck t-shirt this is a men's t-shirt by the way size extra small i love how big men's t-shirts are like this is an extra small and it looks like a medium on me whereas female clothes are just a whole different sizing my goodness let's not get into that but this color is gorgeous it's such a fall color though we're not yet in full it's coming i'm praying for this year to end quickly and if i have to make fall diys for it to be fall you bet i'm gonna do it so all i'm doing now is i'm marking a line below the point i marked i was a bit scared with cropping this time i thought i was cutting my t-shirts too short but i was just paranoid maybe the whole life is actually leaving me but i cut through the straight line to crop the t-shirt and now you are good to go you have another tube top to make another house to make depending on what you decide to do with the bottom bit so now using the v point as a guide i'm just going to draw a straight line down and this is going to help me split my t-shirt open and i'm just cutting through the top layer only and splitting my t-shirt making her ready for the next step i turned this inside out and i'm now folding in the side bits twice and pinning them down so basically i was attempting to make kind of like a button placket makeshift one it didn't go so well but i wanted her to be cute so i just folded in the fabric twice pinned her in place repeat on the other side as well and you're now going to do a straight stitch alongside the edges on both sides so gasp straight stitch stretchy fabric who am i so the reason i'm using a straight stitch despite having fabric that did try me a lot i wanted the straight stitch first of all the zigzag stitch is extra she needs space she needs to be seen and i wanted this to be more subtle and since i didn't need this bit to stretch i could get away with a straight stitch so you do what you feel is right for your fabric but i felt like she had to behave or get out there was no two ways about it so now for buttons i'm going to be using pearls because i'm expensive i'm kidding they're actually fake pearls i got on aliexpress for like a dollar for like 100 of them i will link them down below in case you want to be expensive with me and now all i'm doing is i'm marking an inch all the way down that's what you just saw me do because i was busy just making noise and now i'm going to hand sew each and every pearl button with love so that she serves me in the right way and doesn't escape to go be with her longtime summer boyfriend i need her to stay with me okay so i made sure she was in there i really did sew on these buttons with all my energy i was not letting any button go and once i was comfortable with how secure she was i secured the knot got rid of the excess thread and repeated the entire process all through so hand sewing the buttons was definitely a trying period for me i don't want to think back to this time because i really did spend a lot of time on this i spent like 30 minutes sewing 10 buttons and i didn't even have to use three buttons so it was a trying time i don't want to talk about it but the buttons are on eventually so make sure you sew all of them onto your top and once they're all sewn on it's going to be worth it it's always worth it with diys you just have to be willing to put in the time so now all i'm doing is i'm taking the bottom packet now you know where the holes will be and i'm going to make sure my pearls can go through so i put it on top of the button on the other side snipped it to the tiny scissor that i don't know where i found i think this is actually for my nails am i disgusting yes but i'm just snipping a hole and making sure it's big enough for the pearl to go through i pushed the pearl in and i was basically here for my entire life the reason i don't have a boyfriend i was just doing this for my whole lifetime you will be here for a hot second so the key is to make sure your hole is not too small such that the pearl cannot go through and make sure it's not too big so that your pearl isn't just out there and everything is exposed and i don't know why my voice changed to this anyway i did this for a hot minute and once i had all my holes and all the pearls were home i was basically done i ended up removing the top three buttons by the way so don't even bother okay just because i wanted that cleavage so bad so now i'm just going to crop my t-shirt some more now that i know how long i want her to be i draw a straight line through and i'm going to cut off the excess bit of fabric this whole life chose me okay i didn't choose it and i'm also going to get rid of the sleeve hem because i didn't like her she wasn't my style she was killing my entire vibe and she had to leave the office building okay so i'm going to double hem the bottom of my t-shirt just to make it cute and we're going to do a lettuce hem and i'm going to do the same thing for the sleeves just fold in your fabric twice and sew a zigzag stitch all around and the lettuce ham is so simple you're going to repeat on the other sleeve of course unless you want to only have one sleeve that looks pretty no one's going to judge you and if they judge you please sell them to mind their business so the lattice hem is really simple to do you basically fold in your fabric twice tuck in all the ugly raw edges no one needs to see them you need to put your best foot forward and you're going to sew a zigzag stitch to just have everything in place and together i have an in-depth video on how to do a letter sam i will link it down below in case you want to really focus on the latticem and become a master of it but once you repeat this all through you have a top that is fabulous and ready to be on the urban outfitters website without making you sell a kidney so this is the final result i really love what the pearls did for this simple t-shirt they really took this t-shirt to the rich level buttons are basic everyone has buttons but pearls honey you will be super expensive you'll be on the streets and everyone will be wanting to talk to you even though you don't want them to but even if they're fake pearls no one needs to know that okay so anyway that is all i have for you guys today i thought this methods were such simple and fun ways to revamp your man's current t-shirts ex-boyfriends t-shirts whoever's leaving t-shirts at your house these are two simple ways you can easily re-fashion them that way when they come back for them they no longer have t-shirts to come back for because you've made cute summer tops from them anyway that's all i have for you guys today thank you so much for joining me in today's video i thoroughly enjoyed your company and i hope i will be seeing your beautiful face in my next video until then stay safe be beautiful and cut up everyone's t-shirts i give you my blessing you have my permission to do so see you guys soon bye"}
