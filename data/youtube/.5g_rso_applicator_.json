{"V_Tym8zyoGA": "- what is up push you here we have the indica blend one gram applicator RSO from Terrapin I believe for the price this is the best I think it's like 60 bucks coming in at 88 84 percent THC I mean you really can't beat this for the price especially I'm not a big sativa and I did eat this yesterday I don't think so I don't even I took a lot there was a lot more in here than what it looks he just busted that baby open I love that they changed her the thing was literally filled up to here when I got it like they really filled this thing up nice I love the new style oh my god bro it's another level it's a whole nother level of Highness gross like it's a different thing but the problem with these it's so thick you have to warm it up so you kind of got a rubber in your hand a little but they heat it up because I really don't want to come out of the applicator that if you don't give it a little warmth so I usually just rub it in my hands if you don't want to taste it make sure you wet your mouth take a drink of something first before you eat it squirt oh right if you want to eat it it's squirting your tongue bloom swallow right down or what I usually do I'll get like a dab mat or silicone tray and just squirt up you know the mean point three point three point three throw it in the freezer they freeze on the pad and you can eat them right off their heart as a pill you can swallow them you don't even taste it at all or anything it's the only kind of pain in the butt about it is you got a warm enough to get it to come out of the okay now you get this part here comes in two pieces this part goes in bruges all which is not really good for like recovering addicts to turn these needles like this but it's real thick it like literally sticks to this cap anyone come out boom alright but let's just go right in my mouth was wet boom I went straight down I was only 0.1 of that still a little more it's kind of hard to get out man I started to freaking get out you litter better off boiling it in water and taking it ain't this before it dropped yeah if you keep your mouth wet it's up about 4.4 almost keep your mouth wet you really don't even taste it a little bit on my tongue there but terrapin it's nice for the price you just can't beat it if you ever see these around and want to try or I so highly recommend them their distance they're the same way $60.00 for the whole gram and you know Terrapins they're good you know they're not the best but they're definitely not the worst I don't think the price is awesome it's totally different than dabs like it's gonna take about probably 40 minutes to kick in [Music] this here you can't dab I wouldn't have this it's not it is I think so I love crass cos guerrilla blue I love it I love air or grass Reese's triple distilled too but I mean for the price of this it's just it's worth it to me if it's around I would grab this over any of the other but my second pick would be Cresco Gorilla Glue so they have a better applicator which I mean I like this new applicator but literally my fingers hurt from squeezing that thing on there yeah you guys are [ __ ] awesome make sure you I mean it's terrapin prices you just can't beat always jamming a trigger $11 I've bought an 11 grams multiple times right here Terrapin is the best bang for your buck well this just came out and it was $95 for a whole it is nothing and it this is downing dog mostly like little nuttin no big bugs but yeah it was good I ate I took the RSL yesterday like I said I took about I guess a little bit less than I thought I thought I took about 0.3 we'll try about 22 somewhere I got a little bit stuck on my tongue but uh it took about 45 minutes and then I kicked that it was real smooth mellow just an all-day your lit all day like it lasts if you take enough you'll be ripped for the whole day but they say like in the beginning just take like a grain of rice sized piece to start out but I've been eating for a little bit so I took a little little bit more but best bang for your buck well guess what Marilla glue is like what $7 $10 more than this I guess I mean alright this I just when I've just been around like indica blend even one way to the tea for me like that there's no such differences we don't even smoke on anything good anything how's this birthday today you know goshawk a wonderful day make sure you subscribe make sure you that like button hit that like button it is right up there bling bling bling bling and I'll have a great day or so wrongs it totally rocks she was just like an edible it's like exactly the same thing as an edible", "iSXoNoOfWHE": "Hey good morning happy cooking clubs so today I'm going to show you how to make the amazing spiritual Rick Simpson oil now this oil has helped me in many many ways for sleeping for pain I cannot tell you enough how amazing this oil is and you can make it at home I found that in the stores they're selling it like five hundred dollars for a little jar like this and really if you make it at home you plant your own it's your own energy is your own everything so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to use the cleanest possible cookware in the market to make this so it's clean it's gonna go on your body so you make sure that you use at least I'm using a rice cooker mp5 this is actually the multi-purpose five cooker from sell and master is it's got a timer in there and it's also the cleanest metal this is like 3/16 TI so non corrosive non reactive and that's why I like using it because whatever taste is in there the whole thing goes out so very simple to do how we're gonna do this Rick Simpson oil you're gonna need a fan okay I already set up my fan over there on that side that's going to blow that way you never want to do this inside your home why because we're gonna be using isopropyl alcohol and that is very flammable and very toxic especially if you're using you never want to use a gas stove because as the fumes are flying guess what happens then you know the eventually I probably will catch on fire so you do never ever ever do not ever use a gas stove and so I'm gonna use like I say a cellar master multipurpose v cooker and I'm gonna use also since this is also 3/16 II I another saw my master 3/4 I'm gonna first take the herb and it's best if you see the bottom down there okay I'm going to show you what to do so this is like a very very simple way of doing it and also the best part about it is that it's very healing you absolutely will love it so let's begin what to do with the herb now the older the herb the better it is to see if I can turn this around hopefully and vision is locked rotate okay so alright so let's see here if you can see this part a pan on the top here so the first thing you want to do is you want to take the herb okay so this it's really nice and the older it is the better it is because that means that you will have more THC a and more CBD and so I know that the world is crazy right now selling CBD but I challenge you for you to go look the ingredients and you will find that it's not and besides you want to get the whole plant that just part of the plant so this an example of how I collected the flowers okay and I barely even trim trim them I only took the big water leaves and then I dried it so once you dry it okay it's ready to use you've never want to use this oil you never want to make the oil with fresh any other fresh lead so what I'll do is I'm gonna most important thing is you need to take the big twigs like the big ones okay like big things like this the only reason why you want to do that is because otherwise you will end up with a lot of twigs in it and when you are sifting through it nut milk bag or a painter's bag what's gonna happen the little twigs are gonna rip the bag and so the idea is for you to crush this I'm gonna do a little bit just half of it so you can see it's already have the oil and I already have the parts so of course I'm tripling the amount of herbs that I'm using but for our purpose here today I want you to see is how powdery I can get it with just my hands so let's get back down here so you can see what I'm doing so you take the herb and just break it up completely okay big big twigs take them out you just strip the bud off of the off of the twig or the root I guess the branches okay there's many ways to communicate here okay so take absolutely everything make sure that you know if you have your your herb for a long time make sure that there's no mold if you'd sure if you dried it properly you shouldn't ever have any mold and you can learn here also how to have to grow it and how to and have to dry it as well properly okay you'll have a chance through this channel to learn all of that because I'm a big proponent that we gotta take care of our own health nobody will suggest us so we have to be our own medicine man and medicine woman you know to really take care of our own affairs otherwise we're always gonna be relying on someone else and wind up someone else no longer there what are you gonna do you're gonna fall down and do nothing do something you know pain is not the way to to live okay so now that this is all like powder almost okay so now the next step is to to bring some isopropyl alcohol I'm using 91% you can buy this at any of the of the you can get this at any of the of the pharmacies okay so the idea is for you to wash the herb as much as possible okay so we're we're stripping that taut the trichomes from the herb itself okay so clean it up hey how you doing I didn't want to incriminate you so don't go into my video hahaha so anyway so the idea is to take the trichomes and the trichome is where the you will find the medicine okay so anything that looks like a little crystal like a little star that is the that is the medicine so I'm going to show you briefly how to sifting through in that milk bag so the idea is to spend about five minutes just like washing the herb all over me so wash the herb and we're gonna use at least two of these or two-and-a-half but usually two of these is is perfect okay so the next thing is if you want to take it it's there and then I can call you later or you can just watch me do it you okay perfect okay so what I'm doing is I'm I'm removing some of this for now because I want to make sure that I'm taking the least possible to go in the bag and so first we're gonna strain it in a cloth to get rid of some of the organic matter so example over there in the kitchen a nut milk bag like a painter's bag kind of like this not like this but it's a little bit it's an it's in the sink if you can grate it that's great so you're gonna need two kinds okay number one you're gonna need a one that has a little bit more holes and then you're gonna need the other one that is like really hard to get through why I tell you why because I I've used it I've used two ways I used only the other one that is more like a net and that one will will sift through a lot of a lot of the plant matter still but you don't want that because if you if you if you put the plant matter it's gonna be really hard and you won't be able to get the oil out of that so get something like this first already made a batch that's why it's looking a little bit cleaner so get something like this this is kind of like a nut milk bag but you can get it you can get something like this at a like like a like a painter's bag also at any of the Home Depot or something like that okay turn it inside out why do you want to do that inside out because you don't want any of the herb to or any of the trichomes to end up so first wash let's move you back down here okay first batch first wash okay and then I squeeze it out and out this batch so now I'm going to return this back to this bowl with the with the other one that I pulled out into this I'm going to add a little bit more more of the alcohol so I can wash the rest this is good for a three to five washes Rick Simpson says and I've noticed that once it comes out not so green that's time to stop but so then I'll take this little cloth again I use it inside out okay and then I'm gonna take my multi-purpose our master five board cooker the best to make it in this is the cleanest and the easiest and then you're gonna take this you can even use a pillowcase an old one but I bought this thing this is actually a little bag that is for keeping parsley keeper but I turn it inside out and I make my medicine in there so now I'm gonna take this that I already pass through the other bag and I'm gonna shake it good because sometimes there's plum matter there and then just put it through there too now this will further take away any extra little leaves okay so if I see little leaves in there if I see any sediment of the trichomes I take it right out okay and so you wash it one more time if you notice they'll be sediment here and I know for those of you who like to get the chill of being high you know this is probably you know what would be good for you which I had to make something that will take away the inflammation and the pain and it still give you a little bit of a buzz but not so much and so okay so then we watch the next the next batch we wash it again and we do exactly the same production okay first of the nut milk bag okay to let in some of the trichomes just at least strip them out of the herbs okay so about five minutes I'm not gonna cook this one yet because I'm gonna show you the cooked product can you do me a favor and see if you can get a 5 quart from the bottom shelf in my kitchen over there they're right next to the fresh my pots and pans five four four four seven four doesn't matter anything you can find so I have somebody that's helping otherwise I'd be disappearing from you okay so if you notice I'm gonna do the same thing I'm gonna pull out most of the plant matter with my hand so that way I'm not putting it through the I'm not putting it through the nut milk bag so the least matter that I have there the less chances to grow it through okay and so now we're gonna use this one first okay then that build bag or the painters bag whatever you want to call it maybe new suppose you use for the same thing okay again do it on the do it on the inside out of the bag so that way we don't have too much my matter and by the way since I'm going through I'm going to strain this on you I don't want any little I want this to be clean through the bowl so put it through there you got green matter no seven foot okay and that's it now that we strain through here I'm done with this because I can see the water then we're going to use this little tree fort here and I'm going to strain through here a second time and you see the bag has little bits of a plant matter I don't want that so I have to I'm gonna have to do one more time so it's good to have two bags normally I have two bags but I can't find my other one two bags of these so and then I put clean gloves on the last okay trying to move this here so it's clean see how they had little bits of a plant and there you don't want that in the oil because it'll make your oil super bitter okay so take and put some really clean gloves this time and if possible now so this is I already gone through to two steps of sifting no plant matter on the inside make sure you don't need to wash it this is very very sticky in fact after you make the medicine what you want to make sure is you clean it up with coconut oil or alcohol and I will come out because a lot of the trichomes will be stuck in the stainless steel that's why it's so important to use the clean as clean as possible to do this clean its cookware possible okay so so now I come back and I take this bag one more time make sure that there's no little plant matter on the outside and this line if not wash it in alcohol and now you're gonna take this hope you can see okay being careful not to maybe it would be nice actually you know I pillowcase sometimes works better I did it with a pillowcase the other day open if I think you're beautiful nails thank you okay so this now we're going through this bill so I want to show you keep it definitely see the holding I want to show you look at how much blind matter even though it's already two times see that you do not want to see in the oil okay okay so now we just squeeze that's why use clean gloves too so I don't leave any traces of plants now if you don't have a solid mass or mp5 I used on the other one I use a induction stove because it'll go to 240 you want to make sure that you go to 240 because when you cook it at 248 be carboxylase and it actually brings out the THC the THC ancbds and you want all of those because together one will help the cells to communicate with each other so if you have pain or inflammation somewhere you know there is a connection between the there is a there is truth to it other words that we have two brains one on the gut and one in here so from here to here we need to be communicating and so if our brain is all messed up you know we're always in pain we have no time the cells are dying and we're not replenishing them so this is a good way to get rid of that information so the next thing that you want to do is take this take this pan which is the saw master multi-purpose by cooker and you just plug it in I'll show you in a second now I want to show you what I have here I have a fan right there facing over there to the outside and you won the fan to be facing your pan so that way the fumes are taking out from your oil and it evaporates and also there's no danger of burning your stove or burning it whatever you're doing never inside of the house please okay so now we're gonna go here temperature and then you go up hold your finger there angle 240 exactly that's where the carb happens ok decarboxylation and just plug it in and now let it do its magic you turn the the fan on you turn the fan on which I'll show you in a little bit and what I do is I put a timer for 25 minutes I want to show you one more time okay for the temperature to 40 now I'm going to the timer I'll hit timer and then I'm going to add hold my finger there on the timer sry timer hold the finger and give it 25 minutes actually let's do 20 minutes I want to check it at 20 minute mark because sometimes it could be a little okay and hit time again so it sets right away put it in turn your fan on one to the lowest setting possible and then just let it let it fan okay so Isis panning it's also getting rid of that can you put it up for a second for explanation so you see how it happens so well it's Fanning you're gonna get rid of of all that the the fumes from the alcohol and then you're gonna laugh you're gonna be left with just with the the medicine and this is what you're left with so let me show you you can buy these online so syringe if you don't know how to take the medicine the best thing is to be careful get yourself educated talk to your doctor that's the best thing to do me I'm my doctor on my medicine woman so I listen to my own body in my own self but what Rick Simpson oil taught me while I well I've seen his videos is that he purchased some of this little syringe and he was taking he said about like one little tiny like the size of a toothpick like maybe like one little one little mil a little but for people who are used to they can have a little bit more to me I also prefer to have it on one of these and so after this was all done if which it took 25 to 30 minutes this is what is left the oil it's in there see that's the beauty that's the Rick Simpson oil right there so you see house now I can just take it with a spoon can you open up to me please I should have done this a lot earlier when I when I was still warm because it was actually a little bit a little bit thinner so you just basically put the medicine in there so this I overcooked it a little bit so that's why I gave it I give it less time and I'll show you how much I have because I suffer from a lot of pain so I'll show you how much I have if I want to sleep actually can you give me another one this is perfect so it takes about an ounce to make one little jar like this but it's really heavenly it's so good if it takes the pain immediately God within 15 minutes you're like walking around like you're a teenager girl and her prime of youth without pain without worries just loving life to the fullest like to refill them too much because then it's it gets stuck on the top mm-hmm so I did on the first one about 3 ounces so it seemed so I never waste anything you know I'm from here I will have my own for my you know to meditate and sometimes I like to use a spatula like this because though there will be easy to pull it out with your nails so see now this was stuck in there now I show you what I can do with this I can take my little jar and just put it through there and this will be probably the one that I get some smeared it's the one that I'm going to use the quickest Rick Sampson says that you should take about like about a toothpick size I honestly toothpick size doesn't do anything for me I have to do more because the pain is too much so I'll show you I do the same toothpick it's just I load it up you know you have the loaded you know they're loaded and then unloaded I find that when when I cook it a little bit longer it actually is this cool soft it will solidify a little bit that's why I don't like to put it on the syringe and then can you go see if you can find a toothpick over there and your kitchen concert covers if not just bring me a little spoon okay so see I filled up three little jars and also I have some more in here that this is already in alcohol I also sometimes I put the flour and alcohol so if I have scratches or a bleeding or cut myself I actually put it on and in the heals pretty much within 15 minutes so it's really wonderful what this oil does I really hope that you know you take the time to check it out Rick Simpson oil cannabis oil you know what it does for you not the CBD that I mean you can buy that stuff I heard some wonderful testimonies about it but truly I'm one to make it at home and as holy as possible so see this is kind of like what he recommends that you should take and that's like a tiny little bit I have a high tolerance but also I have a lot of pain so I take a little bit more so I usually take about this much I'm gonna show you how I put it think about that much and I put it on the top of my tongue and I just leave it there on the roof of my mouth that helps release before I used to put it on my own my lower and there my time but the problem that I had is like it looked like a hillbilly I always had like teeth so this one I put on the roof of my mouth and I just leave it there and just just let it do its thing to release you know like little by little and then before I know it I feel calm I feel like relax chill and everything looks so good I feel mobile I can do yoga I can do anything I can garden I can do everything so pain goes away completely within 15-20 minutes faster if I eat something that has fat but right now I'm not eating fat that could actually put a little bit of coconut oil and their interaction be activated a lot of faster because this is fat soluble so now when you're left with something like this I usually let it ride and I scrape it look at I already have it in my nose but I scrape it up a little bit with this or what I could do this is incredible what you could do with this you can put coconut oil like about half a cup of coconut oil in here it will clean it up in fact I thought I brought the coconut oil so I leave it okay if you can bring it so the coconut oil what I do with it I let it I clean it up with it and then I cook it I put I put some raw sugar like raw coconut sugar and cacao and I make a delicious chocolate treat that it just enhances enhances the mood gently okay it's not euphoric type of thing okay so for this for the coconut oil I just take now this is the last of it I take a little bit left over this probably about a about quarter cup here I like to get a better boil but can you see them the covers over there there's like a big one rosco side on the top on the cover yeah so anyway I'll take the same spoon because I'm gonna use it for cleaning so I'll just show you how it cleans okay cuz sometimes I get stuck since is what it's fat-soluble see it comes tough if I have it on my fingers look at how fast it comes off that's why you know if you eat a little bit fat it'll intensify the the it'll intensified the feeling a little bit faster and a little bit longer you'll notice how the fact things up the spoon you know sometimes if I have like just a little bit extra just take it and put it on your skin you will absorb it so the skin is the one of the most tourists things in our in my body so we can absorb a lot through the skin okay I can start to smell that okay so no Glenn one yeah yeah so let's move this way okay and so I have a little stove right here you can fan it that way just position it a little bit yeah there you go I'm not getting up so meanwhile we are here while I'm Fanning that stuff over there so you notice how I was Fanning there's the fan so a little bit of a mess but I got a lot of stuff going on here ok so now so if you want to do something sweet with left over here so you don't waste the thing just put a coconut oil and this will clean up like right away look at how like it just takes it right off so you just what we do is we heat it up because we bring it to warm it up and I'm gonna leave it at 240 so naval uses be ready carve so you see how it now all that brown stuff is melting so now to this I add coconut sugar cacao and I'll make a delicious chocolate tree so I hope you learned something today this is your flexitarian friend J tan tea until then have a happy healthy and wealthy day enjoy your Rick Simpson oil good for the body good for the soul let's go on and", "3nF8AdX9vio": "time to celebrate on a day joy Smith never expected to see once told her cancer was terminal now her medical team say she's clear and she says it's thanks to this cannabis oil I went to see my consultant and she said that there was nothing left to say she was quite happy to take me off my treatment I just couldn't believe it when I came how I was just so excited I was just I kept pinching myself all day it was just real I couldn't believe it and I'm still here and I feel really well joy who's from Charles Moore in Coventry underwent extensive chemotherapy and says she can't thank the team at walls grave hospital enough for their care but when all looks bleak a friend suggested she tried cannabis oil at first they wouldn't take it and my daughter kept care if he had your oil mom and I'd pretend I had but I hadn't because I just hated the taste I didn't like the feeling of it it makes you [ __ ] me and a bit like you drunk really but funny I just laughed at everything but I didn't like it there's growing evidence online of the benefits of cannabis oil the issue was brought chomping into focus just yesterday when a mother from Northern Ireland had her supply of oil confiscated at Heathrow Airport she tried to bring it into the UK insisting it's the only solution to help her son who has multiple epileptic fits we've also highlighted the story of Alfie Dingley from Kenilworth who also has a rare form of epilepsy after successful cannabis oil treatment in the Netherlands the Home Office agreed here he could use it on compassionate grounds but many doctors remain skeptical cannabis is an illegal substance generally but when you take out the psychoactive substance the part that gives you a high it may have some medicinal properties so if it is able to be shown to help people safely I think there is a good argument for considering its legal use within the medical profession we spoke to the home office who again reiterated that cannabis is a drug for which there are no known medicinal benefits it's illegal to supply and possess it in the UK and in a statement the charity Cancer Research UK told us we don't advise patients to use can the soil or any alternative therapies to treat cancer or alongside treatment they're having currently there's not enough scientific evidence to say that cannabis oil is a safe or effective treatment in rare cases it's claimed some people systems can produce the same effects as the oil but it can also exacerbate cancers nevertheless Joyce Smith told me she's proof cannabis oil can make a difference and she started a petition to try to make the government legalize it for medical use Wesley Smith ITV News Coventry", "PWJC0CrU2mE": "top of chagas here first of all we're glad you're anywhere okay let's talk about still your yeah alright Tommy one half of the classic comedy duo Cheech and Chong between the records and the movies of the reunion shows they've been doing it for more than 40 years yeah my doggy my stash man my driving okay man I think we're parked yeah feels good don't it yeah that Dave Dave's not here and I realize listening to you guys you had like a generation of guys running around sounding like you yeah you realize that couple generations the public a couple days feels like more than that what we're so glad to see you glad to be how are you feeling I'm feeling great that's the reason we asked you had the prostate cancer a few years ago yeah yep still have still have in remission mm-hmm okay and now you have yeah rectal rectal culated yeah is it real no apparently not apparently not I look at the body you know like a car you know I'm an old car now I got a little rust in the exhaust pipe that's about it you're you're in your 70s right yeah yeah almost 80 almost really kitty close getting close now you've been I know you've been really vocal about how you're using even a cannabis suppositories right and how would that helped or do you think that's hurt oh no dog helps little helps well first of all it's not when you do suppositories you don't get the head high you know you get a little but I but no way okay whatever that is oh it's good but highs good because you can still sing I know people who graduated from bud high no but no no the cannabis oil is is I think cannabis oil has really kept me from mark kept me healthy kept me young you know kept me undone Singh with the Stars you were amazing you brought your swag to that did you had you danced before then uh you know I learned how to dance salsa you know I had to pick my pencil salsa dance so we're watching you hear the state of your health then was what I had cancer all right at that point I think I think probably is you know this my own opinion the stress of the show probably brought writers write it out and it is just it is stressful touches father it's stressful seven days a week rehearsals like four five hours a day rehearsal is did you know your cancer like that had you been getting your colonoscopies did you know for three years that was that was the problem yeah but they give you a propofol I'm surprised you want to do it Tommy on a serious note here you have always been in the forefront of saying let's legalize marijuana yes it's a ridiculous thing if Mara would start out another way marijuana would be legal and alcohol wouldn't be etcetera etcetera yeah what are your doctors say when you talk to them every doctor the straight doctors and the hip doctors they all the straight doctors they don't discourage it I tell them I'm treating the cancer with with marijuana and they go okay let's see what happens you know the the the cancer I mean the marijuana doctor like there's a dr. Frankel he's been researching and he's one of the top Marijuana doctors in in the world actually he encourages the use of the cannabis oil with cancer for a number of reasons you know and and how does the medical profession officially look at this officially what depends in in Israel there's research going where they've done great strides dr. Sanjay Gupta did a great show on CNN where they showed the cannabis oil actually curing a little girl's epilepsy a little girl had hep-c these are episodes but what about the medical establishment it would say to you what well the medical establishment really don't know they don't know no more than anybody else the medical establishment it when you see the establishment the ones that push pharmaceutical the AMA for instance yeah yeah the one they're way behind the curb you know we were there they don't even allow marijuana research the federal government does it so so I mean they're behind but we're you you know this stuff to be blurry well we call Big Pharma in the pharmaceutical industry are they waiting for the total legalization do they already have I don't know what Varma's not waiting for anybody don't way ahead of the game yes so they they're ready to go as a product much as it can the United States government tried to patent or did patent marijuana years ago when they made it legal because illegal because American government knew at that time knew the medical benefits and and and the reason it was made illegal was pure political you know and racist it's a marijuana laws are very racist there's no probably the only blatant racist law that we have you know and and the reason I say that is before it was called marijuana it was called hemp and was growing all over the world especially in in America there's hemp Bill Hempstead there's him towns named after so people in Long Island who live in Hempstead don't know they live in marijuana stead that's what she said that's right interesting thought a lot of them don't okay it's not like you've dedicated your life to the pursuit of marijuana but I have but but you have and and the interesting thing is that I think most people back in the 70s and early 80s would have thought that you wouldn't be alive now that's right that's right and you've outlasted a lot of those people absolutely because of the the marijuana you think I'm like I say I'm almost 80 years old mm-hmm I still do everything that I did when I was 40 you know everything about about this prognosis the doctors feel confident when you're in there doctors are very very confident but with me it's stage one it's not that serious I'm going to treat it with like I say with marijuana and radiate chemo radiation right yeah and the chemo and the radiation the good thing about marijuana what marijuana does more than anything it relaxes the mind and it relaxes the anxiety and when you relax anything then things get done you know it relaxes the immune system so the immune system will will take over you know because we don't when we have illnesses in that you know the doctors can only do so much doctors are like mechanics they can fix things that are broken but they can't really keep you from getting the disease unless you you treat your body like like a car and you make sure you know what you're putting into it you know like good nutrition exercise and marijuana all right so we have to go you're going to come back next year after your on so you think it can dance after all this time we'll good to see Tommy John thank you very much", "qqvJOAV7oAc": "it was 2012 at the age of 12 that you then became one of a very very exclusive club one that you never want to get into one in seven billion five people on the planet have Langerhans cell sarcoma what's that there's not a lot of research into it so I'm not too sure on what it is it's it's very confusing yeah so that should treatment you were facing that the doctors recommended was a bone-marrow transplant yeah it was extensive chemo radiotherapy and then yeah and then bone marrow transplant and you didn't have just one transplant this was three that you had to have and and how did you get on with that well they failed until the first free yeah they were not - it's not too trouble so it's not it's not a big problem to have and then after that this isn't as a mum because he then really began to suffer ya have to watch himself and how bad was it um well after the fourth transplant they told us that you know the first three had failed and and literally all they had was one more chance for him they had one more bag of his own cells no more they were there you know they'd stress the the the thing to us that there was no more chances after this and and unfortunately three days after he had his final transplant he tracked his fingers down side of the bed and then picked up some infections now obviously infections with no immune system whatsoever and no way for an immune system to even even start to build within his body he was literally being kept alive by antibiotics that's what they told us he did get incredibly ill throughout his whole treatment he'd been very happy and smiley and he'd always been tried to be quite jovial but actually those last those last couple of months are very very difficult he was in a lot of pain you would given I think three days three days a week at most is what they told me when I asked him the the timescale you planned your funeral haven't you yeah to what extent all of it we're gonna do it was gonna be fancy dress and I'd chosen all the costumes for people and it was gonna be quite embarrassing for some of the people though yeah who actually said you want you wanted to go yeah I did he was looking forward to it after four years of treatment it's enough enough was enough so this story then takes at him yeah entirely different turn how did that happen through lots of research I've done lots of research on to see when his secondary cancer arrived and it was so unknown I then said I turned to the internet inside looking and and over the over the following months and couple of years afterwards cannabis just kept popping up people kept emailing me you need to try this you need to nice if he hasn't got cancer you know the cancers have gone this is now a completely different issue it won't work for him is no but I would dismiss it and dismiss it and actually came to the point where I was in hospital with Darren and he was so incredibly ill and really on a high dose of morphine he was actually now on fentanyl which they can't go any further than that and it wasn't working against his hand and and the other issues he had with his stomach and I asked the doctor for bedrock on which is a cannabis based pain relief so it's available in Europe and because I've done I didn't you know I don't know I wanted to go through the proper measures and she actually told me we can't because it hasn't been licensed for children so you know and and more of it came out but people just kept saying and I thought you know what what to lose and you've got nothing nothing nothing to lose it that's dying anyway you know so they just rejoin your antibiotics at this point there was no other treatment so you took this yeah and you asked him and you said yeah yeah I was happy to what did you notice how quickly to think oh my god I mean I honestly do the effect of it blew my mind it wasn't what I expected all I expected too it's done live a research and some people use cannabis to kind of alleviate their anxiety and and some pain and that's what Devin was really experiencing on day 17 when they said there's definitely nothing in his bone marrow there's nothing there you've now just got to wait seven got very anxious and said well how much longer do I have to wait they started to trying up the morphine introduced sleeping tablets and so that's when I actually gave it and within half an hour's hours it administered under the tongue sublingually it's just a tincture it's it's it's not the oil that people talk about it was just a teenager then what we know it's within half an hour to an hour but he was just chilled out he just relaxed the anxiety stopped he no longer was panicking and he was able to just he was able to be compas mentis which he wasn't able to be on the belly always the health-wise I mean actually things being tested against you your white blood cells began to go up yeah after five days or C they told us nothing in his bone marrow so gave it to him five days later when the bandages came off his hand and we saw a healthy fingers which we were told there was no way they were under there when we saw a healthy finger see the doctor started panicking this was now based 75 after the transplant and he was then Tony be there for three three days yeah and nobody has ever engrafted after fifty days so day 75 and all of a sudden his white count has appeared the doctors start running around frantically doctors from Bristol Children's Hospital were called in to do some more blood tests which I said well there's no point you told me on your week ago there's nothing there and obviously in the blood count it was there it's very small but it was there and to test the theory you actually withdrew the cannabis after a little while and the blood count started to go down okay so where are you now how are you now perfectly healthy I'm glad you're normal you stress this is this is this doesn't work for everybody this is not a cure no this is something that worked for you and you could be prosecuted let's be honest well the under current laws in England the world's cannabis is not registered as having any therapeutic value anyone using the drug if medical reasons could be charged for possession possession carrying a maximum sentence of five years in jail or an unlimited fine fascinating story it was so happy that you're here and healthy

"[Music] hello friends welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help all you find folks make sense of that weird kind of confusing i'm not really sure what i'm seeing here place you call your local dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at a kind of product we've been reviewing a lot recently uh and that is the good old-fashioned weed tincture the thc tincture i've been doing a lot of those uh recently i'm a big fan of thc tinctures but this one is a little bit different in that it is not just a tincture but it is actually my first foray into the sort of um i don't know what you would call uh the quasi-branded world of rso or also otherwise known as rick simpson's oil so rick simpson's oil is a very specific type of tincture developed by well the eponymous rick simpson maybe a canadian i'm not sure forgot didn't do my history um but it is a uh kind of tincture uh formulated in a specific way that's been around for many years now um and uh it is the sort of tincture method that many people swear by they say that this is the like most potent formulation of different kinds of tinctures um and again it is not too dissimilar it's um the process is different making rick simpson oil than other different oil methods but not crazy different um but it's also not like um a branded thing anybody can make their own rso uh normally comes in the way i see it most often is in a syringe form i think maybe that's the way uh it was originally sort of distributed as well the plastic syringe which is what i guess is in here this is the remedy rso relax tincture uh by cresco labs look at things from cresco before this is a sort of confusing conglomerate of a bunch of different companies uh i think cresco labs is maybe the distributor um and remedy is the people who are making it but then on our back with our lab information and all that fun stuff we do see some other uh names on there as well uh all these different companies have a variety of different umbrellas that they operate under so it's not too uncommon to not really be sure where this is from or who it comes from ultimately um but i'm just gonna call it under the umbrella umbrella of cresco um their name is on it a couple of places so we'll say it's a cresco product um but i do love this name that you see the url maybe for uh there if it'll uh focus there it is uh it's uh atla atlas sex tracks i mean of course it's just atlas extracts but when i first saw it because i guess maybe a pervert i don't know i just was like what the [ __ ] because it just blurted out to me as atla atlas sextrax which is a great name sex tracks if you're a punk band out there that one's for you so uh this tincture which i'm again not 100 sure what is going on in this big um rectangular piece of packaging there's something bulky and thin in there that's a contradiction in terms but um there's a long thin thing but that is also um got some girth to it um so we have a strange packaging here it looks like um actually kind of doesn't really fit it seems uh it doesn't really close properly it's got a little seal there at the top um but it's like these old bags you used to see old new bags from the recent changeover and california laws where they required these like seal child proof bags although that's gone out the window in the pandemic i have not seen anybody using those not sure why but now everybody's just using paper bags but it's one of those like obnoxious child seal packages i think the key is to open from underneath but they're all so obnoxious and this one's especially oh there we go okay ah and it is a big old syringe next things we need to know is how potent is this well this is 600 milligrams of thc in here as advertised as 601.1 milligrams that's quite precise and 2.2 milligrams of cbd uh the most amazing thing about this was the price i picked this up from what was once connected in long beach now as catalyst changed names on me recently uh dispensaries couple of them in long beach uh for only 30 bucks which is an outrageously good deal for a 600 milligram tincture now that is i i don't know if that's necessarily characteristic of rso but that is way darker than most oil you are going to see um especially in tincture um tinctures are going to be usually a bit lighter than that that's very very dark probably from the rso processes um i don't think this is true but they say the only ingredient in this entire thing here is cannabis um well so this is as i said 600 milligrams of thc it doesn't really know us any or doesn't really give us any specific um instructions in terms of dosing on what is what so i guess we'll have to do some math it's one gram that's 600 milligrams of thc we like to do about uh a hundred milligrams so um we'll go on the safe side we'll do a little bit extra so uh let's say it's 500 milligrams i would need to do what uh 0.2 grams to get about 100 milligrams a little bit less but i'll do 0.2 grams and that should be over uh 100 milligrams of thc so uh that is not a lot that's like down to here on our tincture syringe excuse me i'm gonna do it sublingually so i'm gonna maybe do i don't know see how much i can get under the tongue for now and then once i get it under there i'll leave it there for a little bit i'll annoy you like i do all of these just you know i'll swallow it after a minute or so uh and then um i'll uh do the last bit however much i have to do not sure we'll see how much comes out um like all of our wheat's reviews at that point i'll come back to you guys after about two hours let you know if this rso tincture is everything that i hope it to be and i do i've got some real expectations here um from the amount of praise i've heard about rso so let's get ready to relax with remedy by cresco labs oh [ __ ] oh my god wow uh you hear that right it's like tar when i was here huh all of my beard uh i am not oh well i'm back it's been a mild uh disaster here at wheat's hq with this rso i guess i really didn't know what i was in store for and now i've got hands that are gonna be sticky what feels like for a month i mean it feels like that uh gross feeling you get after you clean out your bong and it's been way too long you get that like just um an indestructible resin that's just permanently bonded to your hand and that's what's happened here it's just my hands are utterly gross and sticky as is my lip and a gross little patch of hair right here just sticky beyond belief um i was not expecting it to be like that as thick as that not nearly um i guess on me um i'm not sure how one would take that sublingually which is what the directions uh very clearly state on the packaging excuse me just through it they say take this sublingually you can't even reliably get it out of the applicator that reliably enough to take it sublingually um good news is uh i was able to salvage 90 percent or more of what uh came out uh actually probably quite a bit more than that uh the little bit that did not get in my system got under my fingers didn't really take it sublingually just took it probably can see to my teeth actually it's real gross um just took it uh swallowed it uh but i am now um more than halfway uh done i have done a little bit over uh one uh milliliter there um excuse me one tenth of a gram is that what they're measuring as is one gram i can't remember i think it says it's measured in grams and not milliliters which is odd but that's probably what should have clued me in that it was going to be so thick if they're measuring it in weight and not fluid uh by uh volume um but yeah uh so i have another uh one tenth of a gram to go uh i'm not gonna do it that way i'm gonna just uh take this um i'm gonna go pour like a drink and shoot some in there mix it up real nice and take it that way um and then that will get us to our one gram mark uh i would say my initial experiences with rso are um complicated but the proof is ultimately going to in how strong it is how if it makes you feel as good makes you feel as pleasant as it's uh many many fans and supporters say uh for that we'll have to wait a little over two hours i'm gonna work on getting this last half or so done in the next little bit um uh and i will also be doing a live stream so i hope uh it's obviously too late if you're watching this now but we do a lot of live streams now i'm gonna do one after i get this other half in uh so i hope to see you then otherwise i'll see you guys for the back half of this review sorry it's taking so long for this first part but we had a little bit of cleanup to do so see you guys soon let's hope the second half goes a little better bye-bye [Music] well hello again friends it's been uh right at actually two hours since our first check-in on our rso remedy relax journey experience extravaganza and if any of you are watching this that were happening be uh watching god i can't even say words our live stream uh that was going on in the middle of this review well then you know that um well uh i'm not sure it's a different high in any way shape or form than a traditional high but it is definitely a high um wowzer pauser uh this is disgusting um i forgot to tell you i how i did the other part i because i did you can see my syringe down to that point eight i just took it uh my original goal was to suspend it in some liquid swirl it around and drink it however it very much resists um being dispersed in another liquid it just mostly stays there as a big disgusting globule of oil um that looks disconcertingly like well um um i won't even say what it looks like a big uh oval shaped thing with a tail but it's black instead of another color um and uh just took it as if it were like the worm and athena tequila just down the hatch uh that was two hours ago and holy bananas um as the stream went on i just kept getting higher and higher and i feel still uh i feel quite high um hate the way this works um and i'm not even a hundred percent sure i actually uh it's it's good that i'm here um because i recapped this after i suspended it in my liquid but i'm not sure if it's going how well it's going to work going forward if there's like excess oil all over the place it's obviously incredibly sticky so maybe we'll experiment with that as well but i do have this to say uh as a kind of experience this oil is disgusting um and i don't want to have to consume it because it's just a big glob but taking it basically like a shot didn't taste it at all went down and this 600 milligrams is 30 was 30 bucks which is very reasonably priced and it this 100 milligrams or slightly more than 100 milligrams that i did um wow it is so potent um it is i don't know how to feel about it um maybe if you could continue to do it um pinch your nose stick it in some water and take it that way it's a really good deal and it's a really strong high let's see i'm curious to see how this resealing method is going to do um what am i going to do uh i guess i'll well shoot i don't even think about it um i promised i was gonna do it i better do it let's see if it still works uh-oh there it goes there it goes well plunge baby plunge ew ew go on oh oh and oh no oh no oh no oh no well there's gonna be a sticky spot somewhere that's what she said um and now i've done uh another tenth of that so it's gonna be a really fun night for me uh seems to seal just fine came right out so you know what it's disgusting it's gross you gotta figure out a way to do it um i seen online a lot of people take it with food like checking into food to each their own um if you can stomach it and you can find it at this price wow there's not much there's not a really a whole lot better out there for dollar to high ratio which is a pretty important one to me so that's been a fun experience our cresco remedy relax thc rso acronym letters hi fun good times wow i'm still kind of reeling at how high i am so that's been a really fun experience with the rso i don't even have composed thoughts other than it's gross but it's really good and for 30 bucks i am very impressed but it is gross so with that that's going to do it for this review i normally give you a cherry on top but oh my god that just seems so impossible right now i owe you one stay high more importantly stay healthy and i'll see all you guys on a future review bye", "JnE6kTqkX1Q": "hello iris Oh SOS

Today I want to talk to you about our Syringes for filling oil cartridges. When you have a vaporizer (or personal vape) such as the MiniVape2, you can fill your own cartridges with CBD or other oils. The way most cartridges work is that you unscrew the mouthpiece to open it, and then you can put your oil in. Now, a lot of these oils are fairly thick -  they don't pour easily and you get about an eighth to a quarter inch little gap here to try to put it into the tube, which is pretty maddening and usually you end up making a mess and spilling more than you get into the cartridge. So the solution to that is use a blunt tip medical syringe. Okay... We have them in green and silver, and they come in a little box like this. And when you open it, you get the syringe [mutters under his breath]: Of course I opened it for the wrong end - I always do that! You get a syringe and a little needle adapter. Now... the way these work -- just like in hospitals they have what's called a luer lock on the end. This is so that you can just twist and it's a Quick Connect. So you can just connect it into tubing when people do IVs and things like that... The blunt tip also just snaps in. So now you have a nice little precision fine point tip that you can stick into the cartridge to fill it. You can put it in and draw... and then stick it back in and Push it. OK... The other thing that you can do is -- these do come off if you pull them off -- and you get just a glass blunt tip. This can be used for dabbing oils directly into a hot banger. Our syringes are made of borosilicate glass and stainless steel plungers. So there's no plastic in this, so you can take off the plastic Luer lock tip and you can directly dab into your hot bangers and you're not gonna melt anything. You can easily just snap it right back on. Okay They come in green and in silver.  And they make filling cartridges a breeze! I'm Eric Robichaud from Green Goddess  Supply! [click sound from lighter] [inhale] [exhale]", "4Z7VJC9LdOc": "[Music] the recent legalization of the drug cannabis has taken the medical community by storm what was once a recreational drug is now being used to treat various health conditions most prominently pain miracle stories regarding cannabis have become more common than ever however the efficacy of cannabis in clinical settings remains unclear this is precisely what this video serves to address to answer this we will take a look into how cannabis works by analyzing the endocannabinoid system then we will delve into the existing literature regarding the efficacy of cannabis and pain relief specifically in the context of cancer patients as well as looking at cannabis as a potential biomarker for immunotherapy the endocannabinoid system is a widespread neuromodulatory system that has a critical role in the human body typically maintaining homeostasis endocannabinoids are mediated primarily by cb1 and cb2 cannabinoid receptors with cb1 receptors existing in abundance in the brain whereas cb2 receptors are primarily expressed in immune cells and the hematopoietic system this system also consists of endocannabinoids and enzymes for synthesis and degradation endocannabinoids which are naturally created by the body are lipid-based signaling molecules that modulate the endocannabinoid system by binding to cannabinoid receptors typically neurotransmitters such as gamma immunobutyric acid or gaba are released from the presynaptic neuron and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron triggering their unique modulatory pathway the endocannabinoid system is different as it is a retrograde system which means endocannabinoids are released from the postsynaptic neuron and bind to the cb1 receptors on the presynaptic neuron this binding event causes the release of excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters which can cause an upregulation or down regulation of specific functions in the body respectively in the case of pain regulation using medicinal cannabis cannabinoids are introduced into the bloodstream and bind to cb1 receptors on the presynaptic neuron which causes an upregulation of gaba signaling brain nerves to reduce pain now that we understand the endocannabinoid system we will have a better idea processing how cannabis relieves pain when administered to patients in clinical settings disclaimer before we delve into the existing literature it is worth noting that cannabis research in terms of medicinal treatment is scarce and has only recently become an area of focus many studies report contrasting results perhaps due to inappropriate dosing guidelines or inadequate sample sizes which may subsequently lead to inaccurate conclusions this video is not intended for self-diagnosis purposes please consult your physician to see if cannabis treatment is right for you with that being said let's look into a systematic review which summarized five primary research papers on cannabis treatment in patients in the majority of the studies the oromucosal spray of navaximal which includes both cannabidiol or cbd and tetrahydrocannabinol or thc proved to have better pain management than the placebo and in one study even codeine only one study reported contrasting results which were deemed statistically insignificant due to an insufficient sample size the review did highlight how inter-patient variability along with the complex symptomology made it difficult to accurately determine if side effects arose solely because of cannabis or from concurrent medication in a study by makari and company in 2018 a self-reporting system was used in 188 oncology patients of the baymont hospital in michigan where 46 out of the 188 patients use medicinal cannabis to manage pain symptoms from these 46 patients pain appetite and anxiety was found to significantly improve with pain being the most frequently reported improvement similar results were seen in a quebec study by the ghana 1 company where patients reported significant improvement in pain severity from using medicinal cannabis in another study medicinal cannabis did lead to a significant decrease in both tumor progression and overall survival however there were adverse a vaccine in using cannabis before and during immunotherapy this is due to the fact that cannabis does lead to a reduced lymphocyte count which increases the likelihood of immune infection especially in immunocompromised patients however these findings were beneficial as they allowed researchers to investigate whether cannabis could be a potential clinical marker for patient responsiveness to immunotherapy since the microenvironments of cd1 and cv2 receptors alter in different environments making them a key indicator the importance of micro environments in terms of tumor progression has also been supported in other studies which suggests that different tumor types would need different cannabis treatment cater to that respective micro environment to summarize from the research that we explored we can conclude that in the context of cancer treatment medicinal cannabis has proven to aid in the alleviation of pain symptoms but not without the risk of some adverse effects and potential immunocompromisation in addition the cb1 and cb2 receptor changes in different micro environments of cancerous tumors can be used as a biomarker to indicate whether a patient could benefit from or adequately respond to cannabis treatments as mentioned before the research regarding cannabis as an effective medicinal intervention is scarce and the conclusions made in different studies are largely inconsistent therefore more research needs to be done before confirming with certainty whether medicinal cannabis can be a prospective treatment even though some studies do seem promising we must be conscious that this is a relatively new field of research that needs more time and rigorous investigation to reap concrete results we advise our viewers not to self-medicate with cannabis and if you think you require medicinal cannabis consult your local healthcare provider to see if it is the right intervention for you", "33Tow5gDvoI": "they explain to my viewers what RSO is in the most simple terms you can so as we hear that term a lot tomorrow RSO is basically a full plant extracted with ethanol oil so you get all the benefits of the you know the fact that wax is the lipids and the terpenes of the cannabis plant we more focus on we use freeze pure hundred proof of ethanol we use we get our ethanol down to freezing temperatures and do a quick wash so we focus more on extracting just the cannabinoids experiment the fats and waxes that go there give you three process yeah okay that's why ours is usually a lot better color than your traditional RSM oh so we don't really consider it too much our our Morikawa a CEO for alcohol but it is all fully activated it is generally it's just harvested over which is what you're actually wanted to take this", "d6MdM9AE3Rc": "hey everybody my name is Vito I am bender educator for iodine labs today we're going to talk about RSO Rick Simpson oil RSO is a popular form of cannabis concentrate it was developed by the cannabis advocate Rick Simpson who used this extract to treat his own medical conditions in 2003 so what is our so what makes our so so special our so is a whole plant extract we begin with the cannabis plant which we strip of essentially everything all of us active chemical compounds resulting in a final product that is not distilled or purified it looks different than other concentrates when you see it you see that it's very very very dark and it has a rich sludgy consistency this is due to the fact that it is not processed this extract is potent it is rich in THC meaning that when you use it you will feel that you for yeah that high associated with the cannabinoid however because it is a whole plant extract you can expect a beautiful well-rounded whole full body effect making this product perfect for patients who use cannabis to treat insomnia muscle spasms chronic pain nausea or chilly for any patient who is looking for a body hi so how do we use RSL aerosol is an ingestible oil meaning that it is already activated it is already ready to go all you have to do is just squeeze it into your favorite food squeeze it into your coffee squeeze it into empty capsules or even just squeeze a little bit right onto your finger and eating it right off your finger there is no heat required it is ready to go this means that RSO is very easy to use portable and discreet when dosing RSO think in terms of grains of rice so like a half a grain of rice or a full grain of rice a little goes a long way how much exactly will depend from patient to patient and the patient's tolerance and what exactly that patients trying to do Rick Simpson suggest our regimen or a protocol to use our so for healing purposes to learn more about that check out Phoenix tears CA however we recommend starting low and moving up slowly another way to use RSO is to apply it directly on the skin it just depends on what the patient is trying to do so here are adenine labs we have three versions of our RSO we have the house blend which is a blend of different strains we have the single string RSL as well as the high CBD RSL they all come in airtight syringes which are perfect for perfect dosing and all the syringes are fitted with the luer lock tape so for patients who are not familiar with these syringes it can throw them off a little bit at first but I assure you actually quite simple so let's talk about that so when you pick up ourselves it will come in this syringe so let's go ahead and get another package so you can see a little bit better and this is the syringe so these two guys here the cap and the lock adapter are the culprits are the culprits of all the confusion so as you can see here these are two separate parts the cap on the top and the adapter at the bottom so what we want to do is pull and twist on the cap alone the adapter really does simply apart into it so just firmly I confidently pull and twist pull and twist pull it twist and there you go so you see it I didn't break it it feels like you gotta break it but you're not gonna break it and then when you're done just put the cap back into the adapter and twist it shut and there you go alright guys so the pending on the temperature depending on how cold your RSO is it could be difficult to push it out but there's really no need to force it just a couple of seconds heating it up either with a hair blow-dryer or running it under warm water will do if you squeeze too much out just pull back on the plunger and that will make the oil go back into the syringe that is all for our show today thank you for joining me for this five-minute video if you have any questions feel free to email me my email is

got we got two RSOs indica guru and let's see I'm really shaky so you can tell I need this one this was clocking in at seven hundred thirty one point five milligrams of THC at one point eight milligrams of CBDs that means it's about 73 percent or so THC let's take a look at the syringes okay here's the RSO let's see if we can get it closed up whoa there we go take a look at that please forgive my shaking attempt we need to take some of this real soon please ignore my shaking I'm trying to control it I really need a dose of RSL I've been conserving it because as we all know there's a

while before I review it also I want to review the strawberry switchblade real quick I accidentally threw away two container guys I'm sorry I'm going I'm just not really what's the word I'm looking for organized during this crisis and I accidentally screwed up and threw away the container I went ahead and did a video for the strawberry switchblade if you want to go take a look at it I'll link it somewhere in the comments or in the video description it shows the close-ups and the weight and everything basically it's just a really good hybrid I like it during the day it's really tasty especially if I turn down the temperature on my vaporizer to like 365 I can really taste the strawberry and it really tastes good it's a good hybrid for during the day I don't usually use it too close to bed because it's not an indica and I'm usually an indica person but this one I actually like and it works pretty well for me if you have any questions about the strawberries witchblade please ask me in the comments and I'll get back to you as soon as I can last but not least I wanted to show you a quick sneak peek of this little box I've got vyvanse sent me they sent me a new device to try out and I'm really liking it a lot they said I'm not allowed to show the device or the name of the device or anything like that I can just show the box that I've got I think it's being released on the 26th I think that's what they said which is tomorrow if I'm not mistaken then I can get to going on the review for this and show you the product I really like it a lot it's a really cool little device wish I could show you more I'm dying to show you more but they won't let me so we'll just have to wait a little while on that and oops there goes the bag okay that's it just wanted to let you guys see the move RSO I'll be using it for a little while and then I'll review that the strawberry switchblade I'm basically done with that review if you have any questions let me know in the comments and I'll let you see this device as soon as the live event lets me everybody stay safe out there shelter in place do what you can to stop the spread of the virus and I hope all I hope all of you are safe and your loved ones to keep it real and be safe", "dwo0gEOClKY": "good afternoon everyone thank you for joining us uh today for our next webinar um we're gonna do introductions we're just waiting people are still quickly joining so give us one second and we're going to get started we know this is a pretty topic to our community so we will be recording this and sharing uh after the fact uh and we will also make sure that if you need contact information we'll happily provide that as well okay i think i'm going to get started just because we have so much to get through today so um first of all we'd like to thank you for joining us uh today we have a rash tag thee did i say right yeah uh who is um from apollo cannabis clinics and uh this company um reached out to us to offer their information and expertise around cannabis and use for people living with als so we have decided to go ahead and do this presentation because it is very much a topic of interest in our community uh by no means are we encouraging people to do uh to take cannabis it is really a listen and learn information session uh we know there will be a lot of questions and we have presented a lot of um als specific information to you today to speak about but also if you have questions please put them in the chat box at the end of the presentation we will make sure that we address those if they are very specific questions to your specific question uh condition we're going to ask you to reach out to the company directly where we can make sure that you're connected with the right people more of today is general information so i'm going to go ahead and let you kind of do a little bit of introduction and make sure that uh everyone knows who you are sure thank yeah so as mentioned my name is arash and i am one of the international medical graduates that works at the apollo cannabis clinics i grew up in calgary alberta so proud canadian kid and i went to most of my middle school was a medical school was completed in the states so i spent a significant amount of time in atlanta georgia and i also did a couple of rotations my elective rotations in cook county hospital in chicago illinois so that is where i was before i moved to toronto so that's a little bit about me um when you graduate medical school you got to put in your time into the community and you have to build up your resume and then you apply for residency and that's kind of where i am at now so i work closely with all the healthcare professionals at apollo and i also work very closely with the research department um we have several ongoing research projects at apollo and that's something i'm going to discuss as i go so without further ado i'll start the presentation and as kim had mentioned um if you have questions put them into the question box i encourage questions the more the better i think and obviously i'll take them off right a webinar on thursday which pals okay so i'm gonna get started guys um first and foremost who is apollo apollo was a research institution that started in 2013 from a group of pain management physicians that were running out of treatment options for the patients that they were treating they would have to say mr mr smith i'm sorry i no longer have any other protocol to treat the condition that you are suffering from and the patient's turned back to the healthcare professionals and ask them well what about medical mechanics this is something that i am interested in and let's give it a shot and the doctors got together and they recognized that they knew very little about medical cannabis and they thought well let's research a small group of chronic pain patients to see what benefits we can find and they monitor them very closely and they started with you know the very entry level products for medical cannabis and they saw very very good results very early on and the group started to kind of communicate that to the people around them and they went from a small group of 30 to 60 then to 120 and then it became exponentially larger so the research institution was converted into a cannabis clinic inadvertently they didn't really plan it that way but they had no other choice with the number of patients that were coming in they had to dedicate a nurse to dedicate a couple of doctors just to that patient base so we now have um this number is a bit dated we have well over 50 000 patients rostered in our emr we do see patients coast to coast all over canada we have a team of physiatrists anesthesiologists we have pain specialists we have a psychiatrist mental health is a very big issue at apollo and that's something we address all the time and of course we have family doctors and we have academics and researchers that follow all of the information so as i'm sure a lot of people in this audience will know medical cannabis is kind of new and it has a lot of interest towards it a lot of people are gravitating towards it to see if it can benefit them but what we have to do as medical professionals is pay attention to the information because we all know that collecting retrospectively or proactively for research is just as important as the treatment options that we give patients on a daily basis so as mentioned we've been involved in a lot of research projects the current pandemic has slowed down a few of course since we have had to have some distance put between us and our patients but we have been doing research since 2013 as mentioned we've been published for ptsd with the use of medical cannabis and we have a couple other papers that i can't speak too much on because they are still in peer-to-peer review but again that is where we started that is our foundation and it's it's something that's very important to the fabric of apollo because without knowledge and information about what you were doing it's it's sometimes shooting in the dark and we fully understand that when it comes to this medication sometimes the dosing is us trying to learn but what we promise our patients is we will follow we will learn and we will understand what can help them so that brings us to our patients medical cannabis comes with a level of stigma to it we all know that um and we we have to counsel other physicians or other institutions about it all the time people think when you go to a medical cannabis clinic well you're going to be stepping into a place that has you know some slow playing music a lot of snacks in the background people are laughing a lot and guys i'm gonna make it very clear that is not the case we are a doctor's office like any other we have a waiting room we have consultation rooms we have education rooms so it's it's very regimented and you would be surprised the amount of people that walk in there wondering if there's something going to be out of the ordinary but again it is just the doctor's office oh and also worth mentioning on this slide um when it comes to our patient base the epidemiology the reports the numbers have come back since the legalization of recreational cannabis in 2017 which is what kind of started the trend for medical cannabis as well interestingly enough medical cannabis has been legal since 2001. recreational cannabis became legal in 2017. so medical cannabis has almost got 20 years behind it but everybody thinks well 2017 is when the leaf was turned that's not the case it's just when it became more popular so our patient demographics now with the new numbers that have come back to us since 2017 shows that the age category of 18 to 35 for the use of cannabis has not changed it's the 65 and over audience crowd demographic whatever you want to call them that has gone up exponentially and again it is a treatment option for many people who suffer from chronic conditions and that's why i think that that age group is looking more towards an alternative with medical cannabis as opposed to the traditional treatments so our medical process i wanted to make sure that i went over this quickly just so people understood there's again a lot of mystery when it comes to medical cannabis and medical cancer clinics why is there a clinic that is dedicated to just one medication well that's because a lot goes into it first and foremost we'll start at the top step one when anybody comes to apollo whether it's virtually over the phone or in person when we were open before the pandemic they must go through what is called a triage that is designed for us to attain all your past medical history the current reason you're looking to use medical cannabis and the current list of medications and any other information that the physician would like to have before consulting for medical cannabis step two is your doctor's appointment right this is where you will have a consultation with a healthcare professional they will go over all things that you need to know and ensure a safety profile is in place for that individual step three is the medical document this is your prescription the prescription must go to what is called a licensed producer there are about 350 of them in canada now licensed producers are just basically your pharmacies we do not choose one or the other we will send the prescription or the medical document wherever the patient wishes now most people come to clinic and have no idea what a licensed producer is so we explain it these are companies that have approval from health canada to grow medical cannabis and we can send a doctor's prescription to them to give you access for medical campus and again that's all nlp is once a licensed producer is chosen we go to step five and this is where apollo's bread and butter is this is what we're really proud of we spend a lot of time with our patients we fully educate them on what to expect when using cbd what to expect if using thc and everything in between that can happen between side effects or or help with the condition all of this stuff is discussed and again that's what an education entitles after the education it's important to know that the medication will be sent directly to the patient's door we are inadvertently contactless right the medication comes from the license producer directly to the patient's home that is a registered address and as i present to you now that is the only legal way to attain medical cannabis if ever you come across a clinic that is giving you cannabis in the clinic that is illegal so again just so you understand the medication must be sent in the mail licensed producers i've added this slide just so people have a better understanding again these are health canada approved state-of-the-art facilities these guys have positive airway pressure in large warehouses and greenhouses they're amazing to experience if you ever have the opportunity you step into a facility and you're hit with a a warm air it's almost tropical and then you close the store and there's a whole bunch of people in white jumpsuits again it's to keep everything sterile and to keep out contaminants they have licenses to grow the plant which they can turn into oils capsules sprays nowadays they also do vape cartridges and edibles and again i'll discuss all the different methods of consumption when we get there i was a little off about my number i apologize guys i said about 350 um i guess the marketing teams updated that for me it's about 380. needless to say there are many options when it comes to medical cannabis so we try to clarify that we have a list of top 10 or top 15 licensed producers that we really like and that number and those ratings have come from our patients to us if someone says to me hey you know what i tried this license producer they were really quick with their shipping and they were excellent in understanding what i needed well then guess what they're going to get bumped up in our list because i know that a patient has had a positive experience there these licensed producers are armed to grow two plants and there's a third that i will also discuss the first plant just a bit of background guys i'm going to discuss the two different plants and then we'll get into the medical compounds i have yet to say anything about cbd or thc sativa plants were initially discovered in south america they are big they are tall um if you ever see a fully grown sativa plant and you look at the base of the plant it's almost you know as thick as the end of a baseball bat you won't be able to pull it out of the ground with your hands they're strong strong plants they actually kind of grew feral in a lot of places in south america and that's how they were initially discovered farmers were trying to keep them off their land and a few farmers reported that they plucked some of these strange smelling buds from these plants and they would chew on them while they were working and they all reported a better mood and less back pain and they weren't as tired so again that's generally where the plant sativa started they are known to be uplifting and energizing the memory trick for a sativa plant is sativa as for sun again it can be uplifting the next plant that they grow is called the indica plant now indica we remember this way indica in the couch they're supposed to be calming and relaxing okay so again and i'm not talking about cbd or thc yet but the indica plant was discovered um in asia remembering that the sativa plants are big and strong and tall the indica plants are short and stubby and they're actually kind of sensitive plants um their properties again are the opposite of the sativas they're calming and relaxing where the sativas are uplifting and energizing but the two plants are genetically identical okay so that's important to note genetically identical but phenotypically different and what i mean by that is that they have different characteristics phenotypes are what distinguish the differences between all species including humans so phenotypes will choose the color of our eyes the color of our hair our bone density there's a lot of different factors within any species that are different and differentiated by phenotypes and again sativas and indicas are identical genetically but phenotypically different and that's the difference between them i mentioned the third plant sometimes a license for two producers will want the strengths of a sativa plant and they'll want the properties of an indica plant so they will cross pollinate them and they'll call that a hybrid i'm not a botanist i don't know too much about how it occurs but i know that most medical cannabis providers will have a hybrid version of their plants just to ensure that a patient will have access to that as well medical compounds drum roll this is what we've all been waiting for right this is where the important stuff can come come forward now when i first started giving these presentations there wasn't many people who knew what cbd was right i have to take a long pause on this slide to describe you know cbd this is cannabidiol this is the non-psychoactive component of medical cannabis fast forward two and a half years feels like it's been a lot longer but now everybody knows what cbd is now there is a person that doesn't understand what cbd is when i have these presentations so i've just put a list of some of the things we've seen in clinic and what we've recorded as the benefits of cbd for for us to discuss here um if i had to choose a couple off this list that were probably the the more important ones i would say the analgesic effect it's a fancy way of saying painkiller and the anti-inflammatory properties these are very very important as well one of the main conditions we see in clinic is the simple run-of-the-mill osteoarthritis right the painful knee or the bad back or the bad neck i've even seen a lot of hip discomfort as well in clinic and again this is a person who through time has worn down the joint and you have site inflammation when things get too close there's pain there and there's inflammation and that site inflammation if left untreated can graduate into systemic inflammation and now you have pain that started in the hip but you also have a headache and your shoulder hurts again you can't understand why and again that's all from systemic inflammation and again the anti-inflammatory properties of cbd play strong role for those patients another one here that's also important is an anti-enzyme right mental health we do see a lot of the pediatric population coming to our clinic now because of the epilepsy that can be controlled with cbd as well again it isn't anti-epileptic it can help that way as well remembering guys um cbd does not have a psychoactive effect and to translate that into more simple terms it will not get anybody quote-unquote high as the kids call it these days that's not going to be a risk factor for cbd the side effects of high use cbd are an upset stomach or diarrhea or a headache and again these are all things that we've seen in clinic and documented and recorded at a very low percentage the next chemical compound that comes off of the plant is called thc so this is the infamous one this is the one that people watch out for this is the one that sometimes people are scared of when they come into clinic guys i want to make this very very clear thc plays a very important role no i have no volume sorry guys i'm getting a little bit of background noise um so thc is not the component that most people are started with when it comes to medical cannabis but again it can be a very very helpful tool in the physician's belt when we discuss medical cannabis for certain cases remembering it also is a powerful anti-inflammatory okay it also helps a lot with insomnia a sleep disturbance is probably the number one complaint when it comes to any chronic condition it is the primary psychoactive component of medical cannabis but that is dose dependent it's very important for people to understand i always say the dose is the drug not the chemical component because recreational cannabis has its starting point and medical cannabis stays beneath it and we ensure that our patients do not feel the ill effects of thc in fact if people do feel them well then that's a miss that's a that's uh we have failed that patient we need to go back and discuss the treatment plan and their doses and how we can lower and still help our goal is to attain the lowest therapeutic dose when it comes to medical cannabis again i i tell you now from experience thc is a very helpful component on this list is also appetite stimulating anti-medic you know in a world in which everybody is trying to lose weight why would we ever want to stimulate the appetite with thc and the answer to that is it has its place medical oncology is one of those places people who go through chemotherapy or radiation will have a complete loss of appetite in fact they'll suffer from a lot of nausea and again a little bit of thc can reignite that appetite for them a little bit and also help with some of the nausea they're experiencing also there's anorexia and bulimia people who struggle to have an appetite can find some assistance when it comes to thc drag homes i thought this was an interesting slide maybe not all will agree but um these tiny little projections oh let me rewind this is a microscopic photograph of the plant so cannabis has a little over 100 different chemical compounds that come off of it 100 different types of cannabinoids and they're all housed in these tiny little oily projections called trichomes this is important to know because this means that a plant that is 97 carbohydrate based has a small percentage of fat that grows on it and that that soluble medication or fat soluble chemical compound that comes off of the plant has receptors in our body and it can affect the human body that way because again it is fat soluble so at the end of the day these big fancy licensed producers and all of these numerous medical cannabis clinics are all trying to harness this tiny little microscopic fat that comes from the plant a licensed producer will take five to ten grams of a bud from a particular plant and they will crush it and they will heat it at a very high rate and they are basically melting off these trichomes and when they melt them off they attain a small concentrated amount of it and then health canada tells them they must dilute that with healthy oil they now choose medium chain triglycerides or mct oil which is a coconut derivative which is one of the healthier oils that we can ingest and they mix with with the oils that come off of the cannabis plant that allows the medication to be unmixable so now you have an even amount of medication throughout that oil and again remembering that it's fat based and you're mixing a fat with the fat you can't unmix it so again it's the safest method in which we can that we can consume medical cannabis so we've talked about thc and cbd we've talked about sativas and indicas and now we're going to discuss what is called the endocannabinoid system this is a system in our body that is already in place there are several different ways we can plug cannabinoids into this system and starting from the top we have cannabis or cannabinoids these are the ones that are being put into the body from either a plant base or a synthetic base endocannabinoids the word endo in latin just means endogenous which means us endocannabinoids are the ones that our body naturally produces and then there are synthetic cannabinoids as well and these are the nabalone and side effects that's what they're known for for any given reason we have observed in clinic that both nabalone and satovx not to be confused with sativa plants sativex is the synthetic version of thc they don't respond well for long and what do i mean by that sometimes you have a patient who will come in and they started on 20 milligrams of sativex they come in a week later and say it worked for three days and it hasn't worked for the past two well the physician will say okay well though maybe we need a higher dose we'll go from 20 to 40 and the same will occur they get about a one to 48 hours 72 hours of benefit and then that falls off again it is quick to be tolerated for some reason that we do not understand when it comes to the cannabis plants and what they produce they're called phytocannabinoids so the ones that come from plants are called phytocannabinoids and they tend to work far better in the system we've observed small percentage of tolerance and again we can easily combat that and we teach our patients how to do that on a daily basis for reference it's important to know that cb1 is the thc receptor and cb2 is the cbd receptor so if we look at this they are everywhere and when something is widely found throughout the body we use a fancy medical term we call it ubiquitous again just a fancy way of saying they're everywhere and this is probably the reason why medical cannabis can be used in so many different conditions which is why we have such a massive variety of patients in our clinic this is another slide just further breaking down the systems that are involved and the receptors that can be found so obviously first and foremost the very top of the list is the brain right upper motor neuron is your brain and spinal cord lower motor neurons will be your peripheral nervous system so everything after the brain and spinal cord will be considered the lower motor neurons or the peripheral nervous system but if we look closely in the brain there's both cb1 and cb2 receptors so everybody always thinks that thc affects the brain and cbd affects the body it's not necessarily true cbd alone can affect people's mental health in a positive way thc can help with sleep in the central nervous system and a physician may choose to go that route depending on what the sleep disturbance is caused by so if you think about it i'm going to talk about chronic pain as an example for the brain chronic pain is consistent signaling that goes to the brain it doesn't allow us to really think of anything else so a patient who is suffering from let's just say fibromyalgia is lying in bed struggling with pain and they're just constantly getting messages not allowing them to rest so cbd can play a role in helping control that anxiety that comes with chronic pain thc will help initiate sleep so again they play important roles and both these things can be discussed at a doctor's appointment other important organs to recognize here would be probably the large intestine if i had it my way that would probably take up half of this slide um the gi is one of the areas of largest free radical damage in our body every time we eat we're causing a lot of cell turnover so the large intestines need some antioxidant help cbd is a very very good antioxidant for the digestive system and also the central nervous system there are set conditions that we see for the large intestines or the digestive tract in general as well there is ulcerative colitis there's crohn's disease celiac is another big one that we see and sometimes the patients will say well i still react the same way to those foods but instead of being sick for 10 days or 15 days after a poor reaction when i use cbd i'm only really feeling poor about 48 hours after so it's really helping with my recovery again these are things we hear the immune system is also another big one here guys way at the bottom almost off the slide but the immune system is where we find a lot of benefits when it comes to rheumatology or autoimmune conditions as well i'm assuming there will be many questions about this slide so i'll come back to it at the end we can stop on it this photo is every medical student's nightmare this is where we spend a lot of time understanding the exact physiology of of the human body in this particular case we're looking at the pre and the post-synaptic cleft i assume in this group this picture will not be so foreign to us sometimes when i do these presentations a hand will go up and people will say well i don't even know what i'm looking at is that an elbow is that me guys this is the pre and post-synaptic clef this is how the neurological system communicates okay so there are receptors in place and what i want to make very clear before i i leave this slide because to me it's boring is that there's 2ag and anandamide those are the two chemical components that our body naturally produces in the endo cannabinoid system and there is cb1 receptors that also affect the central nervous system that act in a very similar way again in this particular photo it's showing thc but cbd also has receptors in both the pre and postsynaptic left so it can affect how we perceive pain it can also help with the inflammatory process that follows pain and we can also kind of address some of the other symptomatologies that follow chronic conditions so when it comes to the endocannabinoid system these are again some of the things that we have seen that are benefiting our patients comes down to inflammation pain digestion sleep bone density is an interesting one mood stress regulation and even reproduction these are the conditions that we have documented well in clinic chronic pain being at the top of the list neuropathic pain second to that when it comes to als most people do not discuss pain but they do report pain in about sixty percent from my readings even as high as seventy times as well so pain is a neuropathic origin when it happens with als from my understanding and again cannabis does play a role with that fibromyalgia is after that ms an autoimmune condition in which the central nervous system is being attacked i've already discussed epilepsy and ptsd with you guys we have anxiety and stress insomnia is huge i think that um anytime you walk into any room i it's fair to assume that more than half the people in that room aren't sleeping properly and that's again something we hear in clinic and some people say i started taking cbd for my migraines but i've never slept better so even when i don't have a migraine i'd like to continue and the doctor turns to them and says that's okay with me as long as you check in every three months and we're on the understanding that this is an as needed medication when you need it you can stop if you wish you can use regularly if you wish as well so this is an additional slide that i put in here um regarding als um again when when i did a lot of my homework with this stuff i went back into my medical books and then i read up on what was new um and we're we're still struggling guys obviously i mean i don't need to spend too much time stating that to this audience but i just put some of the facts that i've come across the second most common neural disease second to alzheimer's very high incidence in caucasians and slightly higher in males is also what i found there's a sporadic and hereditary route i'm looking forward to the questioning portion of this because i'm hoping that you guys can even fill this in for me a little bit further but again i've found again from my recent readings that it's 90 sporadic and about 10 hereditary average age of onset between 40 and 55 but seen as young as 25. and now we're kind of circling back to how medical cannabis can play a role with als symptom control with the sleep disturbances and obviously with the pain management i've also added here from what we have observed in clinic reduced fasciculations and again reduced neuropathic pain is something that we have seen from the als patients in our clinic now what does that mean when you see and observe something in a condition like als all that we can do is document all that we can do is share that information with the next patient that comes in but we must be very clear just because it works for one person doesn't mean it will work the same way for everyone and that is the case for any medication guys not just medical cannabis when when medication is released into the market and it has gone through all of the battery of tests that come from the cdc and health canada they still say these are the side effects that we observed these are the positive benefits we observed and within two standard deviations of the norm ninety percent of people started at this dose the only difference between medical cannabis and most other medications is that we never got a chance to do the bell curve of the dosing so to combat that what we do in our clinic is to start at the lowest possible dose that you can and i always tell patients this is interesting we're going to start a dose that you probably feel nothing and then we're going to move up slowly and once we've attained therapeutic benefit we might push a little bit further if it's the same we'll come back to reduce cost that's the method that we use to ensure proper dosing in our clinic methods of consumption this is a big one now initially and when i say initially i mean two and a half three years ago um there were only oils that can be used okay so like i explained the trichomes were being melted off and put into an mct based coconut oil and patients would only have to dry out what was a small oral syringe and they would measure the dose and that would go into their mouth there was a huge conception of do i put it under my tongue is it absorbed under my tongue no it is not remembering that it is a fat based medication the liver is required for digestion we call that first past metabolism and that is what causes the delay or the kick-in for medical cannabis products at times if they're ingested if they're edible so you consume that oil it goes down into your stomach over into your intestines your liver picks that up stamps it sends it everywhere that prospect takes about an hour and a half to two hours depending on that person's metabolism once the medication is in your system it should last anywhere from four to eight hours again i put the longest window of variability most people tell us it's about four to six sometimes people say it goes past eight again it'll depend on that person's metabolism nowadays we have capsules which have just been concentrated oils into a capsule and it's much much easier to use in that way um patients are very very happy about the capsules and so were we we had a lot of trouble with you know drawing out a dose in public or people who have arthritis and have trouble getting the bottles open now we just move on to capsules it's much much easier i put here it is important to start low and go slow which is just again referencing our titration methodology the second form of um in uh medical cannabis and the method that can be used is inhalation guys i always take a hard pause when i do this presentation to make it very clear we do not promote that anybody smoke anything in apollo but there are health canada approved vaporizers that have the ability to take a dry flower and you put the dry flower into a unit this photo is one of them and that unit will heat the plant to the point of dehydration that plant will let off a steam or a mist and you're inhaling a very small amount of steam that is very different than the recreational vaporizers that are out there the jewels or whatever brands that are out there that people are using that are within seconds giving them huge clouds of smoke those products are are burning plastics and they have vitamin e acetate and there's a lot of inhaled oil and plastic that goes into the lungs and that's causing a whole array of problems for people i can get into that during the questions if someone wishes the condition has been called popcorn lung and i can explain why but what's important to remember is the only difference between vaporizing the correct way and ingesting is that vaporizing will act much much faster there are certain patients that benefit from this and there are certain patients that absolutely need it um and those patients would be our veterans right ptsd is a condition in which a person's mindset is in a war zone they don't have an hour and a half to two hours to wait they grab their vaporizer and they turn it on and there's also a misconception that people think as soon as you are vaporizing cannabis you're using thc that is not the case you can attain pure cbd flower and inhale that and again they unanimously report symptom control they say that you know i'm calm again i avoided panic attacks this month i was able to stay away from the unpleasant trees of my inner self when i'm going through a struggle with ptsd and again these are things that we've documented recorded and they come back to us and their families come back to us and they're all very very thankful they say thank you for giving my husband back or my wife back to me um he wasn't himself or he wasn't herself when she come back so this is helping again i put here it's within five minutes as quick as it comes it also leaves a little bit faster it's about one to four hours before the efficacy is passed i've added a couple slides for terpenes guys this is um something that a lot of patients are telling us um in clinic it's very interesting remembering back to the trichomes that grow off of medical cannabis those tiny little fat projections because they are fat they can have particles settle on them dust settles on them pollen will settle on them so if a medical cannabis plant or any cannabis plant is growing next to a lavender field chances are that it will adapt to some of its environment it can pull in some lavender pollen and that becomes a part of the plant's genetics it's very interesting so plants that have a bit of the lavender terpene profile to them have a calmer relaxing feel a terpene i should explain is any scent or aroma or flavor that comes from all plant matter so if anyone has a basil plant at home and they pluck a leaf off of that and they smell it you are smelling the terpene profile of that plant cannabis has recorded all of these different terpenes within the plant so linolol was the one that i was referring to lavender that is again it can be used to have calming effects um it's a bit sedating it helps with insomnia naturally chirophiline is another one that one's a little bit hard to say but that is the one that comes off of black cloves um spicy woody scent to it again these are all things that we document in clinic pinene is a very popular one as well this one's an interesting one we have patients who use cbd with a high level of pinene and they come back and say hey guess what i don't need my asthma inhaler nearly as much anymore i feel that it really dilates my lungs and i can breathe a little better when i use my cbd well we have to listen we have to document and that is what we have done here there will never be a time when someone you know goes into a clinic or or a bit of an acute setting in an emergency setting and says you know i need to shut a little or i'm not going to make it it doesn't have direct medical value but it's helping and we're paying attention guys side effects this is another hot topic when it comes to these presentations a lot of people love to ask me well i heard so and so tried it and they went crazy and they were never the same person again that is not what happens when it comes to medical cannabis this is a very very controlled and monitored situation that people get into when it comes to medical cannabis all of these side effects that are seen here are from the use of high thc i pause for dramatic effect remembering that cbd side effects are an upset stomach or a headache these are all from high thc and again of course dry mouth is on the top of the list here drowsiness well i thought about adding this one and i took it off and i put it back on i thought is it really a side effect if we're using thc for sleep assistance and a patient is feeling drowsy isn't that what the goal was but again i put it there in case someone didn't want to feel drowsy thc would have to be avoided and that's common practice some of the more uncommon side effects are a panic attack paranoia or psychosis guys these are so uncommon that we hardly ever see them and if it is something that is a danger to the patient we protect the patient the only time a patient would suffer from a panic attack paranoia or psychosis is if they were predisposed to it if they were diagnosed with schizophrenia if they're diagnosed with bipolar if there's a family history of schizophrenia all these questions are asked and documented and recorded by the doctor before a prescription is even put into place so again the old tale of someone using cannabis and never being the same is not true mental disease is just not well known enough and a lot of people who are struggling with mental disease will go into alternatives to try and attain some form of benefit and it's not always a healthy practice but these things can occur any stimulant can cause psychosis in a person who is schizophrenic this is uh also something that i wanted to add and discuss with you guys a very in a sneaky way added the opioid overdose and i wanted to compare and contrast to cannabis because the opioid crisis is no secret guys i don't want to throw shadow at modern medicine but at a time opioids were helping so many different conditions that physicians started to write it more and more and unfortunately they're incredibly addictive and when the doctor would say no to a person well they were left with alternative methods to attain it it wasn't ever safe to begin with the reason why opioids can be so dangerous is because they do have receptors in our respiratory center our breathing center it is considered a neurological suppressant there was a time in which a lot of movie stars and famous people were passing away from opioids and that's because the physician would give them the prescription and tell them please do not use this with any with any other neurological suppressants and they'd say yeah sure doc don't worry about it they would take their medication and then they would sit and have a couple glasses of wine and the next thing you know you have not just one neurological suppressant you have two and they would go to sleep and they would simply stop breathing due to opioids having receptors in the breathing center it was very sad that is called an accidental overdose the comparison and contrast is that thc does not have receptors in the breathing centers of our brain and there is no way that it can slow down our breathing again very important to this group very important for everybody to understand that there has never been a reported case of death due to the use of cannabis addiction i think some of the questions that came our way before this presentation were asking me about addiction so i i brought forth this slide i absolutely hate this slide but i have to give you guys something um if we look at the bottom here it's very dated it came out of washington dc in 2001 but this was a study that was done and it was respectful enough for us to post it here cannabis is reported to have about a nine percent dependency rate now dependency in medicine is described as somebody who requires a substance or they are at risk from a physical standpoint if you take alcohol away from an alcoholic there's a chance that they can suffer from a heart attack seizures renal renal dysfunction they want to call it so regardless there's lots of different things that can happen if you remove the substance with cannabis there are none of those things nine percent of people said they were living better with it and they wanted it again so and again this list is talking about people who smoked cannabis it has nothing to do with medical cannabis i hate that we're even in the same arena as some of the substances in this slide you know heroin and cocaine and tranquilizers those are very heavy street drugs but at the top of the list is tobacco which is readily available at a very young age in this country and then of course alcohol which we celebrate with and that's quite a a a very very toxic substance when you think about it alcohol kills people there are several hundred deaths in toronto every month based on alcohol dependency again under the radon right we're okay with it because it's been around for a while but cannabis has all this stigma so it's important to know the facts this is another one that i've added here um because i thought it was very interesting to share with you guys one of our physicians came to us from a substance abuse recovery program and he said his patients were all unanimously asking more about medical cannabis so he decided to join the apollo team the apollo family and he wanted to learn more and he started paying attention to the medications that were dropping off the list when patients were using medical cannabis and these are some of the results that we found so again alcohol substitution more than 40 percent that's an enormous number illicit drug use this is what he saw in his private clinic not us but about 26 of those patients were able to substitute cannabis the big one the most important one that we like to talk about is obviously prescription medications more than 65 were able to reduce prescription medications with the use of medical cannabis and of course you have these buds in the background that we now understand the reason why they're fuzzy and sticky is because of those tiny little trichomes that brings me to the end guys um i'll stop here because i anticipate questions and maybe some discussion so let me get back to everybody can you see me kim i can see you i can't see you i can still see your screen okay what about you know perfect we're good thank you so much uh aaresh okay so we have a few questions that have been coming in if people have any more questions please type them in now uh before we end the presentation we will follow up with you though and and your clinic uh if there so one of the questions um was how can cannabis help muscular atrophy and not neurological so muscular yeah a lot of clients suffer from muscular issues and it's not yeah of course of course i mean let's look at a big picture okay als is a loss of communication with central nervous system let's leave it at that any muscle who that is not used over a period of time will atrophy okay i have to be 100 honest with you guys medical cannabis does not play a role when it comes to the physiological physiological atrophy of muscle we don't i i can't even sit here and connect it in any way shape or form we do not play a role that way the best combat for atrophy is physiotherapy guys you got to use that muscle to build that muscle and of course i understand that's not always available but that is that is the combat atrophy good question can you tell us some of the benefits for someone who has bulb or onset symptoms yeah remembering that almost 80 percent of all als will graduate into bulbar symptoms this is something that we must discuss with als patients right if a patient is having trouble swallowing or trouble breathing and medical cannabis can help relax that nerve or thc at a micro dose can help as a muscle relaxant then we can say that we're some way benefiting it would have to be a trial and air basis we would start again at the lowest dose possibly move up slowly to see if there is a benefit sometimes they come back to us and say it's still the same we will have a very serious conversation you see well we understand that we have tried and this is not a treatment option for you but it would be with the relaxation of muscles and that's the only role we can play um does cannabis help with anxiety around you know people who have an als diagnosis but also people who are suffering from severe copd copd yeah if a patient comes in with anxiety and copd you better believe the physician is check marking no inhaled forms of cannabis okay we're going to be ingestible only cbd plays a role as an anti-inflammatory copd is inflamed airways that have been clogged up and now we're going the other opposite direction you can't get oxygen out so to not bore us with all the details spoken patients do come to our clinic and we do give them cbd and then ingestible forms of a combination of both cbd and thc can help with the anxiety right remembering that both anxiety and depression are two conditions from the same area of the brain one is an overcompensation one is an under but they're definitely linked right so you can help kind of regulate people we put people back into what we call homeostasis which is balance that's not always easy to find it's ghost dependent but i promise you we'll find it okay um is there medical cannabis that's available in edibles yeah you know it's funny edibles is an interesting term people are thinking now well edibles are out so where's the cookies and the chocolates and the brownies and all that fun stuff you guys remember cannabis is a fat soluble medication so when you consume a brownie that has cannabis versus a capsule that is medical cannabis or an oil they all get digested the same way right they're still first past metabolism a lot of the licensed producers now have chocolates a lot of them have cookies the only kind of restriction that help canada has put on these license producers when it comes to the fun quote-unquote edibles is that they must be broken down by dose in the past you would get someone telling you hey here's a cookie you know eat half of it don't eat the whole thing it's too much well how do you know the medication isn't all sitting on one side of that cookie you have to feel one way you meet the other half of you you feel completely different so canada has said that is not allowed you have to give individually sized dose dependent edibles so i guess the energy questions yes they do exist i think there will be some people on the call that will be quite happy to know that it comes to chocolate form yes um so one of the questions we're having is who pays for medical cannabis and then the second question was did ohip cover that cost good questions uh there's a couple there so first and foremost your entire process will apollo is completely free all right it is overhead covered and it doesn't matter what province you live in right now we are able to see patients from coast to coast like mentioned so the six steps that i showed are all covered the medication is still considered private so that is on the patient unfortunately we are at the top of our lungs with health canada we want this stuff covered just as much as patients do we do have a lot of different avenues that we can travel if a patient is looking for some form of financial relief a lot of these companies offer compassionate pricing there are certain companies that are higher priced or lower priced we can find out exactly what would best keep the individual but as it stands now it is uh is private it'll range in price anywhere from 25 to 100 a month depending on what the patient needs um is there a typical timeframe one of the things you you may reference to a few times was low and slow and is there a typical time frame for a patient to start feeling like they've really reached that perfect dose yes it usually takes us anywhere from four to six weeks to learn and what we do with our patients is they have their first appointment and we drop a treatment plan that's gonna slowly increase their dose with a phone number to our call center that's open seven days a week if they need it and we don't want anyone feeling abandoned and we always tell patients after their first visit look you've been here a while this is a long process the one thing you must remember when you leave is if you feel any side effects stop immediately and call us okay there is no weaning schedule with medical cannabis but because it is fat soluble it can take time to build up in the system and we see those benefits anywhere from four to six weeks out a lot of people are like wondering i took that one dose how come i'm not okay guys you cannot obtain a benefit from any medication with a single dose we have to try over time so we have a question from a client who's been taking um cannabis over for overnight for sleeping um just wondering is there a benefit of increasing that to take it during the day so what's the benefit the difference between maybe regular dosing versus time-specific dosing the the benefits would be based on the half-life of the medication okay so let's say someone is taking and actually i'm gonna give you a real case we had a patient who came in um who had really really bad osteoarthritis in both knees okay former soccer player he says my knees are killing me i take cbd first thing in the morning and it really helps me until about one o'clock so after one o'clock i'm kind of just left with my pain and in the evening i take my sleeping dose and that really helps as well what he has inadvertently discovered is that it takes him about four to six hours for it to come out of his system so his eight am dose is done by about one o'clock so i asked him well why don't we take another dose at 12 30 because i didn't know i could do that i said well if you're feeling the pain again that means that the medication has come out of your system the advantage to using it more regularly is symptom control and more hours of anti-inflammation or anti-inflammatory properties of cannabis so good question you can extend daytime products in the day and then obviously your evening product will be your even product um one of the words that you use and i'm going to try to say efficacy um explain that to people yeah efficacy is where we attain a clinical benefit okay if something is ineffective it's not high efficacy that means that it's not affecting anything it's not helpful but we try to retain the lowest therapeutic dose and the highest efficacy which means we want to use as little as possible with the maximum effect and the only way you can do that is to get to a dose where you're feeling something push a little past that and see if there's any more benefit if not you come back to the lower dose sometimes and very rarely patients will call us and say well i tried one evening capsule and didn't work so i went to two it was okay i went to three and that was not pleasant for me i didn't like how i felt well i will say well mrs smith mr smith we now know what we don't want to feel okay we will go back to a lower dose that is more effective there's a higher efficacy for you i hope i answered that one other questions we had was is a little bit more complicated but um a person who received um a prescription for medical cannabis and and picked that up from their pharmacy um but feels like they don't have they've never been given any actual instructions where do people turn for that support you have to go back to the clinic that is that is our our number one problem with medical cannabis unfortunately i i'm in the industry myself and i see it all the time we have patients that come to our clinic and say well i went to so-and-so and they told me to use this but that's all i heard and talked to me since well like a doctor's office if they give you a prescription and you call and say this isn't working yet the doctor will say well we've got to give it four more weeks so we got to give it two more weeks so if it didn't work stop and i'll come back in for a follow-up we treat cannabis the exact same the problem is that there are a lot of clinics that are opening that are not correctly situated to support the patient base so it's it's it's unequivocally important for patients to understand that your support system is just as important as access to the medication right so if i was a patient that had nowhere to call for medication odds are i'll stop using it and then the whole process is undermined by a lack of education so i promise you actually let me rewind that person should go back to the clinic that prescribed to them to have their questions answered and if not they can always give us a call all right can people if they've had not a great experience it's not an issue to switch to another another clinic if they like they're not getting the support they need at one clinic they could go to another clinic and for example being your clinic being one of them i encourage that anytime someone doesn't get what they need from a family doctor they're quick to change right and sometimes people think well this physician didn't treat me right or this nurse practitioner didn't treat me right i want to go somewhere else and they go somewhere else and they attain an entirely different experience i'm not trying to say we're you know we're walking this golden line here but in actuality if a medical facility is not fulfilling the need for a patient the next question we had was around cannabis salves so creams and lotions uh and and the benefit around that yeah topicals topicals so a big hot topic um it's interesting to say but i'll do my best to explain it when we think about our bodies we always tend to look past the skin right one of our biggest and most important organs it is a fat soluble protective layer cannabis is fat soluble yes it will absorb yes it will affect the joint that is put on that being said we have seen benefit from smaller more peripheral joints right so a bad elbow wrist ankles maybe a knee but if we're talking about back pain shoulder pain or hip pain anything that's deeper you got to go systemic and like i explained when it comes to you know osteoarthritis chronic pain which is more than 70 of what we see in clinic any site inflammation will graduate into systemic inflammation and it's important to address systemic inflammation with the systemic anti-inflammatory i love topicals and i love how people are gravitating towards them well they're saying well i don't want to use cannabis i just want to use it on my joint and kind of get away with it that's great give it a shot but i promise you you will probably attain a better benefit if using it systemically this has been so helpful in terms of the education for all of us listening um so we know that there will be follow-up questions we are going to to pass them on to you for sure we appreciate everyone listening today but we also really appreciate the information it was very unbiased and really general so if you have a question and you want to talk to a medical professional at your clinic please call you can call any clinic but these guys are offering to to answer questions and and and help give some direction it seems like there's some people that have been posting some comments about that they just feel very lost and so it sounds like from from listening to you speak is that it's really important that people feel well supported in this in terms of the decision making around what works for them and we've heard a lot of times i think the one comment that was made is that um the two things one is low and slow is very important but also um it takes time and it it's not just uh let's do the first dose and be done with things um it doesn't work for people wow right away but for long-term use that's not going to be something that's going to be exactly that's exactly right and again like i mean i always draw on on clinical examples so we have certain patients that tell us my condition is really bad in the winter right so from end of october to march i am able to stay afloat with medical cannabis i don't need it in the summer and that's brilliant like i love to hear that that means that patient is in complete control of their health and their understanding of the signals that are coming to them from their body other people will tell me well i tried it twice and it didn't work and again it's not an antibiotic you have to use it for a long period of time you have to understand what you do for after 90 days and the support systems that are lacking for people discourage that so i i don't want to you know sound like a bit of a broken record but the support system is just as important as access one more thing i wanted to quickly add as you mentioned the pandemic has kind of slowed down some of the more uh research initiatives that we've wanted to do als is is unequivocally important and if we do have those patients what we do is we kind of mark them in our emr we attain their permission to follow them from a category standpoint like i will give you a number not in you won't be written down names but i want to know what we are helping with and what your symptoms were and and how long we treat from the date that you came to us compared to the date of diagnosis moving forward again that information will be way more important to us down the line than any kind of commercial you know posting here so i'm happy to hear you said it was objective and kind of detached from the commercial side of things because our goal is to turn the dial of human understanding we want to know if this thing will be something that we can continue to grow on so as we were wrapping up we're getting rapid questions coming in because people realize so one of the questions is uh what's the best method of ingestion for someone who can't tolerate solid foods and might uh need a feeding tube is there a and i i don't know if you want to address that in this group setting or you'd like to just do that on an individual one no that's fine no that's fine i'm just thinking about it in my head a little bit i would have to know more about the individual but my understanding is if there is a gi-2 then we would want to avoid oils and go to a very small capsule again i don't know if they were able to take that capsule via the gi tube we'd have to do some more investigation but my thinking is less is better for that individual and at a concentrated dose so i would want to have 20 milligrams of cbd at night to start and only at night and then we can graduate into daytime use but we have to understand what it will do first so yes is the short answer okay um can you juice cannabis yeah you can um the process of juicing is interesting some people will juice it cold and then you have unactivated cannabis which just means you have to consume a lot more of it some people juice it and follow some of the cooking recipes a lot of helpful people on youtube um your the process is called decarboxylation which is what licensed producers are doing before they send the medication out the only difference between people doing it at home and people getting it from a licensed producer is that the license producer is health canada certified they have an exact set precise dose whereas if you're doing it at home you're kind of guessing now i've seen a tremendous number of people benefit from home cooking recipes and saying you know it's controlling my sleep and my fibro again so thank you i just don't know how much i'm using i'm making the same recipe week in and week out and sometimes it works better than others i left in the oven for an extra five minutes and that's less effective now again those are problems that some people want most people will think a licensed producer can prepare it for me and that's just the easier way um does does the person need a referral from their gp to work with you or any other clinic i don't know about other clinics for us we do not require a referral anymore this is so interesting some patients were telling us well i don't want my family doctor to know can i come in anyways and we'd say no we need a referral and then we decided one day it's not fair for us to say no to people if they're reaching out for an alternative for their health we need to say yes so we opened our doors to walk-ins and it just flooded in and then we got a whole bunch of enthusiasts saying well now i want my family doctor he told me not to search this out but i've been able to get rid of my sleeping man and some of my pain meds and he should know so we're happy to send a consult note with the full treatment plan highlighted to any physician that refers to us we prefer it but we don't have to have it i always say the more minds involved are better the bigger the circle of care the more care is involved and the last question is where is your clinic so we have um five brick and mortar locations in the toronto the greater area of toronto so i don't know if people are all from ontario but we start in aurora we go down to north york then we have a couple of locations downtown and then out west as well but with the current pandemic in place all of our appointments are over the phone or virtual so you would call you would be given an appointment within 48 hours and then you would have it from the comfort of your own home so that can be anywhere in ontario someone could be referred to your clinic anywhere in canada okay yeah anywhere in canada we have patients all over the country awesome thank you so much uh i think we're done because i think people continue to send stuff in but i really appreciate irish like this was awesome and so helpful for people uh thank you everyone for attending and i hope wish everyone a wonderful rest of the day if you do have any questions please feel free to reach out to us and we'll happily answer those awesome thank you so much for having me you guys want to end with a big token of gratitude it's always great to connect when we're also disconnected awesome thank you so much goodbye", "EL25nbWqHpc": "[Music] good evening a woman from Derbyshire says cannabis has helped her fight breast cancer without resorting to chemotherapy Linda Carson from Willington near Derby has been using cannabis oil since shortly after her diagnosis her doctors were amazed to find that her tumor has indeed shrunk by two-thirds since she started taking the oil Linda is now calling for more research on how cannabis could help fight one day maybe cure some cancers gareth own report linda Coxon takes her daily medication this is cannabis oil derived from the same plant used in the recreational drug remarkably it appears to have helped shrink the aggressive cancerous tumour in Linda's breast to 1/8 of its original size and means for now she can avoid chemotherapy I hadn't known whether it would do anything at all really because it's untried and and so on but to shrink by two-thirds in what effectively was five weeks was just amazing and it sent me into a total spin if I'm honest I've had another ultrasound scan and it did shrink by four millimeters and I've also had a CT scan which confirmed it still shrinking although the oil is made from the cannabis plant it's not hallucinogenic or addictive it's freely available in shops but health campaigners fear the stigma around cannabis could hold back research we need trials of this you know proper trials on people to see whether it works on other cancers do you think the research in this has been delayed because people reacting to that word cannabis absolutely I'm absolutely certain it has cannabis is a drug and everything we read about it it's illegal and people are frightened of it I do think that the mood music is changing because it isn't just me there are lots of people there's also scientific evidence dr. Wei Lu is researching the effect of cannabis on cancer at some George's University in London science backs up these cannabis based products as having an effect in patients with cancer especially in cancer cells so more informations required more research is needed and it's really to lay down once the thought whether or not we can use these chemicals in in patients but cannabis is a long way from being an approved treatment for cancer in a statement Cancer Research UK warned we don't advise taking cannabis outside of a clinical trial because it might interfere with other treatments there's no scientific evidence from clinical trials that cannabis or chemicals found in cannabis helped to treat breast cancer but Linda remains convinced I've started to become evangelical about it because it's being ignored and it shouldn't be she's already taken in her story to Parliament and will continue to campaign Gareth Owen ITV News", "JjTiqvrpnFA": "what you think that this the oil the would have a positive effect on these chil I and I definitely believe it would yes because it's any seizure you know anything like this so I mean I'm never treated in anyone with this condition but I would definitely if this was my child I definitely put this child on the oil try it I mean the main thing here is you're not giving the child something that can harm it no no's arm factor yeah no danger so but I think we have good results with this I really do I think there's hope here that's an awful thing I mean you have to live like that my god that's not a life at all no this gives a child a chance and this is the same way to see with these autistic children you know yeah yeah it just does amazing maturity I trust each other their autistic - yeah most of them yeah well I think that doing your would probably well I believe if it can't cure it is probably gonna be best control you're gonna find and like I said it's harmless so I would definitely try it that's what we're we have been aiming for we've been trying to get this oil here in Iceland legally right for a year now hmm the doctors are working against us Corsair yeah but so now we're coming to a point where we have to say okay are we going to continue on this path and and do this for the next ten years or are we gonna get the oil somewhere else if you thought about taking the channel to the US yeah I've thought about that yeah but I mean illegally and in the system there it's not gonna be eligible but well the problem - I mean the oils available and me dispensaries and things in the US now but but the quality to see that there's no quality control there's no standards in place yet you know we need the freedom to do this simple research in no time we can you know bring this a little too much better levels but I would I definitely would if this is my child I would definitely try that and I think and you know I mean I can't make guarantees but I think you're gonna have good results with this oh yeah yeah I've seen well I mean any like epilepsy or any of these other diseases that you know that it's very similar because you're into seizures yeah and it's great anti-seizure medication even you all's that I produce you know like Sanjay Gupta did that piece on CNN you know and it showed the epileptic children and it was reducing it reduced the number of seizures no question but it didn't stop them they still had seizures here and there even when they were taking off but as soon as I watched that I said if there was some THC and more can't seeing that oh I bet you the seizures would cease completely okay so he's very important yeah that's that's another question I had for you because many people are supporting the use of CBD or an or THC free oil yeah well that's a stupid I mean it's it is it's a synergetic effect of all those well over a hundred different cannabinoids working together that creates these effects these healing effects so the two eleven eight th seeds mean that's stupid I'm just plain stupid so you would recommend a THC high I tried I would try something like a 50-50 yeah CBD THC about the same strength and just small tiny doses we're child up over a few days but I'd be willing to bet that it would have quite a dramatic effect on a child like this okay yeah but norm so the dosage what what would you do a drop or no not even a drop when you're starting and even when I start an adult off in this oil it's really I tell people to start with it's just like a little tiny speck like 1/4 of a drop not much bigger than that okay nothing you know and then over every eight hours and then after four days try to double the dose because that gives us the body time to adjust to it this is a very strong if you got the clear oil it's a very strong medication but again no her almost could have caused the child do is sleep so just keep just doubling the doses every four days and then just watch the child and see what happens and I'm willing to bet after you start doubling dose a couple times I think you'd start seeing some pretty dramatic results I would definitely do this and so you would continue this throughout well not necessarily because I mean the oil might be able to correct the illness you know I think it's a good idea that every child well everybody should be taking you all to protect themselves anyway but you know in case like this if we can bring that loss like y'all to autistic children once you get their body detoxify get these toxins gone they're no longer autistic well they don't have to keep taking you if they don't want it but I really believe in the near future I mean everything I'm seeing now the whole future of medicine is going to be in cannabinoids and you know I so I think it's a good idea to continue taking it but I would you know even if you just got a small quantity of oil like 2 3 grams or four grams not very much just because you know it's gonna take quite a while you're only giving us a tiny little doses like that it takes quite a while you use that much oil up yeah but just keep doing and I can't imagine it not I can't imagine it not helping and everything I firmly believe it would help yeah I think it gives you the best and safest option possible look I'm all I can do for your brother yeah thank you completed yeah I presented a message do some research look into it look what's going on in the internet go on YouTube look at all these children and everything people that are using this now this is no damn joke you'll get this marijuana nonsense out of your head says this this is a medicine and it's a wonderful medicine and it's safe non-addictive what else is are out there like this well PubMed they have hundreds and hundreds of peer-reviewed studies and all types of different things you know they're like well even now they're coming up with evidence now and I knew this years ago because we were treating schizophrenia experice that very effectively now they're admitting finally it's a very attractive treatment for schizophrenia yes but the thing is it's a safety of it no you're not giving your child something that's going to harm it and there's a good possibility that it could save the child's life and free the parents I mean the same thing with this if you have up to an autistic child or you have a child like this you're going to have to take care of that child for the rest it's like it'll never have a life at least with the oil it offers them an opportunity you know it gives them a chance what have you got to lose", "ubOiVHbCkwU": "is this a medicine cannabis has been a medicine for 3,000 years it only hasn't been a medicine in this country for 70 years I mean first of all I think just to talk about the the polarization of marijuana you know as a plan I think people have some ideas but people don't really understand like the journey so we tried to put in a little bit of history and context you know without it being like a big you know kind of write film it's not that kind of film but you know we put in the history so I think people are surprised to learn about that it's in the same schedule as LSD and you know that cocaine is in a less dangerous schedule and people are surprised to learn that the US government has a patent on the compounds in marijuana at the same time the US government is saying it has no medical value this is her cannabis oil regimen that we have right now we give her the size of about a half a grain of rice two times a day with baby food and in fact that it's actually at doing something with these can't with cancer on these children I mean we you know what we were able to follow from five years of making this film watching these subjects get better from this medicine not everyone not not everyone but yeah you know most of the kids and so it's it certainly is something that should people more people should know about and we're looking at this window I mean I think what's amazing when you really start learning about cannabis is honestly like how many people that could help I mean we're talking about like autism a DD Crohn's disease you know it's just this huge list of conditions we focus on pediatric and society we we focus on pediatric cancer because it's dramatic and also it's you know takes the stigma away it's not smoking joints and what people think you're really looking at you know medicinal properties but I think like we were amazed we went to Israel and we went to Jerusalem we went to like the top laboratories to look at the science because of course there are light years ahead of the us because they didn't have all the research blocks and you know it's fascinating to see like different strains killed different cancers but the same strain doesn't kill the same cancer and just the mechanism of how cannabis fights against cancers like super interesting so it's you know it's it's just this world of potential of healing and it's so criminal that it has been kept from us for 80 years there is some cell death the tumor is actually dying in certain areas there's no new growth I'm just thrilled this is the most amazing news we could have ever gotten", "xvOEzUvjP94": "[Music] and just that quickly Riley mailer takes from medical marijuana I take it four times a day one in the morning and then during lunch and then during dinner and then at night before I go to bed the thirteen year olds from Delaware says cannabis oil has helped treat the tumor that was eating away at her bones in second grade and my face started to grow and it was getting bigger my mom decided to take me to the hospital the news from the doctor was grim Riley who was seven at the time was diagnosed with aggressive giant cell granuloma only a handful of people in the world have the disease I was just like so uncomfortable because you know like seeing my face in the mirror and it's like Oh big and it made me really sad and stuff I was also in pain because of my seizures that I started having my stomach would cramp up and I would start I started to hallucinate it's an actually like a gut emptiness of when the doctors you know first described to us what was happening and what they thought was gonna happen after surgery Riley's mom decided to give her medical marijuana to see if it would help her symptoms I was so scared anytime you give your child any kind of new prescription you're scared to do you're looking for those side effects we just researched a lot and came across you know medical cannabis as a possible alternative that could help her heal and I couldn't find anything that was detrimental with using that the tumor it shrunk the seizures they stopped the way smaller than it was before I haven't had a reoccurrence in about four I'm taking cannabis oil it made me feel so much better and my bone was growing back the roots of my teeth were growing back before they were held in with stitches and I was told they wouldn't live but the roots regenerated and I still have my teeth dr. Andrew ordered with the doctor says there's not enough evidence to support whether this type of treatment works the key is if you're thinking about trying it you need to see a pediatrician who specializes in using marijuana and especially in dosing marijuana CBD oil for your kid before I took cannabis my brain was normal and then after I took cannabis all of these years my brain was the same and it didn't harm anything Riley's now made it her mission to help other sick kids get the medicine they need speaking in front of legislature she's already pushed to pass three laws in Delaware one makes it legal for kids in the state to be administered medical marijuana another lets children take it at school O'Reilly law was to make cannabis legal for children because it was illegal and when my mom gave me cannabis it made me feel so much better and I didn't understand why other kids wouldn't have it I wanted to help those kids hi she's also created the nonprofit Riley's smile foundation it's very hard knowing what helped you and seeing other people who could be helped by it bringing smiles to sick children and their families by giving them a better quality of life just like she she is very inspiring to a lot of people and I love seeing that but what she's doing changing kids lives one law at the time the chef's for Inside Edition com [Music]", "dbd6q6X285o": "[Music] what's going on everybody making a different kind of video here and I don't know if I'm gonna actually upload this video to YouTube or if this is just a reference point for me but I'm making Rick Simpson oil using Keef today and isopropyl alcohol so here is a jar of it sitting and it's sifted all at the bottom I let it sit for long enough so it's pretty much separated already we're going to use a cheesecloth funnel into a mason jar to collect I already i poured as you can see one batch this is the CBD Keef from our CBD trim so dry sift Keef if you're wondering so it's good [ __ ] I'm gonna make pauses and breaks because kind of doing this at a slow pace so I've switched cheese cloths I cut I bought one bag of cheesecloth when I cut it in half and I used it for the CBD Keef and I'm going to use it for the regular people I only got one hand so I'm kind of just doing this very slowly and very carefully I'm going to be pouring it into I can already see this one up there I've got the griddle set at 250 and I'm gonna probably lower it down to 200 once it actually gets up to 250 just to kind of accelerate the process of tad bit now you will put a lid on but I'm gonna make sure that you have to be watching this the whole time you want to be very careful because it's very quick from full of alcohol to pretty much wasting away in evaporating on you so you got to be quick and careful at the same time so here we go with the point of this and I'm kind of just not giving a [ __ ] because it's pretty clear already because it's already sifted via just sitting oh [ __ ] I'm pulling into the wrong [ __ ] container because I'm stupid alright well since it really doesn't matter cuz I can just pour it back through I'm just kind of stupid as all its okay guys probably too high to be all right so I've muddled most of the process away and I am back with both of them here is the regular and here is the CBD oil now we know it looks quite green but I'll show you I actually did a batch yesterday and have already put it into a syringe and it came out the way it should the syringe kind of got a little messy because it got a little messy and I also put it into some bait cartridges so as you can see it is a little runny like just barely the can it's the consistency it should be it's very viscous I've already used it in a pen I've made a few of them and I put one on a pen and it is quite nice I've never actually vaped Rick Simpson oil until yesterday but or actually not to lie but I have done it before in the past and it was really good and I got it and it actually worked using this method that I'm doing right here which was isopropyl alcohol and Keith I let it I put them into mason jars and I shook him up for a couple of minutes and I let it sit for overnight and then I woke up and I did it again and shook it up and let it mix and then I let it sit and subtle and then I put it through the cheesecloth and here we are on the griddle at 250 I'm wait until I start to see like bubbles and stuff to tell me that it's actually boiling away before I take off the lens and then I will turn on the vent fan and open the window because it is evaporating alcohol and I don't know enough chemistry to tell you that that's good to inhale so alright just a mid-shift update I've got my cooking thermometer here and I'm gonna check the temperature both these the cooking griddle still at 250 this is let's alcohol starts to boil it about 174 to 177 or something like that Fahrenheit I don't know what that is Celsius I can tell you just cuz we're pretty close anyway switch this over to Celsius and about 60 degrees Celsius it would look like oh wait anyway so that's starting to boil but once I took the lid off it started to cool down so probably just put that back on there for a few more minutes let's check this one there's a lot more in here so it's probably not gonna read as hot where am i sorry it's getting there about another 17 degrees it would be boiling away that's the main video update so I got the vent fan going I got a window open these are Boylan so I will come back when they are pretty much done and being put into syringes all right we're just now getting to the little consistency that we want to see this is just another quick update real quick that's doing that and we'll be back when this is in a syringe well after all that we ended up with four grams of oil and I put it in the freezers to make it a little easier to handle one more thing before I wrap up the video here I know there's been a lot going on and I've had a lot of pauses and breaks but uh I just a little little thing I figured out if I make the if I put on a lid that's too big for the pot the water will hit the top and just drop off and evaporate out like this actually I'd imagine that's the alcohol evaporating because there's not much water in there but um yeah so it's a good way to keep it like ventilated but keep the heat inside to for the most part just like I found you still want to watch it make sure you can always just do that get rid of more of it but you want to keep an eye on it the whole time that's basically the idea whatever method you can do to get there works for you then do that [Music]", "GqBNvb9zVqk": "okay wanting to get some quick video of the MU physician referral card because people have been asking about it it is 25% off your first visit 75 off 150 for your second and a BOGO on your third which would be really good to use for rosin there is all the terms and conditions so you can see it hi and welcome back to my channel today's video we're going to be comparing grow healthy czar s o true leaves RS o and moves RS o but first before we start I want to let you guys know I'm on a tolerance break and I'm doing really bad right now no RSO no concentrates no nothing I'd like to do it for at least a week maybe two but I don't think I'm gonna get through one week because the pain is really bad the muscle spasms are keeping me up all night and of course I'm shaky so I may only be able to get through a whole week I wanted to get this video out because I know people were waiting on it and I had a little tiny bit left this RSO but when it before I started my tea break so let's get started here's a quick look at moves RSO please forgive my shakiness there we go hope you can see that very dark very nice RSO I do like it a lot moves RSO is very good I think it's comparable with true leaves RSO I really didn't see much difference between the two this is true leaves RSO let's get a quick close-up of that it's also dark and very nice I put my labels right on the syringe and tape it on it's a lot easier for me that way this is extracted from nine pound hammer and it's 77% extracted from and it looks like it's 73% now let's take a look at grow healthy czar heh so let's see first we'll do the THC looks like it's 72 percent THC and this one is extracted from rookie girl let's get a close-up of what I have left in the syringe I hope you can see that this is more amber color it's not as dark I was told they use a different extraction method to make theirs and that's probably why it didn't work well for me I'll get to that in a second okay on to the evaluation which do I like better I like the move and I like the true leave RSO both of them work well for me I didn't really see a difference between these two that was me though I really didn't see much of the difference in effects they were both really really good they both helped my pain muscle spasm shakiness and all that so it might be different for somebody else this might work better or this might work better but as far as I'm concerned these two work the best for me as far as the grow healthy RSO it did not work as well for me and I don't know why maybe it was the co2 process that they use when I got it I was a little concerned because it wasn't as dark as moves and true leaves I was afraid it didn't have as much full spectrum in it and I'm not sure if it's lacking on full spectrum compared to these two or what but it just did not work well for me I tried to give it a fair shot that's why this video took so long I tried tried it by itself over and over again for like a few days and it just didn't work I finally had to end up mixing it half and half fifty-fifty with one of these just to be able to take it it is potent and it might work for other people it's just not working for me I think that I need the process that are made with these to help me better okay let's go over prices real quick true leaves is the cheapest they want 50 grow healthy is the next most expensive they want 55 and then move is 65 so that now you know the prices so you can go out and you can decide for yourself which one you like the best you should probably try them all that's what I had to do sometimes you win sometimes you lose with this game we all know that for me these two were just the best ones for me this is probably okay for some people but just because it didn't work for me doesn't mean it's not gonna work for you I'll probably avoid their RSO and grow healthy I just keep getting their flour I'm real hoping that other dispensaries will start carrying some RS oh we really really need that here in Florida we need more choices of Rs oh okay I think that's pretty much it if you have any questions let me know in the comments and if I didn't cover anything please let me know keep it real and be safe", "LRVRjYYWyP8": "I'm Daniel B Hill I'm from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment I manage the marijuana health monitoring and research program there so our primary focus is on reviewing the scientific literature on health effects of marijuana which currently doesn't include potential therapeutic benefits we you know our focus is on public health and that's sort of out of our purview but I I do have a lot of awareness of what's out there and I'm gonna share some overviews with you today we also monitor the marijuana use statistics in Colorado and healthcare encounters with mention of marijuana and then we have currently 16 research grants that we've been able to provide and we administer those and I'll tell you a little bit about those today as well so actually kind of want to survey the room quickly how many people from Colorado okay cool east west okay cool no no sorry Eastern eastern parts of the United States western parts mid-middle okay great thank you well for those of you out from out of state welcome you got our snow yeah and any physicians in the room no okay so patients family caregivers primarily okay you guys mind throwing out just a few things that you hope to find out today anyone or you just don't quite know I'm sure you'll have plenty of questions come up as we go so here yes yep okay right absolutely okay thank you yes absolutely yeah and you sir okay right right okay great and as I think there are some stuff some things that aren't in my slides that I'll try to make sure to cover but absolutely throw out questions even as we go that's fine I'd rather answer your questions than have you try to remember them all the way to the end so rough outline cannabinoids in the human body medical and retail cannabis legalization tell you a little bit about the CDP ehe is overall purview related to marijuana kind of the state of marijuana use these days then some research on medical benefits and potential health risks so anyone heard of the endocannabinoids system there have been two primary receptors located or identified I should say in the human body the cb1 receptor is located mostly in the brain and the nervous system and some of the effects of cb1 receptor activation are reducing stress the stress response and anxiety increasing appetite reducing arousal and helping sleep and then a number of other effects the cb2 receptors are located primarily in the immune system and one of the most relevant effects there is reducing cytokine production which is both pro-inflammatory and is part of the pain process so they help to modulate pain and they are kind of less clear than cb1 so the transmitters don't worry this is not going to be a super technical presentation the the transmitters actually come from the the postsynaptic cell so there's a cell that sends a message to the next cell these little triangles and the cannabinoids actually regulate back on the first cell and primarily regulate back to reduce the excitability to reduce the amount of signal that it's giving so in general they kind of have a calming effect on the the transmission of nerve impulses so two primary cannabinoids endogenous just means natural to the human body they're inand amide which primarily activates the cb1 receptors and then to AG activates both types of receptors you know it's it's interesting that these are a very local sort of a function they're not a hormone that gets released throughout the entire body they they just excuse me they just have this very local effect so calling it a system may not be exactly accurate maybe more a series of local feedback mechanisms and then when you use cannabis you're you know putting this transmitter that emulates some of these actions you know in the entire body and so that's going to be different than what it looks like naturally this is a picture of the cannabis plant with I forget what type of special lens but it shows all these little crystals all over the leaves and especially on the flowers those crystals are the trichomes that contain the cannabinoids the two main cannabinoids that you'll hear about or THC or tetrahydrocannabinol and CBD cannabidiol there are many others but these are the primary ones that are discussed and that we understand some of effects about they do not actually exclusively at one receptor or the other so you know we can't make a specific link between the cb1 and cb2 or the natural cannabinoids you know these aren't exact mimics of those they sort of have overall effects that endocannabinoids system so I'll just quickly kind of tell you Colorado story in 2000 we legalized the medical use of cannabis there were less than 2000 card holders for the first seven years in Colorado they have to renew their medical marijuana card annually and that changed when the federal government put out the Ogden memorandum in 2009 which basically said the federal government was going to be more hands-off and and it sort of gave a green light to being able to openly sell marijuana products so in Colorado that meant that dispensaries opened and in response to that we increased to over a hundred thousand card holders in 2010 this is just a graph of that increase it has remained pretty steady around 110,000 since that time and then in October of 2012 our amendment 64 legalized retail marijuana I think a lot of voters had this sort of an image in mind that okay we're gonna you know let people legally grow some marijuana maybe you know share it with some friends and it is a billion-dollar industry so the shops opened in on January 1st 2014 and there has been a steady increase in sales now I think that the majority of this has been just a transfer from an illegal market to the legal market because we haven't seen increases in use among adults or adolescents and it doesn't appear that there's an increase in amount of use among users either just a few very quick points on all the statistics things I have loads of graphs and everything that I'm not going to burden you with today but so about 14% of all adults in Colorado our current users meaning sometime in the past 30 days one in eight 18 to 25 year olds use daily or near daily many adults use three or more times per day and the top reasons for use are sleep anxiety and to feel good high school juniors and seniors about one in four are current users and then smoking remains the most common method of use by far I threw one slide in here on daily or near daily marijuana use by age group so I mentioned about 1 in 8 of 18 to 25 year olds use daily or near daily those numbers decrease as in in older age groups but we have seen an increase in the 65 plus daily or near daily marijuana use from less than a percent to between one and two percent the others oh I'm sorry these are the 2014 2015 and 2016 so in the other age groups the that use has been pretty steady no not on this survey so that's a that's a good question 2014 was the first year that this survey asked adults about marijuana use which is unfortunate it would have been great to have earlier information we do have a smaller survey that's done nationally it's it's more for a national picture so it's not quite as reliable for state numbers but there excuse me that has really sort of supported these numbers in terms of not seeing an increase in particular since legalization so this is a quick map this is from 2017 so I know there's been a little bit of shift since then but the the green states are states with legal retail cannabis Colorado Washington Oregon Alaska California or California Nevada Massachusetts in Maine the yellow states have full medical legalized meaning CBD or THC product containing products Arizona New Mexico Montana North Dakota Minnesota Illinois Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania New York New Hampshire Vermont Connecticut New Jersey Delaware Maryland Arkansas and Florida and then there are another group of states mostly in the south but including Utah Wyoming Iowa and Missouri with CBD only and still a few states where it is not there where nothing is legal anyone who can't see their state here and is curious I'm sure you know you you're from the state and there remains a lot of controversy still about the the true effects of marijuana from it's saving people's lives too it's bad for you and and some say it can even kill you so any questions on any of that stuff so far okay so other than the hair I think this is a decent likeness here I mentioned I'm from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment I'm a preventive medicine physician and I actually started at the Health Department during my residency working on reviewing literature on marijuana health effects and ended up later managing the the program that I managed so my programs focus is this number two health monitoring and research but the department also houses the medical Merrill on a registry we have a large marijuana education and youth prevention program we are laboratory just got funded last year for being the reference lab for marijuana in Colorado that was a real big challenge for a number of years because there was not a reference lab and then various consultations with edible safety waste disposal other departments that end up having some involvement related to to marijuana or cannabis I say marijuana a lot because the legislation says marijuana so that tends to be the language that we use in our publications and things some people prefer cannabis is really equivalent same thing some people prefer yes yeah so the differences are that there is a fee for the medical marijuana card it's an annual fee it's only twenty dollars but you have to submit an application and get a card and then the the dispensaries remain separate there are some locations where they have both but they are in you know separated rooms and the one of the biggest differences is that the taxes are much lower on the medical side and one other small difference is that on edible products on the retail side there is a serving size limit of 10 milligrams of THC and a packaged limit of 100 milligrams there are no such limits on the medical side because many medical patients use much larger amounts there they are pretty much exactly the same you know clearly there will be some products for example that have higher amounts of THC that that you know might have a different name and wouldn't be available on the retail side but for the most part you can get the exact same products in both systems yes that's a that's a common perception and it isn't really in fact the the true CBD only products are not in the medical marijuana system because they don't count as marijuana yeah so if it's less than 0.3 percent THC then it can be sold outside of the system you can even get it on the Internet so and and on both sides you can get a variety of mixes of THC and CBD so today I'm just going to tell you a little bit about the registry and you know some of the information from my program as far as excuse me I was sick a couple weeks ago still have a bit of a cough so the the registry of course was established in 2000 when medical marijuana was legalized they provide the the cards and these first nine conditions were sorry the first eight conditions were on that initial legislation and then the final PTSD was added just last year by the legislature these conditions were glaucoma cancer hiv/aids severe pain cachexia severe nausea seizures and persistent muscle spasms oh oh that's right yeah yeah caregiver for Donnell Dec yep so the vast majority of our patients are over 21 and in the sort of 21 to 60 age range I mean that's kind of represents the population there are 17,000 medical card holders 61 and over for all ages except 10 and younger severe pain is the by far the most common reason given for having a medical marijuana card oh and and just quickly this for ages 18 to 20 you know they those individuals can't buy on the retail side it's it's only 21 and over but they can get a medical marijuana card with a single recommendation from a physician for 17 and younger they need two physicians to recommend a card and their parents authorization so as I mentioned severe pain is by far the most common reason for getting medical marijuana cards some patients have multiple reasons so this adds up to more than 100% but 93 percent say that they or put severe pain on their applications 30% muscle spasms 13% severe nausea and then much smaller numbers for PTSD cancer seizures glaucoma and cachexia which is muscle wasting related to disease so my program specifically as I mentioned we review the research literature on health effects of marijuana we monitor the data and then we administer some research grants I'll tell you a little bit more about the first and the third for for the literature reviews and the data we have this very large report that is also available online you can go to this website and by chapter look at different things either the day of the chapters or the literature reviews by topic and I'll share this presentation so that hopefully you know it can get sent to you so you don't have to write all these things down but if you want to check it out right away actually the easiest thing I think is just to use Google to look for monitoring marijuana Colorado so I guess the first thing that it's going to come up sometimes so I'll just address it right away those conditions on the initial amendment were not necessarily based on scientific evidence they were essentially selected by voters and only some of them have scientific evidence so glaucoma there is not much evidence for what is suggested is that it can reduce pressure in the eye so that could potentially be a benefit okay so this is more oh there we go one of the pictures this is more just sort of for general interest I won't spend a lot of time on it but there are four major methods of use smoking as I said remains the most common these are a lot of different terms that are related to that this is the marijuana flower that top part that has the highest concentration of cannabinoids and this is called kief it's if somebody actually kind of strips off all those cannabinoids it's more concentrated but it's just sort of physically stripped off concentration there are other methods that are able to get much greater concentrations so smoking pipes people can also use a bong these are various terms for different types of cannabis cigarettes vaporizing is a device that heats the usually an oil a concert no no concentrated oil that not to the point of combustion but but just below so that it creates a vapor and can be inhaled and they come in all different shapes and sizes excuse me there are a wide variety of edibles available currently in Colorado there there are more limitations than there were initially and there used to be all sorts of things the you know Pete rings and barbecue sauce and all types of things there it's a little bit more limited these days but you can get sodas chocolate bars cookies choose brownies all sorts of things and again on the retail side 10 milligram serving size limit of THC oh the edibles the cannabinoid content is primarily from an oil or a butter that's made via concentration process yes yes oh yeah yes so all products from flower to ed Abul have to be tested by a certified lab and the labs have to be authorized and and you know they get checks to confirm that they're testing accurately by the that reference lab I mentioned so yeah all products have to be tested a certain amount of every batch and that can change depending on how how well you've passed in the past you can get your testing frequency reduced somewhat etc but but all products are tested for THC content THC and CBD content and potential biological contaminants residual solvents for those that use to concentrate and we're working on pesticides it's a very challenging issue because you have to know exactly which to test for it's difficult for labs to qualify for that so yeah and then dabbing so dabbing is a somewhat newer form of use it is a way of getting a very large dose of cannabinoids quickly the concentration prot process can give you a variety of different consistencies sort of from oil to something that is kind of like a peanut brittle consistency this is more of a waxy consistency but they all have in common that they have a high concentration of usually of THC because THC is a psychoactive cannabinoid that gets people high and typically people are looking for you know getting the high that they want from this method although it could be used for CBD theoretically so there's this nail that is superheated usually using like a creme brulee torch and then they take one of these little dabbers and put a small amount of the concentrate on it and it rapidly vaporizes and they inhale it through the what looks a lot like a bong oh and then this is what they call earwax this is funny this is shatter so kind of relates to what they their consistency is excuse me I showed you this picture before this is a modern growing room carefully controlled lighting water co2 concentration all of these plants are female they have a very small number of plants that they actually allow to flower and that's only done for sort of crossbreeding trying to develop new strains for the most part they maintain a sort of a selection of mother plants that they then clip off sort of seedlings I guess to to plant and grow and an all female that they then put in these growing rooms to produce the flower when they're harvested they are dried really just hung up in in a curing room to dry and then trimmed the you know the bud flowers are the most valuable portion and then the leaves closest to that and then the typically the other leaves further away are what is used for making concentrate because they still have cabott cannabinoids in them and the process can constrict them out but they're not as desirable for smoking directly this is an example of a co2 extractor it's more expensive kind of a little more high-tech there's very but there's much simpler processes using butane I don't know if any of you have heard of butane hash oil extraction and people blowing their houses up by trying to do it but it it used to be kind of the most common method is using butane this is just one example of a use this is filling cartridges for vape pens with oil concentrated oil so in Colorado the average THC content in marijuana flower is 17 percent and for concentrates the average was 62 percent and both of these are probably still climbing I won't go into a lot of detail here because I'm sure there are some other things that you're hoping I get to and I will is this of interest I mean a little bit okay well so I will move a little more quickly through it then this is the active THC these are metabolites that the hydroxy THC is still psychoactive and lasts up to two hours to two even days this can last for weeks in the system so this is what is typically found in urine and therefore a person can test positive in urine for many days or even weeks after use CBD is very similar structure to THC but does have different actions so for medical cannabis research as mentioned there are a wide or an extensive list of conditions that there's kind of a variety of statements out there about marijuana having benefit in the the lists that have good scientific evidence is shorter so the main resource that I want to tell you about is a report done by the National Academies of science last year the health effects of cannabis and cannabinoids and it addressed both medical efficacy and potential health risks so they found that there is conclusive or substantial evidence that cannabis or cannabinoids are effective for the treatment of pain in adults reducing chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting and improving patient reported multiple sclerosis muscle spasticity there's moderate evidence that cannabis or cannabinoids are effective for improving short-term sleep outcomes with for a variety of sleep disturbance reasons and then limited evidence for increasing appetite and decreasing weight loss the studies that are available specifically look at HIV but this should be a general benefit that improving clinician measured multiple sclerosis spasticity improving symptoms of Tourette's anxiety symptoms and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder yes the PS the pts really heavy-duty drugs [Music] the pharmaceuticals that they have to take right right yeah a lot of people say that for you know various conditions that you know they use marijuana and they use less of something else so it's I mean it's a it's a tough sort of a balance to to approach that space where there is a lot of anecdotal reports of various benefits both in in symptoms and conditions as well as things like not needing other medications or feeling like it's there are less side effects than other medications things like that so there are a lot of people who say that they've had these benefits and then you know kind of on the on the further extreme of looking for solid scientific evidence from from trials that have comparison groups etc which is much more lacking so so we're in that spectrum you choose to you know rely on and make your decision you know is going to vary for each individual and and you know maybe their physician if they're working together on that yes oh that's a good question yes excuse me so limited evidence means at least observational studies with a comparison group where there was evidence of some benefit for those using the no well yeah not on not on sort of plant derived marijuana so first point I think I'll make is that yes research is difficult in the United States but there's research in a lot of other countries occurring in particular Israel is has been very big in in cannabis research over the years and you know all of you think these things don't rely only on US research so they look at any available research excuse me there are sort of derived products like Drebin all for example that are either pure THC or pure CBD or one that's a 50/50 mix that it is much easier for those to have trials you know kind of through the the standard FDA process so that is has been one source of some research for different conditions and then the as far as actual plant based research there is one federally authorized source of marijuana for research it's grown it at a lab or at a facility in Mississippi and any researchers who you know get federal approval have to have to use that marijuana that's received a lot of criticism because it doesn't represent the marijuana that's currently available it's much lower concentration you know it may be I don't know it's had a lot of criticism so so there's certainly limitation there observational studies are a reasonable source of information however and you know some of these statements are based on observational studies where you're taking people who on their own have decided to use marijuana or have not and and then you're looking at you know sort of whatever outcome you're interested in so there is a reasonable body of research to look at but it could certainly be much better and we hope that it is you know is improving yeah yeah and then of course there are also pre clinical trials you know in animals or in in vitro models so speaking of which excuse me so their report found insufficient evidence to support or refute the conclusion that cannabinoids are an effective treatment for cancers know that the as described with limited this is based on our there observational studies in people in humans for effects on these and for cancer there are not but their report says however the signal from preclinical literature suggests that clinical research with canal needs to be conducted and they specifically referenced one large review it was focused on gliomas specifically which is a type of nerve cell tumor but they found multiple animal studies showing reduction in tumor size anti-angiogenic effects which is blocking the development of new blood cells to feed the tumor and then anti metastatic effects blocking this bread mm-hmm right right yep yep yep well so with any type of treatment you know getting getting it to the location that you want is an important issue cancers generally have good blood flow and therefore any systemic medicine or exposure would get there pretty well so if cannabis is effective for cancer than any type of systemic intake should get it where it needs to be is that next question right anything so smoking eating it all gets into the bloodstream I think we're approaching time so let me jump ahead to just very quickly some of the potential health risks so smoking in general I mean you kind of expressed what how I think about smoking cancer yes exactly so and and I I think that other methods are probably better than smoking so same cancer-causing chemicals as in tobacco smoke they're associated with pre malignant lesions there is mixed evidence in terms of lung cancer with long term cannabis smoking pneumothorax and then limited evidence that after one month frequent cannabis users who switched to vaporizing had fewer respiratory symptoms and improved pulmonary function there's been some limited evidence of increased risk of myocardial infarction or in younger people stroke with cannabis use cannabis does have cardiovascular effects it increases heart rate and it can more often it reduces blood pressure sometimes it can increase blood pressure but it's very likely that that if these effects are real and we start getting more evidence on them that they would be related to individuals who have other risk factors for heart attack or stroke and then you know this exposure can perhaps tip that over the edge driving not surprising if you drive under the influence increased impairment and and crash risk and using cannabis and alcohol together increases that risk more yeah well there is some of both so there are growers who very specifically aim to grow without using any type of pesticide you know I think the the bigger sort of industrial types of locations they have so much at stake that they do use pesticides now excuse me for things like the concentrates those pesticides should for the most part be removed through the process but and and that's why we want to test yes there have been some challenges but all states are working on improving pesticide testing one quick thing in inhaled marijuana Peaks in the bloodstream and its effects are much more quickly felt than ingested so it can take up to 4 hours for to feel the full effects of ingesting marijuana so we caution people to sort of start low go slow you know try small doses see how it affects you before you figure out what amounts are right for you there is some evidence of cannabis drug interactions this is a list of the medications that we found some evidence for it's likely that there are potential interactions beyond this list there hasn't been a lot of research done on it it's an important area of course and I would suggest I think you know talking with a doctor or perhaps trying to research online any particular drugs that that if a person is using cannabis other drugs to see if there's any known interactions", "Cbh5mcGtziE": "marijuana and cancer treatment in our pets should you be using it not using it what are the risks does it really work get the facts in this video hello guys welcome back to my channel for those of you who are new welcome even if you had to do so I'd love for you to click up there to subscribe click down there to sign up for notifications and lastly when you click the link further in the box below I continue my free books of my free videos on how to heal your pets at home with my top natural remedies [Music] currently there's a huge interest in using medical marijuana in particular for cancer in our dogs and cats in part this comes with some of the types of cancers that are very difficult to treat many of the cancers our animals get you know such as lymphosarcoma and our dogs are not cured of by chemotherapy we're sort of left with you know what are some of the alternative options likely you've heard of all these potential benefits and likely you have a pile of questions and rightly so so you're sort of left with like do I use it do I not use it is it safe to use in my dogs and cats but as you go to harm them or can it really benefit them I'm hoping just to set the record straight ease your mind and maybe give you a little bit of guidance so if a little Tooley here were to have cancer there's a few alternative things I would consider using and at the very sort of a top of the list would be MIT medical marijuana [Music] [Music] medical marijuana has used for thousands of years for array of different human and animal health problems according to the National Cancer Institute the Canlis plan may have anti-cancer effects by one induction of cell death to inhibiting cell growth 3 preventing cancer or tumor angiogenesis that's new blood vessel growth and 3 preventing or inhibiting tumor metastasis where it's spreading to distant places throughout the body one interesting fact that was reported on is that the cannabinoids the components of the cannabis plant appear to be protective of normal cells where while at the same time damaging and you know causing cells f2 the cancerous cells in this specific study the kanima noise induced apoptosis or cell death and these glioma cells that were cancerous but and this was a study done in rats but at the same time completely unharmed the normal glioma cells and these are part of the nervous system cells another two-year study where they actually used THC to mice and rats over this extended two-year period of time showed a specific and dose related preventive effect for a type of liver cancer along with a decrease and some of the precancerous things or even benign cancers such as adenoma as polyps which might show on different parts of the organs throughout the body there are documented beneficial effects for certain types of lung cancer in people for breast cancer also for colon cancer there are also documented anti-inflammatory benefits and in the report they're going to talk about certain types of cancers such as colon cancer which you know are linked to chronic inflammation going on in the colon so if you could decrease that inflammation decrease the likelihood of that cancer starting in the first place [Music] [Music] they even report how CBD might enhance the uptake of cytotoxic drugs so they're talking about using chemotherapy obviously these studies or reference people and how you know some of the can't the cytotoxic drug was in the cancerous cells there was an increasing amount of that cytotoxic or chemotherapy drug making it more effective so they're talking about even using it in combination we're not just using one of the other using both of them as well [Music] so in general from all my research I'm seeing that it appears that the part of the Canada's plant that is gonna be most beneficial would be that THC secondly the CBD and then some of the other ingredients within the that plant itself so ideally if you're gonna be treating your dog or cat you're gonna be using a whole plant extract so this is a real good example of one that I can would consider using if it was my own dog and he's and little tools got cancer and it's 4 to 1 so it's 75% CBD 25 percent THC so in general we're looking at the cancers we want to have you know at least a portion minimum 10 percent of that preferably the solution have THC seems to be the tinctures of the ones that seem to be most effective the ones that seemed to be most beneficial and easiest to give it to our dogs and cats so if I were to dose little Tula here this thing is 300 milligrams of CBD and at 75 milligrams of THC I would be using the measured dose of 1 1 milligram of CBD for 10 pounds of body weight so she would get 2 milligrams of CBD so it means one male and I'll show you it one meal which is wonderful dropper full you can see the dropper full there so that's one meal that contains 10 milligrams of CBD we're looking at a CBD dose of 1 milligram for 10 pounds of body weight daily 2 other ways 20 20 pounds you'll be getting 2 milligrams so that would take you to so there would be point 1 mil to point 2 mils total a day that beer dose right there [Music] [Music] well it'd help your dog or your cat if he or she has cancer I don't know it really depends on the type of cancer if this is a cancer that may or may not be responsive to CBD THC the other cama noids along with you know the stage of the cancer how fast it's spread etc etcetera there's lots of different variables but is there is there the potential for it to help yes there is secondly is it fairly safe you bat or a very few interaction with other drugs you bet - the one big point I need to add in is once I really encourage it there should be some THC in it minimum ten percent - you want to start at a relatively low dose what I'm talking about - one milligram based on the CBD content one milligram of CBD for 10 pounds of body weight not given in total daily you're not gonna see an instant result I would expect it to take about two weeks and be doing in that measured dose but within that period of time there's gonna be a positive benefit that's something you would see you may see that your dog or cat has a bit more energy you may see that their appetite is increased thank you guys so much for watching this edition of energy secrets I'll put a link to some of those studies the references paper and the box below secondly if

years and we understand a lot about the biology cannabidiol is the non psychoactive ingredient in marijuana and since it is non psychoactive one feels the potential harm is going to be much less and since some of these children had truly devastating epilepsies in which the seizures and the high doses of many drugs that doctors like myself were prescribing because really tremendous problems for these children [Music] the first thing I tell people is you are a unique individual your chemistry is in there is unique to you you could have the same exact diagnosis of the last guy that walked in here but you may respond differently to a different strain of cannabis a different dose of cannabis a different method of using it I don't know the answer and I don't think anybody else knows the answers there's this this crazy dissociation between what's happening at a federal level of incredible restriction on safe things and a state level where it's a little bit of the Wild West and states are allowing parents to play doctor and play chemist when they really don't have that experience every two and a half hours okay there is no one that will tell me that a parent this there's as much time with our child if we do did not know what's best for them Mellie was born March 6 2012 week later we started noticing some spasms about four months old we realized that something was wrong to the hospital indeterminate they were seizures she was having roughly I don't know somewhere probably in the vicinity of 700 today they diagnosed her with infantile spasms with hips arrhythmia I'm almost immediately and put her on three different medications as well as started the ketogenic diet she did not progress at all she was not growing she was not gaining weight the doctors had given us a point one percent chance that she would really do anything they kind of feel like that would they had done everything they could do there wasn't a diagnosis therefore there was no prognosis we just felt like our hands what kind of time you don't want to believe what they're telling you and so you try and find alternative solutions and thankfully we found one we ended up you know leaving you know a quarter of our possessions behind selling our business and we made the journey to Colorado our neurologist told us that she can't prescribe it she knows nothing about it it hasn't been studied but that she recommend we do what we need to in order to help Billy you don't that stuff cleaned out yeah we started Charlotte's Web right around her birthday and within the first 15 minutes of her first dose she was wide awake and looking around and I mean I was just crying I couldn't believe it yeah probably within the first 90 days we noticed about a 75 to 90% reduction in seizures I mean we've had extended periods of time that we've had no seizure activity and when I say extended periods of time nine days 14 days we've had times where we backed off and not give her doses of CBD for upwards of a week maybe a little more and then we have times where we will have to increase their CBD it's not as complicated now that once was when I first got here was a little scary it was a little difficult trying to figure it all out it really has been a lot of trial and error it was all parental experience asking other parents you know hey when you see this seizure what do you do it gets frustrating and then you find the sweet spot and you think yes we did it anything really consider off and sort of make it throw off the whole balance it's kind of a two step forward one step back we have some seizure activity that are a bit more violent that are more painful I think the most difficult part is there's nothing you can do about it and basically just have to wait it out there are days that I don't know that I feel like it's hard for me you know and then there are days that I feel very elated and very joyful that we have her we've gone from a place where we didn't think we would have our daughter with us very long and trying to make every minute count so now we feel like we have prolonged her life that there is an opportunity for her to grow and maybe Walt Falk do some of these things that you never thought were imaginable you know I don't know what the future holds for us you know it is a very real possibility that mili could have a seizure and never come out of it for Millie's future I see a lot of beating the odds I see a lot of improvement I think that she's I think she's really gonna make the history books Colorado has given us an opportunity to be parents make decisions that we feel are best for our children I don't know exactly why people are so afraid of this but I think it is Tom now that we need to put that behind us and move on [Music] you", "ROtHQWlBKyQ":

syringes that we carry these syringes are a popular packaging option for high quality material but they can be difficult to fill so today I'm going to show you two methods that will save you hours of work especially if you have to fill hundreds or thousands of these things let's dive in the first method we are going to cover is the syringe coupler method this tiny white thing here is a syringe coupler we have them available for purchase and they allow you to connect a big syringe to a small syringe which is really cool because that is going to allow you to fill these at a much faster rate you're just going to take your larger syringe and make sure it's filled with your material then put the coupler on it by twisting it on to the luer lock then take the cap off your smaller syringe after it's fully assembled attach it to the coupler and begin your filth by gently pushing material from the bigger syringe into the smaller syringe after the fill is complete remove the small syringe from the coupler place the cap on it and there you have it a filled 1 ml syringe the second method will cover preferred method of filling because it does not require as many assembly steps which saves a lot of time there's a special tool that I'll be using to perform this fill and you can probably find it at your local sporting goods store or Walmart it's ten pound fishing line I have a roll of it right here first we're gonna cut about a four-inch section of the fishing line or whatever you can comfortably hold in your hand some of our clients like to take the fishing line and tape it to a chopstick or popsicle stick to make it easier to grasp but the basic technique remains the same you will still need a larger syringe filled with your material such as this 10 ml syringe I have here or you can even make this work with a filling machine you're going to start by taking the syringe you want to fill with a cap on and no plunger then place it in a position where it can be held upright luckily this is exactly how they come packaged if you buy from us then holding the larger syringe above the smaller syringe gently begin to fill the syringe from the top dead center taking care not to get any material on the sidewall of the syringe above the fill line this is actually really important after filling you're gonna place your fishing line into the syringe like this allowing it to hover right above the liquid then slowly push the plunger down and tell it meets the liquid inside then pull the vent cord out as you can see if this technique is used correctly it allows you to hand fill these syringes at light speed compared to other methods and there you have it a filled 1 ml glass syringe thanks for watching this video please hit us up with any questions in the comment section hit

"INVzvJHc2PA": "hello everybody and welcome back to the channel in today's video we are going to be making cbd oil with a crock pot but before we get into today's video folks if you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please consider subscribing and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you so much i really do appreciate all the support and if you all wouldn't mind please give this video a big thumbs up okay folks so you may or may not know but our farm is solely dependent on our sale of hemp flour and that's what we're going to be using today our hemp flour now if you guys are interested in cbd hemp flour to make your own cbd oil go ahead and check out the link in the description below also go ahead and check out this link up top okay so first and foremost we're going to need cbd flour to make cbd oil you will find an array of options on our website if you're purchasing from us you'll see large flour or regular flour you'll see small flowers you'll see trim and some other odds and ends on there as well but today we're going to be using regular sized hemp flour the variety that we're going to be using is biox which is our most popular flower which is my personal favorite but there's also cherry wine on there i'll sweeten it a bunch of others that are all great as well it really depends on what you're looking for um but today we're going to be using biox and that's probably our most potent flower as well and that really depends on your potency level also and the same thing goes with trim versus small flowers there's a whole bunch of different potencies if you guys have questions go ahead and email me i'll be absolutely happy to answer any and all questions that you guys have about the hemp flour okay so we're going to need some stuff to make cbd oil with a crock pot unlike using an expensive machine like the magical butter machine you're going to need some other kitchen gadgets in order to make cbd oil correctly at home with a crock pot and so first and foremost we need a carrier oil now this is obviously you use this for a magical butter machine or any other machine we're going to use mct oil today other popular carrier oils are hemp oil and olive oil i really don't like olive oil that's just my personal preference i do love mctl it's the best carrier oil of all of them but if you're looking for a little added flavor hemp oil if you can find it is really good as well but today we're going to be using mct oil and the reason why coconut oil and other oils aren't in this is well coconut oil will be solid at room temperature so that's not good for cbd oil and other ones don't have the necessary fats to be a superior carrier oil and you really need that absorption rate to be high especially for a crock pot okay obviously next you will need a crock pot um these are relatively inexpensive you can get them for like 15 online you don't need a large one uh your batches are going to be anywhere between one to two cups of oil and one to two ounces of flour so really you don't need a large crock pot a three to six quart crock pot is plenty um another thing you will need is something to decarb with now we're going to use our magical butter d card box i love it there's no point in using a pyrex dish if i have this but you can use a pyrex dish with a cover that works as well and this will be one of the first steps we do here as we make our cbd oil the next thing you definitely need is going to be a filter of some sort some people use a cheese cloth um i don't i've never used that i've always used the magical butter filters you can get this pack on their website or you can get any type of micron filter i believe it has to be 150 or more um that's just what we use uh you can go more or less probably depending on the amount of plant material that's going to go through or how many times you actually want to sift through it this package also comes with a silicone glove i really like using that too especially when we're squeezing out the oil but that's going to be later on in the video now this part isn't necessary um to use i'm going to show you how to get around this but a lot of people will use this to cut up or grind up their flower a nutribullet or a magic bullet of anything like this to cut up the flower pre-decarb but i'm going to teach you a trick today on how you can avoid that it takes a little time but there's a trick now if you buy your hem flower from us it's going to come in a package exactly like this this is a pre-packaged um one ounce pre-packaged from us and what we'll do is we're gonna throw this in the freezer for four to six hours and what that does is it makes the hemp fiber very brittle and once it's brittle you can scrunch it all up in the bag and boom you don't have to use a grinder to cut up a flower we've already done that process and here we go here is our scrunched up flower and a ziploc now you don't have to use the bag if you if you're not purchasing from us use a ziploc same exact method in there for four to six hours scrunch it up and we're good to go so we've already done this step i'm not going to time lapse it or anything like that you will need to cut it up one way or another whether it's the bullet or it's through uh freezing it so let's dive into making cb duo with your crock pot here at home and get into the next step okay folks let's get into making cbd oil with our crock pot here we have already measured out a cup of mct oil so we're going to get that in the crock pot now to get it warmed up this process doesn't take very long but this is going to be the first thing you're going to want to do is measure out your oil and get it into the crock pot we're going to put it on low and we're just going to let it sit all right we're going to move this off to the side here for a minute next thing we're going to do is we are going to use our magic butter d card box again you can use a pyrex dish as long as it has a cover or any other baking dish as long as it has a cover now what you're going to be doing is you're going to be de-carving so get your oven preheated to 250 degrees 250 all right so we're going to preheat our oven right now again 250 uh preheat and then once we put this stuff in there it's going to be going in for 30 minutes now again you're either going to this step you're going to be blending your hemp flour which i just don't like making a mess so that's really just not what i want to do but this is an option you can do that get that you take your um your shredded up flour whether you use the magic bullet or you use the freezer method like we did and you're just going to pour it in to your d carb box whether that's the pyrex or this particular box you're gonna make sure that it's nice and even you're gonna cover it and we're gonna throw it into the oven for about a half an hour once it's preheated to 250 degrees so that's what we're going to flash forward to next and then we'll start getting into making the cbd oil okay folks so let me move this out of the way here real quick all right so we have done we are done with the d-carb process again 250 degrees for 30 minutes and there is your nice fresh ground uh cbd hem flower so now we're ready to go um but before we dive into putting it into crop i want to make sure that this isn't the end-all be-all recipe so we used one cup of mct oil for one ounce of hemp flour you can use two cups you can use less flour you can use more flour it really depends on what you want but i'm going to stand by one cup per one ounce if you want to go less you know you can use 14 grams of flour per cup i really don't recommend anything less than that because i don't think you'll get a good experience with cbd i just don't think the potency will be there for you the other thing about the crock pot too it's not nearly as efficient as the magic butter machine so this is going to be a process it is going to be in the crock pot for four to eight hours really depends on when you're ready the longer it has to be in there to cook into the oil the more chance of a higher absorption rate so just remember that as well and again guys you can find all this stuff on our website or feel free to leave a comment or email me and you can find us on facebook and instagram as well if you need to get in touch with me through there okay so let's go ahead and get this going into the crock pot now remember we put this on low already the oil is already nice and warm we have our ounce of ground flour here and we're going to go ahead and dump it right into the crock pot okay so now that that's done we're just gonna move around the flower and we're going to let it cook down [Music] and that's really all we're doing now we're going to let this cook down absorb all into the oil we're gonna cover it again you can use more oil or or i wouldn't use anything less than a cup of oil but you can use more oil like two cups we're just doing a very small batch for the video but as you can see it's already starting to go right into the oil so now we're going to check it about every hour on low so we'll see in another hour and then we're going to repeat that for probably six hours for this particular batch so that is how we get started making our cbd hemp oil in a crock pot okay folks we have let this go for about eight hours i lost kind of track of time and we've been stirring about every hour and this is what it looks like right now very liquidy you know all broken down and that's what you want to look like again you got to go for the longer cook with the crock pot i know with the magic butter machine it's four hours but you're really safe with an eight hour on low cook um of course the setting is low for the crock pot so now what we're going to do is we're going to get our strainer again this is something you're going to have to purchase in order to make cbd oil and then we're going to get some gloves and we're going to slowly pour this into the strainer all right so here we go again it's a balancing act with the strainer just got to take your time get this out of the way here you're just going to let it all go into the strainer there kind of write it up a little bit now again we only did a cup of oil very small batch and what you can do now is get all the plant material in there much as you want because what you're going to do now is once it's in the strainer you can squeeze every last bit of oil out of the flour because the flour does absorb some of the oil okay now one of the things that you get with the magical butter kit uh when it comes to buying these strainers is they give you the silicone glove it's pretty important because it helps you squeeze out all the [Applause] oil all right that's about all you can have with that and then you can put it in your container whatever you desire whether it's a droplet bottle a mason jar but this is the finished product this is your cbd oil and you made it with a crock pot so that's really it for today's video guys if you have any questions feel free to comment in the video uh or you can reach us um via facebook or instagram or email if you guys are interested in the hemp flower that we use today go ahead and check out our website link in the description below but that is all i have for you guys today i hope you enjoyed the video hope you all stay happy healthy and i'll see you in another video", "8satw2Ca-3M": "all right I need you to explain water is Asian okay no I don't do it Twitter eyes a Shana is in theory removing the fats waxes and lipids from your your crude oil or your BHO and bringing it to a higher potency so in theory let's say you this is you know in theory numbers let's say you have one gram of pho it's that 50 percent THC the other 20 percent is probably fats waxes lipids it's then that seventy percent total and you have 30 percent of the solvents terpenes everything else the yeah winterization is removing your fats your waxes in your lipids so it's no longer present and then your oil and therefore you have 70 percent THC and the only remaining elements or your solvents in your terpenes everything so the idea of winterization would be to take your crude oil soak it in ethanol you want to use you want to use a hundred proof ethanol just kids or dissolve everything better except in a particle but once it's fully dissolved you want to breathe sub-zero just saw your fax that your wax and will coagulate together therefore you can then filter them out through a filter and then reduced it and retrieve your ethanol and then that encouraging everywhere as well yet to recommend so this would be like a crude oil with just you know BHO down to the last of it and it's full the colorful and full of fats and waxes and this would be after it winterized and then we distill down Wow so this is starting product and there's not a finish this beautiful here THC", "7jD9TvFuTJM": "when facing breast cancer it's a very frightening journey there are three different types of primary types of breast cancer you have ERP are positive you have her2 positive and you have triple negative each one of these are treated a little differently about 60% of all breast cancer cases or ERP are positive so there's wonderful treatments the success rates of allopathic medicine chemotherapy raishin are quite effective by using cannabis along with that we have found that people come through on the other side of their traditional treatments much more successfully much more quickly without missing some of their treatments because they're so debilitated from them that they have to extend their treatments etc I recommend that you start with a 1 to 2 ratio of THC to CBD so for example if you're taking 10 milligrams of THC you would take 20 of CBD you have to start low and increase slowly just like anything else there is no milligram per kilogram calculation that we can give you for cannabis it just doesn't work all the evidence we see in the research is it is not best dosed that way so unfortunately it does take a little bit more work on your part besides stepping on the scale and doing the math but by having the ratio to start with you know that you start and keep increasing the reason that we say to start with that ratio is because we know that there are something called the ID 1 gene and the ID 1 gene is what causes cancer cells to metastasize and spread throughout your body and it the CBD will aggressively intercept the translation or cancel out the translation of this gene that causes the cells to metastasize the THC is necessary because of the way that it activates this the cb1 and cb2 receptors to actually kill the cancer cells so on an average 40 year old female your dose might be somewhere between 75 milligrams of THC 50 to 100 milligrams of THC and your CBD might between 1 and 200 milligrams of CBD I know this sounds like an awful lot but when you're treating cancer that's often what it takes the older the patient we found that the lower the dose is with exceptions we've had children that are on very very high doses so don't be afraid of it because interestingly enough when you need these high doses your body will accept it in a way that it won't if you're just taking it as a healthy person so don't be afraid of the the numbers wait till you get your scans back and see what's working if you're only treating the side effects of the treatment for the breast cancer when they start working and you're not having the side effects you know you've you've reached your therapeutic dose if the one to two doesn't work you can always go to a one to one ratio I wouldn't go any further the other way though with a one two three or one to four if you're not having success with a one to two ratio the one that I would increase would be the THC not the CBD one of the things that's very important though is whole plant medicine whole plant THC and whole plant CBD medicines work better than the distillate or the isolates that are being put to that are being put out and marketed as those products they're mass-produced so you want to make sure that when you're picking your products that you pick those that are made from whole plant how do you know this you asked to see the lab results of the medicine asked how it was made asked how what was in it asked who do it and do your research you have to be more actively involved when you're selecting a product than you would if you're going to the pharmacy because as long as we don't have federal FDA approval we're not having licensed pharmacists we have bud tenders that are giving you the medicine the research that we've done on THC killing her to positive breast cancer cells and triple negative breast cancer cells are so exciting in fact in the case of her2 positive we have found in preclinical now this is only in petri dishes and in mice and not in humans but we have found from in a clinical setting that THC works as effectively is lapatinib which is a targeted first round drug used to treat many of these patients triple negative we have found exactly the same thing there is no targeted treatment for triple negative and it's often the most frightening words that a woman hears as her diagnosis that you have triple negative but there is hope with cannabis because we're finding in petri dishes in mice and in our patients that are still walking around that using THC and CBD together is very very effective in helping them to get to a therapeutic dose and have it be tolerable in such a way that they still have quality of life so give it a try see you're gonna have to get your dose I would also start out with a one to one in this case not a one to two the ERP are positive one to two ratio with her2 positive and triple negative I would do a one to one ratio from the very beginning start low and increase as quickly as you can", "EeCyvVgqSjc": "you welcome back YouTube so today I want to give you a little demonstration on how to basically make your own personal use capsules my biggest issue when I make a big batch of oil is like sometimes I really don't want edibles I don't want cookies I don't want any of it sometimes I just want to you know consume I will hey is it that hard it's really not so what I usually do is I get this little capsule machine you go to GNC or Vitamin World or any any health food store they sell these capsules and they also sell this press right here so the capsules cost like a dollar you got like 200 oh and this cost about $10 money well spent let me tell you so all you're gonna do is you take your capsules okay your tops you put your bottoms in this really can't get any easier and the best part about this is these friggin things work you you can make your oil as strong as you want and then you can really really hone in on how strong is my caps and you you can really master this so you get it all filled out and it'll come back in a set but say if you don't have one of these fancy presses which isn't that fancy or expensive but you just you know you're not gonna spend the money it's just you don't you don't see the point so you could what you could do is get a bowl of sugar and say you take your tops put your tops to the side and then you just stick the bottoms into the sugar or the salt and it works pretty perfectly you'll lose say if you do about a hundred you're probably gonna lose a good 15 in falling and just not just whatever but that's not that bad and on the other half you're gonna put your tops so what's gonna happen is we're gonna put or oil and then we're gonna spread it around it's gonna fill up the caps perfectly and then we're gonna put this top on and then squeeze and then when you squeeze they all perfectly become capsules it's amazing and the best part is you give it to one of your friends or or a different medical patient they're gonna look at you like you're just how did you do that so before you go any further you really want to make sure that each one has a capsule in it because if you miss I'm just gonna have oil everywhere and you get a waste of money and you're gonna be pissed so next you take your card so I'm gonna take it I'm gonna pour it in a center round a little square and it'll disperse around and the best part about this thing is if you do too much oil you just pour it right back into your glass so you just spread it around so a little excess oil that I got all right so now I'm gonna take my tops and I'm gonna sit it on top and this is where you really got to be focused when I say really got you focused I mean not really but just squeezed evenly is really what I'm trying to tell you so you're gonna take it and give it a nice squeeze make sure it's all in then boom got canvas castles oh now you can go to work boom boom boom you know no big deal and now ain't no big deal but they work they look great and this is exactly what we're going we're not going for half-assed you know edibles that kind of work like we want stuff that's gonna work so give me a little close-up well thanks guys for watching like how easy was that get yourself out there instead of making cookies or being boring with your oil do something different make some capsules and and you're gonna find that you love these things because I know I did but if you liked what you saw today don't forget to check me out on Instagram at the NJ chef and as always smoke [Music]", "txywY2CyfKA": "[Music] on the cancer research we find from the beginning that there is a specificity between the type of the extract that were using the type of the strain that were choosing that its ability to kill the cancer cells so we find out that strain number one is attacking colon cancer but doing nothing to prostate cancer to liver cancer and and strain number to extract number two will kill just the prostate cancer but will do nothing to call on them to breast and two things was very unique first this specificity and second the amount that we had to use we use one microgram per ml in order to kill these cancer cells so if you're taking every material in the world have what we called ic50 is what is the amount that you need to use in order to kill 50 percent of the cells so if you're taking rosemary you're taking any other herbs and you extract the active compound for it and we will put on these cells eventually it will kill the cells so I'm taking the colon cells and I will put extract from rosemary I need 50 milligram per ml in order to kill the cells if you take in cannabis you need sixty thousand times less you need one microgram and there is what we call therapeutic window if you calculate the doing this calculation which is a stupid calculation because there is a huge difference between cells growing the plateau and mice to a human being but if you're doing this game you reach that you need to eat 40 kilograms of rosemary in a day in order to kill the cells which is not therapeutic window to be doing this calculation on cannabis you realize that you need one gram two gram a day which is a average and average patient in Israel using thirty four point two grams a day so this was very exciting could you understand that is this work very specifically on this plant on the on the cells it's attacking the cells in a specific way but then we were a little bit stuck we didn't know what is the difference between them because you have many compounds here you don't have just teach in CBD you have hundreds of cannabinoids and hundreds of tear pins in every extract so what are the difference between this and death we realize didn't nobody can read it and for you we develop a method to analyze all these compounds and having disability taking us to the next level that we can really define which compound is doing these effects on the cells so the way we are working today we look on what we call you know in India and the medicine field it's called personal medicine so we're looking on a specific mutation we called the driving mutation on the the mutation that derived the cell to be cancer cell so I cancer it's a given name to hundreds of different diseases we'd put them in a box we said every time that we have one two three four five six we will call it a cancer but they are totally different from each other they have the same mccann the same basic because we call them a cancer and one one one thing is that they are losing the ability to commit suicide and other thing that they are starting to between way to different places so we put them in a box and we said every time that we see all of these Fano type we'll call it cancer but they are different in the way to treat them in different and the mechanism in the cells is different so what we're trying to look we're trying to look very specific we said every time that there were these specific mutation the drive to to this breast cancer to be a breast cancer cell let's say brca1 mutation which is very non mutation so that takes on these cells and now we will screen many many types of cannabis and we will try to find a specific one that will kill just this self with these mutations this is the way we are trying to approach it now and when we finding something like that we starting to look deeper and deeper we try to understand what is mechanism why when you have a brca1 mutation these extract attacking the cells which which pathway is blocking which passwords activating what is changing in the cell that it will die specifically this one on the other hand we trying to understand what is the minimum compound that doing this effect you're starting with 100 compound something like 40 cannabinoids 40 tear pens some flavonoids in every extract so from this one do we need all of them like the intro Hodge effect if Amelia effect or do we need one of them whether we need five of them we are not deciding for room for what is true or not but we're asking them and we have the ability to narrow it down until we find the minimum compound and at least two cases we find that we you need three or four compounds doing the whole effects you don't need all the extract and it's not just one and in these two cases it's not the major cannabinoids not the TT in CBD it's other common cannabinoids in a specific leukemia that we today we know that to kill the cells we know a specific three compounds that's with specific 3 cannabinoids that will always kill myself a few abilities mutation but b3 are not the known one one of them is don't even have a name because nobody define it in the literature before but we know that if you put this compound purified it will do the same effect of the whole extra if you taking one out it's not affecting any more so these are the way we're looking and then come the second round that you started to look on the endocannabinoids how the receptors or which receptors are expressing on these cells and how it's affecting our ability to attack the cells do we need this endocannabinoid the receptors to be on b-cells in order in order to attack them so usually people look on cb1 and cb2 but we have many and can have been receptive with cb3 in GPR 55 and GPR 19 GPR 3 trpv1 TR PP 1 so there is more than 30 receptors which one expressing on this cancer cell that now these extract is attacking them do we need a combination is it a synergism or is it a specific one receptors may be it's attacking 3 different receptor may be into entering all these questions are we are asking them and we have all the tools to look on them and to ask them this is the way we are using today [Music] you [Music]", "tmviQBB5DHs": "federal agents in Spokane raided several medical marijuana dispensaries today enforcing federal law that makes selling or possessing marijuana illegal but for some families that drug is a godsend and treating a variety of diseases two year old cash Hyde was diagnosed last year with a stage four brain tumor he nearly died more times than his family can count and was miserable from the high-dose chemo coursing through his tiny body until his dad turned to a controversial place and gave cannabis to his young son KXLY fours melissa luck is here been working on this story a controversial Robin is an understatement medical marijuana is a political football both here in Washington and in cashy's home state of Montana but his father said to me when your child is dying of cancer you'll do anything you can to help his choice defied doctors but he says saved Cash's life June 21st 2008 does a day Mike and Callie hide will never forget it was just a healthy little boy born in Missoula cash michael Hyde's very first birthday a family now complete they never could have imagined the journey little Cash's life would take she's just your average happy little kid and then he just started to get sick it was shortly before cashy's second birthday when dad Mike knew something wasn't right he started being very tired sleeping a lot very cranky he started to throw up we started taking to the doctor and doctor would tell us that he had mono for six weeks is the same diagnosis over and over but Mike refused to accept what doctors were telling him he knew like any parent would that something is terribly wrong I was like feels like he's dying in my arms we need to take him somewhere else you know and so we took him to the ER and that's when they did a cat scan on him and they found the four point five centimeter tumor in his brain they loaded him up and they were gone to Salt Lake City even mattered a couple hours of finding the Tim at Salt Lake's primary Children's Hospital came the devastating news there little boy was facing incredible odds brain surgery revealed a peanut tumor wrapped around Cash's optic nerve when we arrived in Salt Lake and make a she was so sick they I mean his eye was starting to get pushed out he was sleeping 16 to 18 hours a day he was vomiting he was pretty much as sick as you know you can get without being you know on your deathbed doctors cut into Cash's brain to remove what they could only about ten percent of the tumor the Hyde's could only hope aggressive treatment could get the rest three rounds of chemo followed by stem cell rescue than three rounds of high-dose chemo after that a difficult treatment plan for anyone so imagine what it did to a two-year-old kid the first night of chemo we did ten hours with the seizures down in the ICU and you know the doctors told us that he could have brain damage from these seizures we don't know where it's gonna be in the morning just gonna have to wait and find out how she spent his second birthday in a hospital bed swollen and sick from the medication intended to save his life doctors were uncertain he would make it to his third birthday it's overwhelming I guess to say the least and we had a lot of scary scary things happen in June he got a blood infection went and went into septic shock went to the ICU ended up coding and they had to resuscitate him I was I was standing like two feet away I had to watch the whole thing there was a lot of days we were getting told we weren't gonna beat it you know you're not you're not gonna take him home he is gonna die and those are the days where you really gotta really believe they believed and they prayed high-dose chemo was killing his cancer but it was making Kashi sicker than ever he was taking 120 milligrams a day of five different drugs to try to make him comfortable but that Mike said wasn't helping ease cashy's pain by the end of September he had gone 40 days without eating he had he was vomiting nine to ten times a day he couldn't lift his head off his pillow he was literally laying there shivering in his bed and the doctors came in and I said is there is there anything we can do for cash the doctors had no answers so Mike found his own relief in the form of a controversial oil cannabis illegal for you and I to possess and something cashy's doctors wouldn't even discuss Mike got authorization to give Kashi the oil and without telling them why he told the doctors to wean Kashi off the nausea cocktail inserted through cashy's feeding tube a tiny amount of oil replaced all those drugs the result Mike says was almost immediate you're watching a kid that hasn't had the will to eat in four months five months I actually take a bite of something he hadn't eaten a thing in 40 days and it was really incredible just to watch him take a bite of a piece of cheese you know it's shown that he wants to live [Music] Kashi did his last round of high-dose chemo with no anti-nausea drugs mike says the doctors told him they were amazed mike never told them why I wanted to tell him hey he's on cannabis oil but I was afraid they would take it away from him we wanted to tell you about the side effects the possible dangers of giving medical marijuana to a kid as young as Kashi but even though it's perfectly legal in Washington and in his home state of Montana we couldn't get a single doctor to talk to us on camera that's how we ended up here that the THC clinic in East Spokane and I see a lot of folks and they come in from all walks of life and say they receive benefit Shari Allen is a nurse practitioner from Oregon she comes to Spokane every couple of weeks to evaluate medical marijuana patients and sign off on their permits what I try to do here at this office is create an atmosphere that is truly medical because I do believe that cannabis is a medical and we are trying to use it as a medicine she believes in the power of this drug and its benefit for cancer patients she signs off sometimes on 50 patients a day then I asked her about authorizing marijuana for kids it is not common okay and I'm not going to say but I bought my Popeyes per child it's a typical answer as doctors are concerned about federal law and company policies but Mike high doesn't care about the controversy or about the political battle over this drug he cares that his son survived and has convinced not only did the cannabis oil make Kashi feel better it prevented long-term damage to his organs for Mike the living proof is in this vibrant two-year-old boy yes very controversial is very scary but there's nothing more scary than about losing a child a week after we did this interview Kashi was back in Salt Lake for scans finding out he's cancer-free he's back home in Missoula back with his family back to teasing his big brother Kolby Kashi will spend his third birthday like every kid should with the fight of his life behind him and the state of Montana estimates that of the 28,000 medical marijuana patients in the state 51 are kids under the age of 18 in Robin we tried to get those numbers from Washington but our state does not track who has medical marijuana permits who's allowed to get them it's just simply not tracked so we have no idea here in Washington and after today's raids we kind understand that it might be even longer before we have any more and that's right and that's something that we talked to the Hyde's about at the time we entered did this interview a couple of weeks ago and that's the one thing Mike said whether you agree with it or not every time they take down one of these dispensaries there might be a kid or someone in a hospital somewhere that depends on it so everybody involved just wants the government and what's the jurisdictions to just get it sorted out and you can make comments on this story and let us know what you think on kxly.com later tonight thanks so much well Cash's family got from Minda support from friends family and strangers during his treatment now they're paying it forward the cash Hyde foundation raises money and provides things like these reggae runners to children's hospitals they donated several to Sacred Heart Children's Hospital

way to take it is to put it under your tongue and rub it in you cheat don't do too much even the asleep on all that then you know you should do no don't try to communicate just relax see what happens

experiments we also know that boosting certain branches of the endocannabinoid system is helpful in relieving symptoms of Parkinson's finally from anecdotal information we know that certain patients

most of the time oh did you guys see much oh yeah like we could really easy I wanna yeah please pretty angry that thank you my home state the number one frustration that I have is knowing that there

the high band or millimeter way band in this video i will tell you about their differences the low band is referring to frequencies up to 1 gigahertz and these are frequencies that are conventionally used to provide wide area coverage so that you can get the good service both indoor and outdoor and 5g will make use these frequencies slightly more efficiently but you as a user will not see a big difference however the operator will still use these frequencies in 5g to make sure that you see a 5g symbol in your phone everywhere the mid band refers to frequencies from one up to five or six gigahertz and it's primarily in the two and three gigahertz bands where operators are now finding new spectrum that they can utilize for 5g deployments and essentially all of the first five deployments in different countries are in these bands and the good thing with these bands is that the antennas are small enough so you can build large arrays of them this is called massive mimo where you can have say 64 different antennas the antennas are used to send signal beams towards different users at the same time and this is solving the congestion problem that you experience when you have a strong signal but you still get a bad data speed with massive mimo the more users you are serving the higher the total data speed becomes so every user can get essentially the same data speed as if there are a loan in the cell and this is then improving the capacity of the network and since you can also focus the signals in a much more adaptive manner towards users you will also get better performance at the edge of the cell even if you are alone there the high bands are referring to millimeter wave frequencies from say 28 gigahertz and upwards and these ones are having rather short coverage but the good thing is that you can find a lot of bandwidth there there is no shortage of it so your operator can buy big chunk and since the data speeds you can deliver over a short distance is proportional to the amount of bandwidth that they are having in that frequency range you can get much higher data speeds and this is going to be sort of the second phase of 5g that we are deploying this type of millimeter wave spectrum in order to give you higher data speeds at particular locations where there's a lot of users there are short ranges and you have typical line of sight because these type of signals are getting blocked by your hand when 5g is fully deployed in all these free frequency ranges it can cater to different use and needs while 4g was a one-size-fits-all solution now 5g can deliver high data speed if you need that low latency if you need that high reliability if you need that low energy consumption if you need that and all these things at the same time using different frequencies or at the same frequency using the concept of network slicing where the system is reconfigured itself depending on which uses you're having you", "ohMeUJPyRiQ": "I'm dr. Jason MacDougall I'm a professor of honestly 0 del University and I also too committee at the arthritis Society so cannabis is my family of hem the hem family and marijuana is pretty much the same thing it's just more of a slang term so we prefer to adhere to the scientific naming of cannabis cannabinoid is a hammock it's found within the plant the cannabis plant and it can also be a chemical that mimics the cannabis plant so it could be man-made or it could be naturally occurring in our bodies so they're actually three different types of cannabinoid there are the fatal cannabinoids which are the ones that are found within the cannabis plant the synthetic cannabinoids which are the man-made chemicals the pharmaceutical preparations and then they're the endocannabinoids which are the naturally occurring cannabis like compounds that a caramel produced in our bodies there were many active Cannabis the two most well known ones are THC and CBD THC stands for tetrahydrocannabinol and that's the psychoactive component of cannabis CBD is cannabidiol and that has been shown to be effective at controlling pain and inflammation and but it doesn't have the psychoactive properties the same way that THC does so medical cannabis is the cannabis that's prescribed by your doctor and could be an either the herbal form either a synthetic form and there's some evidence to show that it can be effective in alleviating arthritis pain as well as inflammation and fatigue different ways of administering cannabis can be either smoked or ingested in oral form baked into cookies or produced in the oil of butters but they're also synthetic cannabinoids that can be taken as a tablet or as a spray underneath the tongue different strains of cannabis different types of cannabis and they vary and the amount of THC and CBD that they contain and it's important to know that because they may have different impacts in various populations of patients we'll just like any drug there are a number of different side effects associated with cannabis and so it may not be appropriate for all arthritis patients so we really really need more research try and understand the safety profile of the different strains of cannabis there's been a lot of experimental evidence to show that cannabis can be effective in treating the pains of arthritis as well as the inflammation and helping with fatigue but we really need more clinical studies to try and understand benefits and potential limitations of using cannabis so further research into medical cannabis is required so we can understand the different subpopulations of patients who may be responsive to medical cannabis we need to find out the effective dose of medical cannabis some of the interactions with other drugs as well as looking at different delivery systems you", "CzMHusSAZs8": "we've uh removed most of the sticks that you've got in here um a couple more sticks to come out you don't need to grind this you don't want to grind

somewhere between 20 and 30 below celsius some people want it to be much colder than that the colder it is the less green that it will pull the less chlorophyll that it will pull but the problem with making it super cold is it negatively affects the solubility of the cannabinoids as well and that means you generally have to have a little bit longer soak time but in any case that's subject to experimentation by you the objective of this of course is to pull as much cannabinoids while at the same time pulling the least amount of green from the chlorophyll here are the two bottles of 190 proof everclear and the raw material in a freezer we're going to get this really really cold i suspect that we'll be running down around -25 by the time that this is cooled off this will take overnight this particular type of freezer has a dial type gauge on it as opposed to a digital gauge this allows me to run the temperature down to far lower temperatures than i would get with a digital gauge we're now at minus 27.9 centigrade and our raw materials and our alcohol are now cold enough to begin the extraction portion of the process so now pour the cold ethanol into the biomass i'm using about 1500 milliliters of ethanol into that biomass and you can see it is essentially uh submerged in there and i'm going to shake that up just a little bit and put it back in the freezer for five minutes here we have our first wash now what we're going to do is put it back into the freezer get it really really cold again and then we're going to run it through a winterizing process in the essential in order to remove some of the fats and lipids here we have the winterization filtering going on you can see the flow and this is the uh moisturization jar it's almost empty now you've pulled most of the fluid through the little vacuum pump is good enough for doing this but if you want to accelerate it you would connect a third-party vacuum pump and make it much much faster you can see that the filter has got quite a bit of sediment or some kind of debris on it and this could be waxes lipids or bio-particles this is a 2 micron filter and it's quite dark now we can see the waxes and bio particles that are accumulated here we can see the waxes and lipids that are on there this is the clarity and the color of the first wash we can simply put the multi-purpose lid on and begin our concentration and after boiling off we now have uh this concentrate there is still a bit of ethanol in here but this will be left to evaporate and then we will have our final extract", "svEaH7VStFk": "- My hair is rainbow colored, because I had lost the will to live, and my friend told me \"you need to dye your hair \"beautiful colors, so that every\ntime you look in the mirror \"you'll remember that\nyou're worth living for\" and that worked actually, because I'm quite a cheerful person, and so every time I look in the mirror, I remember that I have beautiful children, and an amazing husband,\nand I am worth living for. (inspiring music) I grew up always being in pain, I remember when I was 11\nyears old, asking my mom why I always hurt, and she\nsaid everybody always hurt, and I remember that not being right. I also remember, just not fitting in, everybody doing fun things, and hiking for long periods of time, and I couldn't do things\nother people could do. It was really hard. I went to doctor to doctor, and nobody could quite ever\nfigure out what was going on. It wasn't until my 30's\nthat I found out that I have two malformations in my hips, and I have connective tissue disorder, I have a high rheumatoid factor also. So, what that means is that\nmy joints pop out of socket, and I have a slipped disc\nbecause of that also, and I have rheumatoid arthritis. I have decided to bear\nas much pain as I can in order to spend time with my children, and in order to be a good mom in that I have to be conscious, and I have to be aware of my children, they take a lot of time and energy, and I'm only here with them\nfor a certain amount of time. I do not want the addiction factor, and I do not want to put the\nwear and tear on my body, especially on my liver. It was in 2015 that I\nstarted having seizures. I went into my room, and there's three steps down to my room, and I looked down the steps, and realized I could not\nphysically walk down the steps. So, I yelled to my husband, and he got out of bed and\nhelped me down to the steps. Which was a normal\noccurrence at that time, I had six months earlier\nfallen down the stairs, and so I had been slowly getting sicker, and he put me in my chair. which was the closest\nthing to set me into, and I shook for two hours, and I just did this, for two hours, and after the first hour he brought me to the emergency room, and by the second hour they gave me benzodiazepines, and said that was a seizure\nyou need to see a neurologist, and within two weeks, I\nwas having regular seizures every single day for hours. So, I was on prescription drugs. They caused more seizures, they caused Alice in Wonderland syndrome, they caused me to drool, they\ncaused de ja vu and jamais vu, and they caused me to feel\nlike I was getting high, and stoned and it was a\nreally horrible feeling, and it made me feel very sick. I had to have to\nbe on more medications just to counteract those medications. It was really awful. My mother had to step in, and take care of my children sometimes. My husband had to work\non Christmas Eve once, and so my mom had to come, and take care of my\nchildren on Christmas Eve, and she had to cook the meal, and I had to be kept away from\nthe kids on Christmas Eve, and my mom did Christmas Eve for my kids. When my husband would\ngo out of town for work, my children would go and\nbe with my mom for days, and then my friends would\ncome and take care of me. I couldn't be the mother when I was on the prescription drugs. It was really hard. Whenever I used THC my seizures stopped, but I couldn't bring it home, so I would go out of\nstate when I was sick, and use medical cannabis, but then I would come home and\nI would have seizures again. My doctor was actually the\nfirst one who brought up medical cannabis, and I have\nhad four neurologists bring up that they were excited about medical cannabis being able to pass, that they would write letters\nfor all of their patients. My doctor actually signed\na letter for me right away. After Prop 2, bringing\nmy medicine home was, it was the most exciting\nthing I've probably ever done in my whole entire life,\nbecause before then every single time that my husband would bring me\nout of state when I was sick, we would try and guess how\nmuch I would use before, and then we would throw\nit away at the hotel, and know we were throwing away medicine. And then we would know I would be sick, and I would start having seizures within hours of us crossing the border. It was really hard, it\nwas really, really hard knowing that we were throwing away my health every single time, and we were\ngoing home to me being sick. Since Prop 2 passed I've\nbeen 14 months seizure free, and it's been amazing. I do so many things with my kids, I am currently teaching them how to can, we're canning tomatoes right\nnow, it's tomato season. And I am very, very active. I'm active at their school helping them, I'm active with them in all things. I'm very thankful that I have this law that is making it so\nthat I have my medicine. There is more work to be done, everybody needs to have\naccess to their medicine. Recently up at the Capitol, it was alleged that those of us who use medical\ncannabis cannot be good parents. I happened to be there that day, and I declared that we can. I happened to declare\nthat I'm a damn good mom, and I am. (happy music)", "lZZobKohdN0": "hi guys extract craft here and today we're back for another educational video on how to do filtration of your alcohol-based tincture so first thing that we had done was we soaked our plant material for about five minutes in the freezer the idea what that was to eliminate as much of the chlorophyll and waxes and lipids of the plant material into our final extract so by doing that in a sub-zero temperature we're going to eliminate a very very large amount of that so what we're going to use today is a Buchner funnel or Buechner funnel these are available on extract craft comm and what this is going to do is we use paper filters that sit in the bottom of the ceramic funnel and we actually have a vacuum hose hooked up to the side of the flask now what this does is it will actually pull the tincture down through the paper filter and into the flask creating a much much cleaner and finer end product we actually will be using the vacuum port on the source turbo as our vacuum assist on our flask so first thing we need to do is we need to go ahead and wet down our paper filter this ensures that when you apply the vacuum the paper filter sucks to the bottom of the funnel in order to make sure nothing goes underneath the paper so as long as you get all the edges and everything else we just want to make sure we got all that then we can go ahead and apply our vacuum so we take our hose and we just kind of hold it over top of the vacuum port and then we can start our process and one thing you want to make sure you do is leave your vacuum valve just a little bit open to ensure that we're pulling vacuum through the whole time and the Machine doesn't stop so we can go ahead and start our process here and then we want to make sure that our filter paper sets down nicely to the bottom and then once we have that we can go ahead and begin to apply our tincture just like that the vacuum pulls the tincture right through and down into the flask now one thing I like to do is I like to make sure I do at least three passes through the filter paper just to ensure that we've caught as much of the fine particle waxes and lipids that we can and just like that it sucks it right down so we can go ahead and stop the process here and then what we're going to do is we're going to do a second and a third pass also okay so now what we are doing is we're going to go ahead and prepare our second pass through our filter paper so we go ahead and hook this up start the process and like like before we want to make sure the paper filter sucks down to the bottom before we start to apply the tincture [Music] okay and now we're done with this second pass so we'll do one more pass after this okay guys so now we're back to do the third pass through the Buechner funnel one thing I wanted you to keep in mind was with your paper filters they're typically going to come in a fast medium or slow feed what's important is to use the fast paper filter on the initial pass on your first pass and then after that once the alcohol has been cleaned up a little bit after that first pass then we can go ahead and use the slow feed and catch even more of that particle and those waxes and lipids so we go ahead and put our paper filter in and we are going to wet it down as always make sure that's good and wet before we get started and okay and now we're going to once again use the source as our vacuum assist at that we make sure that paper filter is sucked down nicely and then we begin pouring in the tank share [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so now we go ahead and stop the process and we can actually remove our funnel and everything but after three passes through the Buechner funnel you should have a nice beautiful golden colored extract tincture ready to evaporate down you can get all these things the Buechner funnels and the kits and everything on extract craft comm if you have any questions you can always reach out to us but don't forget to like this video

we are sold out it's thousand people attending here this place is packed with people it is did you expect this yes this is for the weekend warriors for the professional athletes anybody who really is just thirsty you know beverages don't have that cannabis taste that a lot of people think that they're going to get the drinks tastes delicious they work great and it's just a nice feeling how is it very good [Music] the size of the crowd says it all cannabis could be the next big frontier in the beverage world but it wasn't a natural fit every single one of these drinks is made with an ingredient that doesn't dissolve in water our first beverage you can turn it upside down and you'd see that cannabis go up and down THC drinks were a little bit like salad dressing so they had to be shaken and bottom didn't taste or smell that good it all comes back to a simple truth oil and water don't mix it's backbase it does not mix well once you add it to beverages though it starts out as the green plant we all recognize the cannabis we're talking about gets distilled into a thick oil that's nearly solid at room temperature it mixes well with the makings of chocolate which are also fat based so companies like Stillwater ingredients hired experts from the candy industry we've solved it before our eyes they pour these crystals into a glass of water and they appear to dissolve lipids cannot dissolve in water but you can do is coat them in a surfactant and then enable them to be water compatible Industrial sauna mechanics makes this contraption that sends sound waves through the cannabis oil to break it up into tiny particles then coat them with a slippery substance that stays suspended in water it's nanotechnology and it's the solution that's unlocked a whole new kind of adult beverage Keith makes cannabis Cola root beer and sparkling water for those who want a wave of refreshment with a splash of THC Cheers and bottoms up with the cannabis drinks from Tinley all modeled after your neighborhood bar our whole approaches and alcohol inspired type strategy so we've got ready to drink tonics stoned AZ which would be compared to a margarita they offered tastings here at the show of samples without cannabis oh yeah it is ice-cold there are cocktails and shots it smells very cinnamon it may be no surprise the industry's going after a specific customer those who are less experienced with cannabis but love trying new drinks craft beer consumers are perfect for cannabis drinks because they're into experimenting new beverages and though there is hemp beer and weed wine there's one thing you won't find drinks can have cannabis or they can have alcohol but they can't have both it's the ultimate irony stopping nausea was a major reason marijuana was first legalized for medical use because remember cannabis isn't only about getting high all right bring CBD into the sports world now legal in all 50 states hemp derived CBD is making his way into seemingly everything including this sports drink it really is calming it helps with pain inflammation Guardian taps into a whole other market for these drinks those looking to use cannabis for wellness so we wanted to go with the all organic no refined sugar they're going after the same crowd as eat green people come to cannabis to help them with their health I don't want to give someone diabetes while trying to help them come back eat Green makes cold-pressed juices in three different versions it's this the packaging right here the hemp drinks can be sold anywhere the first thing I smell is watermelon is there real watermelon but at dispensaries they sell THC versions one with a little and one with a lot cannabis products can't cross state lines so all these drinks are made and sold in California at least for now and tomorrow the world", "4egS1B4EyQY": "[Music] is 5d a revolution yes is 5g a challenge for all of us yes is 5g a mystery no not for wooden schwartz welcome to our new video series 5gs now in this first episode we'll take a look at where 5gs today we'll explore what it means for tests and measurement and discover innovative solutions today i've invited three of our senior executives first i'd like to welcome ani stefan vice president market segment wireless communications anne can you tell us more about where 5g new radio is today sure thank you brigitte 5g is really a shift a paradigm shift in technology looking at the well-known 5g triangle we see many different applications behind for example embb in high data rate applications such as vrn gaming mmtc in iot type and smart applications such as smart city and you are llc in industrial automation and self-driving cars on the way to realize all of this 5g networks and 5g phones have been launched already testing with use of test and measurement equipment is ongoing in r d and production in the different frequency bands we all know the 5g market is facing complex test requirements we work close together with our customers and handle them in the best way thank you anna testing is a good point what i'd like to know now is what are the unique challenges in test and measurement and who else could answer this question better than andreas pauli thank you brigitte 5g introduces new frequencies in the microwave range 24 gigahertz 28 39 at even higher frequencies are used and in 5g a lot of functionality becomes more and more integrated which means test boards no longer have connectors so test in the past could be done connected but in 5g you have to do them over the air beam forming massive mimo becomes mandatory this helps to reduce interference to have higher throughput and have higher coverage 5g physical layer is very flexible parameters like bandwidth subcarrier spacing modulation symbol duration can be changed rodent schwartz and our innovative test solutions build upon decades of experience in wireless and microwave testing thank you so we've seen 5g changes a lot that's why five of our technology experts have teamed up to create this book more than 400 pages describing the 5g standard and testing aspects this book is available for you online but theory is not enough at rodeo schwartz we develop test solutions for 5g such as our cmx antomesmer vice president mobile radio testers has a cmx with him today development and production of 5g wireless devices require reliable testing such as protocol callbacks application and conformance testing these types of testing regular a wireless communication tester wooden schwarz has been the leading supplier and trustful partner from tucci srichi to 4g the cmw series for 4g is unique and by far the most used wireless communication tester worldwide our new 5g tester is built up on this leadership enabling you to continue with rhoden schwarz as your partner for tester measurement equipment thank you in the next episode one of the authors of this book will give more insights into the 5g technology see you then and don't forget 5g is now", "FZV1Qd8ekLA": "[Music] hey guys this both from Heba and thought I would do a quick extract crap video so we have a couple of patients who we want to try and use our Harlequin and make some RS oh so we will have some CBD in our RS Oh for those familiar RS o is the Rick Simpson oil you can check that out on Phoenix tears CA but we're gonna do this quick recipe and so what I did I took an ounce of our Harlequin 28 grams put a cup of Everclear into the jar and I shook it up for two minutes I put my timer on my phone and shook it up and now I'm bringing it into the bowl here when I'm done I'm going to put it in the extract craft we're gonna boil it down and we're gonna see how it turns out alright so I've got a couple of strainers here I don't want any any material in my liquid no I might even do one more process to get all these solids out let me set that out okay let me just show you here real quick I'm gonna get all this out of here and this filter does a great job you can use a coffee filter but look at all this stuff that I got out of here that's just gonna lead to a better product when we're done by the alcohol in there okay we good now we've got some beautiful green light green liquid we'll be filling up our extract craft tent nothing but luscious goodness in the old cup let's do this machines I had to send it back to get it updated but it is all up to date I've got the turbo mode and all that all the improvements that they've made and I'm just going to get some ice for the ball we will make sure that our screw is all the way plugged in I've made that mistake before my lid goes on and grab some ice dick of the Internet I will speed this up and hopefully hang on hang on it'll be done just a second here we go BAM wow this turbo mode is crazy this is only one hour gone by and we're gonna be done soon so I'm gonna let this go a little bit further but not a whole lot because I am going to be transferring it from the metal bowl here to a silicone container and we'll finish in the silicone silicone container and it will make your life a lot easier so next update I will have it transferred into actually I'll video that so we will do an update here in a few minutes and see how we're doing so here's an example of what I am talking about I will be taking the oil that is left in the in the container and transfer it into one of these obviously not this one because I've already done that so as you can see this is a finished product and the beauty of this is you can get it out easily trying to show you with one hand and I can't so I'll show you with the Harlequin when we're done so shortly I will pour the remaining liquid probably into this one depends on how much is in there but probably this one and we'll boil it down and then we will have it right in the finished container and it will be get out and and try so there you go that's coming up okay guys so I stopped it and I've got a little corner left in here but it's still very liquidy but when you look at it there's some settlement sediment in there and I want to get that out okay so I'm not sure if you're able to see probably not but I want to get that out so I took one of those big filters cut it and now I am going to just filter this little bit and I will be putting it into this little silicon which I believe it will not overflow and we'll see how pretty we can get it all that particle down in the bottom so there you go now I am going to see if I can squeeze the last drop out of here oh yeah I got a couple of good drops alright here we go Oh smells good okay now I am putting the magic potion in I'm praying I'm praying I'm not a praying guy but looks good all right YouTube so quick update I finished the Harlequin RSO and I have to say it turned out pretty darn good disappointing that I only got probably a couple of grams I didn't even measure it if you remember we used how much did we use we use probably an ounce and a half in the beginning but it is very stable I mean look at it will fold up on each other and and you can touch it and not I mean get a little oil but it's it's it's not bad so our patience I have somebody that has MS that we're gonna have try this he uses regular RSO takes it daily for his disease and it's going to give this a try so I will report back on that but in the meantime we really need to give this thing a test and I will volunteer to do that so I've got a DAB on my tool and I'm going to use my doctored ever to dab a little Harlequin RS oh and let's see how smooth it is how it tastes all right here we go it tastes really good so that tasted really good that was strictly Harlequin first time I've done it made RSO a lot of it and I have to say I kind of like that I don't know if it's gonna be economical maybe we're gonna have to grow a bunch of Harlequin outside this year and make a bunch of RSO out of it to be cost-effective but I can't wait to see how our patient likes it as well anyway that's our update this this time hope you liked it if you liked it down below like subscribe whatever all that stuff and hopefully we'll have a new recipe for you soon thank you we'll see you again soon growers love [Music]", "b6DP4pI4igs": "yo what's good everybody j ping here checking in live respectmyregion.com i am here with a west coast wheat tour review today's product is a cannabis extract it is the full spectrum oil whoops from emerald bay extracts here in california this is a blue dream rso so one gram syringe squeeze it on out we're looking at thc 79.35 percent 70 793.5 milligrams cbd 1.7 milligrams so this is definitely more of a sativa dominant product not so much a lot of cbd inside of it just a little bit though to give it that enrage effect pick this up at the royal healing emporium and lamb poke so super dope product we're gonna get this on open i'm gonna do a small tasting of it and then give you guys um you know kind of like describe the taste the flavor any kind of immediate feelings things like that so important to know that rso is rick simpson oil it is ideally what kind of got cannabis legalized in a lot of senses is the medicinal properties that this kind of product really brings smoking does a lot for a lot of people but unfortunately it just isn't healthy for a lot of people as well so you think about cancer patients needing a true product and that's where this medicinal item comes into play the syringe again full plant extract here we go check this out you guys so definitely something you want to keep away from the kids keep away from pets all that good stuff this is real real real medicine y'all so for me i use sativas and cbd's cbd rsos for my ibs i treat my back pain i've got some spine issues and some some things like that and so um you know the long hours on the road and standing and even doing these videos and things like that i have to kind of be aware of managing my my pain and my symptoms and cbd desert and and these blue dream rso specifically do a really good job of helping with that so all we're going to do here is open this on up i think i can just yep twist right there give you guys a view oh oh oh oh oh let me just say oh yeah i can just twist off that cap there we go there we go all right all right so it's pretty simple uh you can run hot water over it to squeeze it out um this one should be good though yeah nothing too hard um when it comes to the amount that you're supposed to do ideally you want to do a great rice or a grain size piece i'm gonna do about half of that just because it's the middle of the day for me and i've already smoked and stuff so i don't need this by itself right now i like to put it underneath the tongue it tends to work a little quicker flavor-wise this is supposed to taste like weed you're definitely not trying to mask it there's no sugar nothing like that it's 100 plant extract you can see it kind of stains the fingers just a little bit i don't think i got any of my teeth but yeah it's a very much a high quality product meant for patients meant for people in need of strain specific effects i do enjoy rso products that blend strains you know a high thc product with four strains in it is awesome but i also like you know these strain specific blue dreams and things like that i think there's value in both sides so when i think about the experience on this you know i really enjoy blue dream as a strain it's light it's energetic provides a little bit of focus has usually it has a higher higher quantities of cbg uh and thc on this particular product it doesn't list the terpene information or some of the other like factoids you know it has thc and cbd but it could have some of the other cannabinoids tested on there and i think that would be important uh cbc cbgs thcvs things like that um but this does taste very good um i know that i'm going to have a good jolt of energy and focus here for the next few hours if not for the next like six hours this tends to come in waves for me so flavor was very good nice and earthy definitely no alcohol taste which is huge some brands you can definitely get the alcohol it wasn't purged right or whatever it is um perhaps but this one really good so score out of 10 price point was pretty affordable 45 gram a little on the high side but there was there was actually about 110 to 120 milligrams of thc higher than some of the other brands that we like to buy rso wise here in cali so i'm willing to pay that higher price for that extra 120 milligrams um i'm gonna give it a nine out of ten it's kind of where i'm leaning um i would like some more cbd this is where it's like a high thc blue dream at 79 80 percent would have been great to have another strain blended in for some more cbd but i can't complain i think a 9 out of 10 is a really great score this is a product that if someone needs 800 milligrams of thc for the day smoke a little bit eat an edible and pop this in and you're good to go so something i really recommend emerald bay extracts this is a west coast weed tour review jay ping here checking in live respect my region man make sure you guys tap in follow comment please let me know

there are mainly three type of appliances we're looking first of all at appliances that can provide the edge specifically view in the due we're developing the full appliance we have adding cards for different type of connectivity a 10 gig 25 gig we have a time synchronization solutions we have offload and maybe uh when when we're looking at this market we can create a different solution whether those are software a partial acceleration of a fully accelerated l1 and those create for the operator a range of choices whether those are software a hardware or a mix of both yes and as of course within this sort of run environment front hall connectivity is a very very important part maybe if you just expand a little bit further on silicon's approach to front hull so in the front hole specifically while developing a solution for time sync while developing a range of heading cards that include synchronized internet ptp 1588 those can be ranged from four port to eight port 12 ports and all those may include gnss receiver so we are actually creating the full synchronization platform for the access for the mobile access network the second type of solution is partial offload partial offload including a chip like a acc 100 from intel this is accelerating the ldpc for the error correction and this is working with collaboration with the intel flexure the third line of solution is fpga card in the fpga card we are creating accelerator for the l1 which is way beyond the for the whole correction and we can actually create more connectivity or we can connect more radio units to 1du and by that we can scale the network much faster so it's a different type of solution starting from software to partial offload to a fully accelerated l1 and do these capabilities they enable you presumably to get involved in other markets maybe you could just just explain a little bit about that okay when uh we're looking at other markets there is a very interesting market of private lte and private 5g the private ltn 5g they create a out of the box solution we can create an appliance with all the hardware accelerators we are collaborating with software companies and we create one solution so when you are coming to deploy a private lte or private 5g we can bring you one box solution that including all the access and network and we can connect directly to the radiohead we are also part of the ongo alliance and by that we are creating this the right specification for our platform in order to integrate seamlessly with the software vendors it's clear that you've made very good progress already but i'm going to put you on the spot a little bit and just tell me a little bit more about your future roadmap what's coming around the corner around the corner there are so many many surprises for 2021 and 2022. so first of all and the obvious one we are align with intel well developing the next generation appliance based on intel and next generation processors we will have appliances starting from four core up to 10 core for rural areas will have appliances for 10 core to 20 cores for open areas and will have high dense open appliance that will range from 20 cores up to 36 cores and this is something that will create for us opportunity to offer software vendor and the operators a full range of appliances on top of that we are developing appliances for uncontrolled environment and for temperature range minus 20 to 55 and by that they can get those applies to uncontrolled environment which is very typical in those c deployment models on top of that we are developing an outdoor view that can be poll mounted and this is very interesting because we will not require a specific room for this we can mount the view next to the ru on the pole and by that reduce the real estate required from the operator so again when we are looking at an operator we need to create for them a portfolio of product so they can actually use for many many deployment models without any software integration and without any software onboarding that require effort yeah it sounds like a very appealing story to operators so thank you very much aaron for your time it's been great speaking to you thank you very much thank you very much", "EdoUnJuENuQ": "I'm gonna meet up with John Dawson from kung-fu dates to make some custom flavors of hash oil but the

find in our 5g book in this episode we will dive deeper into a well known and established internal technology beamforming beamforming is not new but its importance will fundamentally increase in 5g cellular communications my cut camp one of the authors of our 5g book has left his office to show us what this looks like in the field yes Brigid I'm outside here in front of one of our buildings at Munich headquarters and I'm going to discuss beamforming and I will show you some 5g in our measurements so beamforming is really not a new technology used in existing cellular networks you can use it in LT for instance however in five TNR it's much more inherently supported in the system and that is very important because we want to achieve coverage and communication at high frequencies such as 28 and 39 gigahertz so it's so-called fa2 frequency back and their IT nation of course is high and also we want to support massive MIMO which is the combination of beam forming and spatial multiplexing multiplexing which is more technology used in f1 frequency band up to 70 currents so actually five vnr can support beam forming not only for dedicated channel but also for common channels such as broadcast and synchronization signals say I used for the end user device too soon to system so that is different to existing cellular networks 5g and our supports up to 64 beams at fr2 and up to eight beams and fr1 you can see all the details in our 5-3 in our books and now I'm going to show you some my life measurements forces I've got with me my TV 6 scanner from Rolex rods taking with this antenna these signals why are the air and with battery pack I'm able to carry around this solution for drive testing walk testing and then you see the laptop with the aromas software on it that shows you the results so you can see a number of bars each of these bars represents the absolute power and the signal-to-noise ratio for a single beam of a certain cell so you can see it is really applied in 5g in our networks today this is only the starting point for measurements in the field it will be enhanced by measurements with commercial phones using our qualification that would allow you to assess KPI is like throughput like latency and the communication with the network the subject for discussion in one of our future videos in this series thank you Mike if you would like to learn more about beamforming and other 5g topics you can read our 5g book online see you then and don't forget 5g is now", "DLcg_E6YgAI": "[Music] hey youtube how you doing this is tech extremist welcome to speed testing so i suppose if you're looking or waiting for the bus that's the way to do it do it on top of the bus stop how about that huh that's a good way to do it nobody bother you up there read a book in peace kind of like that i'm gonna start doing that as well but anyway so i was driving through what is this 83rd avenue and what road is that let's take a look here in the maps it's always covered right you always want to find a road and and camelback road over here by glendale arizona all right so okay there's been a lot of debate about what verizon's millimeter wave is going to do well there should not be that much debate because it's getting put everywhere at least here in phoenix it is all right so we're going to see if those tree uh branches uh stop the signal ah but anyway check that out ultra wideband from verizon let's go ahead and run a speed test here to see how it performs and then we'll go ahead and test the other ones all right check that out i mean who wouldn't want that kind of performance while you're sitting reading a book at the bus stop just seems like a good idea all right a thousand 101 26 millisecond ping 28 millisecond jitter with a pretty anemic upload but still the download you're gonna be watching videos that's what you want anyway pretty pretty good all right now let's go ahead and take a look at att 43.8 42.6 up 28 millisecond ping and one millisecond jitter all right that is a tnt going back to verizon one thousand one hundred one thirty eleven point three up twenty six millisecond ping and twenty eight millisecond jitter now let's go ahead and look at t-mobile not too shabby all right 335 down that n41 really kicking in now that's another development there was no n41 here before so that is really good news for you t-mobile fans uh it's really good news for me because i use t-mobile a lot i really really love this magenta max plan not gonna lie 18 millisecond ping six millisecond jitter 335 down 30.4 up all right let's see what bandwidth they have here i am interested to see and they are running van 66 20 megahertz oh look at that that's only n71 at 15 megahertz combined with advanced 66 at 20 megahertz produces a very good performance so guess what that wasn't n41 or maybe it was maybe it was it's just disconnected right because now we're running at a lower speed all right so 194 20 millisecond ping seven millisecond jitter but a much better upload and that's probably because of band 66 all right 92.3 up right so what you saw first was probably n41 and what we're seeing now is definitely not n41 is n71 but really good stuff there from t-mobile in uh you know either way so again if you want to read a book sit on top of a bus stop that way well nobody will bother you that is really the way to do it honestly if you think about it and enjoy your millimeter wave verizon ultra wide band expanding into neighborhoods residential areas here in phoenix arizona real close to glendale glendale arizona so if you had any any doubt about what type of deployment millimeter wave was going to see you should remove all doubts here's the proof all right here's the proof if i see any more i'll keep you guys posted but this is not the first time i see them out here uh i've seen them all over the place now all over phoenix but i really appreciate you all watching hit like subscribe comment make sure you hit that ring notification bolt uh bell read a book on top of a bus stop you all have a good one", "syymNA-Xgao": "Hey guys, Nick with Precision here and today we're trying out our all-new L-SEP, instantaneous winterization process. So\nwe're not only going to tell you a little bit about the process but we're\nalso going to walk you through it and show you around the lab a little bit and\nactually show you the experiment real time. So if you look over here, we've got\nour bead warmer. We've got some crude sitting here. It's about 60C, we do\nthat just to keep it liquid. It's about 200 grams of crude or so, and what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to winterize this in real time so you guys can\nactually see what's going on. So we've got our solvent that we've manipulated a\nlittle bit here under the fume hood and what I'm going to do is I'm just going\nto take this solvent and dump it right in I'm sorry going to take the crude and\ndump it right into the solvent in order to show you how quickly this process\nworks so ultimately this is going to have to get taken into solution a little\nbit meaning it's going to have to dissolve within that solvent and once\nthat happens we're going to slow down the stir bar and we're gonna watch the\nlipids almost instantaneously crystallize and separate from your crude oil. So this is normal crude oil out of a hydrocarbon extract similar to any\nother crude oil that you would see coming out of a hydrocarbon application. Let's go ahead and dump her in and we're gonna have a little bit of\ntransfer loss here in this round bottom but we're gonna get just get it as good\nas we can and then we'll leave it alone from there... alright good enough. Let's go ahead and\nturn this stir bar up a little bit just so we can get it moving. So what we can see here is the lipids are\nactually crystallizing similar to how you would winterize in ethanol and as\nyou cool the ethanol you see the lipids start to precipitate - that's what's\nalready happening here instantaneously. And you can see that in most\ncircumstances the lipids are actually heavier than the miscella. Miscella for those of you that don't know is the mixture of the crude oil\nwith the solvent but with the lipids being more dense and heavier they're\ngonna fall to the bottom, so you're starting to see already the separatory\nlayer. And what I'm going to do now - I'm just going to turn off this so it stops\nstirring and we're going to watch that separation. So I'm going to go ahead and lift this\nup just so you guys can maybe see a little bit better. So all of that crude\noil is now in solution and you can see these lipids just absolutely, totally\ncrystallized within this solution. You can see try to get some different angles\nhere for you guys pretty cool though, so now that's ready to be filtered. That's\nthat's an instantaneous crystallization of the lipids. This can then be poured\nthrough any sort of filtration system whether you're doing a small batch, like\nthis like we do in the lab just on lab scale and throw it through a Buechner, or\nyou have a larger filter press whatever the circumstance it very drastically\ncrystallizes the lipids within solution and it's ready to be filtered very, very\nquickly. So if you're using a room-temperature process like this you\ncan generally speed up what took normally with ethanol say 24 hours at\nthe lowest say for four to six hours this just took four to six minutes to do.\nSo massive efficiency increase and we're very proud of the process that we've\nhelped to perfect in the lab here, so we hope you enjoyed it today.", "vlbnzi3jE_Q": "as a leader of 5g samsung has been pioneering r d and contributing to the commercialization of 5g in millimeter wave spectrum bands samsung's millimeter wave product family provides diverse options for operators to meet their needs in particular compact macro is an integration of the base band radio and antenna in a single box and it is being utilized to advance global millimeter wave commercialization since 2019 we are also pushing the limits of 5g capacity and speeds with our compact macro for better user experience in 2020 we worked with verizon to achieve 4.2 gigabs with a single device on commercial 5g network and reached 8.5 gigabs peak speeds using two devices in our testing lab in 2021 we broke records again with 5.23 gigabs in data speeds with a single device by using endc and carrier aggregation we used 40 megahertz of bandwidth for lte and 800 megahertz of bandwidth for 5g in the millimeter wave spectrum we also provide an integrated product for indoor environments link cell it delivers gigabs speeds for indoors and helps extend millimeter wave coverage with advanced technology and solutions samsung will continue to drive expansion of millimeter wave 5g all across the world", "3N8QMeIsX2c": "Translator: Rhonda Jacobs\nReviewer: Peter van de Ven What goes through your mind\nwhen I tell you that my 11-year-old twins\nare using marijuana? Do you think to yourselves, \"Oh my god, the drug problem in the U.S.\nis worse than I thought\"? How is it possible that 11-year-olds\nget access to pot? Maybe some of you thought, \"Geez, I wonder what\nmedical condition these kids have.\" The truth of the matter is, most of us don't think about medicine\nwhen we hear the word \"marijuana.\" I admit - I'm embarrassed to admit\nthat up until two years ago I was completely misinformed\nabout marijuana, and I think many\nof our population is today. I remember vividly in sixth grade\nbeing ushered into the auditorium to see a government-sponsored\n\"documentary\" about marijuana. It was the most scary thing\nI'd ever watched. People jumping off buildings,\ncar crashes - it was mayhem. But not once was there\na mention of the possibility that cannabis was useful as medicine. To be honest, in retrospect, I'm a little angry about the propaganda\nthat our government is putting forth; it's even happening today. My big idea worth sharing\nis that medical cannabis can be the healthcare success story\nof our lifetimes but only if we all engage\nin learning the truth and ask our federal government\nto end prohibition of cannabis. I'd like to introduce you\nto my twins, Addison and Cassidy. Believe it or not, today's their birthday. Eleven years ago today,\nonly a mile from here, they were born and came into our lives. Happiest day of my life -\nI love the date too: January 23, 2004. 1, 2, 3, 4. Unfortunately, Addie and Cassie\nsuffer from a very rare genetic disorder called Niemann-Pick Type C . This horrible disease\nis more commonly called, or what we call it,\nis childhood Alzheimer's. Their little brains\nare drowning in cholesterol. They're missing a protein\nthat allows them to process cholesterol both in and out of their brain cells. The cause is neurodegeneration. They can no longer walk,\nand they can no longer talk. We were told the Addie and Cassie\nwould be lucky to see their 12th birthday. (Sniffs) After reeling with\nthis devastating diagnosis, my wife and I dedicated ourselves to finding treatments\nfor our twins in their lifetime. We gave up successful\nhigh tech careers in Silicon Valley, and we became research philanthropists\nraising money for research, and ultimately, we became\nbiotechnology entrepreneurs developing a compound. The compound we found was cyclodextrin, and we found it with an amazing group\nof scientists, researchers and physicians from all over the world,\nincluding right here in Reno. Every week the girls get an infusion. It's eight hours long -\nit goes into their bloodstream, the cyclodextrin. Every other week, like yesterday,\nthe girls go to the hospital and they get a lumbar\npuncture in their spine in order to get the cyclodextrin\nto reach their brains directly. We think that the combination\nof those two routes of administration are slowing down\nthe neurodegenerative progression, and hopefully, maybe even stopping it. Addie and Cassie were\nthe first little pioneers to try this scary treatment. I can tell you as a parent, with no one in front of you\npaving the way, it truly is a scary moment. Thankfully, a couple dozen\nkids around the world, including a few at the NIH, are now engaged\nin further science and research on this experimental treatment. But the treatment doesn't seem\nto help with their seizures. As a result of the neurodegeneration,\nmy kids have seizures almost daily. A couple years ago\nthey were way more than daily, they were many a day. We started giving the kids\ntraditional pharmaceutical medicines for their seizures. And they worked - some of them worked,\nsome of them didn't work, but the big problem was most seizure drugs cause\nyour kids to become zombies. The whole purpose of the drugs is to essentially take away the stress\nor the triggers that cause seizures. We had heard about a father in California\nthat was treating a young son who has intractable seizures,\nseizing constantly, all day long, and he was using cannabis medicine. We became interested. We contacted him;\nwe learned more about the drug. Ultimately, we decided\nto pursue cannabis in earnest. Did you know that the cannabis plant was used as early as 2900 BC\nin China as medicine? Did you know that we in America\nwere using, in the 1800s, for a century, we were using cannabis\nto treat a number of afflictions. Unfortunately, in the early 1900s,\nas you all probably know, cannabis was prohibited and subsequently demonized\nand turned into a war. It's a shame. It truly is a shame. But we became convinced\nthat the oil would work. So we set out to find\na supply of oil, certainly - Cannabis has been legal\nin the great state of Nevada for almost a decade, surely we could just go out\nand buy some oil and give it to our kids. Not true; there was no oil\navailable in our great state. So we set out to do it ourselves. First we got physician approval\nto do the treatment of cannabis, and then we became caregivers, licensed caregivers\nin the state of Nevada, which allows us to cultivate\nand make extractions, oils from the cannabis plant\nto give to our kids. Every day - three times a day -\nthe girls get a little oil, like what you see here. This oil is extracted\nfrom a very special cannabis plant that's high in cannabidiol,\nor CBD as we call it. Unfortunately, this oil, by itself,\ndoesn't even completely, for our children, stop their seizures, so we still use\na small amount of pharmaceutical medicine, but we use less - we've reduced\nthe number of drugs the kids take, and we've reduced the amount of dose\nfrom the few drugs we do give them, and consequently our kids\nare not only having fewer seizures and shorter seizures, they're also bright eyed\nand happy children again, they're no longer little zombies. This was great progress,\nbut I thought to myself, holy cow, there are two million epilepsy or seizure\ndisorder sufferers in the United States, who's going to help those folks, those kids, those adults\nwith these disorders? And at that moment we decided to take what we had learned\nfor our children and turn it into a commercial business\nhere in the state of Nevada, which was just preparing\nto allow that to happen, and as Kylie mentioned,\nwe've endeavored to do so and are now licensed\nto grow, extract and sell, dispense cannabis here in Nevada,\nin the state of Nevada. Someday the federal government\nwill end prohibition. But how many lives\nwill be lost, potentially, or severely affected in the meantime? How many kids with seizures like mine\nwill move their families, will uproot their homes to move to\nColorado or Nevada to get these medicines? How many cancer patients\nwill be denied access to inexpensive and effective medicine to treat the side effects like pain\nand nausea that come with chemotherapy? There is a groundswell of folks like me\nwho understand the potential of cannabis, and I'm grateful for that. The ironic thing is\nsome of my family and friends, including, most particularly,\nmy own mother, are still not convinced. My mother is worried that free access to cannabis\nis actually a threat to society and that perhaps the medicinal value\ndoesn't outweigh that threat. And she sees the medicinal value\nin her grandchildren. The problem, I think, is that, really, we just don't have enough hard evidence\nyet to convince the skeptics. There just isn't enough\nscience and research to back the foundation\nthat the medicine's working, the medicine's effective, that it's useful\nfor large populations of people. That's not to say\nthat research doesn't exist, there's a mountain of evidence\nthat the cannabis plant is useful. But there's not a lot of clinical science,\nhard clinical science to that effect. That's the conundrum;\nthat's the chicken and egg problem. Until the federal prohibition\nof cannabis ends, until we take cannabis\noff the schedule of harmful drugs like LSD and methamphetamines\nthat have no medicinal value, until we remove cannabis from that list, which is insane that\nit's on that list to begin with, until we remove it from that list,\nresearch can't take place. If I came to the University of Nevada,\nReno Medical Center tomorrow with a million dollar grant\nto study cannabis, I would likely not have success. It's not that the scientists\ndon't want to study the plant, it's that they are fearful\nof losing federal funding. It's because they'd\nhave to deal with the DEA and other regulatory agencies\nat the federal level, which is a complex and expensive process. This is one of the many tentacles\nof the prohibition of cannabis that actually prohibits us\nfrom moving forward. My own personal experience with cannabis\nalong with the evidence, the science that I know about, makes me absolutely certain\nwhat I shared with you earlier. Cannabis has the potential to become the big healthcare\nsuccess story of our lifetimes but only if we allow it. Here are Addie and Cassie\nin a more recent picture. For those of you who are still skeptical, perhaps for those of you like my mother who still worry about\nthe societal downside of cannabis, I ask you to look at this picture\nand consider the following: By limiting access to cannabis\nfor parents like myself, you're forcing me to make a decision between the lives\nor well-being of my children and going to jail. How is that a fair or rational\nset of thinking in modern society? Our 16th president,\nthe famous 16th president, had very strong feelings\nabout this subject. He said, \"Prohibition ... goes\nbeyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control\na man's appetite by legislation and makes a crime out of things\nthat aren't crimes ... A prohibition law strikes a blow\nat the very principles upon which our government was founded.\" This was Abraham Lincoln. And he said these words\nbefore we had the experiences we had with alcohol prohibition\nor with cannabis prohibition. Someday the federal government\nwill spend the money on research. Someday the NIH will actually be actively\npursuing cannabis as a treatment. Until that day comes, a large group of us\nhave come together and formed a nonprofit to organize and fund clinical research\nin cannabis in the private sector until we can use\nthe academic institutions. We call the foundation PeopleCann,\nin honor of advocates like myself who over the last several decades\nhave been saying what I'm now saying and whose words I didn't listen to\nuntil my own situation demanded it. Never in her wildest imagination -\nexcuse me - would my wife have thought that today she would\nbe a cannabis advocate. She was also \"misinformed,\"\nlet's say, about the plant until we needed to learn. Neither my wife nor I would ever believe\nthat our young children would become the next generation\nof cannabis advocates. (Exhales) I'd like you to meet them. Please give a birthday welcome\nto my wife Chris - excuse me - and my daughters, Addie and Cassie Hempel. (Applause) Hi. (Applause) Would it be unkind to ask\nif we can sing Happy Birthday?

(Applause)", "USp47BPZ5zQ": "hey guys this is Jimmy again I have talked about ahem extraction lines on the last episode I'm using the Prussian lines so we can make hemp biomass into coal oil in this episode I'm going to show you the biomass first and then showed you the step by step how to turn the crude oil into good and clear CBD oil so the biomass my current use from this is pretty good as we can see here they have done a good job on separating the biomass out of hemp fiber and hemp seeds all the material remaining in this pack are in high quality they contains a lot of a hemp flour and and leaf which has pretty high CBD contents especially don't want any hemp seeds in your bio mast the hemp seeds contain seed oil which has no CBD in it if you process a bag of biomass that has too much hemp seed in it then you and I was getting a CBD distillates that looks like clear and golden but has very low Sabri concentration in that case that punch that bottle of CBD oil will not be selling an very good price let's take a look at our distillation units so before talking about this relation line we have to talk about how to polish and how to get your CBD crew ready for this relations so right here we are using a rotary evaporator to decarbonize our C bleaker oil so in here we have about 10 litres in this round a flask that we got a foreign extraction line and in here as you can see the liquids beneath the crude oil are yellow so because we were using heat transfer fluids in it instead of a using water by using the heat transfer fluid we can heat up this units 235 degree Celsius which will remove a little bit of ethanol out of it and so decarbonize it nicely so here is our [Music] white film distillation units and our left is crystallizer so we can after we have disciplines we can transform the disciplines into CDP the isolates in in this units so this is not a usual reactor that you see we have a future on the bottom which is the white one yes you can see on the bottom so that one will be filtered out CPD isolates out of the matter liquids the matter its click liquids will be drink from the bottom and CBD isolates will be remain on the future as you can see here here's the drain so once your once you got your CBD isolates by lowing the chlorine temperature you can open a vow and drain the mother liquids out of it okay let's talk about how this were filmed this laser machine work so this machine will help us to transfer our crude oil into good and clear disciplines so we just finished the first runs of of coroico usually we run the crude oil through this machine to time so this is the feeding tank right here so this machine separates different components by using the boiling temperature differences for example your view your terpene and your CBD oil all have different type of boning temperatures also there is some sugar and there's some small particle in or crude oil as well and those things doesn't boil at all so those can be separated by using this machine as well so we just finished our first runs on the floor we have two buckets the buckets on the left is the polished crude oil the buckets on the right is the the terpenes and and also some crow fields so this machine's and everything they have a lot lower boiling temperature will we both will come out and falling into the right buckets all the things that have a higher temperature or four downs to the left pockets so in the first round we set the main body temperature the main distillation body temperature into a temperature that the terpenes and curfew will keep boiling well the CBD will not boil so we have we will also catch all some of the eighth notes in the system so in here we have two Co traps the left cold trap is negative thirty Seco trap the Reiko trap is negative 83 contract and as you can see that the negative eighty contra is we can filling the dry ice or liquid nitrogen in it to treat as well so here we have a vacuum gauge and we have a vacuum pump do stage where come from one floor the first one is turbo pump second one is the normal oil thing reckon pump so the color in the right pocket is look pretty greenish and the viscosity is very high which tells us that there is the terpene for sure and we're going to dump the left pocket back to the fitting tank and do a second runs so in the second runs the we're setting the temperature so that CBD will keep boiling well the others are not well others I mean the particles and the waste will not be boiling so we can collect CBD of the machines so right now we are running this machine further where we're running the crude oil for the second times so because you can see we are feeding the crude oil in its so the mercy is is keep running and we have the the waste coming out of from the left tube and which dripping into the buckets then this halfs and on the right we have dissidents so as we can see in temperature it's not I mean the color for the distillate is not so good because it we just start running the machine we haven't we haven't fine-tuned the machine yet so I'm going to do some fine-tuning to make sure that the color looks much much better after a few changes in temperature setting for this y film distillation units the CBD colors looks looks much much better than previously I just changed temperature setting on the the center coil for this units and also a little bit of vacuum as well make it look much better this units can output about 5 liters of distillate Spri hour and I can improve it a little bit more just changed heating heaters and Childress for this unit to upgrade it into a higher capacity so that this unit can run under be faster even he can even run about a liters per hour if you have the right heaters so that would be all the information now like a share today so we talked about distillation we talked about crystallization and my client is pretty happy about what he got today and here we have the CBD distillates that we have around today this civilities looks looks in a high viscosity but because it is hot after is cooled down to room temperature it should be close to solids so if you liked this video please give us a thumbs up and think about our subscription thank you very much have a good day bye bye", "OhETkefsB3U": "okay guys just got a true leave picked up some RS oh I'm desperate to find a substitute for the xanax I'm taking so I'm hoping that this is it something for the daytime space bomb and something for the evening at that time nine pound hammer I just wanted to let you guys know I picked these up I was at the colonial store in and out in ten minutes and they had to do everything manually that's pretty good actually so I'm pretty impressed with that store so is Benjy I'm not gonna pop these open right now I'll wait till I get home and as soon as I do I'll put that video with this and I'll put it out okay I'm back home guys let's open these up let's start with the space bomb my shakiness is kind of bad that's why I'm doing this no matter what I have tried orally nothing has helped my shakiness it helps my pain but not my shakiness so this is what we're gonna try okay I hope you can get a look at that really really dark and I'm still shaky and that's why I'm getting this let's open up that was the space bond by the way and now let's open the nine pound hammer and here's the nine pound hammer it's pretty much the same really really dark I'm gonna keep these in their packages or peel off a label something so I can keep these identified you alright I'll report back after I've been using this for about a week both of them I'll try them at bedtime and during the day and hopefully this will be a replacement for my xanax stay tuned", "3V4wLZjxwY8": "what's going on you too so I made a video last night and I had some technical difficulties so be sure to hang out you can see it you guys really didn't miss too much but all you really missed is me talking about my ingredients and watching me putting it in and all that stuff but other than that you guys are good and check it out additive you're gonna add to your base very very strong you don't want to kind of make do all this and have it just you know you have to eat 10 candies to do whatever you're trying to do you want to make it worth it spend the money put the effort in and I assure you it'll be well worth it in the end so it's been about four and a half five minutes now and we are just crossing 240 degrees so I like I said this doesn't happen super fast it but once we hit around 270 degrees it will start moving a little bit a little bit faster so when you're flavoring with this recipe you want to use one of these kind of bottles you can get them at a Seymour Michaels any arts of crest or you can get them at Walmart when I went to Walmart they only have peppermint cinnamon and that's not my thing but right here I have cherry and I have an orange oil that I like to add so usually if you're going to say if you're going for lollipops or like life savers or anything like that flavor to get that exact flavor like they come out like it comes out of their factory you want it for this recipe when you use a half of one of these bottles and a half of orange oil bottle and it'll taste just like you bought some lifesavers what the orange oil does adds a little citrus and it just gives a little brightness to it but you don't need that I did a batch with just watermelon and you know I loved them they tasted great it wasn't super watermelon flavored and to be quite honest with you I hate the flavor of water now so these these oils then they they taste great but I know you're probably wondering why you don't add it now so you have it all incorporated it's all said and done well this is a different kind of liquid than what we got going on here obviously so if you added this to a 320 degree sugar base and this will probably burn out see they want you to wait till 250 degrees to add your additives if your flavoring but I feel like that is just way too late of a weight I like to do at almost 275 degrees you're gonna deal a little more heat when you gives you a little bit more time because once you add this stuff this is going to cool down drastically and fast so and one thing you don't want to do with this is mix it around a bunch because if you think if you live in New Jersey you walk along the boardwalk what do they make in salt water taffy so you keep stretching the sugar adding air adding air what's it gonna turn into a taffy it's not going to be as much of a hard candy it's gonna keep out again it's gonna it could turn into a candy corn which is honestly not a bad texture in itself either but it just now we're done for right now well what I like about doing these little candies and gummies and stuff like that is these molds there's so many damn cool molds that you can pick up like a robot dude here it got lollipops dinosaurs and it's like pixelated dinosaurs are pretty cool I seen Super Mario Batman ones like Legos you can actually take the Lego ones and build with them so there's like really cool stuff you could be doing with candy and if you get really good at it you know pull your kids aside and you can do a day with the kids and show them how to make the favorite candies and kids blown away that you can actually make this yourself it'll definitely be way more impressed with this than a batch of cookies that Pillsbury makes just don't have any funny business to it so we're crossing about nine minutes now it's a nine 10 minutes and we are hitting 250 degrees so in about four minutes we only went about ten degrees so once we're all mixed up and our basis set we add our additives we add our flavoring the name of the game is speed and just I don't want to say steady hand because if if you know me I am the last guy to ever have a steady hand you can people will hand me a 2 ounce ladle got a 2 ounce souffle cup and say fill up some butters just the laughs at me because I shake but for some reason I can do this pretty well but you want to almost come down and just go in a line 1 1 1 1 1 if you're just all over the place you're going to lose quite a bit of what you're doing here and nobody wants that but I would say 1 to 2 ounces for this batch usually I do a 2 cup of sugar 1 cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water and so I'll do it it's basically a double batch of this that I would do 2 to 4 ounces but this I think 1 1 2 2 maybe 2.5 ounces will be good all right it's been about 4 4 minutes later and we are just hitting 290 degrees so I'll check back up at the end a couple of minutes all right it's about 3 minutes later and now we just hit hard crack we're at 300 degrees so most people will want to go to 310 but we're going to 320 so I'll check back when we get there well it's about 30 seconds later we're at 310 so we're almost there so get ready all right so we hit 320 degrees so now what we're gonna do is so now this is a so now this is a hard Canyon and it's going to be very hard it's not going to be questionably hard and it's not going to be and it's not gonna lose its hardness from what we had so now we wait until about 270 degrees and we're gonna add about one to two ounces of whatever additive you're gonna add and your flavor so we'll check back in about five minutes when we get there so what I like to use to make my my tinctures or if whatever I'm going to make the most is I'd like to use either a leave o or a magical butter machine the the two of them it's it's perfect the you can perfectly adjust the temperatures and you could really make it long and really strong or you can make it really fast and get you get it done fast so if you're looking for a way to do it without having to you know use mason jars and stuff like that look into buying a leave out or a magical butter machine those two things makes the process so much easier and not just easier but it makes it stronger and enough of talking we're there so now that we're at 270 degrees we got to move fast so speed and accuracy is the name of the game now do not let any sugar touch you so first get all your stuff ready because you're gonna add at one shot so I'm gonna add my flavoring to my additive half I want of the cherry I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do half of the orange oil now people like to do food coloring and all that you don't have to I don't like it because I just don't like the I like the natural color that you get so this part you don't mix too much the more air you're gonna add the worse off it's gonna look so you got to be fast go okay so we're all mixed up don't know what to do let's go and then we pour accuracy now look guys I have super shaky hands and I'm go it's all about accuracy if you tried to reheat this it would still work but it's not gonna be as clear its goal is is clarity and just like I said if you reheat it you're gonna be mixing it again so you're going to add more air the more air you add the different the texture is gonna get try some of these but a nice steady pour and you could if and when we look you're going to tell that we didn't even have that much waste so this a little bit I got here and the rest I got here I can reheat and I can make other candies so what we'll do now is we're gonna is we'll wait and I'll give it about it don't take long about three minutes five minutes and these things will be rock-hard and check them out so check back in a minute all right everybody we're all done so let's take a look at what we got just like that all you gotta do is pop them out and move and look these things they're rock-hard they don't stick together nothing and you're really that worried you can get some powdered sugar and you're good look at that perfect so I got these little robot guys so many cool things you could do and I got these little dinosaurs so what I like to do is I like to have little ones and I like to have full-size ones because a lot of ones honestly where you're gonna find yourself like in these little small ones the best at least the parquet knees but like I said guys super easy super fast and anybody can do this you've got to get yourself two simple ingredients throw it all together and you're home free you can take these out in the lake with you and your fish and boom you're good

are my mango suffer ladies", "bwbZTN4fMGM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "eTb7xVO_FE0": "what's going on it's Little Miss cannabis and this is my part two video on how to use the pure distillate in the syringe form so earlier I told you how to warm it up to loosen up the consistency so it was easier to use so when it's in that state the best thing to do is if you want to eat it on a cookie just put a little rice grain piece on there and directly eat it that way and if that's not enough you can always up the dose and make your little amount on there bigger another great way to use it when it's heated up in the syringe is you can directly put it into say like a cup of hot tea or warm coffee and that's a great way to use it as well so another way you can use it at is you can vaporize it so if you have a vaporizer that looks like this this is a barbed coil vaporizer you see right in there there's a coil in there and that's what you're going to want to put the actual you know little des of medicine right in there and that coil is going to burn it pretty hot and you're going to be able to be braise it in that way now the best way to use the distillate is a way called dabbing and that's something that they are not allowed to talk to you about at the dispensaries so that's why I'm gonna do this video and show you exactly how to dab it so there's different devices you can use to dab this right here is called a dab straw so what you need to do is use a little torch and heat up the end of it you're gonna want to get it nice and hot it's going to turn a little bit once it does and you can see mine is a little bit you're gonna want to bring that parchment paper out of the freezer put it right on there and go ahead and take an inhale now this is gonna go way down in so you can tell it is definitely a deep hit for sure but this is gonna affect you really really well so another way to dab excuse me is to use add a brick so this is gonna be probably the most beneficial way to use it so what the daybreak looks like is this right here you heat this piece up right here until that gets red you put this piece on and then what you're going to do is have your little piece of distill it on here put it down in hit it that way and then feel it go away down in and then the party begins I have a good one see y'all later", "fh2XI6a29mU": "[Music] welcome back to five years now our video collection about 5g new radio 5g supports non standalone and standalone based architectures in an earlier video we have discussed two non standalone load this time the focus is on the excess procedure for the standalone load denilla one of the authors of our 5g book can tell us more about this access procedure yes indeed the standalone mode is one of the main deployment scenario for an hour radio how does he work the first thing why is a new scenario the new scenario involves the UE connected to their a G naught B which is was already in the non standalone case but the UE connect to G naught B now we have a new element the G no B is connected to the 5g core so a new core network behind the diginity in non standalone scenario there was still the EPC so now we have a new combination of components in this standalone scenario how the initial access works the first thing is the you he has to search for the Dowling synchronization signal this was a non standalone a easy task because the non stand-alone case then identity was able to configure exactly where the frequency was of these synchronization SS Block in the stable on scenario where we find now the UE is to search over the band with the channel Rasta identify the position of the synchronization signal the second step is to acquire the mill which it was already in their non send alone but the third test step is a very important step of a stand-alone case where you receive the SIP one in the sip one is a new message that we simulate with our cmx setup and this a new message because therein the nonce in the lone case the SIP one was are coded over LT in the standalone case the SIP one is broadcasted from the G note B and UE nice - really the code the control and the data downlink channel the first step is then the random access the random access in standalone is a contention based on random access we saw already in the nonce in the lone case a contention free random access in the con in the standalone case the UE has to select exactly how to transmit the first message in applying the preamble and in which occasion in the uplink is supposed to transmit so this is a little bit change from the non send alone case to the standalone case next step after random access is the RC connection setup and the very last step the last step is there not signalling the connection through a 5g core here again since we have a new module in our deployment with the 5g core we have a newness singly and in our CX scenario setup we can see that we can simulate a nationally protocol and the Yui is able to connect to the 5g core and even select SM network slicing which is a new feature in the 5g core network all this procedure is explained in a very well detail in our book with a lot of reference of the 3gpp specification exactly there's so much more to tell about this topic you can find more details of the standalone mode and other 5g topics in our online book see you later and don't forget 5g is now [Music]", "XBhLBtoKSbQ": "well it's going on you guys house wrong here it's just about 6:20 I took

with Angela who you have a really interesting story kind of makes me think of my story which we'll get to later but you have been using cannabis to treat treat an illness and it's working for you yes my name is Angela Valdes and I am a longtime business owner here in Portland my husband and I started a tea shop and now a tea company back in 2003 so I've been working with chronic illness my entire adult life I was diagnosed with lupus when I was 18 out of high school and I lived with it for 18 years the first man just saw my audience because many some might not know what lupus is lupus is well they told us at first it was basically like the body attacking itself and now they're finding out there's a lot more science that they don't understand and so we went from in 97 me having a diagnosis of you're never going to live to be 30 you're never going to get married and you're never having children and you need to come to terms with this now too telling my doctors I'm cured they didn't know what caused it we think maybe some neurological issues genetically have been a result of my body reacting that way but I had migraines from the time I was eight very bad physical pain my entire life and I've been on a lot of Western medicines so I'm a patient who has been an American that's trusted every system I've been put into wholeheartedly taking the pills done my homework as far as exercising and eating and it still wasn't enough so after nine years of Western medicine I was in remission and I asked my doctors if I could go off of all of the medications and they agreed and I turned to cannabis and from there I had a couple babies and had to stop taking cannabis during those times and my migraines and the lupus was so bad that it blocked my vision and my hearing so there was a couple months I was breastfeeding and having a toddler and I had my husband taking care of our tea shops and our tea company and I couldn't see or hear so it was it's something where I've come from the depths of despair when it comes to chronic pain and have fought for my life for it and cannabis is one of the biggest things that's helped me and tell me in terms of cannabis cuz there's I'm learning now there's just like a lot of different kinds and that kind of do different things if you want sleep if you want relief from pain these kinds of things how specifically has it helped you I know you're not a scientist but you know you have migraines and other things with lupus what is it done for you specifically to alleviate those well one of the things that I did is I just started smoking it because that's what people did back in 2006 seven eight there wasn't a lot of information about the Rick Simpson oil and so I tried that and noticed immediate pain relief a lot of it was the nerve pain and the jolting and the extreme swollen joints I was having would go away from smoking with like a water pipe so I got my medical card my medical marijuana card here and I started working with my grower to grow strains that were specific for my headaches and for the problems I was having with my lupus symptoms what is a grower for those who aren't from here well medical grower is someone who specializes in growing cannabis so what they do is they really focus on the plant to make sure that the right chemical constituents come out of the plant so the person who is consuming it either in vaporizing eating as an edible if it's baked or in a in a raw form they'll be getting the most cannabinoids and other types of things that come out of the plant I actually went from smoking to vaporizing I tried vape pens for a while I've used the Simpson oil and found a lot of it's not called the Simpson oil but I've found a lot of relief from that on a daily basis a tiny amount of that and I ingested I have no side effects I do receive some side effects if I eat edibles so I've been very cautious to warn people that you really need to understand your body's limitations and don't put yourself in a situation you'll feel uncomfortable because I was terrified to try cannabis I grew up as a conservative Republican I went to plan I went to college at a private Christian College I was told cannabis now you're living in Portland yeah I was told to fear cannabis it was illegal don't ever do it and so it took a lot for me to be someone to try it and I am someone that can say I I wish I could have told my dad sooner about it because he had epilepsy from the time he was 18 and he died two years ago having a seizure in a sleep and he knew I was taking cannabis and was finding a lot of results in my pain relief but he was still too scared to try it because he was a conservative who really believed that if it says it's illegal federally we should follow the law and I think that is a reason that he's not alive today because he was trying to be such a patriot he was someone who wanted to serve in our military and never got a chance because he had epilepsy so he was someone who was a true American patriot as far as they could be in their heart and he believed the system was right and so that's why he chose not to follow it it's that social stigma that his may have led to him never trying and I want to stand up and make sure no one else is afraid of it and that's why I feel like the social stigma has to come down and Bernie Sanders has been speaking out against it and that's that's why I'm voting for him for sure and uh did your father did your father try Western medicine for epilepsy and get any relief in his lifetime no he had many seizures almost daily um he had a lot of grand mal seizures I did not realize growing up in the next room how horrifying epilepsy is for people who have it but he was literally having the fight of his life every time he had a seizure and I didn't understand that growing up his brain would take quite a few minutes for him to reset and it was extremely jarring so imagine being in a public place and having a seizure you know so he tried everything they told him to take and he dealt with many bad side effects his gums were destroyed his teeth were destroyed because of die Latin and different medications they put him on he would go through some really bad seizure episodes in trying to change medications to find a better fit because it would stop working and the whole time I'm taking cannabis and having great results and starting to thrive and he was overworked and tired and he fell asleep face down and couldn't couldn't survive the seizure so it's one of those things where I'm gonna speak out now as much as I can because there could be another David out there that's terrified to try it and he's maybe his granddaughter maybe his daughter has been smoking weed and he's thought well she's not hurting her but I would never try it I hope they will think about I hope they'll consider it because I don't think my dad would have died if he knew that it would him and I believe now it would have saved him for sure I think it would have stopped seizures for sure I think something that struck me is just you saying the word weed even though I've partaken many it many a times Society has even made the term weed sound negative and criminalized and these kinds of things an older school you know we know older school people older people in politics whether it's the cannabis issue or anything else are more traditional and close minded to new things particularly if they see it's really a lot of young people kind of leading the charge so for you you said you're going to do as much as you can how do you kind of get your message which a lot of people will connect when it's about a human and it's a human interest kind of thing how do we get that to more places because for every time you say a story you know a chris Christie and all these know-it-all non-scientists politicians will tell you why you know you're the exception it creates industry it creates jobs it creates uh money revenue look at California look at Colorado what yeah well money they soon let me just stop you right there he you say it's gonna come down the road you know when it may come down the road when I'm gone it's not gonna come off here I think it takes a special kind of courage that I myself am in the process of trying to cultivate even at this moment because I've been keeping a collection of all my journals from all of my years of pain I've seen myself go through many different mindsets from fear to acceptance to rage to understanding and it's something that is consistently fluid in everybody's lives and I think that if we can be more accepting of the fact that when people are in pain it's not what we see in a snapshot is not what they're really experiencing all the time we could see the moment of relief and believe they're fine we could see their worst moment and think that it's always going to be that way and you know what my dad taught me with with his epileptic seizures is he would have a seizure and he would still be smiling and trying to cheer us up even though he couldn't remember his name at the moment and that kind of dedication to his own Drive inner drive to survive is definitely some Carrie and myself and so I would love to just shout from the rooftops anywhere into anyone guess what I'm cured because the truth is is that I am cured and I've been shocked my doctors are shocked my dentist is shocked we're just we can't believe I haven't I have a healthy white t-cell count I have healthy antibodies I'm I am so healthy that I've never been this healthy and it's it's amazing to me I'm willing to be someone to be studied or to offer information up to others I just don't know what how to do that do you know what I mean and it does take courage because I've had people say just write a book just tell everyone your story and it's not that simple I mean I think I could tell someone my story but for me to type it myself just takes a lot of courage and the more that people accept that others are using cannabis and finding finding relief the easier it gets everyday for me to speak up a little more to because I don't want to come across to Chris Christie and have to say well how am i cured like explain this to me and have have him say well I'm not accepting that you must have done something behind the scenes must have done what to be cured of lupus the one thing that people say was impossible to be cured of I mean I'm 37 I have two children I have a wonderful tea company a wonderful husband I beat every single thing that my first doctor told me I would not survive and I refuse to accept that other people are going to have to live a life of pain that if we go back if we have someone like Hillary Clinton come into presidency and she says I just don't believe it let the state's decide I'm I think that it's going to get harder for me to keep my mouth shut because I can't keep living this life and crossing things off my bucket list being cured and know that other people in chronic pain are sitting by and in Portland next door down the street and they can't get the same kind of care because they're not speaking out like AM or because their hair color is darker and so they're stigmatizing or like ostracized from the opportunity to get care it's infuriating as a patient and as a human and I as the supporter of Bernie Sanders who stood up for the for humans in every form in every color by voting for the Affordable Care Act by supporting some who pay our health care by understanding that cannabis is not something to be feared to men Americans have seen their lives destroyed because they have criminal records as a result of marijuana use that is wrong that has got to change we need our doctors to stop being worried about being sent to jail or being charged with something because they're helping patients who are looking into a very healthy I would say very miraculous plant that we have been hiding from the world and we need to start accepting it the amount of happiness quotient would go up in this country would be unbelievable if people could live to their potential instead of living it what I would say was like a fraction of the life there they're actually wanting to put out there does that make sense yeah and from a human level I just want to know because I actually have I don't I don't have lupus that I know of but I've had some issues with energy and fatigue and sleep for many years it sounds to me like you kind of had a rebirth I mean you're a woman in her late 20s maybe early 30s were really this was stopping you from having children so you were kind of living in a quasi you know prison you couldn't do all the things that naturally a woman would want to do or a man if he wants to have a family how is your energy now how is your stamina with two children are you able to do more active things just because not only your symptoms have been relieved but are you able to now do more than you used to be able to do yeah well when I was diagnosed with lupus I was 18 I was studying I was training to be a cheerleader in college so I was working my body very hard and I wasn't eating properly I ate a lot of candy bars for snacks I didn't really take care of myself like I should have and I also really didn't have medical and like I guess medical advice to help me gain weight I was always just it was like oh he's she's skinny it's okay she's fine it was never like Angela how many calories are you eating a day let's work on this you should have at least 10 pounds more there so it was kind of something that was just ignored and when I got really sick they just kind of just thought oh she's whittling away you know and there's nothing we can do it changed my relationships with everyone which changed my energy level I couldn't cheer I was supposed to do low-impact things from then on which is very different from going from a life of dancing for four hours a day and suddenly not you know being told to lightly swim because you could average aggravate symptoms and the swollen joints was so bad that I couldn't drive sometimes it couldn't move my wrists or my my shoulders and so it was very debilitating for me I managed to have a pretty good life through it in college fighting in a rebellious way I was raised to follow the rules I was raised as a conservative Christian I went to a private Christian College majoring in political science and broadcasting I went to an internship in Washington DC with the Leadership Institute it was with a conservative nonprofit and I worked in the print media center training politicians how to stay on talking points so I but I can't stand talking books myself I immersed myself in my belief system in the political belief system I was raised I believed every bit of it one voice one vote I believed it and so I carried that moral core with me but when I got to DC we were going to war in Iraq and I saw a few things while I was there that just just shredded me as a person I couldn't understand how we could be hurting another country and it didn't feel like we were liberating Iraq it looked like we were conquering them and it felt like that to me from what I was hearing and the way that we were all responding is a bunch of conservatives so when I came back from poor back to Portland my husband asked me if I wanted to open up a tea shop with him instead and do something different with my life so I blocked out media and politics altogether I came to Portland and after a few years of being here started meeting the most incredible people and what it was is I lived a very sheltered life and didn't meet people outside of that particular lifestyle and because of it I didn't know there was more than there was more to it than that and so when I came back I blacked everything out I ended up becoming a Democrat later on I realized that I really stood up for environmental issues I was very angry in DC when I when they were talking about environmental issues and I noticed that inside was like this bubbling surface why are we not carrying because the Bible tells me we're supposed to be stewards of the land so I mean I had all these little core beliefs that we're pulling out of my conservative values that just weren't meeting the need wasn't met when it came to the platform for the conservative and Republican Party and so I ended up deciding that what was best for me was to just give love out to the world so I focused on tea I made tea for every four people every day seriously cups of tea working my tail off through the physical chronic pain and they a lot of those people introduced me to cannabis here in Oregon and that's how I found out about it I would say that the biggest thing that changed my life and the core values I had was being in DC it was like being in a crucible 24 hours a day 7 days a week of Fox News circa 2000 sorry sorry I'm sorry but I worked there for five minutes so oh man it changes you to your core and I mean I came back and my family did not understand no one understood why I wasn't saying I'm not a Christian now I'm not a conservative I'm not a Republican I don't know what I am but I still believe everyone matters and I don't know why the political party I'm a part of doesn't seem to understand that so I chose to continue that path and that path led me on a very healthy path because I was no longer afraid to talk to people who were talking about cannabis I was actually talking with people who are very different for me I learned a lot from people who were bisexual and lesbian and homosexual that I had no idea and I had a cousin who was homosexual so there was you know some things you talk about in these communities but most of the time you don't accept people you just glaze over the subject and just say well that's them and I became a person that wanted to be transparent I didn't want to glaze over anything anymore I see people I see them for the color of their skin and I see what their struggles are and I'm tired of ignoring them I'm tired of them being stomped on and having standing next to someone and knowing that the a cop could walk by and choose to target my friend because she's Hispanic and I'm the one with the medical card and the joint in my pocket that kind of stigma just has to fall and the only way it's going to fall is if people like me stand up and I know it takes a lot more courage than I've been giving out because I've done things like volunteering for Bernie 2016 TV it's a group of volunteers who support Bernie Sanders I've done things like working in groups behind the scenes for delegates for Bernie Sanders and on the National Arena and also with the Oregon delegates because I want people to know that we are very productive cannabis patients are very productive in fact more people are cannabis patients than others realize and the reason we don't say anything is because we don't want the chris Christie's to start running their mouths over someone they don't understand you know well two things I think a your father would be very proud and be I think people in DC sitting in cubicles or in Capitol Hill slowly having their souls die are going to really like your message so I appreciate you talking to us thank you very much it's nice to meet you", "v5CTzVpxblk": "hey guys no way we're just running a little light to that song just bear with me guys okay what we're going to go through today is we're going to go through down our filtration so we're going to show you how to make a shout out a definitely product and a product you can make the effect it's okay so we're going to do three different grades through filtration again with this I'm using the pronoun to need a fuse with the parsley you can use dry us so these guys here they're half-gallon units and I don't know what's name is still again the status still tubes it does come with the weed which would we're going to discontinue and on one of these parts will go with it with the grass shooter but anyway there we have sorry there are double warm unit we're going to fill these halfway and just so we can get some sort of white bearing yep of the plant picture so I'm gonna actually put eight ounces of dry white material here mr. phone doesn't work that - eh - for the little boy I think actually sorry little list so I'll anyway it's going to be one cup we're gonna completely hear us just so we can keep an average on what we're doing the DL home usage in the plant material the material that I've ground up is it's very fine fine and we've used everything from as you can see here guys I've missed out on nothing so you're going to see a lot of stem everything routes everything lead families get one cup okay so we go luckily here you can see the powder that okay we got one cup now how much we're tooled up he's probably this area here for one cup so right that's a second cup okay that's the plan for trail 10 like I said that is up well they need to stem everything I have not missed out on anything everything is fine okay what I've been doing is I've been cooling down the alcohol with liquid nitrogen because alcohol again freezes at 172 so I've got the alcohol frozen then you know you're around the minus 150 seats inside that area or around that person we're gonna be pouring a little bit of this yeah this one again so what I'm doing something I'm bringing down the temperature planta - so when I can the alcohol with the plant material so I'm not going to release and undo the chloroform are we locking up just about everything in the planet just releasing the resin what you can do you can do this without your bridges you get a cryogenic fridge or you can do this with just your normal box freezer do is get some dry ice divide the preaches into segments where you can what I'm just about to show you can do these in each segments without disturbing the other require so nothing about your eyes preferably cryogenic freezers - 85 I'll let that sit for a couple of minutes five minutes or so to bring it down to temp and then we'll therefore what we're going to do is is those two units we're going to make sure we break it up because the liquid nitrogen is in there and if there is any moisture in the planet so it's going to stiffen it up so you've gotta break it up so you can freely have the alcohol interactive advantage oh okay that's why the smallest of the particle you get the faster the more interaction we'll have with the alcohol and that's what you want especially in cold temperatures because it takes such a long time for the alcohol at those cold-turkey to interact with people okay I'm going to be showing you we're just using get old coffee filters doing is we're gonna have three different models coming from this extraction so the first extraction we're going to do is from those two containers we're going to be pouring through one of these okay it's going to be your first one first pour and when I have my alcohol with that plant until i sterling fairly quickly little bit of vegetation and we didn't that 60 seconds I will poured straight through the filtration River and there we go so another thing to our I'll explain to it's about in about filtration so when you're saying in the filtration you don't want to go straight into eg a copy basically what you're doing is are walking out the filters and you're taking something so much more time to filtrate that let's say you're training out those lipids fats and waxes and what might be the root the particles pitching my god so you want to do it through something like like this year this that uses to clean water and the alcohol one's really pretty through this but it picks up much of a bigger cut out I have now then once you've got rid of that plant not out of it I'm looking at some of the other particulars because it's sort of called Dan you can line up to you call me and it's gonna save you so much time the alcohol running through this couple filled up will be flat - quick because you've taken most of it through this filtration so and the reason you do that - because the quickly running on all through it in temperatures the less bleed through you can get unless bleed through can change color and get that in and out and you can start your distillation or or something able to shatter to evaporation a little ball the way it's good to be and the most important thing it's always spend a little extra time in making sure that your alcohol he's down to ten to one of the ten thirties and make sure you plant mature is it the same sanction as the alcohol and the UH products that you use to to mix everything like you another thing the least amount of air coming in contact with the water natural process right now checking the planet Oh here it sounds very crunchy so you know there is now putting a little more in the alcohol so I'll let that alcohol crystallize out top and I know you've got intense the alcohol busy here so we can see here that the alcohol speaking up there we have it - taking the temperature down on the alcohol alcohol into one suppose you want to know how much alcohol the guys for it so we're going to show you okay I'm going to be pouring one feet up off of the time it's hoppy website caused by the chances every kid I'm doing quickly know when you're not even three dollars I wouldn't know we do it like this always you want the first poll you can leave it in there for one minute maybe then 15 minutes half an hour to do temperatures all right you can leave it there for Lisa helping out without that core stability experiment so I have to I'm going to 5 minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes and find out where you think you old fuel your best plan these four you'll the old plant material and the style about expression you doing okay so now we're going to get don't forget I'm doing this in and out of the environment normally if you have a cryogenic reach you wouldn't be doing this everything will be all employers and you've got to know I'm doing so I can do this fairly quick so if you don't get to see it this we wanted it's pretty much self-explanatory so yeah shorten filter oh so we have the alcohol run through pretty quickly again with the French compress basically when we push down the plunger it's taken out most of the deadly to admitting exceeds and the longer you do sit through duration or the clients will sit as well by pushing the budget down pouring this down my skull the color coming out I hope you are and what I'm gonna do so here we go pulling down the alcohol grab your coffee pots so now we're doing our second run first pull that was the first one first ball which is going to be predominately up you know you took beans the flash off really quickly and you know the Warsaw you could think about doing these plots as long as you can - it hurted at the opportunity we're going to let that sit for a couple of more minutes and we're going to do an export in a separate unit so yeah and then we're going to filter it through different filtrations and then you're going to see the variance between the colors of the first run stick around Thoreau and what have a look at where we come up with and then again letting you nurture the inverse three different runs is going to be different percentages of the THC in each of all and different chirping curve balls well multiples of a different profile will come through more in the first and in some of the I mean more than the third we need depending on the on the style of tips that are in the package though anyway that's for your experiment and that we need to work out what dandy history board about all these experiments so we can all share the information and give it another middle sir getting back to the preach so yeah what'd you do get your bridges you can buy a second-hand box which if you want sir that's the hard way better so yeah you've got to make more footage you can divided into four units with again you're not going to get smaller tips because you're going to need to draw us in this whole fridge probably minus 10 good night it's better than nothing if you want to go to quite get it okay try Jenny's can start again about four and a half to five delt for a 17 cubic in cubic foot and up to 25 foot and you can get them all the way up to the - a DS that just breezes in stand-ups and it just you know when you using the system like this with the coffee pots you can you can my daughter we can put 50 litres you know fifty of those canisters in the fridge and you can do you can fill up as quickly is quickly arrived so and we just like that you've got salt and donors double wool same school principal interest yeah you're not going to expose it to the air no oxidization the coracle on duty the DC side you know I stretched out some of those runs well pumps were maybe seven runs in about 1215 pools to those rocks off he plated everything out of it without even being exposed can be done okay and that's when you do get everything back so if there's 18 percent like if you measure the plant material about 18 percent and in what I'm going to do is the first one I'm going to be doing that through a she's going to be the center up I'm just going to call and we got pouring it through Oh God and alcohol again we're holding it down was all these guys walk this is just coming from so we have to put more interaction with that virtue and the alcohol took up the dome dude over there and you can just go straight this goes with Lepidus government meets you can do this thing is an absolute alcohol to show you guys okay so the first one I took down okay you can see the planet chillin here okay there you go well the chlorophyll is caught and locked up okay head come through beautiful gold material your see a bit of a dragon tail in it and that's because you've got some fliers coming through very fine so what we're gonna do is we're going to freeze this again right start what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna grab one I'm gonna quit many times you want to go just helps the alcohol slick without a jar you know sorry and just kind of put some students up a minute and now with the spending focus on here we're going to be putting that in there this is like a possibly towards action you'll be doing a senior three to ESP what I do now so quite literally dark twice a week you still want to breathe Oh very tall so what we're doing now through that process we're now gone from one filtration which knocks most of the bigger bigger particles which I'll show you we can see those bigger particles that we took out now that's right little white because what you can do is you can keep these filters and they be doing your interval I saw the previous bill doesn't put that material into our cell because there's a lot of immature left in here and you can tell that why like this even nicer it's a bit powdery it's gonna go but we can tighten up to that all the material so you know disagree direct rebels don't win sir and a host we're going check out the other one now okay let's go what I'd like to do is it's all about it's all about getting the system to flex we're very very appreciative even later because it's all moving as quickly as I want on you see is all the second run to a school on its first filtration there we have it this is the second run I'm trying to there's no ever so slightly it's not important and you see the clock was going to pull back - and there is a little bit of alcohol wipes that you don't have to waste the alcohol you can see that in another pot let it let it run out and then alcohol just add that to your there we have it it's right through much prickly writer there we have it clean that this one again always use new new filters all the time you're going to be pouring anything that you've done with filtration it make sure it's clean because a lot of abuse mistake people who they they use the cotton coffee filters but they do it in the environment where someone's pruning or mulching down there to do the next Buster's in the air that passes just got back in here so why are you using coffee filters to filter out all the fires wing to the air so do it in another room obviously to be coming up in a clean room Pandora yeah pleats it you don't have to places but you can't help there do other that you can see this guy's this is hello I show you I stayed in that hold it there now now we're going to do a third row first pool and then then we'll just have a look at the different colleges between all three and then again throughout the week I'll win to bend down and then bring the oil to the lab next week and then what we'll do is we'll test all three and then find out where they come and the first one fight between them to a show so we get to see the difference in the percentage of THC to that officer we're really not going to do the only compression I'm going to do on this next one is I'm just going to be doing the shortening filter I'm not going to be able to enjoy patient J discussing different percentage at GHC coming through this is more plant material left to get sick less plant material more tears okay they just imagine when you got 13 you're doing 50 of these in the fridge so you can just imagine how much maturity actually does with Hitler spinning what 160 thousand [ __ ] dollars on a co2 the [ __ ] it's crazy you could you could you could set yourself up pretty big for one tennis balls 50 50 times another these units my five units up twenty liters takes 24 hours or a complete turn results and really the 20 leads to basically between 18 minutes well 18 ladies are in about five pounds some way here though so just imagine I look 25 keep twisting rich well throw like technique we went and that's just working out so that we take me so much better than co2 much more probable beginning you're out lace them up so it expired and you return the bed here we go that's not with you there we go Punky's check down a little bit she's my sister today we have that the temperature India is going to be at least killing the alcohol ways how high these super shook I reckon were to really be able to the 1 145 150 months anyway reddit or myself will bring something positive - the city poster world forget about the whole industry play what'd he say he thinks queen is so important because you don't want to reach antimonite something that works so hard to play equalization of temperatures and for going to the next one there's some good to pick up parts of the planet coming through this one some of the heavier pops coming through on the planet make sure your temperature is okay so we've done now three months in the first one the first one we use half a liter of alcohol by month we had two cups in two units so what we're doing is we're pouring our alpha leader in each of those Spanish build French colonies presses and then agitate it that's the first rock first pour let it sit in there for at least 60 seconds and then we take them out in the pouring into a new filter or a filter that allows the alcohol okay the next one which is the second month with wool including port aliza someone neither have we pulled that out for shortening filter again and as I'm doing that I'm cleaning the other one is finished I put that through so you can see this a sort of a system that if you work out the system every time that you're doing one part you can do another possibly not to preach and just working on one sit yourself up we need to do multiple run so that's why it's good to keep notepad board where you've got your history notes on there for that that entire row and then you just want it again on temperature how it's reacting color like last week I showed you how to do another gram count how much saturated I think we had about 200 milligrams just you can work at that equation with how much these in every go and then you would have to be 50 government up north in your notes or every quarter per gallon you had my nose what else here so we went so we go through one two three ones for single pool hall and on the third one we're just going tomorrow through that through that shorty filter that's the last bite people this is the one that we're not gonna winterize just going to keep just running through the short legs over here the first one we definitely gonna change to share so we're probably gonna go through to the Torah session a few other techniques sick and what I'm going to only utilize it wants alcohol in here and it's up to you this is what I do just for this one I'm actually going before it alcohol into these guys and I'm going to be late at sea for a period of time and that can be as long as you want two hours 24 hours to pour out whatever I'm just going to be having the alcohol sitting here and sitting every now and again I'll welcome welcome start up on that accentuate everything and remove everything and then you can either turn these into the topical again that's kind it's a filtration long as you kept your temperature spot so what was that dirt is we're going to call this alcohol so what I'd like to say what I do now is I'll just push everything down and let that sit for as long as she walked you stood that you know give reality every two hours see a little difference in colors here advice now you first got your centerr definitely long not always like that here and that's basically it guys it's just showing you that filtration dictates on the strength of your product are you using carbon paper filters filters that people tell you no like that or 0:45 we the pressure up which large amounts of alcohol and you know and a -100 through some beautiful treasure to the low surface area at minus 45 and you can get a crystal crystal clay Thompson right yes I know filters what made you put Stalin that's about it a short one today I have to help out with with drawing cannabis through the alcohol the technique that that'd be coming out is going to be do they see up into that City Council that's better any question guys to help out a little bit but keep the temperatures high alcohol fine food people talking about you 23 if you're not doing it in that closed environment or our backyard you know rocket using the 203 and then on back an area way to keep after the bond we justify it's worse than you want but if you don't mind Western mind you want to do our first run we'd be 200 very quickly to my jokes very royal but did he get anywhere reaches very lovely reliable free Jaffa theoretical the old abrasions better than the newer newer versions coming out of the new competition so the footprint is much smaller anyway so the old legit what else filtration and that's basically it and have you rented that doubt for the week all up to 96% of ER anyway so that's it I really hope I helped up just before I do on that cooking show yes first second litter so the colors it seems to be getting adopted down there but anyway I'll wear the beads down and again bringing the next week and I will be in three different parts so we can break them down really quickly and then get a mission next door again like I said to you I'm going to go to this totally another three times in a roundabout a - sporting environment and believe in walk out what if it's affecting the path and this month like I said to you this will let me get the one filtration and this one here I'm going to be doing there we go so I pulled that walk down it's all old content but anyway thank you very much an honor to enjoy this and uh happy distilling and that's it any questions about that extracting cannabis just already my little Tex or whatever okay please do something still the best that a lot anybody know worry about just stopped", "5Kca8fSgt1s": "[Music] welcome to the teoco podcast where we discuss the intersection of telecom technology and innovation today we will be speaking with nishita hattie product director at tyoko about the fascinating topic of dynamic spectrum sharing so welcome nishida and thank you for joining us today hello baba thank you for having me so can you please share with our listeners just a little bit about yourself and your role at chilco so i'm responsible for teoco's network planning suite of products called the asset fleet the asset suite includes solutions for radio network planning by call planning automatic cell parameter placement amongst others and one of my key responsibilities as the product director of the asset suite is to add new technologies and new features into this week in order to help network operators efficiently design and roll out their wireless networks so dynamic spectrum sharing something we call dss uh it's a way for operators to transition their networks from 4g to 5g and this really seems to be a bit of a hot topic right now in the wireless industry um can you tell us a little bit more about what dss sharing with dynamic spectrum sharing is and why there's such a seems to be such a hot topic lately yes it is definitely a hot topic at the moment um dfs or dynamic spectrum sharing is a great way for an operator to boost their 5g coverage and accelerate the speed to market for 5g it's also a great way of testing out the voters so for the operators to understand what services work well with their subscribers one of the key advantages of dss is that you can deploy 5g on the same spectrum using the same infrastructure as 4g and this is a number of benefits for the network operator especially in the early stages of a new technology rollout where the number of users is fairly low one of the main advantages is coverage footprint they can extend their 5g coverage footprint the 4g technologies use six figureheads bands so their coverage footprint is much greater than some of the frequencies used by 5g in the millimeter wave [Music] space uh cost is another advantage of dss it allows operators to deploy 5g at a lower cost because they don't need to procure additional spectrum they don't need to set up new sites and also because they don't need to invest time in setting up an insight it's quicker to market your time is the third advantage of css if you think dss to do it will not fight you this seems like uh almost too good to be true is this something that uh that's right for every operator out there and and how does it actually work it depends on the operator's individual scenarios there are a number of factors to consider uh the availability of spectrum is one of the operator's 5g strategy is another for operators who are waiting for additional spectrum allocation to be available this is an excellent way to roll out 5g while they wait for the spectrum for operators who have spectrum available already but the spectrum is in the millimeter wave band dss is again an excellent way of increasing the coverage footprint because a 4g is at low frequencies and hence it has a wider coverage footprint dss is not a good way of rolling out 5g um if an operator already has a sufficient spectrum available in the load to make that so if it's um it seems to solve some problems around this area spectrum but are there is there any special software or hardware that's required to make this happen i mean how much of an uplift is required to roll this out a lot of network equipment deployed after 2015. uh dss is just a software upgrade so there's no additional hardware required um so relative to the cost of rolling or setting up sites dss is um a simple upgrade of the software wow that sounds too good to be true also so as chioko's director of rand solutions um you're certainly knowledgeable about all this and you've seen probably a lot of it firsthand how have you been involved uh on the customer side and and does dss impact of any of of tyoko's solutions in particular we've been working on introducing the dss feature into our suite of planning products uh in order to help network operators and efficiently design and plan vss enabled networks so d8 plus is already supported in our radio network planning tool asset radio and it is on the roadmap for a number of our other solutions at present the dss feature in asset radio allows network operators to consider various watches scenarios using different traffic distribution for example using different dss configurations so they can make the optimum decision in terms of dss configuration so it seems like this is the perfect way to ease into 5g especially when carriers budgets are are tight um have you seen any impacts though from what's happening today with covet 19 with regards to the rollout of 5g and do you think that that this could be helpful yes certainly dss is a good way for operators to ease into 5g um kovit 19 has had an impact on the telecom sectors as with a lot of the other sectors one of the key impacts is that it has pushed the 5g timing out by about six to nine months so in such a scenario being able to roll out 5g with a simple software upgrade becomes even more attractive and the dss becomes even more attractive to network operators so can an operator's 4g network permanently transition to 5g with dss and and if you know operators go down this path will they still need to build out a separate 5g infrastructure or will this give them the capabilities that they need to really to cover 5g going forward i think 4g and 5g will need to coexist for the next few years as the availability of 5g terminals and 5g services increases and as the user starts seeing the value of 5g services the demand for 5g will subsequently increase and this will require operators to build more 5g infrastructure and procure more spectrum so what are the negative aspects of going down this path of of using dss as this as this sort of stepwise path to 5g is there any negative side to it dss may not work for all operators so there may be regulator regulatory challenges for example uh in some countries the spectrum may be locked a specific technology something it cannot be used for 5g and 4g for example enabling 5g on the same spectrum and the same infrastructure reduces the capacity on the 4g network so that could be an issue for some of the operators and there may be some technology limitations as well so dss for example cannot support all the 5g use cases um also it cannot support some of the 5g technologies like network license so there are a number of challenges and some of the limitations of going down the google assistant interesting okay well it sounds like it's a good interim approach at least um certainly in in today's environment probably as is i know operators a little nervous about about capital outlay so when it comes to trying build out a 5g network in the age of covid you know where demand is is for bandwidth is high but budgets and resources and timelines are probably pretty tight um it sounds like this you know like dss could be just what the doctor ordered perhaps huh from any of today's operators so thank you nishida for sharing your insights with us thank you very much all right so for all our

about the fundamentals between co2 and solvent based extraction what we want to talk about is the fundamentals of the solvent we're gonna start with co2 so co2 typically in the atmosphere as you guys probably well know is a gas right it's all surrounding us everywhere but in order to make it a solvent it needs to go into what's called subcritical or supercritical phase right and what happens with a supercritical phase is you're compressing and you're heating that gas in order to make it into a fluid form right so typically called supercritical fluid extraction or and if it's at the lower end of that range sub critical fluid extraction now this technology has been around for years right it's been used in coffee it's been used in vanilla types of artisanal extracts it's really really good for decaffeination they use it in dry cleaning right so the technology has been around and about 10 years ago when cannabis really started getting large and people started looking towards cannabis extracts they said hey why don't we try this supercritical co2 so the history of the solvent is that it's been used very widely and people look to repurposing it into the cannabis industry right which they started to do maybe you know eight nine years ago and it started to really get big about six or seven years ago right so all these supercritical co2 applications popped up for cannabis specifically and when you look at the fundamentals of the solvent right the the difference between co2 and a different solvent like hydro carbon or ethanol is co2 doesn't do a great job at actually extracting the cannabinoids right so you've got your your cannabinoid structure that's contained within your trichome right and your trichome is a a mushroom like shape on the outside of the leaf of the plant right and that's what contains all your goodies that you you know your turf beans your your CBD your THC your cbn your CBG all those things are contained within that mushroom trichome structure right so what we want to do with the solvent of any kind is dissolve that structure right and isolate those molecules now supercritical co2 can do this right but it's a very weak solid so if you think of a solvent and you think of a molecule like like a Lac on one side and a key on the other you want to find the perfect key that goes into the lock and you're kind of sliding it in there you're turning that turning that lock and that that that door is opening right away right now with supercritical co2 it's kind of similar to trying to jam a screwdriver into the lock right it's going to work right but it takes a lot of a lot of power a lot of pressure right which is why you see these systems that operate between 1,500 to 5000 psi and because of the nature of the solvent right the solvent has to be repeatedly passed over that trichome structure right so we're continuously passing this this solvent that doesn't have great solubility with cannabinoids and with that trichome structure of the plant over this plant in order to get our goodies out so to speak right so that's why co2 units have a long cycle time typically what you're gonna see is anywhere between on the very low end to hours which will diminish your yield and diminish your your returns on your actual processing and you're also going to see longer cycle times the more material that you put in there generally right so these can be manipulated in a number of different factors a lot of the co2 companies have drastically improved upon the old days you know the old days it was eight hours per run right they've improved that by running things like subcritical running things like a higher pressure sometimes up to 5,000 psi but it doesn't change the fundamentals of the solvent right the solvent is is is not the best key for our lock in order to get those cannabinoids and those those chemicals out of the plant that were that we're desiring right so that is a fundamental overview of why co2 technologies aren't as applicable now when you look at the equipment side of co2 right obviously it stands to common sense that if you got to have something that's going up to you know 1,500 2,000 5,000 psi right you can imagine at scale it's simply not economical or feasible in order to have those technologies at scale right because if you think about a gigantic vessel that needs to go to 5,000 psi right think about the amount of engineering that to go in there the shell thickness the the valve the safety precautions right obviously when you're working at those types of pressures there's a fundamental safety concern now if it's properly engineered equipment of course the machines operate safely there's not a thorough history of accidents or things like that but that it takes more dollars right which is why dollars two dollars when you're looking at co2 equipment the equipment is actually quite a bit more expensive than solvent based right so what really happens with with with all this total scenario right as you start weighing out all these variables between co2 and solvent based against the equipment against how how you're going to scale what's right for your business how you're going to apply these technologies to your end products right and that's a lot of what we do here at precision is we we look at our client's needs we understand what it takes for an end-to-end process to integrate and that's part of what differentiates our company is that you know we our end-to-end process integrators not just somebody that's gonna sell you a piece of equipment and walk away right so so what I'd like to do is really is compare that with you know the the fundamentals of solvent based extraction now right and when we talk about solvents we'll talk about the three most popular which would be butane propane and ethanol there's a lot of other solvents out there that work there's a lot of other solvents that that may come into play in the future but we're gonna focus around the primary three that are that are used today in the cannabis and hemp industry and we'll talk about how those apply more readily to large scale especially in CBD production and hemp production so on the other side of this coin I want to talk about solvent based extraction right I want to talk about how it compares with co2 specifically so let's go back to our lock and key analogy right our lock and key analogy is we want to find the the perfect key to go into the lock right and on this side is our molecule that we're trying to extract and on this side is our key our key is our solvent right and we've not found generally a better key in the history of extraction over the last decade or so then butane and propane right so butane and propane are nonpolar solvents with light boiling point right and what that's going to yield is it's going to it's going to go in there it's gonna bind to all of your cannabinoids or terpenes and the desirable aspects of the plant right so if you ever look at our teas '''l type of products most of them are made with butane and propane right you get that really beautiful light color that terpene rich smell right which is very very applicable to artisanal cannabis markets and it's also very very applicable to moderate scale right different types of manufacturing and making different products right now we start to make a little bit of a paradigm shift right because butane and propane as most of you probably well know are flammable solvents right so and they also contain a little bit of pressure which means it costs a little bit more money to engineer the equipment right the shell thicknesses on the equipment have to be a little bit thicker but not like co2 right at co2 we're talking about 5000 psi butane and propane we're talking about anywhere from 50 to 150 psi so much much lower pressure is much safer working environment over all right but we want to keep these vapors contained so they're not ignitable right and you want to stay in a class one division one room and take all these proper safety precautions now our company has done thousands of installations of hydrocarbon equipment across the entire world at this point and we can we can honestly say that I think we're experts in hydrocarbon extraction and we understand that hydrocarbon actually does pull the best terpene profile the best cannabinoid profile out of the cannabis plant however at large scale you can start to see where the actual hurdles come in so to speak right so now how do i process you know 2,000 pounds a day with hydrocarbon on a large scale it starts to get very costly and very engineering heavy let's call it right because you have to have all of these different vessels everything has to be under pressure everything has to be class 1 division 1 rated right so it's not really feasible for for large-scale CBD extraction or large-scale hemp extraction and what we like to usually say is is you know if you're an artisanal brand that means you're processing about a thousand pounds of input biomass per day or less right once you start crossing over that threshold the cost of engineering the equipment the cost of the redundancy and the batch equipment and and the cost of the hydrocarbon equipment becomes prohibitive right and it's why you see a large trend towards ethanol so let's talk about ethanol from a from a chemical standpoint for a minute right so going back to our lock and key method ethanol is also a very good key for our lock right but the problem with ethanol is because the polarity of the solvent it's an extremely polar solvent right so the extremely polar solvent yes it will bind to our cannabinoids and our terpenes the problem is is that it's also going to bind to chlorophylls and to other water-soluble or undesirable compounds within the plant now traditionally what everyone has done to combat both those water soluble molecules are those chlorophylls is they've chilled their ethanol down so those of you that are watching this video that are experienced you may very well know if you run your ethanol at negative 40 or below generally you're you're able to bypass a lot of the chlorophylls you're able to bypass a lot of the a lot of lipids and the phosphide profiles right things that are going to gum up your process downstream right but the problem is is that how do you chill now all this ethanol on a massive scale so we're in a different a different era now so to speak right how do we use ethanol a scale for CBD that we're doing 10,000 pounds a day well it comes down to properly engineered equipment right it comes down to proper mass balance it comes down to proper post processing procedures where you need an end to end in engineered solution which is what we've done with our KP D Series right so it's not just pouring ethanol over plant matter right there's refinement of the product there's variabilities in the biomass there's there's all sorts of things that are coming down the pipeline right that affect your yield they affect your your distillate quality they affect your crystallization right all these different variables that you need to have a thorough understanding of right so processing at scale it can be done you just need to have an understanding and a strong team that understands all these variables and how to combat but from a from a fundamental standpoint of scaled extraction ethanol is fantastic because you don't have the pressures there's absolutely zero vapor pressure which means none of your vessels are under pressure you're not operating under pressure it has significantly less flammability than then hydrocarbon and it's significantly safer than co2 and the fact that it's not pressurized right and people like ethanol because they know most of us go out to the bar every Friday and Saturday night and drink it right we ingest it it is a relatively safe solvent generally recognized as safe from the FDA so let's let's talk about an overview of the common misconceptions that come with solvent based extraction right people tell you all you extract with a solvent you extract with butane or propane you're gonna have residual butane and propane in your product that's absolutely not true so what happens is once the product is extracted there may be trace amounts of butane and propane but it goes through a heating and purging process right typically that's done either in vacuum drying ovens or in decarboxylation or in distillation right that's going to remove that solvent and there'll be zero parts per million of any sort of residual solvent right same thing with ethanol ethanol is a little bit harder to take off because it has a higher boiling point right it's not as volatile doesn't make Verizon's easy but the same thing right it's going to be pulled off and decarboxylation or in in distillation and it's ironic because a lot of the people that that preach anti solvent extraction right there in the CBD market and they realized once they get to crystallization that they're forced to use pentane H pentane is a group D hydrocarbon and you know needs to be purged needs to be dealt with in the class one division one room needs to have all these parameters so again understanding your process and and working with really I could say educated people not believing a lot of the marketing hype that's out there because everybody wants to sell you equipment but in the end of the day do they know how to integrate your process and and do they really understand the science of what's happening behind the process and have they done it before did they have a long operational history so these are things that I would definitely you know ask the people that here that you're potentially doing business with a lot of what we do here with our R&D team is that we test these processes we test new parameters we're working on ways to optimize the extraction process you know our company while we're an equipment manufacturer where a process integrator but we always focus as an innovative technology company right so we're always looking at disruptive disruptive technologies what's going to change in the future market trends what's going to happen to these markets how do we get the scale for lower cost and we look at all these variables and that all starts on the bench right which you guys can see the lab behind me we work with our team very closely and we're always working to find a more efficient more effective process right while still being able to integrate the existing processes and making them work really well right so I thank you guys for listening today you know you can shoot some comments below or shoot us an email give us a call if you have questions we're happy to help and we've got a large staff that can that can help you guys out and thanks for watching the video appreciate it [Music]", "Zo5jiigf_JM": "So I've come to public-housing\nneighborhood in London, and I'm about to meet\na guy named Hidrow. He's an underground\nweed-concentrates maker who treated his own cancer\nwith medical marijuana, and now supplies\nJohn's neediest clients with serious,\nhigh-potency cannabis oil. \u266a\u266a Always have one of these. Andavolu: Okay, good.\n[ Chuckles ] So, Hidrow,\ncan you take me through the cannabis medicines\nthat you make, and, like,\nhow you make them? Yeah, I'll give you\na first run out, and this is trim and leaf and a little bit\nof bud and stuff. Where do you get this trim from?\nWho gives it to you? Everybody's got a friend\nwho grows a little something, and, you know,\nthey throw it away, so I say \"Bring it to me. That, what you're throwing away,\nto me, is a lifesaver, and to other people can be\na lifesaver, you know?\" And when you say \"they,\"\nyou mean, like, people who are basically\nselling weed illegally. Yeah. Some of them are\nreally nice people. Some of them are\nvery horrible people. Some of them are --\nI would like to see them out of the business\ncompletely, because -- What do you mean,\nthey're \"horrible people\"? Well, they're not nice. They're criminals.\n[ Laughs ] You know,\nthey actually are criminals. [ Twisting cap ] After this,\nwe would take this and we literally have the most\ndangerous part of the process, which is where we have\nto actually decarboxinate it. You're putting a flammable\nsubstance next to heat source. Yeah -- never smart. You know, I --\nI mean, like, honestly -- Like, I'm pretty nervous\ndoing this inside. Um, stick your mask on,\nplease. -Because...\n-Um... What -- What can go wrong\nif this goes -- Um, you could burn down\na whole building. You could kill yourself.\nIt's extremely dangerous. All right, I'm actually\nvery nervous about this. [ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a I'll just take off my mask. Yeah, that's done.\nThat's just, uh, oil. Ooh, you can really\nsmell it, though. We don't charge. It's not about charging,\nyou know? How much\ndo you give away? Every week, about 20,000. 20,000 pounds? -Yeah.\n-Wow. But for someone, that could be, like,\n5 to 10 days of relief. And this is why we're -- we're\nactually fighting our government for the right\nfor medical access, because it shouldn't be\npeople like me, sitting in a dank,\nlittle house, risking my life\nand my -- my freedom. to produce\nhigh-potency cannabis oil, I wanted to know who was using\nthis back-alley medicine. So I'm joining John\nas he consults with a new patient,\nPaul Webster Hughes -- a single father of two\nand stroke survivor. Hello.\nGood evening, John. I'm Paul.\nIt's a pleasure to meet you. Hello, Paul.\nVery nice to meet you. Can you step aboard?\nI'm -- I'm good. Thank you. \u266a\u266a I've just given cannabis\nin the privacy of my own home. Thank you very much. And, uh,\nthat's a 1:1 strain, which is 15% CBD\nand 15% THC. There's no\nrecommended dosage, because there isn't\nany medical data on how we're to do this.\nOkay. But, really,\nwhat I'd say of anyone is try a very, very, very\nsmall amount. Just take -- even just, like,\na pinhead to start with until you just\nget used to it. No need to worry about money,\n'cause that's what we do. We give out\nfree cannabis oil.\nWell, thank you very much. Because Paul lacks\nregular, safe access to medical marijuana, he uses a combination of medical oil and street weed to treat the symptoms\nof his stroke at his home in North Yorkshire. [ Birds chirping ] Andavolu: So, Paul, if you could\nsort of take me through -- What happened to you? 2005 --\nI'm living in Thailand, and I went out\nto my wife's village. Went swimming\nin the morning, and later that morning,\nI just fell, and I've got videos --\nbizarre, coincidental. Paul: Now, while you're\nplaying around on there... [ Woman gasps ] -It's okay.\n-There's no blood. [ Child crying ]\nOkay... And I was paralyzed\non the left side of my body. [ Slurring ]\nDo you need any... [ Woman speaking indistinctly,\nchild crying ] Woman: Hey. [ Crying continues ] Paul:\nAnd for the next six months,\nI was carried to the toilet. I had about 10% of my left body,\nat that point. I've had a headache\nfor 11 years.\nWow. Can you imagine having\na headache for 4,100 days? -Straight?\n-Straight -- absolutely. I never get a break. Imagine big, rolling\nboulders or marbles crashing\noff each other. It's like a tightening\nof a skull cap on my head. Did doctors sort of\nprescribe you anything to sort of help?\nOh, sure. Yeah, I-I've been on\npretty much all the medications that they're allowed\nto give me. I was on 14 pills a day\nat one point. So, on these pills, physically,\nit closed me down, and a couple of them depress you\nenough to kill you. This last Christmas,\nI decided no -- no more. And, uh, that's when\nI started, uh, smoking, because it dulled\nthe pain. \u266a\u266a It allows me to do the things\nthat I must do. It gives me potential. The pain's still there,\nbut it's in a bubble. But it's like\nthere's an extra layer between me and my pain. My kids\ndon't see me smoke. I only smoke\nin my room. I don't smoke anywhere else\nin the house. I'm a single dad.\nMy kids come first. Hello, you. -What'd you doin'?\n-Hi. There's word\nfor your brother you'll learn\nwhen you're older -- seven girlfriends,\nI mean... He's a player! Okay, that's one way\nof putting it. Yeah, sure. All right,\nhere's the view -- pizza. Can you bang it on?\nYou can do that, can't you, huh?\nMm-hmm. All right, homework --\nWhat about French?\nI got my history. What was your history like? 64%. 64%. -Yeah.\n-Well done, you. -Pizza's ready!\n-Okay. Thank you, sir. Please.\nYou're very welcome. Oh, thank you very much. Meat Feast or pepperoni? I think it's Meat Feast,\none of your favorites. -Meat Feast.\n-Looks like it's Meat Feast. Do you guys sort of,\nlike, realize that, like, the marijuana\nthat your dad's smoking is still, like,\ntechnically illegal? Yeah, we do. How does that make you feel?\nLike, what... Uh... Kind of scared that\nhe's gonna get caught. Paul: If I thought there\nwould be a situation where our life\nwould be threatened, I wouldn't smoke.\nMm-hmm. That's just\nblack and white. They're more important to me\nthan, uh -- than anything. [ Speaks indistinctly ] Ooh.\nHey, you okay? Yes, yes. Is it sort of scary\nto think that he has to do something that's illegal to,\nlike, feel better? If it's helping him,\nI allow it. But if he's doing it\nfor no reason, really, I would feel\nkind of upset. Right. But it doesn't seem like\nhe's doing it for no reason. It seems like\nit helps him a lot, right?\nMm-hmm. Well, she hates smoking --\nI think that's the main thing. And she's got a pretty good\nsense of values. And to her, whatever\nshe sees in the world, says pot's bad. And she thinks\nin black and white. And now we give her\nthis conundrum that daddy needs it. It kind of throws a bit\nof a wobbly at her, you know? Mm-hmm. So she's trying very hard\nto reconcile that. We had a bit of a cry together\nand a cuddle upstairs, and, uh, she'll be okay. I mean, it's hard, right?\nAnd it's -- It's lousy. I have to live a lie,\nand no parent, especially when you've got\nabsolute love for your kids, wants to do that. \u266a\u266a I've come\nto Limehouse Marina in London to see John on the final leg\nof his journey. Today he's gonna take\nhis tiny, little canal boat into the mighty River Thames\nto let his cannabis banner fly and to drum up support\nfor marijuana reform right in front of Parliament. What we've got here are\nsome CBD-rich cannabis seeds. They're very low in THCs. I'm gonna pop them\nin the balloon. Okay. [ Helium hissing ] We are gonna tie some notes\nto them from patients -- medicinal-cannabis patients\nacross the UK, and we're gonna send those\nup into the sky and hope they reach\ncommunities across Albion. Amazing. [ Hissing continues ] So, what do you reckon the day's\ngonna be like for you? Uh, I am...\nI mean,\nyou're taking a small boat into big old body of water. It's gonna be a big old\nbody of water out there, be nice and choppy. How is it different from the small canals\nthat you go in? Uh, it's tidal,\nso it's pretty dangerous. Do you think the boat's\ngonna handle it? The boat is gonna handle it,\nmy friend. We do not like pessimism...\nOkay. Right on. ...anywhere near my boat.\n[ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a [ Boat motor humming ] All right, John!\nSee you, man! Goodbye, Krishna.\nGood luck. Namaste. Whoo-whoo!\nWhoo-whoo! [ Laughs ] That's the little barge\nthat could. \u266a\u266a [ Crowd cheering ] It's to legalize\ncannabis in London. [ Cheering continues ] -Hey, how's it going?\n-Nice to meet you, man. Good to meet you.\nHey, man. I'm Krishna. You guys excited? \u266a\u266a [ Siren wailing ] Hey, Paul. -Krishna, how are you?\n-How's it going, man? Aw, it's good to see you. -What a great event.\n-I know. How are you feeling --\nYou excited? I'm very enthused\nand excited about it. It's not just talk. These are real people\ncoming out and demonstrating\nthe reality they believe in. And that's got to make a\ndifference, Krishna, in the end. And what's it like being sort of\nbeing amongst this group of, like,\nother like-minded people? -Brothers. Family.\n-You think so? -Yeah.\n-Amazing. They're just be so open\nand honest about it. I asked them, did they feel\nat all self-conscious? Hell no.\n[ Laughs ] You know, this is what\nthey believe and what they do. Yeah, people are just, like,\nsmoking weed next to the Thames, next to Parliament. The English are\nvery law-abiding. But I think now that we're starting to see\na movement that's gonna\ngive us a change. And this is the mother\nof Parliaments. If it can't start here... -This is where it starts.\n-This is where it starts. \u266a\u266a Andavolu:\nAll right, it looks like he's just about to go\nunder Westminster Bridge, and he's just gonna pop out right in front of the Houses\nof Parliament and Big Ben. I saw him for just this little\nbit right on the other side, and he looked really tiny. Like, the boat was small. And -- Oh, look! You can\njust see him right there. He's coming in. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] He's releasing the balloons. [ Laughs ] Amazing. Man: Go on, John!\nKeep going! Get those seeds!\nYou tell Cameron! [ Cheering continues ] Hey, John!\nHey, John! He gave the wave!\n[ Laughs ] He waved at us. And he looks so small\ncompared to that building. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] \u266a\u266a As an American,\ncoming to the UK and seeing how medical-marijuana\npatients are faring -- In one way, it's a little\ndispiriting to see that they have to improvise and sort of do\nthis underground stuff to get what they think is\nmedicine that's gonna help them. But another way -- I'm seeing\nsomething sort of special. The people I met here\nare kind of filling in the gaps. Guys like John,\nlike Paul, like Hidrow, who are making real sacrifices\nin order to help people -- Robin Hoods of sorts -- they're forming these kind of\nad hoc underground communities, taking weed\nfrom the black market, making it into oil\nand medicine, and then giving it\nto the needy. That's kind of\na beautiful thing. That sort of, like,\nmodel of compassion is something I think\nthat the world can learn from. What I've seen in the U.S. is that legal weed\ncan equal money. But here in the UK, it seems like illegal weed\nequals compassion. And what's cool\nis that compassion is free. \u266a\u266a", "752DBGq8Re0": "[Music] 5g is now and this is what our new video series is about an hour 5g book that you can read online today we would

his lab dryness twofold Heine I have a challenging question for you today what are the benefits of these numerology z' in a single word Wow indeed that's a very tricky question so for me it's definitely much easier to explain 5g a interface aspects on writing various pages in our 5g technology book but pretty if you challenge me like that to explain the benefit of the interface numerology is in a single word okay um personally I would use the term flexibility so 5g has to cope with various aspects requirements and services so that's also the 5g interface has to prove a very high flexible configurations now as we explained in our 5g technology book OFDM a is the basic waveform in 5g and we allow various numerology is like SAP hair spacings sumu duration etc unfortunately as always in physics there is no perfect waveform yeah so that's also there's no perfect numerology if I go for let's say a more narrow sub here spacing we have the advantage of better channel equalization reduce complexity we gain some robustness because the reciprocal is system iteration of the subway spacing so symbol duration is longer so if I speak a very slow it's easier to comprehend on the other side if we use a wider subcarrier spacing yeah then we reduce the complexity in the f50 operation and especially in the fa2 frequency range millimeter wave we gain the robustness because we did use the impact of the face noise and also we reduce the solo duration and therefore we gain latency so we see 5g offers a great flexibility in the interface aspects on the inside what about the complexity yeah and to see how easy and simple it is to set up a 5g cell I would like to show you is our signal generator the smw 200 how to set up a 5g cell so I'm going into the menu like here to set up a five cheese cell or let me select a boundaries of 50 megahertz the reason why also explained in our book then I have two selection of all possible values and now we can see it in that menu 15 30 and 60 killer sub-q spacings are offered I'm operating in fr1 if I would change to F at 2 millimeter wave then you would see the numbers the 60 to 120 and the 20 and 40 kilohertz when running several numerology is in peril at the same time that's something I would like to show you with the bandwidth part in one of our next videos thank you Ghana if you want to dive deeper into physical access fundamentals and other 5g topics you can read our 5g book online this book provides all details around the 5g standard procedures and testing aspects stay tuned and don't forget 5g is now you", "8mj6E0-aLLo": "what is rso and why did rick simpson create it as simpson describes it it all began in 1997 when he was working as an engineer in a canadian hospital as a result of a dramatic sequence of events he was exposed to toxic fumes before falling off a ladder and being knocked unconscious after going to the er simpson recovered quickly but he suffered from constant dizziness and tinnitus unfortunately the drugs prescribed to him only made things worse despite the challenges simpson encountered he was about to realize something very important in spite of his doctor's dismissal of what was still a taboo subject simpson began smoking cannabis after watching a documentary on medical marijuana as a result of using marijuana simpson's ringing in his ears reduced pharmaceutical medications hadn't helped him however a type of skin cancer basal cell carcinoma was diagnosed on simpson in late 2002. simpson returned to the marijuana plant with a renewed intensity further research led to an intriguing idea how about topical marijuana directly applied to the cancer a study published decades ago in the national cancer institute's scientific journal offered some inspiration a 10-day treatment of animals with delta 9 thc beginning the day after tumor implantation results in a dose-dependent effect that retards tumor growth keeping this in mind simpson harvested his usual cannabis flower made a crude extract and placed a few drops on band-aids when he put these directly onto cancerous lesions and removed them four days later he says he found no signs of cancer simpson experimented with cannabis oil different extraction methods and solvents in his quest to provide cannabis oil to others a highly purified decarboxylated substance was selected after extensive trials and errors by simpson a substance that was well suited to both oral and topical use how cbd oil differs from rso cbd oil is diluted and contains little to no thc rso can reach levels of up to 90 thc when undiluted although cbd oil and rso are both cannabis infused oils they differ more than they are similar rso is a pure thc rich extract while cbd oil is diluted cbd rich and is often mixed with carrier oils rick simpson oil has much greater versatility than cbd oil which is a sublingual and oral drug the pharmaceutical differences are significant as well rick simpson oil's high thc content interacts the strongest with cb1 receptors throughout the brain's central nervous system this medication may also affect the serotonin 5-ht2a receptor which impacts memory development and learning being a concentrate of thc rso has a strong sedative effect as well simpson himself describes it as narcotic this can be very beneficial for cancer patients who may suffer from chronic pain and significant adverse reactions to chemotherapy and other treatments newbies on the other hand can be overwhelmed by the effects additionally making rso is less effective than other extraction options which may lead to a reduction in beneficial terpenes that influence cannabis effects there is not much activity on the brain's psychotropic receptors when it comes to cbd oil because of this it does not cause a high though it may mildly activate serotonin 5 ht1a receptors and thereby relieve anxiety but cbd's unique molecular structure enables it to extend beyond the endocannabinoid system activating trpv1 receptors and for receptors which may reduce inflammation rso may still be more effective for pain relief however because of its high thc content different medical conditions and health needs will determine which oil is most appropriate for each individual it may be appropriate to apply both oils perhaps at different times especially since rso can be intoxicating cbd oil could even be effective in reducing the psychoactive effects of high thc can rick simpson oil be used to treat cancer some patients claim that rick simpson oil went beyond just pain relief and actually cured their cancer but this is still purely anecdotal and no scientific studies have examined the use of rso to treat cancer in rick simpson's traditional cannabis oil cancer treatment the end goal is to expose cancer to ultra-high doses of thc which will kill it early research indicates that thc may induce program cell death apoptosis in cancer cells by causing them to produce more ceramide a fat that eats away at them it is possible that another of the cannabis terpenes limonene also promotes apoptosis in addition via activation of ampk thc may help shift metabolism towards fat burning dr bob melamed a molecular biologist says this is a big deal with more fat metabolism comes a lower level of free radical production and a more aerobic cellular environment these subtle shifts in dna sequences have been discovered to be protective in the fight against cancer although rick simpson oil has only been anecdotally proven to be an effective cancer treatment there is no definitive conclusive evidence of its effectiveness yet although cannabis has a relatively clear role in trying to treat the symptoms of chemotherapy more clinical research will be needed before rso can be considered a potentially effective cancer treatment rick simpson oil may offer other benefits testimonials indicate that rso may lower blood pressure enough to reduce or eliminate the need for high blood pressure medications any prescription changes should be discussed with your doctor further patients who take marijuana to treat diabetes talk about reducing or stopping their use of exogenous insulin while taking rick simpson oil that's because thc has been found to be a powerful insulin sensitizer it is also possible that rso may decrease diabetic's risk of having further complications such as neurological damage that are often accompanied by the disease research has also shown that rso is an efficient agent against pain whether cancer related or not that makes it an attractive alternative to opiates of which the overuse has led to epidemics all over the world there is some evidence that cannabis in patients taking opioids for chronic pain has an opioid sparing effect where patients who use medical cannabis require fewer opioids but this relationship is still under dispute the potential side effects of rick simpson oil given rick simpson oil's high thc concentration careful dosing is necessary given the oil's consistency as with other thc concentrates rso can result in side effects and these can be minimized with careful planning it is important to consult your doctor before using rso since both concentrates and rso have high thc concentrations side effects are more likely to occur in the wrong individual thc can result in cognitive impairment memory problems and even psychosis it may also lower blood pressure so caution should be exercised by those with a history of hypotension or taking medications to deal with blood pressure where can you buy rick simpson oil rso isn't as easy to find in dispensaries as you might think in dispensaries across medical and adult use states you can find high thc concentrates and oils but very few have the same levels and concentrations as those described by rick simpson rick simpson has also noted that there are a number of independent websites in california that are selling products labeled as rso and made by different companies with thc levels as high as 70 percent however he clarifies that these are specific products if you are purchasing a sample of rso online make sure you are dealing with a reputable company and that the analysis comes with a certificate of analysis that is current please consult your doctor before changing any medications this is for educational purposes and is not medical advice i am not a medical doctor or a scientist thank you have a great day video by my420spot.com [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "kgWyJcvf4Uk": "[Music] good day my name is dream sunlight from huawei headquarter a couple of days ago itu just approved 3gpp specifications as the only 5g standard so compared to 3g and 4g we now have only one single standard technologies for 5g but the questions regarding bands remain which branch can we use for 5g and which bands the calories worldwide has been using to deploy 5g today we're going to address the question of which bands for 5g in the following section we've been hearing a lot of talk about c-band but as as a matter of fact 5g can be deployed over high bands mid-band or low band with different rhythm and timing and with different usage and use cases most 5g starts with c-bands offering both decent coverage and capacity and as per itu recommended we should have a contiguous 100 megahertz per carrier it can be supplemented by high bands such as millimeter wave for the embb hotspots or wireless homebrew band access it can also be deployed over low bands to offer wider coverage or better uplink like lte we started a carrier bandwidth of 20 megahertz but in 3gpp specification we have extended the calorie bandwidth to include 30 40 and 50 megahertz as is the case for the bands 2.1 gigahertz and 700 megahertz so let's look at the spectrum allocation worldwide by the gsma story of february 2020 we have at least full team market who has assigned suitable frequency for 5g it could be c-band it could be 2.6 or 2.3 or other bands such as 700. some select markets with the frequency allocation is put in a table on the right side it could be seen that the majority of countries have selected seabed for 5g because this actually is the lowest frequency band that we can find large span of contiguous frequency available worldwide and it offers a decent compromise between capacity and coverage nevertheless when c-band is not available we resort to other frequency bands as well such as the case for the netherlands at the time of recruiting the netherlands is carrying out auction of 700 megahertz and 3.5 will not be available until 2022 therefore as a sum of rule we should have between 80 megahertz or 100 megahertz per carrier for mid band as per recommended by gsma this is the case for the market including china european markets and japanese market or south korean markets in case we don't have sufficient spectrum for the 3.5 band 41 in 2.6 will bend 40 into the 3 gigahertz can also be considered regarding 2.6 gigahertz there are actually two modes of allocation either as a combination of fdd plus tdd or as a single chunk of 194 megahertz contiguous spent in band 41 for the reason of efficiency and capacity we recommend mode 2. this has been also the choice for a number of countries including japan including china or the u.s here comes the question asked by many since n38 is a subset of m4t1 how does the m41 device and operates with n38 network and vice versa the answer lies the following for n41 devices it does not only get the signals from the n38 but it also possibly get the interference signals from n7 two other mid bands in 2.3 and 4.9 are less ready or deployed than 3.5 or 2 tactics for 2.3 gigahertz it has been largely deployed in lte and it has a large support of devices we expect 2.3 gigahertz to continue the momentum in 5g we already have a number of devices in phongs cbs and modulus being supporting 2.3 and has been allocated in a number of markets regarding 4.9 as a matter of fact our first 5g device as early as 2018 already support photo9 one thing worth mentioning is chinamobile has mandated the support of photo9 for its 5g devices regarding the spectrum besides china it has also been allocated for trials in japan and russia china mobile is also considered using 409 for the vertical segments where a special object downlink ratio is used in order to improve the uplink throughput so let's take a look at the mid-band availability in countries worldwide as we can see that when you have at least 80 megahertz per carrier for the mid band we are in a green zone meaning with sufficient mid-band resources but we do have the mortgage such as turkey or russia which is below the threshold of a 15 megahertz per carrier meaning that they are facing the challenge of insufficient knee bend in the short term after the spectrum allocation let's take a look at what kind of bands carriers has been using for the commercial launches according to the most recent story from the gsa we have 84 live 5g networks today mostly in europe asia pacific and middle east if we take a look close look at what kind of bands they have been using for the commercial launches it is without doubt that 3.5 is the most used band for all the carriers followed by 2.6 and 2.1 gigahertz now let's take a look at the number of devices being commercially available when we look at the breakdown in terms of bands it perfectly matches the bands for the commercial networks you have the most devices being available in the c band followed by the m41 of 2.6 and then followed by 2.1 and 1.8 the form factor breakdown sets a lot of focus on the enbb on the fixed wireless access and on vertical use cases with 5g modules we've seen that the majority of carriers go with 3.502 doxes but we do have carriers who has no access to such bands that's when the cameras resolve to sub-3g bands for fast 5g deployments as is the case for carriers such as t-mobile in the netherlands it can also be used for fast deployment and supplemental coverage for seabed in many countries such as germany when the spectrum is auctioned there is a mandatory coverage requirements last but certainly not least it can also be used to improve the uplink and to reduce the latency as was the case for trying to take on we have been working closely with china tecom to offer super uplink which leverage both c-band and 2.1 gigahertz to offer a higher uplink throughput regarding the 3gpp specifications we can see that the fuji bands are generally enhanced with a number of options in anchor and in dc combinations in 3gpp specifications we can see that subdigi bands are generally enhanced with a number of options in anchor and in endc combinations moreover the channel bandwidth has also been extended beyond 20 megahertz for example there's a possible to have 30 or 40 megahertz for 700 records as was demanded and advocated by china broadcast network the uptake of sub3 gnr we forecast there will be a few 5g launches by the end of this year notably in 2.1 700 and 1.8 so after all the discussion on c-band sub-3g nr and the millimeter wave the next question will be what should be the next band for 5g or 5.5 g we believe that a very likely candidate lies in the six gigahertz spent because of its availability in most geographic regions and because of its availability of 1.2 gigahertz contiguous spent considering a long time between the study and the commercial launch as was the case for c-band we recommend the speeding of the process starting from 2019 as a research project we should stream in line process and target marking 6 gigahertz for imd usage in wrc 2023 and we should target the first commercial case for 6 gigahertz as early as 2025. comes the summary for the question which bends full 5g we recommend at least 80 to 100 megahertz per carrier in order to offer the 5g data bit rate as per recommended by itu or gsmi first ray 5g starts with the 3.5 gigahertz or 2.68 to be followed by m40 into the 3 or 4.9 gigahertz sub 3g ni is gaining momentum as minus by the number of deployments starting with 2.1 gigahertz and 700 megahertz as four millimeter wave it finds its usage in enbb hospitals or fixed wireless access due to its limited coverage let's all follow the section answering the question which bends for 5g you", "tslOMsXMVoU": "hello everyone thank you for attending today's webinar with streakwave and buy sales i am joined by maggie where he will be addressing today's topic on buy stealth upcoming 5g products this webinar will be recorded and we'll share afterwards with a link to our youtube channel if you have any questions at all during the presentation please type them in the q a section at any time and we'll get them addressed at the end maggie you can go ahead and begin great thank you very much um in today's good morning everyone uh in today's presentation i'll take you through some 5g basics and principles and i'll walk you through some of our upcoming 5g products um myself we're a global company uh we do exist in more than 55 countries and we have over 40 global partners with end-to-end solution we have epc deployed across the world and we've shipped over um 200 devices in 100 small cells 100 000 small cells and the list is growing by the day all right so um 5g i mean this is a buzzword you hear every day so what is 5g 5g is the fifth generation wireless system it's based on three gpp standards release 15. um every 10 years we have a new wireless generation um and as you know uh humans our generation is 30 years so the wireless technology is three times faster than our generation so if you're 30 years old you've already witnessed three different wireless generations 2020 started deploying the 5g wireless technology 10 years ago 2010 lte came to light 22 000 we have the 3g and so on um there are three basic uh components when it comes to 5g there the first one is enhanced mobile broadband which is emb the second one is urlc which stands for ultra reliable and low latency communication and then we have the mmtc which is massive machine type communication so if we look at the triangle right here i if you can see the mouse let's start with the embb this is all about speed and throughput um 5g speeds under 100 times faster than the speed of lte and 10 times faster than lte advance so we're talking about 10 gigabits per second um just put it to put it into perspective you you can actually download um you know a high definition movie in less than a second and you can stream 8k movies without any delay and so smoothly so as we go down this triangle you can see all the use cases right here 3d videos and work and play in the cloud augmented reality in the industry automation so as we go down speed would not become as important as latency and latency is just it's the accumulation of various delays from when the request is sent until a response is received um so you can see here um vehicle to vehicle um that's where uh the ur llc comes into play um the delay or the latency here for this kind of application it's less than one millisecond uh humans reflex will take around 250 milliseconds for the brain to to to comprehend and react to any event so when we talk about one millisecond that means your vehicle will be able to decide um 250 times faster than than you do so just to put to put it into perspective then let's go down this side from the amb all the way to the mmtc which is the massive machine type communication uh what's important here for these applications with a lot of smart cities and in the smart homes it's the density um in in 5g um 5g technology will be able to support up to 100 devices per square meter that's like 10 devices per square foot so um you know the density here is much more than um lte and uh we've all been in a situation uh where you know if you're in a stadium or in a crowd sometimes you don't get the service that you you wanted to but 5g will eliminate this this issue another factor is the the system spectral efficiency 5g is is much more efficient than 4g or lte technology um we're talking about 10 bits per second per hertz and currently we're probably at five or seven so it is is much more efficient and when it comes to energy uh efficiency um it is like 90 percent improvement over lte so these are the three basic concepts that you need to know about 5g and all use cases will be covered under these three concepts some of the 5g ram characteristics one of them is millimeter waves um according to physics the higher the frequency the shorter the wave so for frequencies above 30 gigahertz that's where we get the millimeter wave that's the length of the uh the the length of the wave itself what's good about these waves they're they pack lots of data but they cannot travel far because of the shortwave characteristics and they are not as good in penetrating walls so there's some kind of uh you know limitation here and so that's the millimeter wave concept then to utilize such millimeter waves uh we we we use small cells small cells um they're they're going to be spread across the cities and metropolitan and they're going to be part of the street furnitures lights and inside of the buildings and you you will you will see them all over the place and they're so dense so every 250 meters you will have a small cell what's good about small cells you know they have small antennas um so um they won't look bad they're not as big as as the the traditional micro or macro uh cells and uh they'll be spread across the city to be able to utilize the millimeter wave another concept is the massive bible massive mimo as you can see from the picture it's like an array of hundreds of of small antennas now that the um utilizing this feature will definitely um increase the capacity of the mobile network uh we're talking about at least 22 times so um it it'll it'll really um put the whole city into another canvas another another function here is is the beam forming uh instead of just randomly broadcasting the signal um it will be it will be focused on the user itself and also the technology would allow the the the uh the beam or the the signal to be um tracked and it'll track the user and that will definitely uh reduce all the interference um it will provide a much better end user experience so these are the four main characteristics of 5g ram technology we have another feature in the core which is which is network slicing think of it as end-to-end service in each slice is dedicated to some kind of vertical or dedicated service you can see for instance here you can have a consumer slice where um you can have uh you know post post paid customers and prepaid customers you can have an iot slice that will address different verticals whether medical or industry or utilities and then you can have the mvno slice or the the waste flies so this has been utilized in the core and it will make the server because 5g is is service based uh technology and and this is how it's utilized you just have different slices like big pizza utilize it according to the uh use cases that you're you're you're working with this slide uh it's a listed view um of both the lte technology and the 5g you can see on the right this is where um the 5g technology [Music] you can see lots of small cells because this is how you can utilize the uh the fast speed um small cell will carry eighty percent of total traffic um and it's it's gonna be indoors um you know outdoors you still have the normal uh micro and macro uh with a 5g technology but they will not deliver the millimeter wave and and the gigabit of speeds that you want five g small cells will utilize this uh another factor also for fi another another entry uh for the 5g we call the edge cloud or the mobile edge computing due to the uh you know if you have an application where latency is is extremely important um you put that server close to the edge meaning close to you to the site instead of having it out on the clouds because uh latency is extremely important to you so um this is one of the advantages of 5g yeah now the ran um part is is divided into three different units this is important this is uh part of the uh um 5g open ran standards so the ram is divided into a radio unit and a distributed unit of central units and this is spread across all the layers you know there are the osi layers you have the physical layer then you have the network layer and they have tcp layer so if you look at this we start with the radio frequency and then you have the physical layer it's divided into low and high so um and then you have the mac and the rlc and the pdcp and then the rc this is where the data starts flowing out and it's the tcpip layer two splits that are of interest here are split seven and call split two split seven this will split the physical layer into two and it's called lo-fi and um what it means that you will have two separate hardwares the rru the red unit right here and then the distributed unit and this and the centralized unit would be in a different piece of hardware if you have the option two it means you will have the ru and du unit combined functions combined into one piece of hardware and then you have another piece of hardware uh it's the uh centralized unit while we're doing this um you know in virtual light this one will will make virtualization easy um it will um depending on your application you will be able to scale uh the the hardware and software according to your to your needs and um for option seven this will give you a front hole this is this is you know the front hole would go from uh the radio units into the uh distributed and centralized unit which is the bbu this would be realized as a bbu and the front home uh will be um significantly higher than than the normal it will take you up to 100 gigabits per second but when you split um on two that will give you some limitation um in the split two this is the mid hall you have front hole mid hall and the back hole so menthol this is a new uh concept it's just designed for 5g and open ram and it is the interface between the du and the cu and it's done like that because it's open interface and you can actually mix and match you can have an radio unit from a vendor another another and the bbu from another vendor because uh with this standards it's open interfaces and um that's the basic of open ram okay and this is from open ram and buy cells we're part of the open route consortium and just to put thing into perspective for you um this is the rru which is represented in the uh uh peak radio unit right here and then there's a front hole the extension unit is just a switch or an aggregator if you have more than a radio and then um it'll take it front hole all the way to the vbu which is in this function the bbu here in this case because of split two if you remember sorry split seven you will have both functions the du and cu combined into uh one piece of hardware which is the uh the bbu and then you back hold everything to the core network we do have um end-to-end demo system that we're providing to to some of our customers and 5g has two different modes standalone which is sa or non-standalone which is nsa standalone it's just pure field 5g no lte components no legacy is is to be dealt with here um so you have the 5g radio then you have the 5g cpes or terminals they're connected to the remember 5g is a split you don't have it in one node anymore you have the ru and the bu with with the separate easy pre connected connection which is an optical uh 25 gigabits of of connection uh in case of 5g in case of lte you have the supreme which is 10 gigabits and then you back home to the 5g uh core so this is a standalone um demo system end to end that we provide to our customers to do their own tests in the lab now this is another demo system that we provide end-to-end this is the nsa non-standalone and as i indicated for non-standalone you will have lte parts from the core perspective uh because you know to to evolve from 5g to from 4g to 5g you still want to utilize the existing legacy network core network that is which is the lte so uh in this case we have a radio that supports 4g and 5g and it goes into a bbu that has both cards you know one for 5g and one for uh 5g 4g and then it you backhaul it into the legacy core so this is how for instance uh you know at all mobile going through their 5g deployment but for instance um this network since they have a greenfield 5g they don't need to worry about you know legacy and they will go with 5g straight here are some of the the 5g elements that we have we have the new generation core or apc and this this combines both 5g and 4g it comes in three different flavors the compact can handle up to 5000 active users and support 500 sites standard configuration would double that so i'll take you to ten thousand active users and one thousand sites and then we have the professional that will multiply the standard by ten so you will have a hundred thousand users in ten thousand sites just you know within one box bbu we have two kinds we have the intel based x86 and this can be used as a standalone you know in a for only 5g and the configuration can be either cu or du or combined you know depending on the the split that i explained a little bit earlier and we have the 1588 version 2 synchronization also implemented in this box now there's another technology for the bbu which is uh arn this can serve both worlds the lt and 5g because uh you can add cards you can have 5d cards that'll handle the 5g radios and you can have also the 4g cards to handle the lte cards so you can expand it and scale it accordingly and it will serve both technologies here are some of the indoor 5g radios that we have we have gamma uh you know we gamma is for 5g now we have the nova neutrino so we still use the uh space naming convention whatever you see gamma this is 5g compatible so looking at gamma 632 these are two in their indoor radios they're they're dual mode meaning lte and the new radio 5g sub six gigahertz yeah in 5g has two frequency ranges from one per specification so fr1 fix frequency range one is um you know frequencies below six gigahertz and then you have frequency range two which is fr2 this is for millimeter wave and it's for you know frequencies uh above 30 gigahertz or so the antenna diversity is six transmit and six receive and the signal the single channel up power is 250 milliwatts and since it's a 5g technology the difference in in bandwidth you know for lte the maximum bandwidth you can utilize is 20 gigahertz it's sorry 20 megahertz and for 5g it's it'll expand it to 100 and all the way to 400 mega megahertz per carrier per channel and that depends on what's called mu which is the uh numeration uh it is configurable in in the system um now the frequencies that this radio um operate on um you can see it's fdd and also tdd and when you see n that's the new frequency it's in 41. and what's good about 5g technology there is a spectrum sharing so the same spectrum the same band can be shared by lte and 5g um in 41 this is for the educational band so 5g on 40 band 41 and then band 78 this is a c band and it's uh it starts at 3300 all the way to 3 800 megahertz and so that will include the cbrs then within so you can actually have 5g for the for the abs and the cvrs bands we have another one here a 33 and this will well as a dual mode as well you know it has lte and it handles both frequency ranges so the the sub gigahertz sub six gigahertz and the millimeter wave uh antennas are getting bigger so we're going into the massive mimo it's eight by eight eight transmitted receive diversity and you can have it like two sectors or by four and it's 200 milliwatt of power per channel and the spectrum you can see now we we we added um band 261 and 269 and that these are the bands for the millimeter wave uh they're like um the the it's used by uh tier one operators here as well we do have also outdoor 5g radios the gamma 844 in eight four four three and 84 x x they the difference between them they they will have more mimo if you can see here this is eight by eight then then um you can see it we're going to 16 transmit 16 receive so this is more towards the massive mimo technology and the the output power you know uh the first one we have and that's five watts and then we we take it to 40 watts and all the way to 80 watts so we you have more powerful um uh micro outdoor um radios available for you and again since this is 5g technology this is no longer an integrated small cell it's split into two the radio unit and the and the bbu as i explained in the slides before and we we're handling uh we're adding different bands as we go on and this is some of the uh the other uh some other radios that we're working on uh we have the aau aau it means that the antenna is included in the radio so you you don't need to to buy external antennas advantages are including included again we will have more diversity in uh all the way up to 64 by 64. this is the massive uh mimo and um the the power also here uh it's 10 watts per up per channel let's go into one of uh the radios in in a more more detail and i'll i'll i'll make it as simple and as quick as possible we have the gamma 846 now this this radio it has the antenna included and it is a one of our products that we're offering for art off that meets the art of requirements and exceeds it it is a dual mode so it is it will work on lte and 5g it is eight by eight it is that the diversity is a transmitter each receive and we call it eight by five watts because we have eight different paths and each path is five watts uh of output power l cover and 5g in 41 as i said anything with the letter n that's that's 5g related band and the the classic b-48 cbrs on the lte technology it is it is um when it comes to carriers lte we can aggregate up to four carriers and each carrier is 20 megabit megahertz so you can have up to 80 um megahertz of bandwidth on lte and for the 5g it's one carrier and each carrier you can have up to 100 mega megahertz of bandwidth it's compact it is less than 8 kilograms which is like 16 or 17 pounds um it has eight separate configurations which means again the slippery is a front hole between the radio and the bbu and if you remember the split 7 that i was talking about this is for the 5g ec3 which is 25 gigabits per second optical interface um some of um the antenna gain is 10 dbi and the we support the dual mode and we support beamforming as i explained earlier in the 5g characteristics you can actually track the user and have a focus uh the energy on that user instead of just broadcasting it all over the place it supports the du which is the split which is the bbu and it's gps uh supported and uh one 1588 version 2 of synchronization other components if you remember i mentioned that the bbu we have one version of the bbu that comes with cards and these cards are called acceleration cards and this card is can be 5g or 4d cards that you add to the bbu and and this card has six interfaces six e3 interfaces and um it is it is pci express or epci that's the type of of hardware that that that that's um being used for these bbus then yeah then we have what's called an extended unit this extended unit it will connect more than one radio because you remember we have the radios and we have the bbus and then you need some kind of aggregate or switch in the middle to be able to connect more than one radio to the uh by a frontal to the b to the uh bbu and this model will have eight optical connections you can connect up to eight uh um radios and then you will connect the um the bbu through one optical connection and then you have another connection to another extended units like you daisy chained them together that this is to make you able to scale according to the to the needs so it's very much scalable good now uh just to protect your investment we have 5g migration path and so looking at the first layer here these are 5g radios and if your configuration uh this is for the distributed systems you know the radio unit and the bbu uh separately this it's called distributed systems no longer one um small cell uh in in in one enclosure so currently if you have the um you know the 4g bbu which which we call normal 1000 and these radios that i talked earlier that i mentioned earlier on and then you need to go to 5g you don't have to climb the towers and change the radios they're they're 5g ready but if you have normal 1000 and you need to have um the full 5g support from the bbu perspective all you need to do is just add another uh bbu 5g ready so the normal 1000 will take care of your lte uh network and the 5g for pure 5g uh subscribers and the apc it's it's just software upgrade so you don't have to worry about any hardware this is another way of protecting your investment when you go through a complete 5g upgrade if you already have the x86 server with with the 4g cards all you need to do is just add 5g cards into this server and you're you're you're you're you're there you're fully 5g compatible um your network is is 5g compatible again the radio units they're 5g ready but you have the b you have the bbu that also need to be 5g and to be able to do that you can add just a 5g card and then you will have your a non standalone architecture that will support both 4g and 5g and the apc is just soft software upgrade you don't need to worry about any hardware so by doing so buy sales would really protect your your investment and you don't need to um you know climb towers and change radios and and do all that to be able to have uh the 5g capability so we're we're is purely future protection for you we do have road maps that we track that we're adding more features as we go on you don't have to go through this but it is it is um we do have clarity when it comes to to future technology this is just an example of how you can scale your your indoor network if you look at this this is like your uh like a standard wi-fi network where you have the radios look at them as consider them as access points you can connect them to the extended units that that we talked about and this is a front hole uh to the to the 5g bbu and you back hold it to the 5g core now each bbu can support up to four cells you know look at consider each one as a cell and each cell can have up to 400 sorry up to 32 uh different radios indoor radios this is an outdoor coverage architecture we do handle heterogeneous networks it is we we do have outdoor aau's that you can find on towers and then it connects as as we talked about it connects to the bbu via the extended units through the cpr or easy pre front hole and then uh we back hold everything to the [Music] 5g core whether it's on a cloud or um or virtualized or localized and we do have also some indoor solutions and and uh [Music] outdoor aau's that's all connected together now it's we it's worth to mention that um we're fully compliant with the ardof and they're 5g ready as i explained in the in in the previous slides we do have two different products that meets the above baseline of 100 downlink speed you know 20 megabits of uplink speeds this is the rand part which is split again this is the bbu and this is the rru and it has all the features all the whistles and bells that that that's needed to take you to to uh the requested above baseline speeds and it's 5g ready and then we have the cat 15 that will go with that product um and it'll take you up to uh 320 megabits per second over downlink and 28 maybe bits per second for about uplink and to be able to uh achieve these speeds on the edge of the cell uh the the uh the radius is uh 5.6 kilometer which is like uh you know over three miles uh of radius um achieved with these speeds then we have the gigabit struct architecture which is the lt we call it lte turbo which will take you to the gigabits of speed this is an um it will aggregate now this is not 5g compatible the this is 5g compatible on the top but remember to be able to have 5g compatibility you need to split the radio from the base band so this will aggregate cbrs channels to the wi-fi tab gigahertz in order for you to achieve a gigabits of speed and we use also cpe that will will take advantage of that lte technology lte turbo technology to aggregate the cbrs channels with the five gigahertz of channels and that will it is two kilometer of radius edge to be able to achieve these uh speeds and that's all for me um and i'm open for any questions great thank you um there were some questions that are coming through and that also came in the beginning of the presentation or mid so i'm going to just go ahead and start in order um is beamforming already commercial available or still development say that again they want is that available is being forming already commercial available or skill development it is it is under test right now it is available and it is is being tested out on the field yes it is it is it is available and that that will be also uh the part of the art of strategy that we are chasing here okay uh next question is slicing done only on bases of apn or is there another way to utilize utilize sizing apn based yep okay what is the use of the tx power 40 watts if ue is only 2 watts uh 2w the ue cannot cover so much can you cover so much distance yeah i mean the 40 watts that's eight by five watts so you can actually um each channel will have the five watt uh power uh and it's configured it's four by four mimo so depending on on again you your your uh engineering uh it will be used this is according to to the standards of cbrs i mean the the you know you have um uh cbsd cat a and cat b and the maximum powers uh are considered on these specifications that we provide so um [Music] the the there's a difference between the cpe power and the e note b power so the cpe is is based at the customer side but the uh the e-node b's for the external ones they're they're they're away from from the side so that's why you need more power on the radios than the cps okay um what channel size aggregation is needed for wi-fi turbo uh yeah it's 20 megahertz of lte and up to 18 megahertz of the wi-fi uh five gigahertz technology that will take you to when you aggregate them in theory they should take you uh the the the throughput should be close to two gigabits per second that's the article but in practical when you aggregate both and use the special assignment frame of sa one or two that'll take you to the uh one gigabits per second of upload and download so okay why is the max distance radius limited so much when using b48 and not millimeter waves so that i can say that question again please yes why is the max distance radius limited so much when using b48 and not not millimeter not millimeter sorry i mean this is uh i explained this earlier this is according to physics because the band 48 is is banned 3.5 megahertz which is like a mid band and the signal travels uh further than the millimeter waves the limiter waves there there they're short waves and they they will not they cannot by physics they cannot travel uh you know uh further than uh the standard mid mid band wave so this is just pure uh physics this is uh this is the characteristics of the waves itself okay um and then was there gonna be any discussion on five gcps yes we are working on that we are actually uh we started the the uh design of that and we should be able to to have uh c 5g cpe ready for test uh earlier in q1 all right thank you um it looks like those were all the questions that were asked um so thank you for all everyone that attended and thank you from vermaj for presenting today um if there are any other questions that to arrive please reach out to streetwave or myself um and we will be also sending a copy of this recording everybody um any last minute things that you wanted to add magi um not really i mean i hope uh you know this is just uh the basics of of uh 5g and you know our our expected products and if you guys are interested in more detailed um explanations or detailed presentations uh i'm ready also to take you through more technical uh uh explanations for 5g and then please feel free to ask any questions that might come up later on perfect thank you again have a great day everyone thank you very much bye you", "RHXbsNVI4PM": "so here I have an ounce of Rick Simpson oil oh my god I had to take a breath in away from here so strong smelling even though I'm outside it is still really intense so this is an ounce I just put my ruler in and it's it's just an inch of liquid in there so you know I don't know he says once it gets down to a couple inches you add 10 to 12 drops of water but this just started four minutes ago so and I didn't deke our belief our cuz he doesn't say to in the book I'm following the books instructions there's the weed that I've used for the rinsing I didn't deke our bet so look at that it just I just turned it down to warm thinking that would slow things down but I guess it's not strong enough so I'm putting it back up to cook and you'll see how quickly it catches I just my understanding is you have to deke our vet for at least 45 minutes maybe it's a half hour at a certain temperature so if it's not simmering long enough at the right temperature then it won't be dee carved properly and I worry that's what happened with my with my last one so anyway see here it goes again so literally I just poured this in here just a few minutes ago not even maybe five minutes now and there's no other settings on this one it's warm or cook I've never tried it on warm until just now but obviously that's too low so that's on cook and he says to leave the lid off but I thought I remember in the video and in the book that it's some I don't think in the book it says how long to do but it says until it gets down to about two inches then you add the water and you watch that you know rapidly boils down into the concentrated oil my experience has only been with this rice cooker making Rick Simpson oil it's like nail polish remover right up the nose um so I don't know how long it's supposed to take I thought somewhere in a video or somewhere that I watched it was like at least an hour two hours three hours so I don't know I've never been brave enough to go inside and do it on the stove like in a bowl with hot water on in a pot like I've seen some people do it though of course I'm not using Everclear like there's a woman who does a youtube video and she has it right on her stove it's an electric stove I have a propane so that's why it would also make me nervous but she's using Everclear and I'm using the alchemists isopropyl alcohol and it is 99.9 percent so again this I didn't know if I say this but I mean this was an ounce of indica strain we'd need to make the Rick Simpson oil this here from my dispensary here in Vermont and I got or I'm using Shiva skunk and Henry's OG Kush for this one I just saved a teeny bit ooh people's I just saved a teeny bit to have for my vape in case I want it so and then I use 2 cups of isopropyl alcohol my understanding is you zakat per ounce of weed so I use 2 cups of isopropyl alcohol to 1 ounce 28 grams of indica strain cannabis and I did the double rinse you know I rinsed it once with half the alcohol and then I poured the next cup in after I strained it and then I put the next cup in mashed it around for a few minutes and then I strained it this is the first time I'm using this little coffee filter it's really oh look at that there's still some more in there it's a really really fine mash see and I know Rick Simpson says to be really careful to get all the resin out I don't feel like I've been careful yet you can see I have got like cannabis sticking to the bottom here nothing I don't see any falling in it's just the drips but if anybody has any idea on how to strain it without waiting 10 hours using a paper coffee filter I am all ears wow this is really strong definitely use a fan I think next time I'll use a fan even though I'm outside there's no wind today so definitely strong okay so it's still dripping a little bit so I'll just keep that hanging out so this is that this is the magic I guess see how fast it goes sometimes I get it will start to evaporate like precipitate I'm not sure the name and it it's splashes and I always forget to bring a bowl out just stick it in too because it does start squashing and they go in and get something so looking at the time we're about ten minutes in so you see how quick it goes and that's why I'm really not sure what I'm doing I haven't been able to find I haven't been able to find a place on Facebook or online where I can just ask people that have done this before Oh oh my god Wow do this on a windy day you gotta use a fan don't go so close I'm really wanting you guys to see though the changes cuz I really love watching it alright let's see there's some more in there oh sorry I'm making you guys dizzy I wasn't gonna film but I know if you're anything like me when I'm like really still learning and I just eat up anything that I can find talking about the basics and how to do this because it's unlike anything I've ever done before and I'm a nutritionist I'm a holistic nutritionist and I do a lot with like really weird things you know like I'm used to doing at least a roasting bone marrow and making all my own stalks and using fish heads and eyeballs and making things with cow tongues and beef pig feet mmm you know like I'm you know I'm used to doing things outside the box but this is like you know if it's just the cannabis but it's also it's just the method is so far out you know using this nasty solvent right and getting all the materials and then even just be able to find indica strain marijuana like I didn't even know that there was different kinds of marijuana I just thought you go and get marijuana right but I didn't realize how unique it really is a medicinal I had no idea it's so cool so this is not unheard of but it still pushes all my learning curve buttons so you can see it's starting to kind of almost foam and I guess the tiny or the bubbles that is it the denser the the denser the alcohol is becoming or something like whatever is evaporating off is changing molecular Larry molecularity I don't know how you say that stinky stinky anyway I'm just gonna keep you guys are hanging out sit down so this is ten minutes and it just feels like it's going too fast because so we are down to I'm so excited to have this again and I hope it works the other one I made was the sativa strain and I swear is not doing me good it's not healing at all for me it's making me so irritable and I'm not sleeping well you know jittery like I mean I sleep well if I don't take it too late at night but sometimes like I take it because I want the medicinal effect so I take that look at that beautiful and so I'm starting to really miss my indica strain RSO which I made my first batch so this is my third batch so I'm excited to finally I have a teeny little piece laughs tight because I wasn't sure I was gonna do this today so saving it for tonight I've been taking my sativa usually during the day up until you know early afternoon I stopped taking it and then I switch over to my indica but now I'm it's so little that I just take one grain or one and a half green at night so that's all I really have to reserve it so I got this indica weed a couple a few days ago but I just haven't had time to come out and the smell is getting stronger so this is the point where I'm not sure if I I'm gonna stick it on warm for a minute so I'll slow it down I'm nervous it's going too fast and then it won't be carved properly which I brought my thermometer to see what the temperature is - they said I think it said 300 not yet no it was 250 or something Oh see those are the props all right so I'm just gonna slow that down and then I'm gonna let it let it just calm down and I'm gonna go get I'm gonna go get a big bowl I'm gonna go get a big bowl and stick it in that so what my cat becoming knock it over okay see how it's really shallow and still see some resin so you know I didn't strain it as well as I could have you could even see kind of a chunk right there ooh ouch ooh oh my gosh that's hot oh wow look at that it's actually quite a bit of alcohol evaporation I guess it doesn't matter to get a bowl for it because it doesn't it's not really anything to be saved so he was saying the more resin that's on the bottom the more it will be it won't be the oil texture that you want it will be more like the the doughy texture that I got the first time okay so that's coming down now at this point I'm wondering if I should pull it off and stick it on the coffee warmer see I had the coffee warmer here I just don't know how hot that gets so let it go just a teeny bit longer so we're learning together so please if you've done this before and if you don't mind writing in the comments how to like what would you do in this situation when it's you know maybe an eighth of an inch in the rice cooker and you're doing a small batch would you pull it off and finish it in the oven that's an option right I'm not sure how hot the coffee warmer gets I don't think he gets that hot enough to deke Arbit so I could pull it off and stick it in a Pyrex baking dish there's a little custard cup and stick it in the oven at 250 2d carve it but I don't know if that's a good idea because I have a propane oven see now it's probably not a good idea oh my gosh explode my little II have my little yurt so I guess it's either this or the coffee warmer cuz um yeah the ovens out of the picture I guess if I maybe if I had an electric oven I would feel more comfortable with smell is pretty intense so it's definitely flammable look at that you see how dark it's getting so pretty so I have that on high again so the last time I made this I did keep it going I didn't pull it quite yet you know at this point maybe we could put in our water so he said when it gets to be 2 inches in the rice cooker to add 10 to 12 drops of water so 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 that's going faster now it is definitely starting to smell like RSO now this is the point where I feel like if I don't pull it in time it won't get really hard to remove hmm it smells like the way I'm used to it smelling that taste the way 80 feet oh it's so good I still just eat it the way it is I don't camouflage it sometimes I do I you know but usually I chasing a drink but strong love it look at that see I wish I just had a slightly smaller like half the size of a rice cooker sorry it's getting long but I do know them I want you guys I want you guys to see the process it's so cool so we're at 17 minutes right now and I think it was about five or six minutes if that in so 18 19 20 21 22 minutes so that's not my understanding is that's not long enough and carb properly so this I would think is kind of like bail that he's talking about know lastly it's thinner than I've ever had it okay I'm just gonna okay I'm going to stick it on warm and then I'm gonna so there's this thing if you put a little bit of the oil on a safety pin yeah I mean you guys to see this okay I don't know if I can do this at the same time maybe okay where you guys might miss this part I'm just gonna see if that catches if it sparks at all I didn't see any sparks so you're supposed to put some onto a safety pin and then like that light it on fire the very tip and if it sparks then there's still solvent left it didn't spark and it is that's definitely the texture that I think it could maybe be a lit a bit thinner thicker but I'm hesitate to do it anymore because the if I do it to more like I did it last time too much I that I didn't stop on time last time and it it got too thick and I couldn't I couldn't draw it up into the syringe I have one size one milliliter syringes I couldn't draw it up whereas this will drop now that's so that's cool that's the first time I've been able to do that but I don't think this is D carved enough because it's only been going for if 25 minutes so I'm thinking I'm gonna go inside and get a spatula and then put it in my coffee warmer I'm gonna turn that on and finish it off in there that's my plan okay so I'm gonna tune out okay guys so you saw a little bit of my process okay talk soon", "Me6cluxDlx4": "mrs. underscore 420 underscore Jenny with an eye and that's where we can find you on Instagram yes and I post there David all right so let's why don't you tell us why you take RSL well I started taking RSO basically out of desperation a little over 60 days ago with a multitude of issues and basically I was flat on my back between an unruptured brain aneurism multi knobs or says and my thyroid possible breast cancer which has to be rechecked and a tumor in my abdomen everything how how much RSO are you currently taking today are so I'm taking a full oh I say a full syringe which is 758 milligrams of active THC and it's essentially twice what you see in the package here that I'd say you're taking one of those full surrenders today yes every day what do you experience from that taking that much not at all and and you know I thought it was going to be but you know the point where I started I was already flat on my back I was very sick my skin was gray I couldn't drive my car because of bubble in my head would seem to be getting worse and I could barely move around the house so compared to that I mean this is like living again do I feel high no no I feel healthy and I feel an inner goodness that I didn't feel before it's totally not what I expected I expected that I would be stunned and in the bed but instead got me out of the bed and gave me motivation and a drive that I haven't had inside of me actually in years Wow yeah that is that's what it does it's a healthy lifestyle actually gives me clarity and focus I feel more clear than I've been in years I had a head injury in 2011 and I went with post-concussive syndrome for about a year after that I was hit in the head with an ashtray right the Murano glass ashtray and for about a year after that I had to lay down during the day for you know before I could get back up and it gave me a brain fog and it was taking away my clarity and I just figured that over time my brain would deteriorate it was just something I had accepted and this is changing that I believe is completely healing my brain my brain is more clear than it has been huge I feel like it's reversing everything that happened up here over the last seven eight years since my injury all right well I know that you said you know you have a lot of tests of coming up so we're gonna check back in with you around 100 120 day mark you said you're gonna keep taking this product the rate you're taking it yes so we're gonna check back with you then and just to see how things are going and see if we have and you test results that we can compare we will we have to see an endocrinologist and I have an appointment with the new primary and also will be getting another mammogram and another ultrasound of my abdomen there's lots of doctors appointments coming up oh and uh neurologist so but I'm going to continue to take it until I have all the answers so right now I was just making me feel real really healthy so I hope you guys will check back with us around 100 days subscribe at the button and we'll see you soon take care", "QEWqXEZ__Lg": "hey

the promise of 5g services but to do so the ecosystem needs to closely collaborate to collectively address the challenges of deploying a cloud-native based 5g core network and provide communications service providers with the ability to offer new services joining me now to discuss the importance of the 5g core and deployment strategies are alex quiche vice president network platforms group and general manager y-line and core network division at intel miguel carreras who is director of network and technology planning at verizon and akil gokul who is chief technology officer core and it at ericsson hello everybody and thanks for joining us on our 5g core panel hello thank you alex if i could start with you um what is the industry outlook for the 5g core today and also where are we with technology readiness overall the industry outlook for 5g is actually tracking well along with the 5g deployments that are happening around the world and have been happening for the past couple of years and will continue out through the years to come one of the characteristics of the 5g network is that it's uh virtualized and it's moving to a cloud-native environment and the virtualization of networks actually started not with 5g but you know over like a decade ago with the advent of nfv where the industry started transitioning from very vertically oriented vertically integrated hardware and software solutions for the network and the um decoupling of hardware and software uh started with uh with nfv and it's been happening you know again for you know over the past eight to ten years or so and with the decoupling of hardware and software the solutions that are based on high performance hardware compute communication server technology that powered the network today actually have reached the point where they can scale well with the requirements of the 5g core network and then the software infrastructure from osb's and software solutions coming from leading companies like ericsson have also been modified to take advantage of these off the shelf communication server-based technologies where i think today you have a very uh compelling um and adequate set of solutions to power the 5g core networks um so that's my view i'd love to hear from my colleagues that uh at erickson and at uh verizon so akeel and miguel i'd love to hear your thoughts on on where you see the the 5g outlook and then the technology readiness no thanks alex and you know as you mentioned i think the ecosystem is primed for 5g to scale some of the technology advancements that happen in the 4g world with virtualization we have piki backing on it so 5g is here now we see a lot of traction for the non-standalone deployments and when it comes to ericsson we are there in 45 live networks across 25 countries uh involved with 5g deployments um 5g core is an instrumental part of that it's a cornerstone where you translate connectivity to a user experience you translate connectivity into uh agility and programmability of the network that can be that can be exposed to the end user yeah and so from my perspective i i have to agree with uh alex and i kill both i think we've set the foundation for how we want these networks to work in the future and what we want them to look like for the next 10 years we are well along the way on the 5g side with a lot of deployments around the world including here in the us different services different spectrum assets being put to work on the 5g course specifically i think we're still in the infancy right we we have the first trial systems uh we are kind of grasping how things are going to work in this new cloud-native micro service kubernetes-based architecture and networks and how we're going to be scaling them how we're going to be feeding architectures to use cases and deliver the kind of the promise of 5g thanks everyone miguel if i can continue with you what is the expected timing for the commercial rollout of the 5g standalone core and also what are the main use cases that customers consumers and businesses are demanding which the 5g core will have to process so it's a really good question so we are starting to see some of the first early deployments trial announcements happening around the world with the early adopters um so this is kind of an opportunity for all of us to learn and see how these networks operate how they how they scale how the services can work how the frontline teams can manage and optimize these networks um at the same time the standalone is not just a core player you need the entire ecosystem to be developed so you need the support on the run side on the device and on the chipset so i think we are still early um as i said the early trials and deployments are happening as we speak as far as volumes and massive adoption i think we are uh yeah starting is probably something that's gonna happen over the next two to three years great and akil what are the different paths that your customers can take in order to deliver 5g core when it comes to 5g core there are different aspects you know with 4g you have the virtualization of evp then the early introduction of 5d with option 3x i gave some enhanced capability to the 4g network and when you can't look at 5g core it brings the additional value in terms of cloud native deployment and a new architecture with service based architecture so essentially ericsson approach has been to give flexibility to our service providers to accommodate different starting point the way we have looked at providing this flexibility is with the dual mode 5g core portfolio our dual mode 5g core portfolio essentially incorporates uh 4g epc functionality 5g nsa functionality as well as the 5g core essay functionality and we bring in all of these functional capabilities on a common cloud native platform by doing this we give them flexibility to start in any one of the three tracks we have some operators who i would say have explored the 4g track with technologies like cups as well as bringing in some of the container network functions in the 4g network however the majority of the deployments that we see globally have started with the option 3x this is an area where you know ericsson along with other industry partners and operators um have gravitated towards a 132 approach and that's been very helpful option three towards an option two uh where the ecosystem is focusing in that direction and miguel akiel just spoke there about the different tracks are available what path has verizon chosen to deploy its 5g core and what are the advantages to using this approach so i can actually set up the kind of the my answer really well already right so um we advise we are very happy to see that the ecosystem has kind of settled on this one option three and then evolution to option two approach uh over the last couple of years there was a lot of noise based on the multiple evolution options that 3bp offer moving from epc to 5dc um and so we were concerned and some other like-minded minors were concerned as well that some of those options would end up kind of splitting the resources that had to work in the specifications to solidify something that could actually be implemented so you know definitely very happy to see that this one to three to two is becoming the norm our approach is very aligned to what akil was describing we are building a 5d core with a 10 year out output right so we are building the network that we are going to be using to serve our customers to bring new services for the next 10 years at the same time we have very practical needs as well we we have uh you know 120 some million subscribers generate a lot of usage and we want to move all the traffic to the new core to the directional platform as soon as possible and this concept of a combo architecture where the 5d core can serve the pre-existing option 3x traffic as well as potentially 4g traffic is obviously very compelling to us and we see this as the key enabler for some of the main goals that we're trying to accomplish with the 5d core against offload the traffic we already have be able to offer differentiated services that are consistent no matter what the access technology and then some of the the other more advanced services that will be coming up where we have use cases that will require workloads to be placed in different parts of the network and the 5g core and and the 3pp specs that come with the 5d core provided the flexibility and the elegance right to accomplish some of these new architectures that fit better the use case then you could do it with previous iterations of the core alex this all obviously requires industry collaboration how is the ecosystem working together to bring solutions to market for the 5g core yeah that's uh that's a good question uh it takes a village uh to bring together solutions for the 5g core i think uh you know if you go back to the um the statement i made earlier about the decomposition of hardware and software moving into a virtualized environment moving into cloud native that really unleashes a tremendous amount of innovation of potential across the industry and for leading companies like uh you know verizon to offer really compelling 5g services but that decompos decomposition of hardware and software actually poses different challenges in that where the industry is moving from single vendor solutions to now multi-vendor environments where you have to bring solutions from vendor a working on top of vendor b working on top of vendor c and that sometimes can actually delay the trials and deployments so a big area of focus for the industry and certainly for intel and our partners is to really look at how to deliver pre-integrated pre-configured pre-tested pre-validated solutions so that we can accelerate the trials and accelerate deployments one of the things that intel provides is what we call intel like solutions which are pre-configured solutions that we actually work with a number of different vendors in the ecosystem to drive scale so we test and and we validate these solutions and we know that whoever is going to consume these solutions uh can have the peace of mind that the solutions uh work well um another way we work with the ecosystem um you know let's say with uh with with erickson is to partner with erickson to optimize uh what akil mentioned their uh dual uh core uh aesthetic solutions uh to have that uh instead of suite of applications uh take full advantage of the underlying performance hardware uh so that when we bring these solutions into a service provider network that the solutions we know will work and that actually can actually shorten the time to deployment akil are there any special or new technologies that are you you are designing into your 5g core network products that are making this transition and making the deployments easier and more operationally efficient for operators absolutely if you look at 5g core it is part of the network when it comes to the transformation uh you're taking something that's fundamental and giving an end user experience so from that point of view we see our customers kind of taking a two-fold approach one is to bring in the benefits of cloud native platform web scale platform through their network and the other one is to introduce a new paradigm uh shift in their architecture from a network design perspective with sba and we feel to enable both of those tracks uh we need to provide a set of portfolios uh that enables that smooth migration uh so here erickson we have taken a twofold strategy uh one is to ensure that there is a smooth horizontal integration so erickson brings capabilities not only with the core technologies with 5g but also on the radio side and the i.t side of the house so we enable an end-to-end functional validation which helps accelerate the adoption of ig core technologies the other area that we focus is to be agnostic and dovetail very well into existing investment made when it comes to northbound integration with regards to orchestration and management systems the approach is to build upon existing investments in etsy in aligned with new disruptions coming with own app and things of that nature on the southbound side when deploying on cloud native platforms we have taken a cloud native first approach we work very closely with the cncf community and by doing that our applications are agnostic and can sit on top of any cloud platform uh we've also focused on some other areas of innovation to help this transition which are more focused on the operational aspects by not losing sight of the needs on the 4g network which gets translated to 5g but at the same time bringing the innovation and new capabilities that cloud native behavior brings to the table so it's an amalgamation of both that we're trying to find a nice balance and provide it to our service providers in addition we have focused on couple of areas of innovation particularly to make the network more programmable and expose network assets to our end customers so there is an emphasis on the exposure capability and then one of the benefits of 5g core is you get much more granular ways of defining your policies and your quality of experience and we want to enable that to be translated to the end customer the other area and i think alex mentioned about this briefly is talking about how we can look at performance we're talking about low latency high bandwidth very fast throughput high throughput fast fees and there is there's a focused attention that we are working with partners like intel verizon and others in the ecosystem to drive high performance applications for your forage or your edge computing scenarios thank you akil miguel can i ask why is the 5g core built on it on a service based architecture so that's probably one of my favorite questions guy and i think akil again said the the foundation pretty good here um so if you think about what we are trying to get with the 5d core from architecture perspective we'll eventually have a core that's a lot more complex than what we've had in the past with previous generations right so different slices different network functions which might be shared by multiple slices or fully dedicated to an individual slice depending on the use case and they will have another functions that are decomposed into microservices so this these networks are more complex you have more instances to manage and those instances have to communicate if you think about how things are done in the 4d core today and in other legacy technologies most of the relationships between the applications is very point to point you tell application a that for a given code flow or use case it needs to talk to application b and there is one or a limited set of ways to reach that application well so if you try to apply that same principle to that architecture of the future that we'll have in the 5v core it could be impossible to manage i we we need basically a network where service discovery is built into the very foundation of the software from day one that enables their automation orchestration and they provide the flexibility that accomplishes two things like this very complex network has to be simple to be operated therefore uh you have service orchestration you have self healing at the same time you have the flexibility that customers are looking for at the end of the day we are building a core yes for us engineers will have nothing like a very expensive tool and we have to deliver value to our customers and what do our customers want is the services that the ecosystem will dream of the ones that we don't even know are coming yet they'll have some very specific requirements and the expectations will be that the 5d core and the 5g ecosystem overall will help us meet those requirements to support those services immediately super fast right so that's one of the goals that we we need service-based architecture for and then if we think about the enterprise side of things the enterprises want to be able to differentiate different traffic types they want to prioritize for example sensors over tablets they want to accomplish their latency goals for mission critical applications while some of the other traffic is still best effort and so we will have to get a network that's very dynamic and programmable to me in those different requirements and sba is a big component of that and moving forward what is the role of the central office yeah that's a really good question guy and so when you think about the the conversation with just adam service based architecture the role of the different locations within the network is going to evolve and the next generation central office is a good example like we will have a future in which the border between mobility services fixed services kind of blurries will will have um what used to be only the river over fiber will be delivered over wireless now and we'll want to make sure we have a consistency and that comes a different set of requirements right you might have um different amounts of throughput the different types of what's the regular busy hour or the typical user behavior and we'll have to be able to customize the set of features and even the architecture of the applications that serve this new generation central office the needs of a fixed wireless service or a traditional fiber service are very different from mobility service so service based architecture will help us identify what services the customer wants what technology we need to make sure we meet the requirements of that service and where those workloads should be placed within the network alex building on what mcgill has just talked about what has intel done from a platform perspective to support and address this service based architecture sure yeah intel has done a lot of things just from a platform perspective to address the service based architecture and actually to provide you know uh the best uh optimized resources you know for and in service of this this architecture you know starting with uh with our um xeon processors of course cpus uh that that power much of the the infrastructure we've made general generation and generation enhancements uh to uh the cpus to optimize on communications workloads and then from a platform perspective we see what we can do working with not just cpus but with a network interface cards to implement features such as ddp or dynamic device personalization to optimize traffic flows towards the cpu cores to get even more performance for specific comms workloads like packet processing for uh and in service of this uh these architectures and then we've also done a lot of plug-ins uh into uh the cloud-native foundation into cncf to expose more of these platform-level features so that the network applications the the cloud-native applications a lot of complexity of what miguel was talking about can actually be exposed to the applications and the applications can take full advantage of them uh without necessarily having to know exactly what's in the hardware itself right so working with vendors in the uh abstraction layers to expose a lot of the goodness that the the hardware infrastructure provides uh to power up this the services based uh architecture that is the 5g core a question for all of you now and let's start with akil if i can ask you first what do you think are some of the future challenges moving forward with 5g core network and its deployment right so if i look at future challenges um what i see in the short term period between you know the 2021 time frame there's going to be a lot of emphasis to industrialize the network right we are bringing in new technologies from a platform point of view uh in addition we're also bringing the new architecture so there'll be an emphasis on industrializing giving the operational ease and having a sense of familiarity to build upon if you look beyond that the emphasis is really on the programmable nature of the network and exposing capabilities um so there you know we're looking for innovation um you know we're looking for more value-added services that can move beyond the core network and build up on what we can do with slicing technologies uh service agility to bring up new dedicated networks um and things of that nature so i see the challenges kind of twofold in the very beginning it's all about industrialization getting the adoption uh having a smoother transition between the forging networking network um and in parallel there is going to be a sense of uh you know leveraging the capabilities uh you know towards the enterprise customers or or building upon uh you know as media mentioned earlier use cases for the consumer segment with the gaming and things of that nature so uh we see a combination of both and what is going to be pivotal is making sure that journey is as smooth as possible indeed and miguel what future challenges do you foresee speaking on kind of a kill sensor so i i when i look at my current function i see two main challenges even within verizon right so i i serve two communities of internal customers i have to be very mindful of what services i enable my marketing and product team to build right so we can provide value to the customers and we can generate the revenue but obviously it's how we deliver value back to our stakeholders so that's critical at the same time i have an equally important set of customers downstream that are going to be running this network so one of the challenges that i see is we are rolling on a lot of technology a lot of this technology is new uh for us and us and uh you know with flexibility that the technology provides comes complexity as well so i think it's gonna be critical for all of us really represented in this call and alex also touched on this is to build a very robust tool set that helps the teams that effectively run these very complex large networks operate them to the level of performance that we've grown accustomed to and beyond in a way that is simple right this uh you know it should be easy for the the downstream teams to be able to tell what is and isn't working and be able to take actions to remediate issues as they happen so we are those two are top of mind and then the third one when looking at the ecosystem outside is i think the promise of five is so significant um there are so many things that we can do with this technology that we also will have to manage our customers expectations right the the industry has done a really good job at communicating what we are thinking and what type of services we can support and what type of capabilities we'll be able to expose with that comes a lot of excitement obviously from the ecosystem and our customers and now we have to make sure that we can explain how things work what's realistic at different uh points in the journey that we are just embarking on and uh and kind of how can they derive uh incremental value from these networks that we're going to be building and alex what future challenges do you see ahead you know i think uh miguel and akil captured you know a lot of the uh the the sentiment um you know and i share that um it's this is truly uh a journey uh that we're that we've embarked on and we're really at the beginning of the journey uh if you look at the short-term challenges it's really about making this complexity uh you know easy to consume and you know i think of that in the context of you know working with companies like erickson to deliver consumable solutions to miguel and then you've heard from miguel actually a completely new paradigm of making it easy for his customers for verizon's customers to be able to consume both on the enterprise side and on the consumer side and so while i believe that we have a a robust set of technologies that actually can come together uh in an integrated fashion to support this services based architecture that is the new 5g core network there's still a lot of work to be done uh relative to making it very simple uh to deploy to operate uh to manage to orchestrate and then on top of that it's um miguel talked about this as well being able to host services that we don't even know uh really have a good grasp of you know which ones will be the very successful ones so there's a lot of experimentation going on and so just to have the foundational flexibility to accommodate these new use cases uh exciting use cases uh that that 5g promises i i think will be uh you know will be an exciting and yet challenging uh you know instead of times ahead of us and miguel i just want to pick up on your your previous comment about the ecosystem what would be your request to the ecosystem to make core deployments easier and quicker probably my favorite question right out of all of them so so i'm going to start by obviously acknowledging and thanking the panels that are represented here right so we have intel and ericsson are both critical partners for verizon uh we have a number of efforts that are uh are ongoing with both of them right uh deploying new solutions and new technologies so a phenomenal amount of work has gone into getting us to where we are now and we all need to pause and take a minute and reflect upon the advancements in the technology with coding already at the same time we are demanding we are demanding customers we have a lot of expectations for this network all right so i'll start with a reference to my cfo if you allow me for a second right so our cfo always says verizon is an ant company not an oil company and so as alex and the kill have mentioned uh things that we have that we expect from the ecosystem is collaboration that allow us to be keeping an ant company and what i mean by that is we need for example to derive the maximum performance out of every cloud resource that we put in the network right we have to optimize how we use our assets at the same time and that will allow us to provide the best performance at the same time we need to do that while optimizing the price point so we can pass the service on to the customer right this is a competitive marketplace so that's that's a critical one uh collaboration has to continue uh some of the things that we've seen embracing open source the cloud native foundation uh tool said um leveraging the tools that partners like intel provides right so there are a lot of tools in the toolbox so how can we leverage them to ensure that that vision of a torque performing network that provides services that never stop evolving it's another key ask to the ecosystem and then kind of like we we all need to think about i guess in terms of open interfaces and open apis including ourselves as seminars uh so much what we are going to be building it will be the foundation for the companies that will develop the services that will write these capabilities to do what they do right innovate and offer creative solutions that solve pain points for our customers and a lot of these require us to be able to expose network capabilities apis and so on so i would say this this collaboration in the ecosystem where i think at times the the border between us customers and rental partners are no longer there we are both a customer and a vendor to our vendors we provide our platform reactors integrators so we can no longer operate in silos this is a goal that will have to build this network that will allow us to deliver the value of 5g and we added it together and we need to keep working together basically so that's my ask to the system micrologin how much progress we've made and this is good and we still have to do more in which they have to do better thank you miguel and also thanks to alex and akil for joining us and explaining the importance of the 5g core and its ongoing development don't forget you can watch additional interviews and discussions on 5g as part of the intel network and edge vsumit series for now though thank you for watching and goodbye you", "lC7spjFs2RY": "hey Pennsylvania patience it's me Medical Mary and we're gonna have an RS snow day the first thing that you have to do is learn how to open one of these packages so there's usually place right up here where you squeeze it and boom there it is microscope packaging is a little different so when this is closed you have to pinch it and then squeeze it open so a lot of the irises are a little thicker and you don't want to break the packaging so I soaked them in a cup of hot water for about two minutes the Terrapin click cartridges can be a little tricky to open you have to pinch and pull and it's real easy because you just dial it up to pull it anything out so what do we put that stuff in a lot of people bake with it but I have a little trick package of starbursts take them flatten it out kind of like this you take the RSO you click out the amount that you want and you just put it on there and roll it up in a ball the Crisco dispensers are a little easier to use but harder to dose see you twist and pull on this and with the plunger you have to push out but not too much make sure you put the dose right in there put that right back on there and then that you have your starburst you roll that up into a ball and there's your nose from the road so that's my little trick on how to make one day with 2dos fine doses to carry with you why did the cattle keep coming back to the marijuana fields it was calling the cattle back that's my easy trick to make as many doses of RSO as you want and why did the cattle keep coming back to the marijuana fields it was the pot calling the cattle back you", "Re1VZwJavR8": "today really just I was about to do a distillation for meditation over the next couple weeks and thought I would try and do a better video than some that I have posted trying to go through the process a little bit at least with what I do you know this mayor cannot be right or wrong he's given the equipment that I have so one thing I wanted to talk about here was the difference in Chinese glass box or glass I guess that's one thing that was passed in one of my other videos and they mentioned that there was an article mentioning toxins in the glass now personally I've been smoking for probably 20 years or more this is something I've never heard of I've used bikes from the cheapest finished glass you know two bucks at the convenience store to the more expensive types of pipes like 80 90 bucks a head for just a basic plate you know I could see a difference a lot of it I've never heard of the toxins I've never read about we seen anybody to mention it in the article that I didn't read about it it was like somebody who you know I'd say they probably had an idea but it also didn't apply to laboratory glassware they were speaking specifically at players now I don't know about toxins but one thing what I do know about the Chinese glass for the office was causing problems but stuff like this work comes down to his tolerances and inconsistencies in the glass like you're gonna have you know the glass is not going to be you don't want thickness it may not be the best quality of borosilicate either it's they probably use something cheaper but if you use the types of soft glass mention in the article in this type of application the heat would absolutely destroy it so the other problem we've got with the Chinese type of glass are these ground joints here where they may not may not make a perfect steel you know you'll never really see it unless it's really really bad but if it can't make a perfect ceiling here you're gonna end up with say maybe this is just a little bit longer than it should be so the tolerances will be will be different they'll be way out a lot more than what you would see and say american-made glassware they're tall matches are gonna be really really close so that's one that's one of the issues were running to there and what happens when like this is too long or especially too short as this heats up you know it expands and then this joint will actually it'll fall in just slightly and as it cools down it'll grab that and it basically you know prevents that swipe from ever coming out again that's where you went into less of those problems with american-made glass also there's there's the the sealing ability here now you always need to use vacuum grease on these but with a really good quality Canadian or American made glass from a reputable company you would find that you could get a vacuum seal without using any grease or additional stuff in there but that would not be good because again you'd go back to welding your joints together and things like that so you always want to use a greasing so that being said this is just the quote-unquote cheap distillation unit you know it's not it's made by some offshore company so it does the trick but it could be better like I'm pretty sure I run into packing leaks and things like that there's no insulation around globe flasks and other such things like that where you see improvements like that on the American stuff also your electronics in here these are very cheap electronics so it doesn't have the accuracy in temperature it does about the same plate control that something better would happen where this just controls the temperature by a thermal probe and basically turning the heating on and on and off repeatedly you know to maintain a temperature a more professional unit will use wattage control where it'll actually just adjust [Music] the amount of current going into the heating element instead of turning on and off it's actually regulating regulating the current that's feeding it so that you have a more accurate more steady temperature so not all being said now I would like to get this [Music] I just like to every night at the back you pump right [Music] and I've reached over my shoulder down to zero so I [Music] another thing I wanted to talk about here is the back in Greece I started off using this Dow Corning's but the person I think it's garbage it's thick it's it's sold us back in Greece but it seems to leak through the joints no matter how little I use or doesn't create a perfect seal if I don't use just the perfect amount you don't need a lot anyway what I've started using here is krytox GPL 207 which it's a little thinner it's not marketed as back in Greece but it's a parent induct and a fighter temperature resistance so when you're using this stuff you really don't need a lot a little little dab on there just a little dab will be it's hard to do with one hand and then so on your joint you would just apply a little bit of that is down the edge there just like that even that looks like quite a bit there I don't like to come all the way down to the bottom on this piece just because this doesn't see a lot of the heat and I you know I don't like the trip to seep into the joiner end up running past now but how do you pull the vacuum this will thin out it'll really in the filament will pull into the rest of the joint you do have to make sure to actually put enough on there though otherwise you'll still end up with joints that are hard during just put a little bit on there like that and you stick that in the joint you just spin it back and forth until you get a nice clear joint seal showing that like it's easier to spend titles so here's how to properly grease the join now I've got a nice thin little coating on that side that side put it in there carefully just minutes with the devil corny grease it tends to make the joint nice and clear I've noticed with the cry box it doesn't clarify it as much they just spin it there and you shouldn't feel any any glass grinding together get you just feel smooth all the way around that's nice and snug and stay longer I'm actually gonna clean house and as is your joint don't forget to put a cat clip on it there should be plenty enough grease one thing to take note up here do not forget your [ __ ] stir bar because I do this just about every time and I have to take this out plop it in there and we grease that joint make sure you put your spare bar in there every time I'm about ready to get this started now I get my cold trap cold and for anybody wondering what the purpose of this bowl here is the goal trap will collect any of the vapors and they'll drip down into this blast now the extra cold will help also condensed extra [Music] boiling installing cycling so with everything hooked up greased up everything's cold vacuums been running for a while and gotta like glasses together so the first thing I'm gonna do is run it back to you and don't worry about that little dog this is the flash don't fly called a joke this I mean it will cause some certain problems as it will also try to boil and want to vaporize compounds that are still in it but that's already distillate so this should be pretty negligible and yes I should have taken the time to clean that better but the other two that will collect everything are clean much better and as this is just for personal use I'm okay with this yeah I'm not too concerned about that right there so the first thing we're gonna end up doing here is turn on a vacuum gauge also this PVC pipe isn't hooked up that was an experiment before I was going to run in public that PVC is just not the way to go it off gases and a week too and it just there's there's too many points of leakage so it's just not word that maybe some Dale gold stainless steel but right now that's just not you know it's it's not in the foreseeable future so I'm just using the government roses and then [ __ ] everything up or whatever I need at the time the vacuum regulator just hooked up because for other purposes if you did that great out of the way out of the back and pump through the table into the vacuum regulator - bull trout so whenever I need to use anything else I just I just unscrew that fitting there screwing whatever appropriate fitting I need so right now for for the distillation I'm just going to do turn it on and set it to pull back in because we don't need any regulation here it's probably isn't the greatest pump but I'll worry about these problems a little bit later down the road for us to change the oil I just changed out while the singular form works next another the dryers as well [Music] smells pretty clear to you this is just a reservoir [ __ ] chambers in here so question they tell you almost impossible through here [Music] missiles you gotta be careful in your film because we have company [Music] so just be wary about it got one of these pumps right now I'm just pulling you back c'mon I'm gonna let that pull down as low as it'll go before I even start heating it up as you can see is kind of slow with this welcome other part of this problem is my lines could be dirty so you know there's terpenes and stuff collected absorbed into the lines and they're gonna be vaporizing and off-gassing as well so that's another thing that'll affect your vacuum level another thing that I'm aware of and we'll try to address in the future see what I can do about that so I'm aware of some of the problems that I have here another one should be this should be robbers I guess in some tip while I'm not really sure what I should wrap it with I'm going out there how quickly you're done oh yeah but how does of great now like when this is running this is just acting as a condenser as well I'm going I did try packing the head with stainless steel steel wool I wasn't really sure how much of there's also the condensation that bill here which is an issue running degrees so that's another thing they're going to take care of possibly wrap that up so there's there's key things that I'm aware of that I need to fix that could improve the distillation overall we'll see how long this takes it's just about one o'clock in the afternoon I'm hoping to get started here by one o'clock and see how long it takes to get through this whole process thing so right now we're sitting at 1,200 with this particular batch I have done more filtering on this than dispatches okay I kept filtering it through stage one and full of a stop boat that I really freeze up to 24 hours again we filtered it through stage one and I kept doing that if there was nothing coming through in stage one there are nothing getting left behind the filters to stage one which I wasn't doing previously and I probably should have been actually I definitely should have been alive and I repeated that through stage two and stage three as well so what's in here is has been more filter than anything that I put in previously so I'm curious to see what kind of an effect last thing you have going with this with this current class of distillation and what's in there right now is just to put exactly 1,000 grams fully winterized and filtered plenty of oil they you know make thanks to a closed loop system actually made to a terminator style system so here we are at 9:20 so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna let that just sit for a while without backing pull-down we'll come back when that's that's not a star I've been holding steady at 860 for a while got a pretty good boil there I mean realistically I'd like to see it not boiling but someone's car cleaning it up now [Applause] I'm gonna heat up to 50 degrees you're running before I start turning on the starboard point of advice if you want your driving school last a little longer one thing that makes a good seal not let any moisture in there because it hit moisture freezes and then encouraged to do a block of dry ice to do is just stuff it all blankets or towels or whatever in this remove all the air space that you tend from the dry place and this will last the cooler I'll have this pool of dry ice in a couple of days and I constantly use it topping this thing off making sure it stays cold that's the process for now it's just going to be one once it hits 50 degrees start going up by 30 degrees so then I'll heat it up as soon as it is 50 I'll ramp it up to 80 and then from 80 I'll go to 110 and so on and so forth like that usually once I get to about 180 I've seen a bit of reaction from water and other call the files and stuff up here and ahead so I will hold it there at that temperature for a while we'll let that stuff collect into the ship blast so I haven't had a bit of an opportunity here and I see we have boiled up a little bit [Music] but it's not 60 degrees right now all should be 56 overshot that's already pointing system so at this point now since it's not Ronnie Emma on the skewer because we see over there 1,050 [Music] the pressures come up because the vapors in here well this is the first time ever you do this to me only goes so fast that we're gonna stop [Music] except this 286 the other thing too is this is a PID so it's gonna learn it know if I want to get to 50 I'm gonna end up going up to 80 anyway so I guess it's kind of learning that it came to order shoot the temperature a little bit stupid [ __ ] but this is where your this is the difference between your basic PID and something that actually controls the wattage right now I'm pretty sure that's just collecting water and ethanol but only mostly ethanol what was left after the evaporation process the reclamation so this unfortunately won't be reclaimed it will just be thrown out I just about at 180 now pretty vigorous reaction going on I'm honestly not sure if it's supposed to happen what this right now this isn't anything good this is just the about earlier least I think it is anyway so in this pointing I've been told these puffs of smoke are not good [Music] I can't remember the reason why and I'm not running entirely correctly with myself can leave your song [Music] so I will just hold this here for a little until this reaction stops basically distilled all out just got pure stuff here over the right now we're in 860 so it's been just about an hour come up to this temperature get here of course that our like it's gone up to a Nazi 1200 [Music] gen-i smoking stuck there too Nessa's tough innings of is out there the bus now if I had a secondary cold trap on there I'm sure so I know this server stuff didn't like - all this hold America last one during about ten minutes later you're taking the reaction up here stock for the most part I stopped collecting stuff as a pastor [Music] [Applause] start turning because this would take a while [Music] hormone when this to exchange so slope is still down at 790 microns now [Music] about 220 now and [Music] after twenty twelve hundred microns was lower I was starting to see a little bit reaction here so I've set the temperature up to 230 and I want to stop it when I start having a reaction here 46 degrees at the head I'm going to junk this is starting to get a little bit more yellow kind of a bit a little bit thicker oh I also set this up once this hit [Music] so probably by the time this event of 225 or 220 6w3 in addition to 25 right now with 154 point two degrees and temperature dropping at the head well 50 micron 2-minute 86\u00b0 I'm actually going to hold that right there that is now 240 in the afternoon when I started this about one o'clock from here I am our 40 minutes in see this is running by the Chinese stuff that's gonna overshoot the temperature not measuring correctly as to why to swing hysteresis I only seen a really big clean reflux rate in this setup once or twice I mean no one wants your twice but I mean just to replicate it every time I probably turn around run for a bit michalak [Music] so it's 3:45 started except one I had the temperature such as a little too either to 35 and it's kind of boiling over but it has gotten to the fraction looking for I think it looks pretty good the most part yeah some kind of something's showing up I'm not sure what it was but so far this looks pretty good here another got this stuff coming down before coming down it was little green colors like this because he [Music] I'm so willing to do now is I'll rotate this over and begin collecting this fraction and collected in this separate jar here yeah rotated cow turn the temperature down 230 actually keep this one 2:33 instead so collecting distraction I think I have noticed that I've got I mean you see it down there very well little bubbles right there in my class I'm sure how they came about or where they came from [Music] I believe this is the hearts hearts fraction I wanna say but I don't know also not really sure with those little bubbles I run I think it's just an air bubbles I want to save all this I hope it is it looks like it is [Music] I'm sure this looks like animals [Music] and there's old that's collected someone that will be I guess wildest one and then I put this stuff into it our container later right after all the same process I gotta collect all the garbage and let it sit this fraction that off [Music] [Applause] and so far so far just looking like the nicest distillate I've produced out of this which I attribute to the extra filtration that I'm wrong see how it looks on collects an alert so while 280 degrees when we got eleven fifty microns not ideal I was able to pull a lower vacuum on this and the temperature would be much lower than the same results right now it's five o'clock now so that's been going for about four hours a couple hours since I actually started to cover it it's another nine hundred and sixty microns now we're degrees up in the head to put it 32-bit 50:33 it seemed to be working pretty well so bit of oil over but in the most part I guess it's working okay this what's already here there was at some point there's a little white cloudy [ __ ] showing up I'm not really sure what it was but it's not there now it's not showing I'm done here this in a second distillation with help I'm not sure what that [ __ ] is it keeps showing up in here I have never shown like one of my other videos I'm not really sure how it started why it started it's not something that I've always seen and quite frankly and really saw in flesh and doing all the filtration so that's what confuses me the more but I don't see anything down here and now right from there we are a couple hundred grands who goes [Music] this is actually pretty clear the stuff that you see in there there's a lot of air bubbles it's hard to see on camera but you know what right there right there a little I feel swirl thing that's that murky [ __ ] that I was we play those bongos across there down from the top goes over there [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and that seems like a lot but I eat about five or six grams probably about 10 grand you're just eating this [Music] 20 up there 6 evening now and I'm pretty much just gonna wrap this up on you there's a bit left in there I'm sure there's a lot I could collect still I don't feel like letting it run all night it's director slow down and get a lot of character so [Music] Kangra doesn't really show it too well there's there's a lot of stuff on the outside of the glass that's showing up in here there's some air bubbles and what's dirtier than it really is but it's not it's not that very this however this does look a little bit cleaner still less air bubbles it's a higher heat yeah I did turn this up specifically so I would get a higher boiling right but even now I can see it's starting to slow down there somewhat so it's about at this point I'm just going to shut it off here and we got we're at 10:50 so I find pretty disappointing a lot of times that dullness I've been able to achieve a lot lower results in fact a couple of times by this point I've been down to probably 200 or less microns so I've definitely got some issues here and I'm welcome some of these got some suggestions or nonsensical help me out I call that some people suggestions and done what I hadn't but at this point I'm not sure just too much too much more I can this is certainly clogged up you got a goblin come down there you want some [ __ ] that's one thing that having problems with usually that starts happening at the beginning it causes trouble the whole way through but when that plugs up the boiling air stops I'm going to give it a little bit water - for sure color week too low 6:30 6:40 [Music] now you can see where it blocks where it becomes plugged and stops the boiling across it's still going there's not a click still a bit in there I'm just a little pressed for time this evening unfortunately so [Music] well I do when I shut this down I just turn the temperature way and just back down to zero and I'll let this cool down under packaging all still running because if I unplug this right now if I disconnect a vacuum right now this will fill up with smoke I don't really like doing that I don't like it and smoke in there it's all about you're in a while to cool down and then disconnect all files and applause playing out with the next and four blasts into the jars did you make a medicine so I just released a vacuum on that bye I loosened up this time I just kind of pulled it that'll do with support so I want to collect that stuff my trusty heatgun here [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] when you're cool enough heat gun to mine has a cool setting [Music] any rate when you pull off your heat gun you're always going to want to put it up like that will maintain the light to your heat gun and be less dangerous because unless the heat escape up inside that's just a this is a little FYI I'm gonna turn the pump in here there we go we'll call now today I said I'll just pull these once it's out here like so and before I have to you know wipe up the grease inside there and we have I'm not gonna lie I'm not gonna try and you know I'm not gonna be anything I'm sure I could have better results I just don't know how I would love to have better results perhaps I would be able to consume less of it on a daily basis but for the time being it is what it is this is pretty much what I did it looks pretty golden and nice when you look at it you know in a syringe or in a little on a little jar something like that piece of glass until the drunk did it take in there like I said I'll recycle that that plainly stuff in the bottom yeah I love your backs and that's kind of stuck but you know it can be recycled it's gonna be cracked and so I just don't like waste and if I can waste as little as possible I will should we got that up I'll set that to uh turn off for about you meter the condenser so I'll take that part this is some little and that's it for today that's just from that distillation thanks for watching everybody", "3fjZFZwdU7M": "[Music] for 5g as with the previous generation of technologies the most key assets is doctrine therefore extremely important to maximize the value of spectrum in the following time we're going to address two aspects of doing it first we're going to look at why contiguous band is very very helpful and then we're going to address the spectrum sharing first remember when we address the 2.6 gigahertz there are two modes of allocation compared to the allocation mode of fdd plus tdd combination the mode with band 41 removes the need for garbage moreover the contiguous band has two key advantages one it could reduce the number of required network modules even though we do have available inner markets a single modular with ibw as large as 400 megahertz second even if it's possible to cover two non-contiguous bands with one single modular using carrier aggregation that's still associated overhead with the carrier aggregation that needs to be taken into account in a transition to 5g we probably can all agree that 5g and lte are going to coexist for a long time if we do have sufficient new spectrum preferably we will go with nr only for the new spectrum however in many cases there is a need where we would like to accommodate both lte and nr with the same spectrum therefore some of the substrate events can be gradually migrated to nr for the sake of better coverage or better oblique there are actually three ways to accommodate both lt and r with spectrum assets first is by static reforming of part of the legacy frequency bands for example we can refine 10 megahertz out of 20 megabytes of lte for nr or we can accommodate both technologies with 20 megahertz the key values of the iss knows its flexibility i.e on-demand spectrum allocation based on the traffic from one single technology compared to static reforming dss can possibly allocate more resources to one technology when there's more traffic from that site thus improving the overall spectrum efficiency the third and the ideal approach is to add ftdnr onto a new spectrum like 700 megahertz in a few countries for the scat during the fdd dss in a frequency domain the minimum scheduling my granularity is rb meaning that we can change the allocation to lt or nr from rb to rb in the time domain it can switch every millisecond that's also possible to have different priority settings for sharing or we can prioritize lte by giving a higher portion of traffic to lte or we can set up a fair sharing between lt and ar this can be extremely useful as the starting phase of 5g when we have low penetration of 5g devices and we would like to assign smaller portion of traffic to nr but dynamic spectrum sharing is no free launch since we are accommodating both lte and ngo with the same spectrum the reference signals of lte such as cris are sent no matter what here comes the lte cris ray matching which means the genob would have to punch out the resource elements corresponding to the lte cis and do not feel the data the terminals needs to punch out the cis resource elements as well in 3gpp specification it is mandatory for the ues to signal whether it supports dss and when which band in case of non-support of dss of certain terminals it can be refused to access the network in terms of the device ecosystem we already have the mainstream set vendors being supporting dss now regarding the overhead for the cis it is always there no matter whether there's a lt traffic being sent the lt overhead for nr is even higher if we have a full port compared to two port the overhead can represent up to 30 percentage of capacity for the nr without one single lt bit being set we do have some approaches to alleviate the problem for example by using mbs and subframe but it also comes at some sacrifice of the performance of lte legacy terminals before tm9 for the next step we are planning to continue to improve our dss with the hybrid dss by high rate dss we mean we can have a nr with larger bandwidth than lte for example 25 megahertz for nr and 20 for lte thus we can have a exclusive nr portion where we putting all the nr signaling to avoid the conflict with lte signaling meanwhile in a shared portion since we don't have nr signaling that gives higher capacity for the lte the value of hybrid dss are multiple phases one since nr signaling exists only in the nr exclusive portion of spectrum there's no need for lte and bsfn lasts no impact on the lte experiences two it is possible to have a larger nr bandwidth than 20 megahertz as of the day three better compatibility with 5g devices 5g devices which does not support the dss can still access the exclusive portion of nr 4 short latency services are for the nr exclusive portion since there's no need to wait for its share of rb it reduces the latency for tdd dss it is managed rather differently every sometime the uplink downlink prb usage or the number of users is being uploaded and every seven minutes that is decision needs to be made whether to be switching between lt and agr based on the load stats from different technologies and priority policy one carrier can be used by only one technology at one point of time regarding how to switch one carrier between lt and nr lt vrd synonymous setting and nrvr active vwp configuration in summary we have addressed two key subjects in maximizing the spectrum value one is the importance of having contiguous and a large span of spectrum can help lower the cost improve the capacity and improve the efficiency second we have addressed the true pros and cons of dynamic spectrum sharing dss brings great flexibility on the table that's why it choose a lot of interest but it's not civil bullet either it brings our heads since we are accommodating both technologies with the same spectrum therefore the choice between dss and static nr reforming needs to be made case by case network by network this is all for this section on how to maximize spectrum value thank you", "SfPjBMahBOI": "hello everyone my name is Rick Simpson and I've always promoted natural ways of growing cannabis because I think it's much more beneficial than healthy for us now I want people to understand something I mean on my website Phoenix tears dossier I've never allowed anyone to doing advertising I always felt that you know someone's going to that website they're there to learn information not to be bothered with other people's products but quite a few years ago I came in contact with the gentleman named Matthew fingerling and he he had built several different setups for you know for growing canvas you know what I think is quite a rational way and and you know over the years he kept sending me you know you know updates and videos of what he's been doing and to tell you the truth I have to say I think the work this man is doing is fabulous you know he's designed these expandable grow systems they you know basically you could expand it to whatever size you want but it promotes growing in a natural way you know instead of chemicals and things of that nature the setup he has you know you can easily use like natural teas and things like that you know to feed the plants the nutrients they need so and on top of that the the way he's designed this it's all wheelchair accessible you know I think he's kind of a wonderful line you know these different growth systems so this is the reason I'm promoting this you know it's not that this has nothing to do with money there's no contract between me and Matthew I simply believe that this is something that people need to know and this is a wonderful way to grow in cannabis so this is really what it's all about it this is not about money I'm getting no money for doing this but I wouldn't say that you know it would be to the benefit of so many people today you know who wish to grow indoors and things of that nature I think they should go to riverbanks and have a good look that what Matthew you know the equipment that Matthew is making available and this man knows a great deal about groaning - so there will be a link to a clip you know that'll take you to weld it'll take you to a boaters I think it's 35 minutes long Matthew does tend to go into detail quite deeply but I think that a lot of the growers would appreciate that and you know I hope that people will go there and take a strong look at you know at the products you know that he's providing because I think they do make a good sense and all I can do really is wish Matthew the best you know with River phonics I hope that this is a business that will grow because and I believe it you know using this system could help a great number of people so I hope you'll go to his website and you know and look over what he has to offer and I think you might find it to your benefit thank you very much", "wSsRa4d34L4": "reaction has been Swift since yesterday's Supreme Court of Canada ruling expanding the definition of medical marijuana it now means pop brownies cannabis oil all legal for people with a prescription it was welcome news for some parents including Alex for Patsy whose daughter Gwen has epilepsy he's been giving her cannabis oil three times a day to help control her seizures she joins us in studio today thank you for coming in to talk about this so essentially you've been doing this but it's been illegal yeah we've been we've been doing it for eight months legally obtaining the dried cannabis with a prescription note from doctor etc etc it's been illegal to convert it to oil she doesn't smoke so it's the only choice and tell me about your daughter's life before you gave her a medicinal marijuana and after so if I rewind nine months to last October she couldn't really do much she could barely sit on her own she was still having seizures she had been on eight different medications anti epileptic drugs none of them controlled the seizures she was having massive subclinical activity so it's basically seizing constantly in the brain so subclinical activity meaning seizures are going on you may not see it you don't see it at all no but they're happening so it's basically turmoil and chaos all the time and throughout this your daughter's ability to grow on all levels you know emotionally physically is stunted yes her development basically halted we're continuing the therapy but she wasn't acquiring skills almost at all you were your wit's end we certainly were and then you decided to try this medical marijuana and at first what did the doctor say you know when you said you wanted to do this well I actually thought about it about eight months before that or a year before that and maybe 14 months and doctors initially were kind of like no there's not enough research I presented them with a lot of logical arguments academic sources of data anecdotal reports and one of our doctors was kind enough to take the time to comb through all of that and decided that although he can guide me on dosing he didn't feel it would hurt her in any way and nothing else was working so he gave us a prescription and how did how soon did you notice the difference well we started her on a low dose after I made the first batch of oil and got the lab test results back the second day she had a minor seizure this was November mid November and then after that she has not had a seizure since even a subclinical nothing we had a her seventeenth eg in January and it showed no seizure activity at all nothing yeah how does that make you feel that this is you know something that you've provided the quality of life for her however it's great I mean she's now she's crawling she's learning to walk she's playing with toys she's feeding herself she's bothering her brother her quality of life is a thousand percent increase you know probably fair to say as a parent you're gonna do whatever it takes of course do that legal or not legal but now that it's legal how does that help you out well I was willing to do it before and I did but now that there's no fear of prosecution it takes a weight off and hopefully opens the doors to two other people having better access and research yeah

topic of 5g radio bands is always key when it comes to deployments around the world and before we go into you know what's available it's worth remembering that we already have 4G LTE radio bands in existence and here are some of the key bands that you'll find in different parts of the world now it's worth pointing out not every country has access to all of these different frequency bands now as we go into 5g what you'll find is some of these frequency bands are being pulled into 5g straight away so some service riders are utilizing them but it's worth pointing out from a standards perspective don't assume that all of these historic LTE bands are available for 5g that's not the case so in the first phase of 5g what we're finding is this the majority are available for effectively 5g operation but not all of them and so we have a set of frequencies now this set of frequencies for 5g comes under this heading of fr1 or frequency range one so all of these frequencies here are part of F R one so it's 5g frequency range one now historically we would call that this or the sub 6 gigahertz band but as you can see it goes over 6 gigahertz up to nearly 7 gigahertz we also have a frequency range to in Phi G commonly referred to as millimeter wave and this is because the radio wave as you hit about 24 gigahertz you'll find that the wave that the RF radio wave is measured in millimeters hence the term millimeter wave now in terms of the global if you like dry for 5g what you'll find is the 3.5 gigahertz band has got the most global momentum around the world and obviously that's one of the key 5g radio bands that people are grabbing onto it's not the only one some of those other bands that we saw for 4G are being utilized for 5g as we move into frequency range - there are three key bands that have appeared to provide this ultra high-speed connectivity with respect to 5g deployment so the 24 28 and 40 gigahertz band but it's worth pointing out this is part of what we refer to as the phase one deployments as we move into phase two and as we go into the different releases of the standards we're going to find more and more spectrum becoming available worldwide for

conversations you have with your customers that help you articulate and refine what these use cases are going to be Lindsay maybe we can start with you short so for those of you who aren't familiar with cradle Point we're sort of a global leader in 4G and soon to be 5g solutions and if you think about that it's really a horizontal but we're talking about what end up being vertical use cases so over the years what we found is there are typically niche players that are serving a particular need and so what we've done is partnered with them we now have about a thousand specific partners with very clear and specific verticals for example firefighting applications we might talk about that one a little bit later or security solutions or things like that and what they've done is they've they've needed the horizontal solution that's what we've provided but then they integrate that to solve a particular customers needs they then look for similar customers and that's how they've grown their business and scaled horizontally within that particular vertical niche and so it's having this portfolio of partners that deliver specific value at that is really made this successful and then what we find within customers is they see wow that was easy and so it's just a rinse and repeat at that point it's like well let's do the next project let's do the next project okay Sode what's your approach how's that dialogue work from Jamie's perspective well you know youyou mentioned a good way to think about it fairly horizontal right as an industry you know I always say we we kind of act like plumbers we create wireless connectivity with disregard for how people might use it our focus for years as an industry has been enabling mobile devices on phones which we see shifting dramatically especially with private networks and the need for these new use cases so for us while we work with mobile operators when we work integrators we're all a son now working with people who are right at the endpoints like the two guys on either side of me and we're going direct into environments like the guys who run the league for all the major sports organizations so we're going into applications like coach - coach communications we're going in and talking about applications like connectivity of tablets on the sidelines where I want better care anteed performance and I want the ability to review videos and not just images and I want that done reliably and I want it done securely because I don't want the other team to see those videos right so you can cut across this industry and find hundreds and hundreds of use cases now they're growing right as an industry what's important about what we're talking about with use cases is and you hear it a lot in this conference of why do we need this thing called 5g when you developed connectivity back ten years ago nobody sat around and said because we need it for Facebook because we need it because YouTube's gonna be a hit right we couldn't envision that but people consumed it now if you look at use cases you will hear people talking about video analytics which takes a lot of energy you'll talk about volumetric video where I'm trying to produce and you have to really reach out and imagine a use case of real-time volumetric video feeding a virtual reality in an event that's going on in real time it takes an immense amount of data so it's a very powerful use case driving where we're headed Marko I know tell it is engaged in essentially every value vertical industry there is out there so when you're dealing with healthcare when you're dealing with agriculture when you're dealing with Public Safety how do you have these conversations with your potential customers to really get a better understanding of how they're using connectivity today and how that might evolve as we see 5g networks become available well we have to put the things in the in the context Phi G is somehow the persecution of the VLT technology as tell it we offer product at our cover essentially all the solar technologies starting from 2g up to the Katamon are organically but also a linear categories so essentially what we are looking our customer in use cases that related to customer that already involved in LTI kata and on the other side of course we have to not to forget where we are in term of standardization we all know that the currently the standard is a release 15 and they will essentially support the mobile broadband segment let me say that for us is representing for a representable fixed what a segment so everything that is related to routering gateway for enterprises CPE for residential these kind of things this is essentially the focus of tallit today the next way in my view at least for my company would be the industrial and that's the application but I believe we will have to wait every 16 and also we will probably need to weigh that the industry will become aware that 5g somehow will let say so some issues or will bring additional benefit to their business hey Paulie you probably have a little bit of a different perspective here given your role as a neutral host provider small cells as a service I know you're engaged with carriers in some of the markets you serve but other than carriers what kind of clients are you working with and then what are the conversations you have with them to really demonstrate what your value proposition is and how that solves a problem that they're facing yes it's a case in point really Emma knows were seeing it and we heard it here today that Emma knows are launching 5g on a macro cellular can a level but that's not really going to enable the the 5g use cases that have been spoken to spoken about it needs a you know a seismic shift to a different strategy in it in a way to deliver on some of those those use cases to deliver the site density that's going to be required so what dense air about our delivering that that dense and hyper dense networks and partly what what we're doing is working with with cities and you know to enable the for structure there to enable them to pull to draw down on that on those use cases so I've been working with Dublin as an example in in Ireland and we built a network there and it's about making you know we're working with Dublin City Council it's about making them an active participant an active stakeholder in that deployment rod today in today's world and previously they've been very much you know just a passive player and the mobile operators deploy as they see fit but if we can turn the model around and get cities a lot more active and driving the deployments then it Able's and facilitates a much richer model for everybody MNO is inclusive so you can get the deployer much wider infrastructure and able small cells enable those use cases reach out remove digital divides accept first so that's what we're drawing on and that's what we've built and deployed in in Dublin well let's let's talk a little bit more specifically about some of these use cases and your various strategies for addressing them Lindsay you brought up firefighters I know Public Safety has been a great market for cradle point so maybe you can help us understand the evolutionary path here in terms of what are you unable what are your customers unable to do today with LTE that they would like to do and that 5g will let them do sure so I mean everybody in this room knows what 5g will bring is orders of magnitude in terms of both throughput but really in my view and I'm sure most agree here more importantly latency and the performance gains that you see there and a great example of that is this startup a partner that we have the company's name is quake it's like earthquake only it's QW a ke you can google them and a little bit of mythbuster in here if you watch the telly and you see a firefighter show and they bust down the door and you watch the camera go in and what do you what do you see we you see flames and you see the feeling the the ceiling falling and that sort of thing in reality that's just not true what you see when you walk into a burning building is nothing it's black smoke and so what quake do is that they've created this firefighters visor that's equipped with thermal imaging and a Google Glasses sort of a view that allows them to see through the smoke see through the dark to be able to see where things are hot like fire and see where things are people who may be cooler this is one of those great applications I get really excited about because that's truly transformative latency in terms of single-digit milliseconds in that kind of a use case can mean the difference between life and death and we'll look back in five years and say how did we ever fight fires before because it was so arcane in archaic it's not that LTE doesn't have a bandwidth capabilities but in this kind of case latency really needs to get right tight in order for that kind of an application to save that life potentially maybe better than nothing is LTE but in this case 5g will be truly transformative and it Paul you mentioned the project that you worked on with the city of Dublin believed you want a small cell form award for that relatively recently but uh as I understand that the general premise is a smart Docklands area so maybe you can just give us a little color on what sort of use cases are riding on this network today and how those might be emboldened as you see carriers roll out 5g in that market so so we're just we're just building out some of the use cases on that network at the moment and I guess to bring it to life what what what we're seeing so are we got band 42 mid bands 3.5 spectrum in in in Dublin and we built macro cells who got five macro cells in it at 300 meters from one of those macro cells we get one mega megabit per second in building coverage or in building speed tests so that kind of demonstrates the challenge we've got in in 5g spectrum so we've deployed to enhance here not just the macro we've got in building small cells in there to to demonstrate it effectively the challenge we've got with five year with 5g spectrum so we're pretty much a connectivity solution provider in to enter into the markets but where I say we're building we've got we've got IOT applications we've built in on that layer at the moment and we're building out the the use cases on top of that one of the ones they're looking at the moment is around say the Docklands area where people get a bit tipsy over on stag dews and fall in the water and they're looking at how they can make health and safety a lot more you know enhanced around around the area I look forward to following up with you on how that works out now Todd you kind of glanced past a few of them volumetric video coach - coach communications you know when we have this conversation about a smart stadium I think a lot of the attention goes to enabling new types of fan experiences but really when you look at the complete picture there's a lot of things going on in the back of the house that really smooth the operational side of running a venue like that so maybe you can take us through a little bit more detail on some of those type of use cases and then how you see them being enhanced as you can slowly upgrade to 5g yeah so you know we do many many stadiums around the world and when you peel back a stadium you do have to look at the different constituencies in the stadium so fans is usually the focal point within the fan area we often call the bowl area the seating area you're gonna find that 5g from a performance issue is going to become a key factor so there's going to be areas within the bowl where we use incredible spectrum think from things like millimeter wave to deliver unique performance to those users but if you if you flip over and you look a little bit further you have a lot of back-of-house applications that need wireless connectivity that you don't generally think about when you ever you walk into a mat usually you walk in and there's we call in that industry and ingress stage where there's ticketing and there's security and there's a lot of connected equipment included in modern stadiums now is monitoring cameras that are out there during the ingress those monitoring cameras will now be doing video analytics on people in and out and and they're looking for many different things good and bad so those are all things that get moved around so portability of the back of house functions becomes a critical factor and it's very difficult to be dragging wires out and connect everything and I want secure reliable connectivity for these different kind of things what you may not know for example in in the US market if you ever watch something like the National Football League or American football you have referee devices and they speak on those you have coaches who can speak to one or two of the players during the game you have coaches who can speak to the coaches up in the kind of back office or the oversight of the game all of those are done on slightly different wireless technologies today and and in many cases they're they're well in advanced because they have to validate which channels of specific wireless technology in some cases they're using technology that is right in the middle of what is now the CB RF spectrum so they're going to have to move that off so really what's happening there is new technologies particularly in the u.s. like CB RS technology which gives us the ability to build a private network will have individual channels that can be configured on an event by event basis a match one day a concert the next day you have different constituencies from security to video capture to sound men the whole tour organization and the music group and and there functions there we talked in one session earlier today about 4k 8k video if you've ever gone to a concert lately you know there's a lot of guys running around with wireless cameras trying to capture and put video up during the event that you're at getting that - really high-resolution 8k video over a wireless technology is challenging today but yet we have layers of spectrum and we have a way to use the new technology to do that and these are very very different use cases than just connecting the mobile users so it's exciting area because it's a very very different way to think about what we're doing with the network we're gonna come back to private networks I think but um Marco you mentioned manufacturing is something that's on the horizon for tell it but uh you know right now the focus of 5gn are very much on enhanced mobile broadband and as we kind of move from release 15 to 16 and beyond that even expect a lot of refinements that'll speak to massive machine-type communications getting up to a million connected devices per square kilometre and then you get into that ultra reliable low latency communications so just from a strategic point of view for tell it what sort of the what conversations do you have today with your manufacturing customers that are gonna be really opened up as we get further down the evolution of 5gn are and add these enhancements well well we would say it is essential today is a talk to talk to the customer and and also educate them about what is the status and what are they to set also the right expectation because I I mean there is a big hype in the Friday now and in particular for the the the features of the capability that is promising so of course we have to stay that they come let me say and yes set the right expectations and tell them what they can achieve with a current technology today in particular tell them what is the status of the deployment to the start of the certification for the device and also application because the ecosystem is still I mean growing and not only things that are ready to to accept the device and so we know that there are already devices in the market that has been announced but they will be the need to see still some time in order to stabilize everything and to see a system that is performing at the same level that LT is performing today so next way the for sure will be the release 16 with additional features there will be the improvement for ultra reliable low latency communication and these kind of things that will serve the industry that is quite promising but again we will take some time to concretize now back to this private network point you know there's a lot of moving pieces there Todd mentioned CBR s in the u.s. we see some interesting things in Germany where they have dedicated mid bands specifically for factories but I you know Paul you guys are doing it today I believe in some of your projects you've got your carrier customers and you've got some private networks riding on top of that shared infrastructure so what are some of the needs that your customers that go this private network route have yeah well we've got the option cuz we got our own dedicated spectrum so it enables us to play play to the strengths so enabling small cells at a lower cost point into the mobile operators but also though interpret into private networks as well so we one of those may lead first you know a private network potentially and then we can deploy that and then give them options then to hand that you know integrate into a commercial mobile operators network so you can hand that off so give them the security of private networks also the benefits of handing back over into into a commercial network so it's it's about your cost of deployment really and one of the one of the barriers that have primarily been there for small cells for commercial ever knows or even private networks is that cost of deploy so with shared infrastructure equals shared cost so that's the the primary fundamental driver of our business case and it's getting in there deploying that riding the the benefits to those private applications that sit on there for private networks but also at the cost point that works for all and you know Lindsay I was hoping you might highlight another use case for us that I think is very appropriate given where we are and that's the work that cradle Point does with the public buses here in London I had no idea I mean cameras that's you know kind of a low-hanging one but you guys ride a lot of different applications off of in bus connectivity so maybe you could just walk us through some of that sure you know if you think about a bus or really any sort of mobile application you know it's no longer a single application we look at a vehicle is kind of like a mobile branch so let's talk about the bus for a second you know the first thing you want to be able to do if you're a bus operator is collect the fare right and you want to be able to do that electronically because now I want to use my Oyster card I'm not gonna be dealing with cash so that all require requires real-time connectivity but you mentioned cameras I never realized until I first heard it you know there's there's nearly two dozen CCTV cameras on one of those double-decker buses well that's all about insurance management if you've got people either claiming that the bus ran over their foot or you've got problems with security with bad actors I've even seen now that they can tell you what seats are available on the bus so you can help in traffic management let's not forget digital signage because you have digital signage outside the bus as a revenue generator even inside the bus and of course let's not forget about passenger Wi-Fi and our society is so addicted to wireless which is of course all great for all of us but that's an opportunity to monetize and I'm sure there are a variety well let's not forget about where the bus is and when is it going to arrive and my ability to serve up to my handsets when that bus is going to arrive and we're just scratching the surface there's there's just so many applications and naturally a bus provider any customer doesn't want to have a sim in every single one of those applications it makes much more sense to have a hub of sorts providing that secure connectivity either over wired Ethernet or Wi-Fi or whatnot to those various sensors in the bus it's kind of amazing when you really get under the covers and think about that as the next branch office so to speak so what you're saying is that anyone that was planning to fraudulently claimed that a City of London bus ran over their toe don't do that don't they it's not worth it's not worth the pain all right well Todd you talked to about millimeter wave a little bit you know that's the big thing in the u.s. right now on these early 5g launches but I was hoping you could add a little context for millimeter wave as a in building technology you talked a little bit about this in your presentation this afternoon I thought it was very interesting to understand the nuance because you know you think millimeter wave you think short propagation problematic propagation but not necessarily a deal breaker for an in building type of deployment right well that's correct and and you know we talk a lot in our industry about where the mobile users are utilizing their devices the most and we always go back to this metric that says 80% of the mobile utilization is inside of buildings we know there's a lot of density in buildings we know there's a lot of density in areas within city areas and and in sporting events and entertainment events so it's a logical place to solve for capacity right now with millimeter wave frequencies when we talk about double-digit Giga Hertz frequencies the wavelength creates different propagation characteristics so unlike a very low frequency like 600 700 900 megahertz which can propagate for a very very long distance we have a different challenge especially if we're trying to create a broad outdoor network as a macro network but when you go indoors the the flipside characteristic of millimeter wave is it's very reflective meaning that it will bounce off of things and reflect over to other things which you could treat as a problem but you could flip that over and say it's actually an opportunity it's actually a unique way to build solutions for in building and in our case build solutions for in building that are small panels that are much like deploying an access point or a small cell inside of a building have digital beamforming so that you can utilize that directional characteristic and the reflectivity to create coverage within those areas where you need them in a building so plenty going on in terms of the debate around millimeter wave and how effective it will be but I think what you'll see in our industry is very unique innovation around this technology that will find ways to make it pervasive and find ways to put it inside of venues where we'll have these I talk today on the panel about or the speech about speed zones right and you know many of us know that you know you may not use your phone a lot by the way you're walking down the stairs to your seat at the next match but when you're there 10 rows up and there's exciting stuff going on the ability to have that phone work really well and share videos or capture information about the match very very quickly is a powerful user experience that you want to get and it's those kind of capabilities that can be enabled inside of these venue millimeter-wave technology and yet Marco a lot of times when I have conversations about IOT and 5g the next thing that comes up is edge computing where if we're gonna have all these sensors streaming all this data just even if you just look at the economics piece of it you're gonna need to compute that locally scrub off what's unnecessary initiate some action that also lets you take advantage of that real-time you know nature of the air interface so I'm curious what a provider like tell it how do you think about edge compute is it something that you look to carriers to very proactively invest in is it something that an end user can go their own route and distribute that compute where they need it based on their operations just what's what's your view there well first of all when we talk about edge computing that r2 aspect there is a device aspect and the net or aspect we have seen today several tracks are talking about MACC so Mecca multi axis edge computing that is related to the network side that somehow will output have solved for instance the low latency requirement and then the reasons that the ads computing that is related to the device side on that side we can play a stay later we currently have a couple of product lines that where the customers essentially can develop the application inside a module and and get rid of the application processor and in all the rating components or reducing a bit of material this is of course one approach there are also of course the situation when their solution we provide cannot fulfill all the needs because there are use cases where there is a need to support a lot of MIPS so a lot of capability in terminal power computation this is also something we are looking at and so there are these two different aspects and Paul further on this edge compute point you know and I think about a small cell you gotta have a place to put it you need power you need backhaul seems like it'd be a great place to put some edge compute infrastructure do you see that as a kind of way to add value to your offering and open up new revenue lines yeah absolutely that's in our roadmap so it's something that is coming out and it's about you know if we can get a small sell in the right location and then sucking in to do that that edge computing it's the key to it and you know we've got a layer call we call dense ware which we suck in analytics from end-user devices these are embedded STK embedded in your day-to-day kind of apps and we suck that data in churn it and we can analyze we're good coverage and bad coverages today and we can rate a building based on the deployment characteristics to kind of say that is a good building to put in a 4G or 5g of 5g solution so that's quite unique and it's about the economics of getting in the right location with small cells and if we can overlay then an edge computing module onto that small cell it just enhances the deployment but for like I've done a lot of talking maybe we have some audience questions here just show a hand I'll bring you a microphone you've got a access to a just wealth of knowledge up here encourage you to take advantage of it anybody yes sir so let me ask the panel about first night so what do you think of your solutions been ready available for first night who wants to take that first yeah I can run with that I guess I do have a microphone here I'm just used to grabbing that mic yeah so so for those of you in the UK who aren't as familiar with the u.s. applications you know firstnet is a public-private partnership that was started by the US government after the 9/11 disaster that happened and and what happened at the time was that the networks got so jammed from people trying to call their loved ones that first responders couldn't communicate and so firstnet was born to create this prioritization this segregation if you will of network elements such that first responders can at any given moment prioritize their traffic you know in a regular everyday situation they don't need that but if there's a disaster they want to say we're coming first and technology enables that firstnet is probably the best-known there are a number of other operators that are doing that here in the in the UK you've got ESN in the emergency services network in australia you've got lanes and even some of the other operators like Verizon in the u.s. have created effectively a competing set of services with a separate core prioritization preemption etc at the end of the day it's the ability to provide a differentiated level of service for whatever use case now we're seeing that as I just described in public safety we've we've been there we've done that now for a couple of years it's working really well we're also seeing some similar use cases in the private sector that provide that same kind of quality of service differentiation based on an application or need let's just say you're providing that bus Wi-Fi well you don't want necessarily to if you're using a multi the operator network and you have a pricing paradigm for this different from one than another let's say you've got flat rate with one and metered pricing with the other you're gonna want to drive your Wi-Fi traffic to the flat rate and not worry about the quality in case of processing my credit card transaction or my oyster card transaction you absolutely want the performance so this is happening today some in public sector some in and public safety some in private sector so it's a great opportunity tada as AT&T builds out firstnet and Verizon comes up with a similar offer I know there's some sort of in building public safety mandates that you know the owner or the managers task with complying with what sort of opportunity does that present to a company like JMA where you know you can help them meet their immediate mandate that they face but also yeah so I mean we think of firstnet right we're talking about a prioritized band set of bands and connectivity for first responders in the event of an emergency well the funny thing is when emergencies happen many times they happen inside of buildings so you know as you said when I walk through the doors what do I see but the next question is what can I hear and how can I talk so everything we deploy today supports the firstnet frequency so we have the ability to add that on to all the in building scenarios that we deploy today but when we think about emergency response the funny thing is looking back at what happens in an emergency situation now firstnet and a frequency in the air is good what happened in the u.s. when we had stuff comes through Porto Rico what happened when we had the fires on the west coast things burned down think stuff disconnected there was no bound so there's a huge initiative ongoing in that area of first-response right so a fellow and our team was called up as part of the naval command overseeing that initiative and did the readout to the US FCC organization as part of that initiative number one issue was didn't have communications it wasn't just communications for first responders it was communications for the people that were in those areas who number one couldn't say that they were somewhere and needed help to get out right couldn't call loved ones and let him know that they were safe so that whole layer of first responder systems that go in in the state of an emergency when suddenly infrastructure goes away or making the infrastructure more reliable is pretty key right and then in the u.s. we use this term called smart grid driven by Department of Energy which is yet another home mission-critical layer call it a private network because it really be a mission-critical private network layer because if you tie it back to the use case for why did I need first responders and why did I need an emergency communication system in the first place well what happens when high-tension power wires break in a storm and hit the ground of dry turf they start fires so when you look at utility and distribution of electrical energy to homes and businesses everywhere and you have new IOT technology that can shut things down very very quickly with low latency we can create a very smart grid infrastructure that can respond to those and not create the problems in the first place so these are the kind of things we're seeing and then what we're looking forward to in this new infrastructure it really comes almost back to some of the use cases right that's it maybe Marco you can add a little more color on that I know you guys work in the you know energy sector to some extent and in a lot of ways five g's a great technology for this you have something like a smart meter that's incrementally sending a very small amount of data and then in other cases like Todd described you have the need to send a lot of data all at once so what are you hearing from your energy customers in terms of their strategy for continuing to invest in technology to improve their operations well in the industry sector I mean the technology that is being adopted currently is essentially focused on what they call mobile IOT so category am an Arab and IOT but I have to admit that the customer already started asking question about Phi G and a private private network looking forward they want to understand what they have in front of them surely for them the bigger concern is the lifetime of the of the technology there are some of them that should say should I bet on Katamon our ability now or should I wait that Phi G is mature enough and hang a star with a G the true is that the LTE or the 4G network will will stay alive for a long time we have not to forget that the Phi G deployment or the majority of the fudgey deployment that are going to start our non standalone so the 4G network would be the anchor for the for the signaling channel and so from this perspective there are no as they dub that if I have to deploy a project based on mobile IOT today it should start to cut this earth with a cat a more narrow band of course looking forward looking at the specific use cases where there is the need to have in a very cheap sensor for some reason there is the need to have low latency and have to deploy media of units yes I have to wait for G I have to wait release 16 most likely or even early 17 we don't know yet that's the the situation we have any other questions out there yes sir yeah so hello aqua question cradle 5g has been talked about for over two years it's only just coming to fruition I know crater points messaging around 5g I'd be interested in in the elevator pitch for each of the other companies y5g why why would I go 5g what would what's the interest in them ultimately you know from our perspective it depends on the use case all right so as Mark I just said you know four G's not going away it's gonna work hand in glove with 5g for years say if you're deploying on millimeter-wave it's gonna take so long to be able to bail out the network and it may not make sense in a variety of areas let's just say in the rural areas and so 4g will be counted on but at the end of the day we're seeing both 4G being enhanced and 5g being coming to market to deliver some of these enhanced use cases the end of the day it really does come down to the use case so if we can deliver better safety for customers for the general public if we can deliver applications that either save money there's a great one so here's a retailer one of the biggest problems in retail is turnover and so you'll see people flying around their HR recruiters to different cities very expensive so now if I have high-definition telepresence I can lower my travel costs something like that could be sort of done in 4G but it's just not as good as you'll see in 5g and so it really comes down to the the evolution of applications we talked about CCTV and facial recognition well what can you do in 4G versus 5g well in that case it comes down to hip rates it's not necessarily that we'll do brand new things though we will it's doing so many things better that will drive 5g adoption maybe everybody can take a shot at that question I think that's a pretty good place to kind of provide a little summary statement here I think it is you know some in the industry you don't want to think 5g is this narrow thing it's millimeter-wave it's higher speed it's lower latency I think the thing you got to look at is there is 5g is really a shift to multiple attributes in the network infrastructure so you hear us talk about enabling entirely different user applications and rethinking about it more than just plumbing that goes faster right 3G to 4G plumbing 2g to 3G introduced data right now we're talking about all kinds of different use cases with lower latency the number of devices they're going to be connected to the network but from guys like this are going to be tremendous right well beyond what we know with mobile phones there's as many subscribers across our homes as there is mobile users today connected to a network which will shift into a common infrastructure over time so it's it's a lot more than an additional spectrum with speed and lower latency it's what we enable right now when you talk about cost-effectiveness you know we have a bit of a problem we have an area plumbing which been which which the willingness to pay has been a bit commoditized just for connectivity and mobile devices so what we're talking about is finding new applications on one side that enable new service capabilities with things like edge compute technology on the other side we're transforming the technology from proprietary hardware technology into virtualized software technology we've seen that happen in multiple industries before when you make that transformation to software and as much of the network as possible the economics change radically in Italy we changed the stadium in Rome Stadio Olimpico - fully virtualized Ram technology they bought back 90% of the footprint of the space where they had legacy in OB and they doubled the capacity in the stadium it's all running on a rack of Dell servers now all right that fundamentally and radically changes the economics lowering the costs and the speed that you can deploy these networks so 5g to me is is not a one-trick pony anymore it's about many many different attributes that we're gonna change in the entire ecosystem mark oh definitely I agree with you and you say that the the challenge stuff would be essentially that this technology will enable a lot of new use cases and it chances the challenge would be to understand which of them we will be able to monetize at the end of this room for spa yeah it's hard to add to some great comments so I think we're all the lines I mean I think absolutely you know 2g 3G and 4G for me largely being kind of consumer kind of services it's very much a bit pipe and 5g we don't really know how it will change our lives and how it will transform but it but it will do and it's it's about building that fabric it's very much you know we know will be millimeter wave we know it'll be hyper dense we know it's a tactile Internet and there'll be a whole array of applications and services and it's not just mobile operators delivering that to consumers or businesses there's a whole another service layer an app layer above that that will take that and and transform it so it's about delivering it and be more efficient and and you know delivering it where it matters well gentleman I really want to thank you for sharing your perspectives with us big round of applause for the panel", "l6R8LH8OEXE": "I love IRA so SOS air and today we're gonna carry on this RSO journey so I've managed to get some more RSO

least we're gonna : brown on it it's better than a [ __ ] green this is good least updated with proper stuff as all I can say but this stuff here is not as good as the last stuff I had he's here a bit more big but I'm telling you now that's still that golden color and I'd say that would be healthy to use still what are your suggestions what do you feel tell me what you think for the comments below", "YlTUWK-eJ5A": "[Music] well hello everybody my name is mark barrett i'm with blue wireless technology and myself and my colleague andy morris are here today to talk about uh 5d small cells they're all a millimeter wave in orm-based mesh backhaul and the presentation is also uh supported by uh by denser uh which is a neutral host operator based in the uk and uh i thank support rubric who's the head of random denser for his contributions to this presentation um so to start with and set the scene um let's just talk about um the um the role of oran neutral host and and millimeter wave in emerging small cell networks so so this slide has been contributed by by denser and mutual host is really about sharing mobile infrastructure it it's it really transforms the business case for 4g and 5g it means that operators can share the the the equipment which is installed for example street level for 5g small cell networks and enjoy a slice of the of the infrastructure rather having to fund the 100 of the infrastructure given the economics of uh of 5g rollout so so that that's the important point and um and then so rolling out neutral host networks around the world as we speak so open ram or om then provides flexibility for various sharing models and they include full active disaggregated demand sharing sharing ready unix distribution units and the central units or partial active sharing which which as you would suggest is um slightly different we here we dedicate the ready units share the dus and the cus and then uh passive where we co-locate the radar units the du's and the cus and then share the front hall and the backhaul piece and really millimeter wave comes into its own here because um millimeter wide provides fiber-like access and connectivity between 5d small cells on the core network and avoids the cost and hassle of installing and dedicated fiber at street level so really that's what this this concept is all about as regards blue wireless um we're uk based millimeter wave production technology company um we we we focus our products mainly on the license exempt spectrum bound 57 to 71 gigahertz um and and that allows us to deliver gigabits at kilometers of range um within a licensed exempt or free to use uh spectrum envelope uh and we've deployed this technology in various private network style applications including high-speed transport for first group in the uk which is being deployed this year on southwest rail rail network and also in the city of liverpool um for a smart city millimeter wave mesh network and we also have activity us europe and japan and all these platforms are based on armed network processes and also armed as an investor in blue wireless so with that in mind i'll hand over to andy morris yes thanks mark so here we've got the uh blue wireless products that uh rail certified so train top and uh track side units uh which both can uh consist of the blue wireless rwm 6050 modem coupled with a 64-bit on v8 processor to deliver low power uh high throughput millimeter wave connectivity we also couple that with a flexible software stack which enables us to deploy this in multiple applications on the next slide we are showcasing the first millimeter wave deployment in france in sergi just outside paris the applications here are perimeter security and also massive data upload as well as even some mobility applications we've deployed the technology across a 900 meter link as well as in point-to-point scenarios okay thank you andy and uh please get in touch uh at bluewireless.com or you can

than just treat symptoms of disease can it actually cure serious illnesses the reason for thinking it might stems from the fact that the medical use of marijuana has become legal in almost half of all American states and anecdotal evidence has been accumulating that cannabis in oil form can actually reduce cancerous tumors anecdotal evidence isn't enough but pharmaceutical companies are starting human clinical trials Alistair Lee's head has been investigating in California I watch women die every day I watched children bury their moms so I know what is in front of me and I'm doing everything I can to prevent that Serah amento and her family are running out of time she has stage 4 cancer the chemotherapy isn't working and the doctors say there's nothing more they can do left with no options everybody speaks about cannabis oil there's a certain stigma especially being a mother of doing cannabis oil you know everyone looks at it like you're getting high and it's not it's a medical it's it's a natural option that the government's ignoring and I knew I want to live I have to live cannabis has been used as a medicine for millennia nearly half all US states have legalized it for medicinal use research into its cancer fighting properties is limited but the signs are strong enough to get britain's leading cancer research group interested and even trialing cannabis treatments cannabinoids are certainly very interesting molecules and there's a lot of research there's hundreds of papers being published looking at their chemical properties against cancer cells turning that into effective treatments is a long road and certainly it's not going to be the one cure for cancer because nothing is this is how you're able to engage what level of activities going on in your body it's all about scientific proof collecting case studies with medical evidence I have many many thick books of medical records but this is really one that matters Stephanie LaRue says she has proof the impact of taking cannabis oil was the fact that the cancer is gone all the tumors are gone they dissipated in my body with no evidence of metastatic disease they're just gone Stephanie's doctor confirmed to the BBC the tumors had gone despite her opting out of conventional medicine but stopped short of endorsing cannabis oil cannabis works no chemo I only did cannabis and the tumors are gone and the scans I have is evidence and proof of that kind of like what more do you need a lot more according to one of the world's leading oncologists this is chemotherapy so these are natural products you know man who helped cure Lance Armstrong's cancer needs data and real scientific evidence until somebody proves it whether it be the manufacturers who put together a clinical trial whether it be doctors who get government funding to do it or patients who say here my records and let's put it in a medical journal and be transparent with what I had what I was treated with him what my outcome was then until that it's snake-oil again I'm not trying to impede progress or say it's bad but at the same time I don't want people to get false hope so cannabis snake oil or can this plant cure some forms of cancer what is the evidence there have been hundreds of scientific papers published this study came out of the University of East Anglia last year showed that mice with cancer had the tumors reduced using cannabis this the first human tickle trial eight out of nine patients responded but they will died within the time we'd expect despite that there's a long list of charities and research groups that say it's an interesting development it may have a clinical use and now the big pharmaceutical companies are getting involved this huge cannabis garden is in Britain GW Pharmaceuticals is developing drugs from the cannabis plant the latest human trial is a cannabis oil to treat brain cancer we understand how some of these molecules work we have the preclinical evidence and the regulators have given us permission therefore to expose humans in a clinical trial setting at this point in time but for now it's an underground industry a bloke in a backyard with a stick a bucket and a jar of solvent who's making the cannabis oil he wanted to be known only as cell not because the cannabis is illegal in California but because of the flammable materials he's using we then pour the liquid into the pen so this is this is the finished product yes that's the finished product there's about one gram of oil in there and do you think this is a cure the cancer in many instances it is and it can be it depends on the person's particular condition or their state how the cancer is but we've seen thousands and thousands of people get better from using this oil squeeze out at very little and now and then I just and swallow it but to be effective Sarah needs to take a lot more than this and eating a gram a day is too much for many people when you ingest it you get 20% of the medication the properties that actually attack the cancer when you do it rectally you get 70% so you're actually getting more benefit from doing it that way and you don't get high and not only do you not get high there's no sleepiness there's snow there is no side effects it is her only hope but it's also unproven medicine I'll continue doing it until the cancer is gone I believe it's the best option I've seen it work for others and I'm hoping it'll work for me Alice Solis had their and just to reiterate what he reported there is as yet no clinical evidence that shows where the cannabis can reduce or destroy tumors but it's a question that more and more researchers are trying to answer", "mq4kWYAbgmI": "[Music] bsf is a global chemical company we have sites all over the world here in antwerp it's very large scale with a boonside with different business units different plants several years ago we designed a tetrawacky talking network here so we were looking for coverage and we set antenna sites wherever it was necessary also backup and redundancy was crucial for in our design so every other technology that would be an alternative like 5g should comply with the same requirements we have different use cases on 5g in different places in the world in china there's another situation than in europe and even within europe you have germany and belgium with total different situations we have different internal customers we have maintenance teams that have to communicate we have operations but also intervention teams like the medical department and the fire brigades they have to communicate so we are looking for technology that has a large coverage so what do they need not only a very good network which 5g surely will be but also devices we need not only devices that we can find off the shelf we need devices in a chemical company so this means they have to be explosion proof also we need applications that run on those devices and those applications have to fit our working processes have to fit with the existence applications and so on when we want to really implement our one device policy then we have to lose the one or the other theater walkie-talkie or the smartphone before we even consider going to another technology and that could bear this responsibility of mission critical communications the standard parameters of reliability and redundancy backup coverage have to be in place so we need an end-to-end solution it's just like cooking dinner if you want to to make a good lunch or a dinner then you need your ingredients at this stage we're just at the grocery shop looking at the different ingredients so 5g is certainly a very important ingredient at the moment we should talk with only the basic requirements i think within 5g there will be much more possibilities in future spontaneously i think of video streaming biomonitoring localization of the firemen sharing quick and easy information on the scene an extra way to alarm the other people on site et cetera while working with doggies was great and they have the know-how about the radio access network but also about the real 5g core network so this is very important if you start exploiting 5g network of course next to that they also brought in some extra devices which we need before we can implement this use case so this gave us a head start [Music] you", "Xxh9CmB7J8U": "hi

Lindsay and Joseph Mohr Serena hello everybody and thank you for joining us as you can see from the agenda on screen we're going to start with a few introductory comments on trends and characteristics of millimeter wave and then outline some of the problems and challenges of usage after that we'll look at solutions and review what it looks like from a deployment perspective then we'll hear our sponsors and ritsu and fidgets who talk through their approaches to millimeter wave for fixed wireless access in particular and lastly we'll make a few quick concluding remarks before we enter the Q&A section but without further ado let's get underway so I'm going to kick off today's webinar by briefly giving some context around millimeter wave and outline some of its characteristics and challenges as you can see on screen so it's a high-capacity line-of-sight wireless connection that can utilize several different spectral ranges in mobile back home we've probably seen it most so far used in the e Bound range around the 71 to 86 gigahertz range but for 5g fix wireless access applications it's mostly going to be utilized lower down in the frequency something that we'll look at in a minute or two it operates with narrow concentrated beam signal for point-to-point connectivity uses techniques like MIMO and beam forming but one of its limitations is range and that's typically in the order of several hundred meters rather than several thousand meters as other microwave frequencies are able to reach but that still means it's viable for a number of different applications such as within a local neighborhood where radios for example could be pole mounted to offer 360 coverage though also in such deployments there's going to be signal attenuation and environmental issues and that's something we're going to dig into in a lot more detail later on and other important issues for consideration firstly spectrum of course is it available and for how much once you have spectrum how do you plan the network how you're going to scale that up in the network efficient and cost-efficient way where do you have permission for sighting pole radios sorry radio poles and is there adequate power supply for those and of course all the regular backhaul considerations apply for all radio types capacity cost reliability network operations and so on so we're going to be looking at smart transport solutions which is a vital part of fixed wireless access applications and lastly there are of course some commercial considerations the business model the cost of CPE building revenue streams so on that's a whole other webinar today we're covering much more on the network side that we did want to acknowledge there are some other elements in the equation as well so let's compare millimeter wave to what is if you like the other flavor of 5g radio some six gigahertz how do they shape up what's the best usage fit so a wave has channels up to 400 megahertz whereas sub 6 has up to 100 millimeter wave is therefore you could say compatible for high-capacity services but only over short distances as we mentioned while sub 6 is more suited to broader coverage scenarios and as we'll see later millimeter wave typically suits the small cell deployment model with lower user numbers per cell whilst sub 6 it more kind of macro cell centric and better suited to those high usage high user mobility environment with regards to massive MIMO techniques that can be used in both but in millimeter wave that's typically to improve the link budget and also to extend coverage whilst for sub 6 it can improve spatial efficiency particularly in highly loaded cell there are other differences as well but I just wanted to highlight some of those differences and show why millimeter wave might be better suited to fix wireless applications rather than subjects in case you were wondering why don't we just use sub 6 instead or use it everywhere so now we're going to look a little bit more about how operators are currently using millimeter wave for 5g and I'm going to hand over to Russell Lindsay of anritsu to take us forward and tell us a bit more Russell over to you thank you Richard yeah I think I wanted to do a quick overview of what we're seeing in the world it's a bit of a moving target things change every day so the minute we put this slide out it will be out of date but from what we've seen I start with Korea Korea has really focused on trying to be out in front and lead the world in 5g in last year they had a government mandated deadline set for each of their three carriers that they would bring commercial networks live in March of 2019 which came to fruition they even started with enterprise networks at the end of 2018 and now today what we're seeing is that they've already deployed hundreds of thousands of radios across the entire country they're working on testing those radios installing them and improving and mapping their coverage in Japan there's also been a big focus on putting out their networks in preparation for the Olympics and the Paralympic Games we're seeing that they're focusing on really the denser high-density areas where you see mass transit like the high-speed rail or in urban net bourbon areas like downtown Tokyo they just finished their spectrum auctions in the sub six and millimeter wave in the US there's really been a high focus on the millimeter wave both in fixed point wireless and in Mobile they've had a recent auction for the 24 gigahertz spectrums and we're even seeing now the FCC trying to open up some of those fr1 sub six sub six pieces we're also basically seeing new installations of commercial networks every day so it seems like every day we hear a new city being announced moving over to Europe and not to generalize too much but really all major countries are moving their networks forward we've seen trial networks in the UK Spain France Germany and many many other countries the initial networks in Europe seem to be focused on the sub 6 gigahertz band there are some testing happening in the millimeter wave but more more focused in the sub 6 but there are new commercial launches being announced every day there as well China it seemed like a bit of a slow roll to begin but now a very fast ramped up commercial and trial networks being built in the sub six bands millimeter wave is under test the single carriers each single carrier which there are a few in China are expected to install over 50,000 G note B's around the country in the next in the next several months then of course around the rest of the world we're seeing more and more activity as things move along so that's what we're seeing around the world like I said it's evolving everyday and it's exciting to see it unfold so back over to you Richard thanks Russell so let's look a little bit more at some of the challenges particularly on the radio side and to kick us off I'm going to ask Jomo Torino from Fujitsu to talk us through it Joe over do thank you Richard the millimeter wave bands offers a significant capacity increase for new 5g services but with this high capacity in high frequencies comes limitations to its coverage area mamede wave has to propagation limits associated with its operation at first is the open air or line-of-sight coverage limited to around 100 metres contrast this to the sub six GigaPan that has around one kilometre of open air range the second is its inability to penetrate buildings trees other common obstacles in the coverage area this results in separate strategies and implementation for outdoor and indoor applications mitigating these coverage limitations is a densification strategy where millimeter wave radios have to be deployed around these various obstacles instead of traditional cell tower deployment millimeter wave radios will be deployed on street light utility poles and sides of buildings in their serving area much like we've seen in the past with small cell of deployment as a result more fiber will be needed to connect these radios and also since cell sites are non-traditional these small cell sites are non-traditional they'll have limited power and footprint available to them in the illustration the outdoor strategy for radio units will be deployed on utility poles in the intersections of dense or urban areas to maximize coverage around the building's intermediate deployment will be required to get around trees and other barriers let me now hand off to Russell Thank You Jo before I get into some of the RF challenges that I want to focus on I do think it's important to reiterate what Richard was saying about some of the benefits of a millimeter wave why is it that so many countries and operators and regions are focused on getting this millimeter wave network up for one it was extremely important for the world to find ranges of open frequencies to support these dreamed of throughputs that 5g was promising we've seen in the first couple years of 5g deployment that most if not all countries have really had no problem opening up the millimeter weight of millimeter wave bands for 5g on the other side though many countries have struggled squeezing out the contiguous bandwidth that's been required for the 5g speeds you can really look no further than us for an example of that struggle the the three to six gigahertz bands have been tied up in other applications and due to some of the shared spectrum there wasn't really a desire from the operators to use those we seem we've seen similar things across the rest of the world so that's actually recently led the FCC in the u.s. to reassign the 2.5 gigahertz band and have announced auctions for that it's also important in millimeter-wave because with this need for wide bandwidth it's really rare across the world to see any of the countries auction off more than 100 megahertz of continued contiguous bandwidth for a single carrier so like Richard mentioned according to the 3gpp to find opportunities for 5g you can have a single carrier up to 400 megahertz you can also have aggregated carriers either four by 100 or 8 by 100 to give you that full bandwidth especially when we're talking about broadband internet into a neighborhood and then also as far as millimeter ativ goes this is really a great time to take advantage of advances and technologies so new technologies in radios and modems they're enabling things like being forming in modulation schemes that have really taken this opportunity now to the next level so on that note now I'm going to focus a little bit more on the the RF challenges the the Joe's already discussed as you said in its first slide it really for the on the RF side it boils down to two paths loss you can see here in my slide on the left that the wavelength of high-frequency signals are naturally much shorter than those of the lower frequency signals so the wavelengths of a 28 gigahertz signal are seven times shorter than the fr1 band signals or 5g and forty times shorter than a 700 megahertz LTE signal so that really leads us to the two big obstacles which are free space path loss and object path loss so on the note of free space path loss getting the signals from the radio on the tower to a device in the home can be a challenge so the wavelengths get shorter the path loss through oxygen and water can get higher and higher you think of you have your a.m. radios that have been transmitting for decades and they go for miles and miles as they transmitted kilohertz and megahertz but as signals for mobile communications have gone higher in frequency we've seen the densification of networks millimeter-wave represents a new level to that same challenge and it's going to require some different solutions so at 24 gigahertz you see on this this plot that I have on the screen you see some some bumps at 24 gigahertz there's a bump where the absorption line and the scattering of water vapor can really attenuate your signals and then even bigger as we start to think higher in frequency when you get to 60 gigahertz that absorbs inline-four oxygen really bumps up the attenuation of the path loss so that's going to be an issue as things continue to evolve now fortunately for as far as free space path loss goes we've actually seen that the performance of these radios has been a little bit better than expected but the bigger challenge for these signals is going to be the the object path loss especially when we're talking fixed point Wireless where most of the applications are taking a signal from outside and bringing it inside the shorter wavelengths are quickly absorbed by physical objects like brick drywall and even foliage if you think about sitting in your living room when you go to connect a mobile phone or a PC to a Wi-Fi network you haven't you typically will see all of your neighbor's Wi-Fi networks as you connect to your own but if those were millimeter wave transmitters those signals wouldn't even leave the living room so that's that's walls but even windows which have typically been a conduit for some of these wireless signals to go in and out of a building are especially problematic because many of them are coated with UV protective films that heavily absorb or reflect the millimeter wave signals and then furthermore apart from just getting into the building there are obstacles around the buildings like metal fences telephone poles and trees that are going to attenuate those signals so all of these technological challenges really lead to some practical challenges the greater free space path loss means more radios are going to require it which we talked about densification this is going to require more planning and especially a lot of alignment with local governments there are there have been a lot of fears around the safety of 5g networks and that that those fears really come from this public knowledge that these networks are going to have to be more dense and there's a fear that denser networks means greater RF power but really it's actually quite the opposite the reason for the denser Network is because of the lower RF power that you're going to see and so planning that and working with governments to make sure that thing that is clear is going to be a challenge for the operators spectral clearing is also going to be important because these signals and millimeter waves are sensitive to interference that trying to make sure that there are no interferes in that area is going to be important and then working through and trying to deal with the increased cost more networks installation challenges they're all going to be a challenge practical challenges for those that are making installations so now I'm going to hand it back over to Richard thanks very much Russell so we've heard about some of the deployment and densification solutions and what sorry we've heard about some of the challenges but now we're going to hear about a little bit more about some of the solutions particularly around those areas that Russell and Joe have just out one but before we move onto that I'd like to just remind everybody that you can submit questions to us at any point if you want to click on the Q&A part of the WebEx interface you can just submit your question we'll get to those or get to as many as we possibly can at the end of the presentation so now as I said we're going to look at some of those solutions so I'm going to ask Joe to take us forward first Joe Oh big bottle yeah actually I think that this one's me so some solutions then the two the challenges that I just mentioned coverage planning so making sure that we're optimizing our radios across the across installations optimization means that you're you have fewer cells which saves costs and is easier for planning easier for deployment is more desirable for government's understanding the propagation loss and coverage limits that's going to be important so there are RF tools out there that can help in in making sure that you view and understand all of the different RF characteristics of signals and then using those same tools to clear out spectrum so in advance going into areas making sure that you understand the RF characteristics in those neighborhoods and then pushing them pushing them on ahead and then as far as simplifying the home installation that's going to be making sure that whatever we do in the home is we've come in we've optimized our networks we have radios pointing in the right directions then how is it that we make sure that a user who wants to use this service can easily get installation whether that's through a technician or whether that's within home installation so now I'm going to pass over to Joe for more information on that Thank You Russell so we looked at various let me just move the slide over we looked at various types of planning from Russell let's look at some modeling tools to justify the millimeter wave target areas so custom modeling and automation tools are used to plan a target area for identification the outdoor millimeter wave deployment strategy follows that of small cell deployment as I mentioned before and is deployed in a mesh on the right side is a target area to be modeled below that the modeled view shows the density of high-speed Internet traffic and proposed cell sites using millimeter wave fixed wireless access technology there's no standards for these modeling techniques as of yet but it provides a fairly accurate level of deployment for proposed millimeter wave cell sites brownfield deployment for 5g millimeter wave radios will be at four G small cell sites where mobile network operators already have a presence because of the identification strategy for millimeter wave many greenfield 5g Pico cell type deployments will exceed the number of 4G small cell sites that you have today and shown are pictures of non-traditional cell sites for millimeter wave that in most cases blend with the area landscape let's look at the transport options for millimeter wave radios in a centralized or cloud-based ran topology realizing pooling and sell-side aggregation the transport deployment model is from the radio unit to the distribution unit as shown at the top of the slide and reference as a distribution unit or combination distribution and central unit shown in the slide as addy you /cu i've listed for transport options based on the deployment limits and considerations previously mentioned for millimeter wave radio first is dedicated dark fiber this is the best transport method for fiber rich environments of course you don't have fiber in every area in terms of service capability so the next three options utilize varying degrees of wave division multiplexing or WDM technology even a transport technology is less of an option here due to the power space and capacity configurations of millimeter wave radios at the small cell-like sites WDM extends the capacity of fiber when strands of fiber are limited full passive WBM transport is the next in line and offers the lowest cost capacity extension of dedicated dark fiber however this lacks any remote visibility for performance monitoring next is semi passive WDM optical transport this is a low cost technique as it is semi passive one end is passive the other inactive and it adds a level of remote visibility to that active side of the network more about this option in subsequent slides let me just finish off this slide with the full active WBM this is the highest cost but most flexible offering in full remote visibility and self-healing topology options this offer this option is often cost justified in sub 6 gigahertz type radio' environments when dedicated dark fiber or d DFS is in short supply the semi passive WDM transport offers the best approach in terms of high availability performance monitoring and minimal deployment requirements in the semi passive WDM transport option the ru side or remote unit at the cell site is passive which means it is low cost it eliminates additional power and minimizes footprint using a WDM with its outside plant enclosure that is slightly bigger than the size of a coffee mug or let's say a high size beverage of your choice smart pluggable optics are installed directly into the radio unit or are you to interconnect with the full active hub site the hub site will have the intelligence to provide remote visibility into the network let's look at those networks now and here are some topology examples of semi passive use cases showing point-to-multipoint and linear topologies at the self site the smart pluggable optics automate the operation between sites and these optics offer service connections for sipper II III and - 25 Gigabit Ethernet type connections whether point-to-point of excuse me point-to-multipoint or a linear fiber topology the passive self site Transport maintains low cost small form-factor WDM and no additional power needed looking at the hub aggregator portion of this semi passive approach network elements contain the intelligence options for remote visibility offering integrated modules for optical digital diagnostic monitoring or DDM OTDR performance monitoring and laitanan latency measurement capability let me turn this over to you Richard Richard are you on mute alright looks like we lost Richard here for a second so let me just kind of pop here in here and remind everyone to please continue to answer your questions we have a lot coming in and we will get to those at the end of the presented content Richard are you back with us hi I'm back with you yes apologies folks just got cut off there so thank you very much to bottle and Joe for giving us a great overview of the deployment identification solutions and an overview of the transport network options that are available but now it's really important for us to map those to real life applications and look at that from a deployment perspective so I'm going to ask Flo to come back in and kick us off there and then hand over to Russell to give us some of those real-life examples that joke over the use of starters great thank you Richard well we mentioned before fixed wireless access is probably the target application for millimeter-wave access and here I'm showing an illustration of fixed wireless access transport for high-speed Internet service to residential and small to medium business use cases the residential and small to medium business buildings will have outdoor antenna arrays that are small somewhat about the size of a small size laptop computer when closed and these arrays will interconnect to neighboring cell sites that are on utility poles these utility poles will have passive wvm for transport as I mentioned previously as one of the optimal transport methods transporting multiple sectors of traffic across the network to the distribution or combination distribution central unit devices or network elements in the RAM the cell sites had to connect to the D use of V as a semi massive transport system enhanced mobile broadband is another area that millimeter wave can be used in little more challenging here as you need to highly identify the area but similarly this enhanced of mobile broadband use case would deploy or of radio units on utility poles and size of buildings interconnected to the D you see you using a semi passive approach so essentially a mobile operations for high-speed Internet and mobile communications within 5g let me pass this over to Russell thanks Joe so I'm going to do something a little more fun we've had a lot of time out in the field here for the last several years working with some of these networks and I mean I've put together here an example of some of the challenges and opportunities we have in installation of fixed point networks based on several real-world examples that we've seen out in the field so here we have an example of a new community development where a group of homes have been built and they want to use 5g fixpoint Wireless for their broadband connection into their homes but the question then comes to the operator who's coming in to install the network how do I make sure that I cover this network correctly so depending on the size of the neighborhood in in some cases we've seen that one single radio actually has enough power to cover an entire development as I mentioned before we've seen that in many cases a single radio could transmit several football fields away so as long as it's installed high enough it has visibility of the neighborhoods of the homes one tower with one sector could potentially cover that entire neighborhood now before installation this operator takes a little bit of time to come out and do some some mapping of the coverage so let's say they install a radio they've set that radio to transmit and now they take an instrument an RF instrument like a spectrum analyzer they attach an antenna and they walk the neighborhood and they map the power and they show that okay as I walk down this first Street I see plenty of power for me to transmit my signals second Street as I get into the cul-de-sac here now I start to see some dead zones same thing as I go into the other street looks really good for a while but I'm seeing some dead zones there as well so as we put that together now we've seen this this operator would see a story and say okay there's clearly something that's blocking the transmission of my Miller millimeter-wave signals I'm not going to be able to cover the neighborhood why is that so in this case they they may take a bird's eye look at the neighborhood and in in one case they might see a tree so let's say either it's a new tree or a tree that they hadn't noticed was there before one single tree is blocking coverage to almost a third of this neighborhood and this is a really a key consideration if you think ahead to to deployment if I come into a new neighborhood and I have installed this network maybe today everything's working fine but a year from now two years from now either they've come in and they have installed new fences new new trees the trees are starting to grow and the foliage is now taking over in some of the areas you start to see loss in coverage so it's going to be very key to working with the planners of these neighborhoods making sure that there's communication as landscaping is changed as homes are built on those things are taken into consideration for the coverage of the neighborhood so that the broadband network access continues to be there so in this case it may be important then for the operator they have to come in and install another another radio here's one example they may be that in order to optimize the network they can move one over add another this can be a bit of a problem as you think through towers tower availability if there's not a tower that is in an optimized place to cover this neighborhood there may need to be installation of something new that can be expensive it requires long-term contracts it's really not ideal so trying to minimize that can be very important to to the the operators now interestingly if we go back to that coverage map you know I mentioned before that as they've walked the neighborhood as they've mapped out the power I it kind of doesn't quite jive where you see a tree blocking this neighborhood and yet you see this green these green dots which represent good coverage what is it that's actually happening here this is an interesting example where you actually can see if you start to do your tests and use a directional antenna to point around and look for the source of those signals by using a directional antenna and pointing towards the radio you see that they're there no RF power but interestingly if you turned that directional antenna down the street towards the home on the corner you can see here as shown in this diagram that there was actually a reflection coming from that home then the corner bringing that coverage out into the neighborhood it's very important to understand the direction of that coverage because let's say you decide as an operator to rely on that cut on that reflection then to cover your your home but again that homeowner chooses to install a tree in front of their home the blocks all of the windows that we're reflecting that signal and now for for a no fault of your own you've lost all of that coverage there in that area so thinking through and optimizing networks in that way they're going to be extremely important so it may be that you decide that a more prudent way of covering the neighborhood is just saying well I know that I know that I have coverage for most of this network here if I have another network another Tower in a neighborhood around the corner I could install another tau another radio on that tower at a different sector that then could come in and cover those homes that weren't seeing the network before so those are you know it doesn't work simply it's going to be a challenge and it's going to be an evolving challenge as the the network operators continue to work through how to make this happen for all of their users so as they do that it's important to have all the right tools to make that happen so now back over to you Richard great thanks Russell nice overview there's a different deployment scenarios another reminder just to keep those questions coming in we're building up to quite an inbox full of key topics that you want to process on so we're going to get onto those towards the end of today's webinar at the top of the hour but before we do that let's hear from each of our sponsors regarding their organization's portfolios for this particular environment so we will start with an RIT suit and then digital sue Russell over to you first of all thank you Richard I'm actually excited to have this opportunity to talk a little bit about what we've just announced here in the last several months so we've released a new spectrum analyzer and with that spectrum analyzer we're offering several tools for coverage mapping that I mentioned before so in this case we have this our neon ma 8100 a single mapping which is not only outdoor coverage mapping but indoor three D coverage mappings as you can see in that diagram on the bottom right there a person can walk a building measure the RF power of signals coming in to that building and make 3d maps of the coverage and then this not only works with 5g but with that same tool you can make measurements of your LTE networks and your Wi-Fi networks and all of that information is pushed to a cloud where now you can optimize networks put everything together and and make sure that your your network is being built out in the best way possible and then I mentioned that going along with that is our new ms-20 90 a real-time spectrum analyzer so this the real-time the advantage of a real-time spectrum analyzer is as your spectrum clearing as your interference hunting you're able to see intermittent signals Feige in and of itself is very difficult to find because of the the very nature of the signal though they're being formed signals so trying to find the maximum power of a signal is going to be a challenge finding the bore side of that beam in any given area they're also TDD signals which means their time divided and they're only when you have power depending on the amount of traffic on the network you may only see power somewhere around five or ten percent of the time so with a real-time spectrum with a regular spectrum analyzer if it doesn't have the right sweep speeds you may lose some of that power with a real-time spectrum analyzer you're always guaranteed to capture that signal and then even even more beneficial is as you see interference from Tim or from repeaters or jammers or anything like that that might be in the network a real-time spectrum analyzer can help you identify and track those down in a in a faster more efficient way so the the performance that we're providing with the MS 29 da is designed to be optimized for that use and to give you industry-leading performance so we're excited about that and if you have any questions hope you reach out to us now we're going to hand it over to Joe Thank You Russell the Fujitsu smart X Hall solution offers a flexible Sdn control and manage transport capabilities for 4G sipper e5 g isa pre and up to 100 Gigabit Ethernet transport using a mix of WDM time-sensitive networking Ethernet transport and MPLS segment routing with cloud control plane to dynamically provide network slicing operation from multiple virtual networks within a single high-performance and highly scalable infrastructure this Fujitsu turnkey services team can also design integrate install and manage the complete end-to-end transport infrastructure for your new network as well as your legacy network let me pass it over to Richard great thanks very much folks so we've pretty much gone through the whole a slide part presentation for today but before getting to the Q&A I'm just going to spend a few minutes recapping and reiterating some of the points that Russell and Joe have presented for us so we heard about millimeter-wave having some challenging characteristics regarding propagation range line of sight and so forth and that more cell sites equals more fiber needed each site will have limited power and footprint available no there's going to have to be you know a plan in there to overcome those limits when when planning the network so that coverage planning is is crucial not just for coverage but optimizing antenna placement understanding propagation losses and so forth we heard about the importance of simplifying home installation providing use of solutions processes that minimize time and effort and this is both a network and a commercial issue getting to mass customers connected and happy without overspending and lighting them up but nonetheless we think it's really really important to kind of bring that into your thinking when you're planning your network as well that densification strategies are really really important for ensuring performance and also the scale gaps of the network beyond you know the initial phase of rollout which might be fairly small scale but how do you know that out have you kind of if you like build a template that you can extend from neighborhood to neighborhood using small cells less configuration maybe only technical part of our certification strategy that we heard about earlier we heard about the importance of the various transport options that Joe takes a great overview of those an enrolled smart transport in big point-six wireless access applications so really up so we had a great overview from I know it's around fidgets so I think in some of the ways in which millimeter-wave can be utilized within 5g applications and now we're going to turn it over you guys really to start picking us picking us picking our brains a little bit I suppose with some of the questions that you want to fast to go into to dig a little deeper so let's start by having a look at some of the questions that we've had come in okay I'm not going to read out the names of people contributing those questions but I'm just going to read the questions out for you so first question what are the distance limitations of front hall at 25 gigabits so I'm probably going to turn that over to you first of all as you've kind of been talking about transport specifically go well thank you Richard so typically the distance limitations are limited by the radios of the radio unit to the tribution unit and that has been defined in standardized as up to a 100 microsecond latency budget for most applications most being really all but the ultra reliable low latency type connectivity use cases so that's typically that distance of a hundred microseconds equates back to about 20 kilometers of dedicated dark driver just lost the latency loss in the 20 kilometers of dedicated dark fiber will consume that entire latency budget so you'd have to have a very low latency types of equipment on either end to provide that interconnect such as WDM which is extremely low latency or a concept of networking which is also extremely low latency but in answer to the question essentially distance limitation in the front wall is about 20 kilometers okay thanks very much I think that answers that question Russell any comments are you happy to move off nope that's Joe's area of expertise okay great okay another one I think that might also be one too for Joe the knock out the part what's the difference between city and ISA pre so the difference between City and ISA pre is essentially city used in 4G communications of both of these coming back up a little bit both of these are defined by the city co-op group of ran vendors that have defined the SIP protocol and have evolved that into the ISA pre protocol essentially zip free is a used in 4G it is very similar to a time division multiplexed or type of signal in that it is always a fixed it's always on ISA free on the other hand has a look and feel more like Ethernet it the difference between the two is that in ISA free the lo-fi processing is done in the are you and this converts the SIP Reese ignore into what looks like an Ethernet type signal which we refer to as an ISA pre type of signal this is also a variable signal in that when it is off and not in use it does not use much bandwidth when it's in use it Peaks so it operates like Ethernet traffic would operate whereas with sipper II it's always on whether it's being used or not it's always on that full bandwidth being your life okay thanks Joe and here's one I think I'm going to turn to Russell because to begin with Russell you would talk about the different deployment scenarios in local residential neighborhoods as an example but do you think millimeter-wave could be applicable in different vertical scenarios let's say manufacturing premises we've had a question in about that could it be done that I think it absolutely will be done we've seen in several countries where they are planning actually what they call dedicated 5g networks so what you'll see in a lot of manufacturing lines is rather than relying on a commercially available network to everybody you'll see manufacturing buildings work directly with operators to have a dedicated 5g network installed to their plant so they can manage if they're trying to manage their their equipment their their cloud-based solutions that stuff will all be given directly to them and access to that network will be solely on for that that company I mentioned mass transit it's going to be very popular there where you have networks that are installed when you have a more predictable more predictable environment it is a little bit easier to plan that network so you're going to see a little bit of that coming first and then of course the mobile networks as they go along you know it's it's going to take some time to build out you know I think I saw another question about when will we see 5g becoming more prevalent or Universal it's this is a technology that's going to roll out over a decade or more with this new technology it's going to take some time for the world to get used to that and you know you know the way the analogy I like to use is it I think 5g is you know it's a Ferrari and right now we're keeping it in first gear and running it at five miles an hour and it's going to take a while to open it up yeah okay thanks Russell okay you're hearing put other vertical sectors around ability to over that other getting interested group I've been seeing a lot of millimeter waves in terms of fixed wireless access type of applications so mobile network operators are focusing on that for fixed wireless access type of applications more so and that's being deployed now in fact one of the North American Tier one started deployment actually both started deployment last year and continue to deploy of those today okay right thanks very much okay so the next question jumping into a different topic within the subject area this one's about interference what technology is used to alleviate interference basically when being calming and Milo are active Russell you were talking about interference be able to handle this one first and then Joe if you won't come in with some comments yeah so one thing link over so I can hear me yeah Joe going on so so techniques for finding interference you know it's going to be there's obviously there are several different types of interference there's going to be a lot of multipath issues here so using utilizing tools that go beyond just throughput you know there's I think there's a been a temptation or it really there's a value in using Yui devices to do testing but Yui devices are not going to give information on directional the directionality of signals some of the the higher level signal quality pieces and then like I mentioned interference hunting so using a tool like a spectrum analyzer and I mentioned a real-time spectrum analyzer is going to help you to with directional antennas you can pinpoint where the where these are coming from with fast audio tools that can give you audio reactions to power levels you can then track them down triangulate on those signals we also offer tools like a mobile interference hunter where you can do Drive testing to pinpoint and triangulate interference go find it and then and then identify that source and have it have it rectified okay generally comments on alleviating interference I think Brussels has it covered thank you okay okay well I what will you hand back to Russell because I've got a follow-up question on the topic of interference once interference has been confirmed what will be the best way for regulators to know type in the short range of coverage of the minimal millimeter waves well me obviously there's the challenges are first you know identifying the presence of interference locating it I mentioned before the types of things that you might see might cause interference there are repeaters that can come into bands as you start to get into these higher millimeter wave frequencies things like 24 gigahertz there may be existing technologies like you know pocket radar that's been used for testing the the speed of a golf swing or baseball pitch my wireless microphones and headsets things that have typically operated in these these higher unused bands or now may become sources of interference in different areas and so people who may not even questions the use of these objects and don't know that what sort of problem they could cause and so monitoring over time is going to be important so being able to put instruments and tools out they can do spectrum monitoring tracking that data and then utilizing that into a cloud-based solution where you can then evaluate and say okay here's the timing of certain things there's is a sporadic is it often actually being able to capture the IQ information of those signals and verify it does this look like you know is it a big fat CW signal that makes it look more like a jammer is it a is it something that looks like it's modulated in a specific way and by utilizing those types of tools then being able to zero in on what type it is you can then look for sources whether it might be something that's in-home maybe something that's some device somebody's taking to a park anything like that so it's going to be hard at first knowing what all of those will be but it's going to be more and more prevalent as we move forward okay thanks very much Russell okay here's one I think for Jo this is more related to the transport solutions you were outlining for us it's the semi passive active WDM located F amount or at l'homme so let me answer that with simply the active WDM component would be at the hub site at the peppy self site or I guess what is being referred to as the node that would be the passive unit the passive unit would consist of a pluggable optical device as a P type of device that would directly plug into the radio unit or in 4G the remote radio head this is not an ordinary optical pluggable but a smart optical pluggable that has processing capabilities and remote communication capabilities tunability operations to automate the overall operation and then also at the cell site or node site you would have the passive WDM itself the wave division multiplexer these are small devices they're in medically sealed types of cases so as to be deployed at these locations for when millimeter-wave is used such as a utility pole or the side of a building type of deployment okay thanks very much I'll go find just for one more question it is another question for Joseph really focused on some of the transport solutions so it's specifically around jitsu solution you're wdn equipment differ in terms of you know the millimeter wave scenarios we've been talking about compared to existing 4G type of deployments well actually in 4G typically what was used outside of dedicated dark fiber is was WDM type of deployments for transport in 5g you have a WDM that can be used based on the use case for instance we talked about millimeter waves throughout the webinar and the limitations in terms of millimeter wave that would force it into these locations that are challenged for footprint and power overall operation and there you would use a WDM technique as I mentioned before semi passive type of technique there are other applications where there might be a more space more power availability of many more channels to be transported from that self site whether it's 4g channels from out of 14 small cell site as well as 5g channels at a millimeter wave site or even a sub 6 gigahertz site at a traditional tower this was this is where there would be many more channels and therefore it would depend on number of channels power availability number fibers that are available how you would transport that using either another WDM technique such as a full active that would provide full remote visibility or a time sensitive networking even a transport type of system that would provide and timing and would open up to network slicing applications for the future okay thanks very much Joe really appreciate the answers from both Joe and Russell unfortunately that's all the time questions we have today we'll do our best to follow up with everyone with questions we weren't able to answer in the days following the webinar so we'll try and give you some sort of answer offline that's all we have time for today too I'm going to come back safely to moderator that was great thank you to the three speakers for presenting today and for the very informative webinar I'd like to say thank you to all of our attendees who made the time to sit in with us for this webinar and for your participation as I mentioned at the

thanks again everyone take care", "saGx_F5_1z4": "hello this video is brought to you by ricksimpsonoil.co.uk in this video we are going to show you how to use the alphacat testing kit to ensure your rick simpson oil is of a pure and high quality we understand many people's anxiety about whether they are buying a product which is the right quality when their life literally depends on it we are that confident of our quality that we encourage our customers to test our oil as we want to give our customers peace of mind if you have oil from elsewhere we would recommend you test it even more so the alphacat testing kit is an amazing piece of kit it enables you to test your rick simpson oil with ease alphacat created a scientific cannabinoid analysis and detection system in a test kit format to make quality assessment accessible and affordable for everyone this kit costs 80 pounds which is around 100 us dollars this may seem expensive however you can do eight tests and for many people who need to spend over a thousand on their rso and their health is on the line 20 pounds per test is a cheap piece of mind we do not sell the kits ourselves as we want the test to be independent from ourselves we bought this kit at alphacat's own website we will add the link in the description below the first stage is to weigh 100 milligrams of the rso in one of the eight ependorf tubes we first tear the scale with the tube on it so we can get an accurate reading when the tube is weed as you can see we have a hundred milligrams of the rick simpson oil in the tubes make sure you are wearing the supplied gloves when doing this the next stage is to use the supplied pipette and take exactly one milliliter and add it to the eppendorf or extraction tube when that is done make sure the lid is sealed and shake vigorously for 10 seconds it is important that the rso is well shaken and before doing this ensure you close the lid on the extraction fluid as it will evaporate the next stage is to remove one of the test plates it is important to be careful with these and treat them with care in this video we are only testing the one sample but we will test it three times to make sure we have consistent results to extract exactly one microlight we use one of the 10 supplied capillary tubes which is placed in a special holder when the capillary is full to the top we then release it on the spot on the testing plate if you are going to test different samples ensure you change the capillary tubes for each one make sure you really take your time when using the capillary tubes they are quite delicate and probably the most temperamental part of the whole process although not difficult just take your time and look closely at the capillary with our rso solution being very dark if you look closely at the glass tube it will be very clear to see the capillaries full to the top which is what you want then you know exactly one microlight is going to be used for each spot on the test plate the next stage is to release the contents of the capillary tube on each spot on the test plate again take your time it's a little bit fiddly but perfectly easy to do if you just take your time now the test plates have the sample solution on them see the three red dots we need to take two milliliters of the test fluid using the pipette and releasing it into the supplied glass beaker then carefully lower the test plate into the beaker with the marked test spot at the bottom it will lean at a slight angle this is fine once this is done close the lid and leave the test plate to soak up the whole solution you will see it slowly travel to the top this will take 25 minutes once 25 minutes has passed you will see that the test plate has soaked up all the solution the sample has traveled up the plate with the test fluid so we know that the process has worked well so far now we carefully take out the test plate and leave it to dry for around five to eight minutes the next stage is to prepare the dipping tray and dye powder take one of the two vials which contain the dye and make sure you empty all the contents into the dipping tree then using the 25 milliliter beaker pour 25 milliliters of water into the tray and gently mix it in to ensure the dye has properly dissolved the next part is to dip the plate with the coated side down into the tree for only one second the reaction i found was quite aggressive so i would make sure this is the one part of the test you do not take your time with as you can see we have very clear results the plate has reacted very well we now leave the plate to dry for eight minutes now using the supplied chart we can try to get an idea of the potency of our sample however upon using the sizing guide it is clear that the thc levels are off the charts we are unable to get an idea of the exact percentage however at least we can get a good idea that when our rso oil is looking like this we are getting exactly what we have paid for in the coming weeks we will be getting our rso tested at an independent laboratory in barcelona that way we can supply you with exact numbers we will do this test again to see if we get a different reading and we will do a second video to demonstrate it we hope this video has been instructive to you and we will be grateful for any likes or subscribers you", "aD3ATSdvk34": "so this is the full extract this is the hem full extract and I will show the consistency of this which is like it's very greasy and it's I have to push the plunger from below goes inside again and this will be like half the grain size and this is the dose one drop at a time sublingually", "7fK_wumSrzY": "some of you may be wondering how to take your rso your rso comes a little syringe like this but how do you take it a really good way that i think is awesome is if you get some peanut butter crackers like these these are really awesome um anything with peanut butter is gonna be good in my opinion and then when you say a rice size amount it's gonna be something like hopefully it doesn't squirt out like crazy and yeah about like that put it on the top and then eat it all right so it's very good for a lot of things um if you have something that's chronic um you know chronic condition that marijuana helps with i would suggest rso it's a concentrated of all form cannabinoids and turps and and everything in the marijuana plant and yeah it's been known to help to cure cancers and uh it's good for a lot of things so rso also known as rick simpson oil you know rick simpson is the one who developed it and this has been an oklahoma cannabis educational minute see you later", "YXpfchNKqm0": "hi I was doing some plant extractions so I thought I would share my process here you can see the ground up plant in question normally a chemist will do setup like this this is footage stolen from nurdrage if you don't know him go check him out anyway the key feature here is the soxhlet extractor it is a device that you can load up with stuff and it will automatically cycle the fresh solvents through it it is basically automatic self siphoning device if you like me don't have such logic structure or any glassware basically you can use method that I am using here so this is just basic filter paper that I modified to allow vapor to pass through it of course it has to be compatible with your solvent on top of that you can place random container that you will fill with cold water ideally this should be glass container but in the past I have used even polypropylene plastic cups also here is some kindergarten science in case you wonder how you can make effectively holes in this filter paper you can see that I intentionally offset the first hole from the bottom this offset basically depends on how much material you have now let's put in just a little bit of a solvent I'm using 50 milliliters of ethanol put your stuff that you want to extract into this filter paper do this outside your extraction container because you can contaminate liquid then a few your cooling container with water and be sure to keep outside dry now you can turn on your heat source and just wait actually you should periodically check the temperature of your cooling water one little problem this setup have is that the filter paper likes to suck in the solvent and carry stuff with it this is not a big deal unless you work with extremely small quantities in which case you shouldn't use this setup anyway you should continue with extraction until you see that the solvent that comes out of the filter paper is basically clear I guess depending what solvent and what you are extracting here you can see plant material after extraction and you can see that is quite off-colored and at this point I tested the extracted plant material and I can confirm that the chemical was not there and here's the extract it should be pale yellow oily resin material but you can see that it has quite greenish tint to it this is due to presence of chlorophyll in this part I will try to extract the chlorophyll from the extract itself unfortunately only way I can destroy chlorophyll presence is by UV fluorescence which would not be so terrible but unfortunately my only resource is this PCB exposure unit I built sometime ago this is about 120 watt light source and the radiation from this Fink is overwhelming when you turn this thing gone basically whole world looks like it's dead and I will have to make some adjustments to the scene so you can see what I can see and now we are cooking there may be much better solutions to separate chlorophyll but I know only about one solvents that can do this and that is propane or butane or mixture of two now this will be a little bit crazy but actually propane mixed with ethanol is not quite that volatile but it's still pretty much flammable so be aware of that at least I mean it should be unless you are five years old anyway so you can see that there is quite clear separation of two fractions since that chlorophyll content is not that different though also in the visible light this is really nice but the question is how do we separate this seriously what did you think if you have one you can use separatory funnel just never never plug it up even though it should handle this pressure there wouldn't be much much higher than one atmosphere of pressure I mean do you see any problem here I repeated this extraction about six or eight times now on the left side you can see the butane fraction and on the right side you can see the ethanol fraction the ethanol one is quite muddy it seems like it has some water content in it to be fair I also fill tributon fraction through some filter paper so but still it wasn't muddy it seemed to be contaminated by some solid pieces now both fractions are right and you can see quite clearly the color difference now let's look at this under UV light [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so you can see this reddish fluorescence that is quite specific to chlorophyll this is the beauty infraction even though you can see some orange a green fluorescent blobs there on the other hand in the ethanol fraction you can see that the whole material is this orange green fluorescent pink although even here you can see some quite a reddish spots that could indicate some presence of chlorophyll so the separation is quite good but not 100%", "s-ET6EzDOGQ": "oh you guys I got a little ahead of myself dump the weed out of that bin and into this pail here I wash this pillow a couple times just so it's above level of the weed there and now for this oil it's going to actually soak overnight so we'll be back and look at it tomorrow morning are you doing some wheat crumbs there another thing is just to put this the pail like that that way it doesn't doesn't evaporate as marshal guys for this particular oil and I'm making I'm talking with this pipe in my mouth met this particular oil that I'm making I have this was that sugar leaf that I put through earlier in the video and that's just still draining out but down there in the bottom there now I have a bunch of fresh plant material which I'll let you get a better look at that here I'll do the old switcheroo knee material mostly buds and leaf there's a little stem in here all sugar leaf fan leaf as you can see but just whole plant and it's fresh and is fresh and isopropanol will kind of each all the moisture out of it too so I don't know we'll just I'm not even gonna say what this is gonna do we're gonna see what this is gonna do so guys I just added some new ISO to this I pour it in through here pour it in through that stuff that I soaked yesterday and just kind of rinse that out if I need to add more ISO to it I pour the ISO through here into there there's some crumbs from some old stuff that I made there's a whole bunch of old [ __ ] that I'm throwing away that's for my last batch of oil that I made yeah so we'll come back to this in an hour or so see how it's so guys this is some of the fresh material and putting in there and I'm just showing you so that's the fresh material that I put in there before and so I'm gonna strain that out and add some more fresh material to that well and here are some of the buds from that same weed so I'm not putting all I trimmed quite a few the buds out of that plant but then a lot of the buds in the plant are also I'm going to be four okay guys so I got this pretty much well fully soaked sure looks a lot different and the leaves and stuff for breaking apart as if they were dry so this one now I can get rid of that stuff and if I need to I'm one-handed cameraman a guy here 92 for this crazy bit color superfood that's what I'm not supposed to be using our nice [ __ ] my wife does not like and yeah okay I know why me I don't mind all right so this crazy insanely weird looking bright material left over is crazy this will be interesting to see when it's dry what it's like for as far as its consistency right like to see how much how sticky it is or what it held on to but you know it's probably just gonna be sticky because this [ __ ] that I'm making is so sticky now I need yet another container here Monica the junk is some more of an Interphone put down music dude [Music] yeah suck at that know their music stuff away what's going on in there and now we got what's going on here goes Oh get out of there it like kind of evened out the greenness so I think summer like it kind of really kind of died some of this green it looks like super green so when I run this through coffee filters now um will actually be interesting it'll take forever to go through coffee filters because it's so thick and sticky okay so I'm gonna get some more fresh material and be right back okay so here we have fresh material pour this one in I'm gonna put this down what a super dank smell this like that you're pouring down their messy process that's empty no yeah take a look at this and then I'm going to be back when I started doing the coffee filter in process I'll be back so guys this is just this one is just so potent that it won't make it through coffee filters so I'm using a whole bunch cheesecloth layered over and over and over and over again to filter it out and it's coming pretty pretty clean advantage to using these kind of white containers this is like as you're pouring it out you can see better on the white background like what kind of contaminants could be in there you know harder to see you through the clear but then if there's a white background you'll end up seeing every little speck of it kind of fluorescent green I'll try to give you some view here what I'm doing I'll run this through a couple times but I think I'm screwing this one up a little bit it is coming quite a bit cleaner and then I'll actually wash this out and I'll do musical containers for a little bit I'll just get a cleaner cleaner hopefully where I run it through see how it is when it's done so guys if you've watched my videos before you've seen this before I've got the rice cook here with a fan blowing on it with the vent fan on every found in the house on while the blog windows open at home and last year our stupid just kidding this is just to show you guys how this was done this is not to tell you guys to do this okay there is a little bit of danger involved here and if you don't know what you're doing there's tons of danger involved here okay for me it's just a very tiny little bit of danger but if you've never done this before there's a huge amount of danger just so you know take it for me I have blowing myself up once before and will never do that so with that white container you get a good look at what your color is like and your cleanliness as well so it looks like the cheesecloth actually did a better job than I thought it would had filtering this because it is very clean [Music] I just keep adding more to it as it goes guys now it's down to this lawsuit oh yeah that fan going and I got a switch to warm now yes whatever about Hollywood production okay so yeah and obviously you've done one for a while it is 158 right now I gotta go be somewhere to my drugs oh crap you guys I totally forgot what my plan was my plan was he's gonna using this leftover shower for this linked to this dish and finish it off in here was the original plan back to doing that again and in this dish here I will save that I'm going to save that because I'm gonna make chocolate in this later so might as well save that nice little coating so guys this we have here it is pretty greasy already man whoa so gonna sit it on this element here and turn and then have this fan blowing there I put this towel down here so this fan doesn't rotate I know my fans dirty nevermind this is her personal now it doesn't blow anything up here my stuff is clean so there you see you can see that is a bubble [Music] and those are bubbles they're not debris even though with my awesome camera but you can definitely see what's going on here I don't know what it is but it's something something serious so here we are it's just starting to bubble now got rid of the fan and everything cuz just finishing off here I can still smell it away so propanol smell if I stick my nose right close to it Oh kiddies maybe gives a dinner time soon update here almost done almost it has been almost all day ordeal it's been about a six-hour process look just so what I do is I kind of pick it up and move around a bit and then it starts to bubble up when those bubbles disappear there's when it's done it's gonna be like way too thick but it'll be you know fully smokable smokeable Rick Simpson oil smokeable edible topical all of the above for this one some stuff I add a little bit of coconut oil to this stuff here just regular but I'm gonna get into the MTC coconut oils from the health food store right now I'm using this stuff but it still works it's so good so yeah I do make a little bit of this stuff that's kind of 5050 with the coconut oil so it's not so super strong and like it just annihilates people people take like a little bit about as much as a grain of rice full like a like two drops and our comatosed from this stuff of course this is different so this one is super Silver Haze a Dutch treat and above a cushion here so it's quite a little mix but sativa dominant on this one so interesting and so guys I've shut the element completely off there's still some bubbles in here but I smell absolutely no isopropanol like I stick my nose right in there and smell all around it and I don't get any isopropanol smell whatsoever so you know there are still some bubbles there but whatever I'm gonna leave it for a bit longer everything is still warm so I'm gonna leave it till it all cools down cold again and that's it though that's it for this video segment thanks for watching everybody peace and hopefully you know you guys are finding what you need out there", "6u5dvg6EbzU": "[ __ ] working all right yo what's up guys uh today we're gonna make some [ __ ] rso and if you don't know what rso is it's uh rick simpson oil and uh yeah that's the [ __ ] they used to uh supposed to cure cancer and [ __ ] that's what the rick simpson the guy that originated it and what it's named after claims and a lot of other people claim to and uh basically what it is is extracting the [ __ ] out of the plant and by playing i mean marijuana and uh i don't know what makes it like some [ __ ] it looks like resin really if you've seen rso it looks like resin but yeah like it's supposed to cure cancer and that's really that's really all there is to [ __ ] say here's supposed to cure and uh my grandma's been having some issues and [ __ ] so uh she wanted to try it so i told her i'd make her some and i made her some yesterday that it turned out pretty good but i figured i'd make some more today and just really hook her up you know so she doesn't have to be going like dispensaries and [ __ ] and buying that [ __ ] yeah they come from a time where uh weed was basically like heroin or that's what they were told so it's pretty crazy that she's even willing to try it so i was like [ __ ] it yeah i'll make some and i figured why the [ __ ] not just make a video in case anyone else wants to make some but uh what you're going to want to be doing i'm using bud straight up bud because like i'm trying to make [ __ ] cancer killer you know what i'm saying and this was some but it was just it was subpar i didn't like it but uh you're going to want to grind your [ __ ] up as much as you [ __ ] can like some i've seen people they use the ninja choppers and [ __ ] this is all i'm doing right now just squeezing these [ __ ] buds i'm gonna fill this whole jar now you can use trim you can use whatever you want really as long as it's got thc and [ __ ] like this is some this is some [ __ ] you can see it's looking like ass well i think this is some [ __ ] from last year honestly i just found it i got a bag of trim here i think it's from last year too just a little bit i'll probably run this [ __ ] too like i said yeah i did a run yesterday of this bud and if you watch my outdoor grow this is that uh that extra northern lights plant [ __ ] seed random seed just fell from the year before i just let it grow i grew with no newts or nothing so that's why it's ass but i just might want to see what happened you know never growing a plant just [ __ ] soil in the ground and seeing how it turned out it was a pretty big plant but yeah you need nudes but uh honestly you guys probably want to sit and watch me uh crunch weed up so uh i'll get back to you guys with the next part all right guys i got some jars filled with uh some products and uh now the next step you need to get something that's kind of hard to [ __ ] find in these days and ages isopropyl alcohol now this is 99.9 good luck finding this but uh i ordered online and you can use everclear [ __ ] like that you just need some [ __ ] some strong alcohol you know what i mean and uh yeah if you can't find 99.9 just find the strongest [ __ ] you can strongest [ __ ] you can but a lot of people say everclear is better you know because it's already ready for human consumption but we're gonna be cooking the [ __ ] off anyway damn i should bring you guys down here probably to see the poor sorry i'm blocking damn what's the best way to [ __ ] film this all right hold up let me uh let me make a change here all right all right all right that's better i had front facing camera [ __ ] it wasn't gonna work but uh all right i'm gonna show you guys how much you want with this alcohol so pay close attention or slow see the liquid building up at the bottom call it good now and maybe a little more right about when it gets to the top of your bud is when i'd stop maybe just a little over but you don't want to be wasting this [ __ ] and uh i think that should be good we're gonna seal her up and uh make sure she's sealed because you don't wanna be getting this [ __ ] everywhere shake it as good as you can i didn't leave much room left in this one you really don't got to shake it if you don't want to the alcohol is going to strip it regardless but i'd let that sit [ __ ] man must not have been sealed very good it's got [ __ ] all over me son of a [ __ ] but uh anyway you try and leave that part out but uh you let this [ __ ] sit let's say about an hour and uh yeah then we get to the next step which i'll have for you in about an hour so yeah i'll be back all right guys i'm back and i got a shitty camera angle here but what the [ __ ] you want me to do it's all i could do but uh anyway got a pyrex bull here and we've been letting that [ __ ] sit for an hour i went up to the store and [ __ ] and and i do a bunch of [ __ ] and anyway i'm getting started later than i wanted so i might kind of you know try to go fast through this [ __ ] as best i can but anyway you're gonna need glass pyrex bowl here all right and ideally you're going to want some cheese cloth for this to put over the bowl to uh filter your [ __ ] throughs you're not getting buttons [ __ ] in but uh i've got no cheesecloth so i used some redneck ingenuity and i got a [ __ ] pillow case and i secured it on there with a headband and uh i doubled it up i doubled up the pillowcase and uh i used it yesterday and i didn't see any [ __ ] butt or nothing in the [ __ ] so if you don't got cheesecloth use pillowcase like me rag whatever just make sure it fits on your bowl try and double it up and uh hold up real quick i'm about to pour like i said this is like the best cam ring like come up with fast give that one last shake and uh yeah there ain't nothing special man you just you let this [ __ ] sit in the alcohol you just pour it see some seeds pour it on in there let it [ __ ] sift through pillowcase actually works pretty good man ain't gonna lie oh [ __ ] but i wouldn't uh i wouldn't use pillowcase off your bed i would definitely use a spare one but i'll show you guys this oh covering up the camera sorry i gotta switch uh see that [ __ ] slowly draining through you see all the [ __ ] left behind see seed there really not that many seeds though seed there and yeah see we still got a bunch of [ __ ] in here but ain't gonna go to waste just wanna let all this good liquid get in there all right i think that soaked in about as good as can you get i don't know if i should i'm just gonna do the same i did yesterday put all this [ __ ] right the [ __ ] in there get all your [ __ ] off the jar best you can and uh you want to take whatever you secured i would recommend securing this to the bowl i guess you don't have to but considering you secured it to the bowl you're going to take that off [ __ ] try your best not to get this [ __ ] spilled you don't want weed flakes in your rso i should have another glove on but i don't know what i did with it but you're gonna last [ __ ] it you basically just want to squeeze this get all you can out of there oh dropping weed in there i can see it already i've fallen off this glove but yeah this is basically what you do until it stops flowing yeah this could take you you'll probably depends really how long you want to wait but probably like 10-15 minutes you could probably let it sit if you really just wanted to let it drip but uh yeah so i think you guys pretty much got the idea so i'm gonna come back to you you know it's time for the next step but i'm gonna let this drip and i got a few other jars i'm gonna run real quick and uh yeah i'll be back all right guys here we are man we got the next spark here and uh yeah for this you're gonna need a hot plate well ventilated area see i got this [ __ ] here got a little bit of weed hanging actually but uh what you're gonna want to do uh get your hot plate i got a little setting right now and i'm pouring some water in the [ __ ] so yeah you're gonna need some water and i'm just gonna put this whole picture in there and uh now what you're gonna do is you take your uh concoction you see i got it here and put it in there and i'm gonna put this aside cuz i got this jar and i've actually never done this in a jar and i really hope it doesn't break so if it does then i look like a dumbass but yes we get a little live experiment here actually today and yeah so honestly you'd like to have a little more water probably for the one in the jar i don't know how well it's gonna work but you know sometimes [ __ ] it but uh yeah i'm gonna go run grab that other jar and see if it fits but yeah basically for right now that's all you got to do you just want to make sure it's ventilated and got my mixer here you can see on the mixer that's what you want to end up with right there or something like that that's from yesterday but uh basically yeah we're rocking and rolling and it's about three o'clock and i kind of wish i would have got this started like this part of it started earlier but uh took a little longer than i wanted to in town and hopefully it's not [ __ ] too dark you know a lot of times the donald trump still show you guys out here because it's probably gonna be dark but uh yeah basically that's all you do for right now so i'll be back in a while probably take about two three about maybe four hours who knows but i'll be here and i'll show you yo what up guys it's been like [ __ ] probably a little under an hour and uh yeah give you a little see fumes cooking off and man it reeks like [ __ ] alcohol so yeah you can see the smoke flying out i'm sure but uh yeah that's why you want to use a ventilated area it's cold as [ __ ] too so that probably adds to it but you can kind of see well this bowl was a little dirty head tomorrow so in it but you can kind of see the line where it pointing out for you started about right here it's cooked off that far the jars is kind of hard to tell i don't know i don't know if the jars are cooking off is good because the water level is not you know yeah but uh [ __ ] it we'll figure it out but uh yeah it is working so we'll give it some more time and check back later yo guys what's up so it's been about three hours since you started cooking this [ __ ] and the [ __ ] that was in this pyrex i believe is finished [ __ ] in the jars you can see there's still quite a bit of [ __ ] liquid in there so well i'm guessing it was too deep in there and the [ __ ] in the pirates have more surface area you know so yeah i kind of want to let this [ __ ] pool up here is what i'm trying to do but you can see it's thicker it's not runny like it used to be and yeah it's just it's freezing [ __ ] cold this is probably the easiest way to get it out is when it's all pooled up so i'm just gonna let that run but yeah that's basically that's how you make rso man that's the cure for cancer right there uh yeah hope you enjoyed the video hope uh helped you out uh yeah that's about all i got uh be careful with this [ __ ] though man it'll [ __ ] you up so take a little bit see what's up if you've never taken it but yeah other than that later all right guys there we go it's our rso i know i said i was dumb but i just want to show you guys basically you can scrape it out of here and uh put it in this dish give it to my grandma it's ready to eat put on topically you know uh yeah basically whatever i might eat a little bit too just to uh test the waters but uh yeah other than that yeah i think this is gonna be the real end so later you", "FsqTJZjyj-g": "hello everybody and thank you so much for joining me I am so excited to share this video with you I'm gonna be teaching you how to make cannabis infused oil in five minutes or less and you do not need any special equipment to make this happen my name is Andrea McHargue I'm a cannabis wellness coach and educator and I'm really passionate about teaching you how you can incorporate cannabis into a healthy lifestyle for you I offer private consultations I'm soon to be offering group classes please check out my website at wwlp.com so that you are always in the lead all right I'm going to talk to you about why I love this recipe so much the first reason is that you do not have to use coconut oil if you don't like it or you have something else that you want to infuse go for it use olive oil use grapeseed oil use butter you can even warm up honey and infuse honey this exact same way there is no need to decarbonise I will teach you really quickly how to dose this after the video and I want to point out before we dive in that the recipe is linked in the description below in a handy PDF for you to print out so let's dive in here we have everything that you need to make cannabis infused coconut oil we have 1 cup of coconut oil a knife a spoon something to heat up the coconut oil with and this is the star of the show so this is a vial a 1 gram vial of something called Rick Simpson oil so it's also called RSO that stands for Rick Simpson oil it's also called FICO's which just sounds like a terrible name for full extract cannabis oil and basically what it is I in most cases is its cannabis that has been extracted into alcohol and then the alcohol has been boiled off and you're left with this really sticky goo sometimes it's extracted using co2 extraction which is also excellent so if you can find super concentrated cannabis oil that you know meets all the standards if you can get it with lab testing all of that then this is a fantastic way to make your edibles because it's very easy the first thing that you were gonna do is to make our coconut oil really warm because basically what we're gonna do is heat up our coconut oil or butter or whatever it is and then we're just gonna squirt this in - they are and stir it around until it's dissolved so I'm gonna go heat it up in my microwave and we'll be back in a sec the coconut oil was in the microwave for about 2 and 1/2 minutes now that depends on how cold your coconut oil is if you're in cold cold Canada then sometimes your coconut oil can be really freezing so you want it really warm this is very liquidy you you don't want it boiling or anything but you want it very warm because this stuff is so sticky and it's gonna take a while to dissolve so basically all I'm going to do you can see it looks gross actually whew I've got it all over the side you just squirt that in and you can see how green oh maybe you can't yeah you can see how green it is and you can see why it's sort in a syringe it is so so sticky so I'm just gonna try to get this off I'm not sure what I can do with the stuff that's left in the syringe I'm sure there's a way to get what's left out of there out oh yeah this is quite green I'm not sure if it's picking up on screen very well but this is a very green extraction sometimes they turn out black like almost Atari color and sometimes they turn out more like this all right that actually seemed to dissolve really really well so I'm just gonna spend some time stirring it just to make sure it's all the way through you definitely don't want to see any chunks in there you want to make sure that this is really really well incorporated into your coconut oil and then we're going to let the oil cool down and it's gonna take quite a while because we got it quite hot and then you can use this beautiful oil for anything so the cannabis infused fake 5 I posted last week absolutely any recipe that uses a cup of coconut oil sure half a cup sure cut it in half if you did butter instead make some cookies or put it on your toast you can do whatever you want alright wasn't that fantastically easy I hope you want to dive in the other reason why I love this recipe is because of dosing so let's talk really quickly about how to figure out doses for this cup of cannabis oil that we have first of all if you have lab tested cannabis then you will have the entire everything you need right on the label so check the label see how many milligrams of THC or CBD or the combination of both is in there and then you can use the same process to divide up your doses as we do down below if you don't have access to lab testing and you are going to go for an estimate then you can estimate that that one milligram that one milliliter vial of RSO has about seven to eight hundred milligrams of THC total so that's a that's 800 milligrams about for one cup of oil there's 48 teaspoons in a cup I looked it up so that leaves you with about 17 milligrams of THC per teaspoon so that makes it easy to know how to dose out your edibles or how to dose yourself if you have questions about this if you have comments please leave them below it really helps other people to find my videos when you make a comment so and I really like to read your comments and answer them so please do that and as I said before exciting things are happening at reveal especially if you live in and around the London Ontario area so make sure you stay tuned at my website thank you so much for watching and give me some time of yours today if you would like to learn how to start using cannabis right away head to my website sign up for my email list and you'll get redirected to a video right away that will teach you in about 15 minutes what to do you can also book private consultations with me and please subscribe to my channel and like this video I really appreciate I will see you next Saturday", "x_-3yX7fWak": "hi I'm its burly I'm the editor-in-chief of semiconductor engineering I'm over at advantage with Adrienne Quan it's going to talk today about the challenges of 5g tests so Adrienne 5g there is no single 5g there are multiple versions of this and there are multiple iterations of this what are some of the challenges that you're seeing as we go forward yeah the 5g is a new era right I mean is it's not just for mobile communication but it's gonna affect earth in all walks of life it's gonna deploy things like automotive infrastructures we're talking about more mobilities and we're talking about also having industrials and even things like we culture health care and things all this coming in together to actually formulate this whole 5g ecosystem what are some of the problems that we have to deal with in testing this because this is a brand new area that nobody's ever done before right right yeah so testing 5g devices obviously becomes a challenge especially in within the 8ee space where we have been so comfortable doing sub 6 gigahertz testing for the past 20 25 30 years right so things are gonna change absolutely right when it comes to testing this kind of new type of devices which encompass higher frequencies higher bandwidth different wattage modulation schemes you know and stuff like that why don't you draw the South worse sure what are we looking at here through this 5g spectrum here which also encompasses the 5g subsist gigahertz talking about 5g in the mini mini wave space which is also defined in the latest release of TPP and the millimeter wave obviously is a huge range between 24 to I mean about 44 gigahertz today but they also talks about 50 gigahertz and it may be even higher so we have to be ready for the future of 5g as we move along in terms of the frequency spectrum and on the other part of it as besides the frequency spectrum we also have to consider the modulation bandwidth or or the DD the frequency spectrum bandwidth a is going to be transmitted through the channel so in the subsist gigahertz range obviously typically bandwidth RBD indeed 300 megahertz modulation bandwidth the the six eight to 18 gigahertz or sometimes we coined is some 18 gigahertz at the beginning ranging between 500 800 and 1 gigahertz and that goes the same for the 1424 244 is there a difference when you're doing with the testing of the handset versus the base station yeah so typically handsets and base stations are very different because the infrastructure of the base station requires much more complexity in terms of in today's case if you discuss about base station that deploys 64 of 128 256 kind of face array obviously have a directive architecture from what the phone is where we probably only need by 8 or 16 or maybe max 32 kind of face array structures so testing them is definitely very different obviously we need to consider different things in terms of the architecture and historic form factors and stuff like that off between the base station and phone right and the handset gets very complicated because now you've got antennas built right into the chips - right correct yeah so antennas in package which is a IP is a common term today is gaining a lot of popularity because right now as we go higher in frequency obviously we can incorporate antennas within the the module itself right so this is something that needs to be technical consideration when test is involved how do you make sure you get enough coverage of these devices because they are very calm they're very dense in terms of test coverage definitely compared to what we are testing in the subsidies gigahertz transceivers today there's a lot more to consider because we need to especially for a IP devices or intendancy in package devices where we do you think about the safe registers we need about thing about getting controls both adding with these phase shifters and how they come together and how we actually measure up in terms of the different transmission angles and paths and how this different phase that we come together and combine at the end of the day and at the antenna side right so there's our the a lot of these challenges definitely we are going to face in the 80 space and you're also testing more than you were in the past right because now you're not only testing the device you're testing it in motion in the field yes so that's what we call Mishimoto testing or sometimes food duplex testing is becoming an anomaly stays and that's why with the architecture of the h ee has to really enable us to do this kind of testing because for the past 20 25 years the architecture of RF solutions on the h ee has has very very a lot of limitation in terms of doing this kind of mission mode testing you've got a lot of pieces here that you have to test for that you didn't necessarily have to test for in the past right correct yes and that's why here the diagram kind of illustrate I mean 5g is a basically a huge pipe right and obviously we have to consider the past standards like the ash GSM in the 2g 3G 4G and even today we have the LTE IOT or sometimes we call the narrowband IOT this are what we have today right in in today's will on the mobile phones but moving forward I think things are going to give even more complex I mean in terms of things in the automotive side like UWB which is ultra wideband is being deployed by chip manufacturers and obviously they demand for things like ultra-low latency which is the uar they demand for a huge deployment especially the ultra density we call it right and ultra density deployment so this is where automotive comes into play where if structures needs to be deployed automobile would have to be deployed so these are the things that are coming into this whole 5g pipeline what are you actually testing for there is it the device itself and the standard kinds of tests that you do or you are you really working now on signal integrity what's going to work out in the field well yeah the device itself has to first of always operate in a slightly different frequency range not within our norm of the sub 6 gigahertz so we need to kind of take care of that in that space right and obviously at the end of the day this device will have to work with the infrastructures and within the ecosystem of 5g so then again that is a different set of tests in in pomona system level type of things and this gets even more complicated because not only do you have a 5g signal you also have the 4G and 3G when you start running out of range - right and all the stuff has to continually work together exactly I think the backward compatibility is necessity because I mean we roam all fours everywhere we go today globally so therefore not everyone is in the same level in terms of network deployments so it has to have some kind of backward compatibility so one of the things about 5 T is this is not just a one user type of chip it's a multi-user type of approach as well as a single user right right so for 5g test cells the is a little bit very different from what we have on 40 because 5g test cells demand for much higher capacity protesser which means higher user equipments higher number of mobile devices there has to be supported we did the same test cell so that's therefore there's even talks of going into smaller test cell where we talk about femtocells or Pico cells where we need to deploy things like massive MIMO right so massive use of my voice is the key and how we actually do it is the different components that really make up the massive buy more number one is the special diversity which means you're gonna receive signals from multiple antennas that's number one right so that's very critical in massive MIMO how you deal with this in test two and that becomes really interesting in 5g because these signals are so particularly as you get at the millimeter wave there's such high frequency that they don't travel through things they don't necessarily travel as are exactly yeah so that's why the specialist if diversity is very critical because you get signals from all over different antennas that becomes combine signals and make sure it gets directed to that user or the particular device within the test cell right so that's very critical and definitely we sought the location is also very critical so how to really maximize the battery lives of the user equipments so the resource that we use or the infrastructure users to allocate to a particular user needs to be very efficient and that's the thing there has to be taken care of within that infrastructure type of devices - and the third one is really the spectral efficiency how we're going to divide the spectrum we is only that small between so many users right so that spectral deployment efficiency has to be there in terms of per user right within the 5g tester and lastly is the back-end processing which is the multi-user how am I supposed to process all the different users they are transmitting or receiving signals at the same time and this is really a lot of this 5g AI that might be deploy in the future especially in the base station or the infrastructure site one of the issues with 5g is it's a very complex technology you're testing a lot more than you were in the past these chips are more complicated than they were in the past sometimes they're even in packages how do you manage to keep that tested moving throughout the fat without slowing it down over what was done with a path in the past with a de yeah so I think the integration of the different technologies whether is it packaging whether is it the eyepiece base tax and stuff like that this are definitely changing the way we test these devices today obviously a lot of the new packaging type like si P or a IPS in a coming near future this are definitely something that we need to consider in terms of tests so these are all of the learning things that we are actually doing on the 880 e that that make sure we can able to test this type of devices in the future so we are actually revolving ourselves as well in the HTS space to adapt to this type of new technologies that will be deployed for 5g devices and you've got a few years to work on this right because this stuff is not rolling out tomorrow well yes I know I mean we have some customers that are already have samples that that they want to release ship for early users trials and stuff like that so the the service providers are actually doing a lot of this and to end user trials for 5g but but obviously mainstream consumer will take a couple more years to deploy Adrienne Quan thanks for a great explanation of a very complex subject thank you and thanks for having me here", "8b0sqs5n-IQ": "Hey Florida medical marijuana visions was evident this is Florida medical marijuana reviews with a little bit of tips and tricks for how you can use your RSO from anywhere really we have one here from move which tasted excellent had what seems like strong indications of an actual full-spectrum product here with actual CBD milligrams in it unlike what I've seen from truly where they don't even be be able to have a cannabinoid profile on it of CBD there's none whatsoever when finding a preferred intake method for your artisan you really either want to just take it straight since it's already activated or find a way to mix it into something that isn't going to be heated so I chose icing icings on top of a brownie I get to dose it as I please to each bite that I'd take I don't have to share it in the banner with everyone else because it's my icing in my medicine so this was honestly the best thing for everyone everyone still got to eat a brownie I got to keep the medicine to myself because I stuck my fingers in it and I enjoyed dosing smally as I ate my brownies like I was definitely able to watch how I was able to medicate from this rather than necessarily eat a big fat brownie per se and then find out how strong this RSO is but the reason you don't want to be actually reheating your RSO while cooking it into say a brownie batter is because when you start reheating your THC that's already activated you're actually going to degrade it into CBN which isn't necessarily something bad some people actually may like a higher percentage of CBN which can help you with all kinds of sleep and pain needs it's a great cannabinoid but it will definitely alter what the product was already if you were choose to heat it again say in the brownie batter rather than something like icing that's never heated again thanks again for watching Florida medical marijuana abuse", "ppKvv2668OI": "[Music] when I was doing a bite here and today we're going to make some high-quality MCT oil using some canvas so there is a couple of steps to this and we do need a couple of different things so everything that we are going to be I have right here in front of us so we're going to need a crock pot for using this method of the making our empty tio which is a batch to the have right here this is some very potent stuff I found this out last night you're supposed to start low and go slow I definitely suggest doing that so when you're going to need for this is some MCT oil that you could pick up if you're in Canada at GNC health has some pretty cheap or if you go to probably any local health food store they're probably gonna have this stuff you're going to need some cannabis depending on how much you want the rear there are calculators out there and I will put a link for a calculator to kind of give you a rough estimate of how potent your your things are going to be like let's if you want to make gummies or stuff like that so I'm gonna put the calculator below and it'll basically just help you decide what you're going to do now when I made this little here I used 38 grams of cannabis as well as I don't know probably like three four grams of Keef and just the mixture of other candidates that I had around so it was pretty potent stuff so if you're going to use okay so to start we need to talk about D carving your cannabis or decarboxylation it's basically turning your THC a into THC which is what you are really looking to do if you're going to ingest cannabis now if you don't decarboxylate it really won't do much for you so what we're going to do so I guess what I should say is you have a couple of different methods of being able to decrypt leave so you can use the crockpot method because on high they usually heat up to around 220 degrees you put it in a calendar and you just put it there thank you news [Music] okay so there are a couple of different ways that you can be box decarboxylate your cannabis so you could either put it into a canning jar you can put it onto a cookie sheet or something like that or something like this here silicone cookie sheet and you can put this in your oven for about an hour at 225 degrees and that will decarboxylate your canvas this is the method that I chose to do this because when you do it inside of a canning jar with the lid closed you were actually keeping in the terpenes now if you were to just decarboxylate on a cookie sheet throw down a silicone on top of that that put your cannabis right on it you are actually going to lose your turkeys you're going to strip them out of your oil and that's something that I did not want to do so the canning jar method for this instance is a pretty good way of doing that because if you're doing your infusion in the same jar that you decarboxylated it you're going to keep all of your terpenes inside your jar which is great so let's start the process so in the oven 220 degrees for an hour what you're going to do is want to take this out every 15 minutes set an alarm and you're gonna want to turn your jar just kind of shake it up make sure that it's kind of everywhere mixed up and every half hour you're gonna want to burp the jar so you're only gonna burp it once burp it in the first half hour period then you take your cannabis out of the oven you are pretty much good to go so I have some footage that I use the making this oil here and this here is a pretty potent oil I had some last night and I can honestly tell you that you should probably really start slow and go from there don't don't overdo it I made some gummies and just like licking the spoons and the bowls I think I got my fill so yeah make some pretty potent oil and that's we're planning on doing here today it's you know so let's get started and we'll go from here [Music] so the reason why I'm wishing it up like this is because I have 473 milliliters of MCT oil and I know that that won't be a full jar up to here so we're just gonna squish it down [Music] all right that one's mixed up you see this mixed up pretty good here let's get this in the MCT oil and we're gonna get into the slow cooker [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the reason one of the reasons why we did it into the canning jar meant that was so that we were able to keep the terpene profile over animus now if you were to just decarboxylate on a tray we wouldn't got the same abilities out of it so we would have lost all of our terpenes [Music] this here looks like it's just to say covering at all and we got maybe like a couple teaspoons left in the bottle [Music] so perfect [Music] [Music] all righty guys so we dropped her in there and now you just gotta let her do or think what we're gonna do is just I guess probably keep filling this crock pot back up with water as imagine it's gonna get pretty hot and we're gonna lose some of its kind of the steam out so we'll just have to keep an eye on so we'll come back and check them in this problem you tomorrow all right guys so it's been about 12 hours now we put it in a little midnight last night it's just a little bit past noon here and 66 degrees Celsius one hundred and forty nine point seven it's temperature that it's been going at on high and if we take a look at her oil when first put it in it was clear oil now we can see it's a nice dark green delicious looking oil let's see if we can maybe get under light here a little bit sassy we'll get you a better shot your moment with flashlights alright alright guys so I've got my measuring cup I've got the strainer that sits in it I've got my cheesecloth what I'm gonna do is take this out of here this is actually pretty freakin hot play with and we're just gonna let it cool off for a little bit and while that's cooling off let me get some cheese bot open [Music] get a couple little laters wrapped around here don't really wanna be able to see through it but I would like to filter out most of those kind of fine once particles so I've got me one of these Curie filters and that's really gonna get all the very fine fine fine stuff out of it so that's what I'm gonna use for the very fine stuff so for now we're just going to pour it here into the cheesecloth get out most of the large particulates and then we're going to do the finds with this year we should have some awesome future oil and then with this taintdroid we can do lots of things with make some gummies well I don't really know lots of things but other than just that using this nature but I really want to make some gummies and that's what I was thinking about doing so if you guys are interested in that let us know and we will make a video for you on how to make gummies you can probably start to see this I'm not sure if you can see some camera not butter there's a nice green oil nice green danger I think what I've done here is underestimated the amount yes I have underestimated the amount the cheesecloth I would need to strain this out [Music] [Music] oh yeah there's quite a bit in this cannabis though [Music] you've got a clip holding this and now we're going to just do we're fine strain into our jar that we're going to store it in a little bit better review here my messy cupboard cannabis all over it alright [Music] all right so I've got a lid wash to clean ready here what I'm going to do is I'm going to stick a notice I got some MCT oil it was made November 5th 2019 and we're just gonna stick that on here now I'm gonna grab a flashlight so we can kind of see this here so we can see here it is a greenish oil we put it in it was Coulier clear clear and now it's a nice green so what you're gonna want to do the store this oil is it want to put it in a nice cool dark place some people recommend putting it in the fridge and that's one of the benefits of the MTT oil if you put it into the fridge it will not solidify like it does if you were to use coconut oil and I believe that also preserves a little bit longer as well so there's definitely some benefits of using the MTT oil so here you have it guys I hope this video was easy enough for everyone this stuff here tastes really good this tastes a lot better than the textures that I was buying from the licensed producers and with 38 grams plus a couple of grams of Keef this [ __ ] it should be pretty good well so we're gonna try some out and yeah we'll go from there [Music]", "d4z4TYZGYY8": "hey guys it's adrian the naturalist and we're just finishing our very clean 16 car wash that my dad gave me say what hey guys we just finished the car wash it's adrian the naturalist having a great day hope you guys are having a great humble day it is wednesday it is beautiful it is sunny it is awesome here love you guys well hey guys hey it's adrienne the naturalist and we are back my hair is a little goldish blondish in the front sides it's still got the brown rocking it in the back and your girl's in uh bubble gum pink with cotton candy lips i swear to god that's what it looks like just want to hop on real quick before i take a drive here to go to the nursery with my mask on of course i want to show you guys that i got an order from a company this has really helped my headaches and migraines you can find them online they're called lazarus naturals and they send me this really cute little free sticker they sent me a little pamphlet on their products and how they work and how they make them let's see what it says from the farm to your door our process start to finish your cbd starts as hemp grows on central oregon farms this is out of oregon i guess it starts at oregon and then after harvest the hemp is dried baked and tagged cannabinoids terps and flavonoids are extracted and filtered to remove impurities plant material is tested for heavy metals pesticides and levels of potent potential potency sorry um cbd is formulated with active effective ingredients and a third-party test for residual solvulence heavy metals pesticides microbial impurities and potencies and finally they're packaged at our at their fda listed ccmp facility and it says at the bottom we fill every order ourselves using biodegradable and recyclable materials this part is printed on 100 post consumer waste paper and in the front it talks about them there's a picture i think of the owner and with a bunch of hemp plant and it says made to work we do it all from our farm to your front door we deliver consistent high quality and effective products thank you for choosing lazarus naturals and you can find them at i'll link it down below ladrissnationals.com they sell two sizes and what i got from that's really been working for my headaches and migraines is putting into capsules twice a day of their full spectrum cbd rso which is known as rick simpson oil rick simpson is a canadian who patented a marijuana oil and now it can be made derived from cbd hemp plant and this uh extraction process of rso has been known to dissolve tumors in the body and with what's going on in my head my head pain it'll help just you know continue to make it smaller and manageable and it really seems to work each small syringe they sell their one gram syringes are 39.99 i believe on their website and for one of those you get 20 doses out of it you literally put like there's you'll see half a milliliter in a capsule and it'll fill a double size zero capsule like halfway to three quarters just perfectly so 50 milligrams of full spectrum cbd rso and i want to show you guys what they throw in for free right now and then we all need this with a virus going around the good old coronavirus they sent me some lemon scented 80 alcohol antiseptic topical solution spray naturally kills 99 of germs and this is about four three and a half ounces almost 3.4 fluid ounces all right well i will show you guys the rso here in a second i promised you guys i was going to show you the full spectrum rick simpson oil cbd version that i was talking about that i showed you guys i read the pamphlet on the left show you the sticker on the bottom middle and here's how i do my doses so these are a hundred or a thousand milligram syringes each they're 40 on their website i believe it's 39.99 plus tax and shipping um each syringe has 20 doses at 50 milligrams of cbd rso full spectrum um i take two a day i wait six hours apart and i take them with a little bit of like a cracker or starch because they're hard on the stomach because they're you know an rso rick simpson oil version of um cbd um and what was i gonna say with that and i also do it with a little bit of fat mixed in so like a glass of milk would be good or some kind of other like coconut milk if you don't do dairy something just a little bit of fat to bind the oil with in your stomach it is harsh you do not necessarily have to take it in capsule it takes longer to activate it takes two hours to activate its potential peak at three hours and lasts for another two so it lasts longer but it takes longer to take effect um it's more cost efficient um to take it this way but if you were to per say take it on a little piece of cracker or bread or under your tongue if you can actually um adhere to the taste of it's a little earthy a little kind of you know earthy tasting but under the tongue sublingually is the fastest way next to vaping or smoking and no you cannot vapor smoke rick simpson oil it can also at last be put on topically to um for things like rashes or cancers rick simpson oil was created by canadian his name was rick simpson hence why it's called rick simpson oil and this is the full spectrum cbd version this is actually helping patients dissolve cancerous tumors you can put on skin cancer and it'll dissolve away the skin cancer it's really good for headaches and migraines which i suffer from if you haven't been to my channel yet it's good for chronic pain issues like fibromyalgia arthritis like i suffer from it's fantastic because it's full spectrum cbd for anxiety and depression mood disorders schizophrenia paranoia it's a good level out this has up to three percent thc in it so it is technically a marijuana product but in my program that i do for recovery from drugs and alcohol this is considered cbd and it is a supplement you only have to be 18 to buy this online or in washington state where it's made locally in oregon um these expire in may of 2022 so i just bought these so these last each you know they're good for about a year and a half to store them away i would say don't store them in a hot area not too cold either as you can see this oil fills up about half the capsule at 50 milligrams i can't zoom in with my hand with a tripod but here's what it is um and you can't really see it either it's kind of oh there we go 1 000 milligrams total of cbd 100 milligrams cbd per milliliter and i take half a milliliter twice a day that's what's in each one of these capsules and then in addition to that i wanted to show you guys another video on the other cbd oil that i combine with this on a daily basis i take this with these twice a day and i'll take a dose in the afternoon to relieve some pain and anxiety i suffer from as you can see my hands shaking because i get chronic headaches and migraines almost daily for the last couple years my higher power god is healing me he's healing me on my cluster headaches as well um i'm also doing it through diet and exercise meditation prayer um it's a full it's a full job to take care of headaches and migraines and chronic pain issues so i cut out sugar again no sugar sugar substitutes unless i'm treating myself and i go out like during the week for a coffee to go and there's maybe a little sugar in the oat milk that they have at the coffee stand and i'm also going to look into cutting out processed foods more my body's detoxing right now but yeah definitely check out lazarusnaturals.com and check out their products they also sell tinctures and creams and all that fun good cbd stuff that helps with uh mental and physical ailments and disabilities in life so this was adrian the naturalist i definitely give this a 10 a time this combined with the relax full spectrum cbd oil i get from cbd diamond.com or maybe it's diamondcbd.com i was getting mixed up that one i just showed you i will do a separate video on that too as well and give you a review but this is a definitely like i said a 10 out of 10 star rating is the only thing combined with the other cbd oil and even on its own that helps with my headaches and migraines and it's actually reducing them down the amount during the week as well as the intensity so check this product out you will not be disappointed i love you guys i'm sorry i'm getting this out a day late here on thursday i filmed the rest of it yesterday on wednesday i had a really nice good sunny day um and i hope you guys are having a good morning or afternoon or evening wherever you're at thanks for tuning in to my channel my name was eight my name is adrian the naturalist i'm still waking up it's almost 8 39 a.m here i'm just eating some crackers and taking my medications for the morning and my cbd oils um for my pain anxiety migraines headaches you know all that fun stuff that i deal with on a daily basis that can be managed and can get better um but yeah i should make a video if you guys want on my full approach to how i help my pain and mental disabilities through natural medicine and we've got some pharmaceutical medicine here i take that i talked about maybe in a video there's my crackers there's my water putting some more capsules together you guys got some sweet potatoes some pears lots of good whole foods that i've been eating that i've been helping so i'm detoxing that like i said all right guys hope you have a nice day i'll see you later hi guys it's adrian the naturalist and my mom and i and her dog are at christensen's nursery flower store outdoor store all masked up and ready wipes and hand sanitizer so this is my lucky brand clothing mask that i really like and i wear it and then off of the day when i go out a couple times a week and then i will throw it in the wash and let it hang dry so we're gonna go look at some plants i'll bring you guys along mom's not gonna get in it but we're at christensen's nursery here in mount vernon marysville area in washington state paparazzi and we're gonna look at some herbs today guys hey mom they're on sale the summer herbs are 20 off but a lot of these will come back next year not the dil well they all will the cilantros and dills and there's chives on the bottom bell peppers on the top i don't want those what else do they have they have what is this [Music] this is i don't know i'm videoing mom that's cool it'll be fine i'll take him out i guess he'll survive dogs out in my truck making a crazy commotion my mom's dog there in that red ford ranger is mine huh old washroom here at um christensen's nursery here in washington state i want to show you guys how old school this bathroom is it's got one of those locks they've got some flowers there's my keys right there i'm about to use the bathroom but they've got all these cool like things going on on the walls hey there's me i don't wear my glasses because it

development of new services we want to provide the best network for all major users of mobile data citizens businesses and society as a whole now and in the future Aliza 5g rise to a new level", "drX6--JlkdE": "what we're showing here today is a millimeter wave based system that is moving towards what we envision 5g to be it should be noted that 5g and millimeter wave are not synonymous there is 5g that will be operate in the subsequent as well as in the millimeter wave what we're showing here are some of the enabling technologies for millimeter wave we have a base station that's back this way where we have two antenna systems each one has 8x8 array forming 48 beams and we have two of these arrays each of which has two polarizations so we can create four independent streams to talk to the user equipment which we have over here and it also has an antenna array of eight elements so what we're showing here is the system operating on eight hundred megahertz bandwidth that's made up of eight component carriers each of which is a hundred megahertz so we're using one of these component carriers to carry the video and we've sort of locked in a manual QoS so that it's good and solid on the other seven carriers were simply running data at its fastest rate so we're showing the 4k video in the upper left in the lower left we're showing the aggregated throughput on the left side of that and just some of the concepts that were demonstrating here today including multi-user or single-user MIMO beamforming being tracking variable TDD so we can actually change the upper eight uplink and downlink amounts to get different rates in the upper right what we're showing is a view from the base station of the room and of the user equipment each one of these white dots is a lust rate ofwhere the beams might point if they were being formed on a particular beam according to this diagram here so the green circle that you see here you'll notice it when there are more people in here moving between a couple of different B as it optimizes the throughput versus the interference or blockages that it sees in each beam so you'll see it going between beam number 30 and number 42 we're also showing here the throughput on each one of the carrier's individually these get aggregated for the total throughput down here we're showing the probability of the modulation and coding scheme that's being used and all of this is being done in real time so you can get an idea of how the system is operating and at what levels for error correction coding it's using what modulation rates it's using here we have the block error rate per carrier so with the video we wanted to ensure that that's a good solid video so we made sure that we choose an MCS level and an FEC level that gives us very very low error rates the others were shooting at a target of a 5% block error rate and so you can see how that changes here and the MCS and FEC changed to ensure it stays at about that level and then in the lower right is the probability of what rank is being used and that has to do with MIMO so there are four independent streams as long as the radio carrier is of the right quality it can use each one of these streams independently if the quality starts to degrade it may reduce the number of streams that it uses so that's being shown here so this allows us to show some of the capability with millimeter wave this is being done at 15 gigahertz we will be operating very soon at 28 gigahertz as well and this is the first time that AT&T has come out in in the public with our demonstration of some of the work that we're doing we're doing additional work in our labs here in Austin were testbed where as we continue to improve the capability we are adding those to our testbed and continuing to work and feed back into 3gpp and use the benefit of our knowledge there to help improve the standards", "z5kSOLH-4oc": "[Music] okay grow hams what the heck is going on it's rando i'm gonna make today some rick simpson oil i'll show you the ingredients you need first you need some weed some gnarly [ __ ] and you need about probably about one or two ounces i might go an ounce and a half just to have a good look at this stuff this is this is um skull [ __ ] a combination of blue dream and ak-48 and we gotta crush all those up plus you need um some 99 alcohol costs about 22 bucks a gallon and you're gonna need a hot plate and it has to be electric because you don't want no flames this [ __ ] is so freaking uh explosive it's not funny and of course you have to be outside home ramble fresh air gotta have some music on look at this day it is one o'clock and 68 degrees unbelievable i'll ramble the jamaican blue mountain crossed with the lamb's breath is still ripening up out there and the oranges are looking good ramble ramble still has a few um uh of these uh nuts to finish off those are walnuts i grew myself up in my front yard chow down rambo he likes to um chew on the carpet it's really painful to step on them okay what else do you need you need because you need a bowl we'll crush them up and and you need a bigger bowl and you need a strainer you know of course you need some good weed to smoke too while you're working on it something good to drink and over and out i'll be right back [Music] okay once you got your um your buds ground down to a good consistency and got rid of most your stems and everything you're ready for some isopropyl alcohol 99 holy [ __ ] best used by 110 20 21 that means we're already out of date [Applause] now you got to make sure you put in enough to completely cover the canvas and you need a good spoon for um mixing it all up now you could probably do this for 10 minutes five ten minutes i would i would say ten minutes and what i heard is this um pure alcohol actually depletes the the thc out of the buds and brings it into the alcohol just sucks it out like us like a slushy machine [Music] foreign [Music] um [Music] it's barely warm it might be too cold outside i might have to crank this heat up a little i'll go to one and a half let's see how that works [Music] okay finally we got some action happening starting to boil got on a slow boil let me see what time is it now it's about three o'clock and uh it might take another two hours hopefully be done by five o'clock so stay tuned it's a little breezy out here nice temperature probably 67 68 degrees hold on [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] well finally the rick simpson oil is done what time is it what's about four o'clock i think i spent about three hours making it and look how much i got it's a [ __ ] ton out of about two ounces about five dollars worth of um alcohol and uh a dollar's worth of electricity and oh this is some potent ass [

and out you", "1IH5Ct13v2c": "what cios need to know about private 5g networks i'm tanya hall and joining me is alejandro hookman senior vice president of engineering at qualcomm welcome alejandro hi danielle welcome thank you of course how are you involved with 5g at qualcomm um 5g at qualcomm we run a group that works with operators around the world in helping deploy 5g networks so we help them with education we help them in understanding the technology and not just operators but also industry leaders where are we liable to find private 5g networks today well uh private 5g networks uh there's been a lot of industries that have actually had and requirements where the public networks do not quite meet that if you think about it there are industries where they may have specific latency requirements or specific speed requirements or reliability requirements and if they cannot get that with the public network or with a wi-fi network they've deployed 4g networks now with 5g there's a lot more of these capabilities right now in terms of reliability in terms of latency and that's what we're seeing a lot of industries right now deploying or interested in the 5g networks so so then what do cios need to know about private 5g networks uh well i mean you know there's no talk of the digital future anymore i think it's it's here right now in in just a few months there's been a tremendous leap on how people view technology and everybody's recognizing some of these benefits that maybe would have taken five to ten years under different circumstances so uh cio's right you know employees right now want to be able to have the exact same experience that they have on site as they have offsite so basically access to the cloud in terms of extreme low latencies you want to be able to work from home or work from anywhere the same as if you were in the office certainly conference rooms the whole capability of virtual presence so this is just the starting point the other piece that i want to mention is both cios and ctos they're now looking at not only the operational piece but also the production pieces they actually not just want to connect the employees they want to think about their facility and how we make the productivity and the production facilities in terms of manufacturing building management systems uh it can go on and on so what do business users need to take advantage to do to take advantage of existing private 5g networks well uh i'll give you one example we're talking with um cios around building management systems and if you think about it they're looking at for example connecting fire alarms uh wirelessly with a kind of feature you need extremely low latency and extremely high reliability that is just one example and of course remote control anything that would require a remote control where you need extremely low latency what security implications should we consider when implementing a private 5g network yes definitely that is also another question 5g in a lot of cases you have assigned your own spectrum so you're not on a public spectrum in terms of unlicensed spectrum so it's licensed and what that means is that uh there is no chance of of selling people getting into your spectrum and maybe you may have performance issues so it's a dedicated spectrum that you will be able to use and the other piece is maybe you control your own equipment uh so these days the equipment 45g has become more open it's more interoperable there are a lot more vendors out there doing infrastructure equipment so this allows economies of scale where cios can actually implement their own private network and have control of exactly what speeds and reliability they may need what's next on the 5g horizon what capabilities will we have maybe in the next coming year that we don't actually have today um well definitely far faster speeds reliability and latency those are key because you can access you get the cloud closer to your device but the one that i'm more interested about is the indoor positioning actually that's one that people don't talk about and i think that has tremendous possibility this is the ability for you to be able to accurately position a device within a few inches so this opens up the possibility in terms of you know asset tracking warehouse inventory all kinds of opportunities where you can actually control and also control for example of automated guided vehicles for manufacturing plants so indoor positioning i believe is one that people don't usually talk about but it's a capability coming up on 5g what recommendations can you offer to organizations that will implement private 5g networks soon uh well there is a lot of discussion today the the first thing would be understand depending on the region of the world you're in what the spectrum situation is whether you will rely on some of the spectrum from your operator or whether you can actually get in many countries actually there's dedicated spectrum that somebody can request and then also look at the equipment there's a lot of companies out there that are offering uh very capable equipment right now for example you can get 5g base stations pretty much the size of your wi-fi access points and you have the capability of connecting them where they would have power over ethernet so you could take out your wi-fi access point and maybe replace it with a 5g exit point that also has wi-fi capabilities so we're trying to make this very very simple to install a private 5g network alejandro hulkman by senior vice president of engineering at qualcomm thanks again for for coming on and joining us and talking a little bit about 5g if somebody wants to connect with you alejandra what's the best way they can do that well the best way you go into our website the team that we run is called esg engineering services group and again we help many industries and operators worldwide so happy to take questions and

valleys and I'm coming on today to talk about how things are going for me with the Rick Simpson oil it's been I think at least three weeks if not a month that I've done a video I've been laying a bit low and putting in a lot of effort into working outside it's it's spring here in Vermont and I just have not been wanting to do anything inside but I am still taking the Rick Simpson oil so the last video if I recall correctly that I did was on hyperemesis cannabis hyperemesis and how that for some individuals cannabis can affect your body in a certain way and make you feel dizzy and nauseous and lightheaded and I was having those feelings and so I thought maybe that was from that I've sinned so I backed off I completely stopped doing all Rick Simpson oil for a few days and then I brought it back in just like little bits here and there and I didn't notice any dizziness but I did notice a correlation of dizziness when I took magnesium so I think that I overdosed on some magnesium I was doing um a magnesium protocol for something else and I think that might be the culprit for me though I'm not ruling out the cannabis hyperemesis I'm not going to roll that out quite yet because I haven't upped my intake of Rick Simpson oil to the degree that I was doing it when I got that dizzy and the reason is because I I I just can't afford it at this point it's so expensive to buy all the weed and I'm not in serious need of it like there's no I don't have one main illness that I'm really trying to get rid of and if I did that I would you know make the effort but where I am now is the most valuable thing that I find with the Rick Simpson oils to help me with sleeping and so what I've been doing is I have been reserved my doses for a really late in the day like what I'm done pretty much done with my day so I take a dose usually around 5:30 6:30 now that it's summer and the kids are out of school I'm able to go to bed a little bit later and so I take it sometimes as late as 8:00 and I try to take two doses and I find that one dose isn't enough to help me really sleep one dose meaning the size of a grain grain of rice and that's what I consider a dose with the RSO and so I take one dose about you know around 6:30 7:00 or so that timeframe and as soon as I feel like I can just drop in and not you know be on the phone or do work on my computer or engage too much with other people because it does make me feel stoned and I like to have more just freedom to do whatever I want to do when I am in that space I tend to get a little bit sleepy with that first dose especially if I am already tired and then I take a second dose is within about an hour hour and a half I take a second dose the same amount and when that hits I try to be in bed because I'm I get really puts me out it puts me gives me really tired I found that if I do a little too much more than that grain I was trying to do like a grain and a half to get the healing benefits to get more inside of me but I found that it got me too stoned and I was unable to drop in and go to sleep my mind became too active and I was like laying there trying to sleep but I felt like my eyes were fluttering and I felt just too much activity going on in my brain and that could just be for me but it didn't help me sleep if I took too much but again maybe I needed to take just a little bit more and it would knock me out so I'm kind of just oh I well I'm just kind of at a standstill with it I just take basically the amount of two grains and call it a night and then that's it I don't take anything during the day and I I feel pretty good I still I feel that upbeat Ness that I've been feeling with the Rick Simpson oil today I pulled out for you guys my the syringes so like if somebody's here that's new to watching my progress or how I'm doing with the RSO I made these a little while ago and I just pulled it out of the fridge to show you I'm not gonna take a dose right now but this is pretty much all I have left so I do need to I need to make another batch you know within when I get to about halfway mark so this is definitely a really easy way to I find to take it so that's where I'm at and I sleep really well with this stuff and there's been a couple nights where mm-hmm I haven't taken the RSO for one reason or another I just um well I guess I should share that I have this like since I was probably having babies it started where I couldn't I have a hard time sleeping I mean obviously when you have babies but I am I became a really light sleeper and anything would wake me up and so I find with the Rick Simpson oil that it puts me into a deeper state of sleep and I can sleep for five six hours without waking up once and then I'll wake up and I'll you know go right back to sleep like I'm pretty quick to drop back in now if I'm not doing the Rick Simpson oil I find like I'm not and I'm not like extremely tired because if I can get myself so in the past before the RSO in the past what I would do is I would I would not sleep very much for two or three nights and I would sleep really fitfully I toss and turn I I just I'm not I can't I haven't been able to drop into that deep sleep since having babies and and it's become harder and harder as I've gotten older especially like in the middle of the night like I can sleep I can fall asleep fine it's just the that I wake up but I feel like you know I just can't sleep and my body feels like a lot of tension and I feel kind of hyper in my body I have this really strange feeling in my body that I just can't drop in and so I've the Rick Simpson oil it's definitely a sedated for me it definitely makes me feel like I can just I go in I go deep and I stay there for a little while then when I wake up to pee or have a drink of water I can go right back to sleep like within seconds like I'm not even thinking about anything and I should say that I have been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder which I've come to realize maybe is not even like what is you know I still don't quite understand what that might mean for me anymore cuz it's just you know maybe a characteristic but there is definitely something to that my brain does fire off in a certain way and my body is much more harder to settle down just to get into that restful deeply relaxed space even during the day it can be a challenge I tend to be more you know busy and just go go go so things like meditation are so valuable for me and I met at eight every day and I have been meditating every day for quite a while and that very much helps but the Rick Simpson oil oh my gosh I mean I so I'm reserving because I really can't afford to take it the full dosage like the way that Rick Simpson suggests you to take it I can't take that amount at this point in time and so I've chosen to do the minimal amount for the maximum of the benefit that I want which is for sleeping and it works totally works I wake up I feel so rested I don't feel hungover at all I find that if I take the if I take the medicine and then I go to sleep before it really hits then the next morning I can feel a little groggy and just disorient it a little bit but if I take the medicine you know well before bed and then go to bed once I feel the effects not a problem and I will say and I'll do another video later outside I have my plants my cannabis plants my indica strained cannabis plants outside as we speak and and they're growing and I will harvest them if all goes well I'll harvest them at the end of the summer so that will be a big chunk of Rick Simpson oil for me and I have an order in for three more clones so I have a total of six plants on my land and excuse me and that will you know then maybe I'll up my dose so that's where things are at and yeah happy sleeping to everybody who's trying this because I've tried melatonin I tried circadian like sleeping rhythmically which helps a lot but it hasn't been that the total trick for me though that more than anything has has helped me well other than the Rick Simpson oil that's helped me number one but circadian rhythm sleeping like sleeping on a regular time and getting up at the same time has helped me incredibly I don't always do it but it really really helps me avoiding all caffeine after you know three o'clock is huge for me if I can avoid it after one that's even better I don't drink coffee I cannot drink coffee I just do a cup of black tea but I have tried like every homeopathic you know insomnia sleeping thing I've tried so many things and this Rick Simpson oil has been by far the best thing that I've tried so that's it okay well good stuff really good stuff and I'll be back to show you guys my plants okay", "QxBDmA__rdA": "one of the major challenges that face our customers when bringing 5g handsets to market really lies around the antenna management when you think about it you're trying to add 5g to an already dense radio network where you've got Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS and 4G ultra wideband already enabled and in today's handsets it's at very difficult to build a suitable antenna environment when it comes to managing all these signals around the antenna the antenna tuning and switching is paramount and the performance of it will really dictate the performance of the system we're looking forward later this year of bringing MEMS technology into this application they promises much lower loss a much higher quality factor to enable better performance overall in handset you", "Ig-mNLIdGYE": "on today's video I'm going to show you how to make cannabis capsules or canna caps in two different ways well we're gonna talk about why choose canna caps whether you infuse or not all the materials that you'll need and then I'll do a demonstration for you and then we'll come back and talk a little bit about dosing hi my name is Andrea Hogg I'm a cannabis coach and educator we do a whole bunch of stuff besides weekly YouTube videos online classes workshops one-to-one consultations you can find out all about that and get some really cool three stuff by heading to reveal cannabis calm so why go through the investment of time and equipment and resources to make canna caps what are the benefits of them well for lots of people taking a capsule is a really familiar way to take medication so especially for people who are new to cannabis and might hold lots of stigma against it sometimes taking it in a capsule can feel really reassuring to them they're very easy to take just like regular capsules you just swallow them and they're easy to increase or decrease the dose so you can start out with one capsule and then see how you feel and then increase from there they're super easy to store you just keep them in a cool dry place maybe in the fridge if you'd like they're very discreet you can keep them in your purse or your pocket and medicate as you need and making them yourself saves you so much money over store-bought traditionally canna caps have been filled with cannabis infused oil so that's oil that's been infused with cannabis and then they strain the cannabis out they take the oil and they fill up the capsules with it but you don't have to go through that step if you don't want to so if you prefer you can simply D carve your cannabis in the oven grind it up slightly and then use the capsule filling machine like I'm going to show you in a couple of seconds and the scraper that comes with it to just scrape the cannabis flour into your capsules you want to bang the tray deee on every once in a while to make sure that you're getting about the same amount in each capsule but it really saves you a lot of work of doing the infusion if you do decide to do that just use ground D carb Canada make sure you take a little bit of fat with your kiddos capsules when you take them cannabis binds really well too fat so having some avocado or some cream or some butter on your toast is a good way to ensure that you're getting some of the fat that you need to help the cannabinoids bind well so for this project you're going to need cannabis infused oil and I have links to recipes and videos to make that down below or ground D carb cannabis so either one of those to start and then you do not need a capsule maker but it really does make the job a lot easier and a lot faster than hand filling capsules you need the empty capsules try to find it capsules that come with the tops and bottoms apart so you don't have to go through that step but it's really hard to find those so good luck you'll need tweezers for flipping the capsules when you're using the capsule machine a syringe or two or three because sometimes they get clogged up and a dish of hot water or a double boiler if you're using the coconut oil infusion method I get a lot of my capsule making supplies from Amazon but you can also get these at some pharmacies and you can get the capsules themselves at lots of health food stores so check that out as well I just want to give you a picture of what to look for this is the basic capsule filling machine yours might look slightly different but so long as it has these basic parts then you'll be good most of these capsule fillers only take zero and zero zero size capsules and I actually have a whole recipe quote unquote down below for you so that you have links to all of this as well here's a look at what your capsules will likely look like again if you can find them atop some bottom separated that's the best or even different colors is really helpful but this is what I can usually get my hands on make sure that you do check the capsule size there are different sizes and again you can read about that on the recipe down below these are the types of syringes that I buy you can buy literally a whole bunch of different kinds on Amazon I try to get them so that they are at least five milliliters so that you're not refilling your syringe often and some of them do come with the long metal tip I don't find it necessary but some people prefer it so here we go I'm going to show you how to do this the first thing that you need to do is separate your so bottoms from your capsule tops some of the packages come already separated and that's fantastic if not it's a little bit of an arduous job to do next you put this device I do not know what all the names for this stuff is it looks like it should be weight easier than it is and it takes some practice to learn how to use it and sometimes I wonder if it would just be faster for me to fill them by hand and then I go try and sell them by hand and I realize no not sure just taking out all the extras so I've got some here that are actually like upside down and some of the holes aren't filled so I'm going to go through and fix that way that I do it is by pushing down on the springs and just flipping these legs around that need flipped around sometimes I have to go and grab tweezers because just the way that it's set up but you do really want to make sure that you don't leave any of these unfilled especially with these clear caps it's hard to tell so make sure you do a super good like luff scan through because otherwise if you get cannabis oil all over this machine I know it's on machine but all over this capsule filler and it's hard to clean so yeah do your best to make sure that you learn from my many mistakes of capsule filling next we take this piece and put the filler on it again and we do the same thing that we did with the top after you're finished with the tops you can just set this aside for a couple of minutes because you're going to be filling up your cannabis capsules what I have here is cannabis infused into coconut oil and I'll link to a video on how to do that so that you can have that all ready to go and I have it sitting in a dish of really hot boiling water I do that on purpose because I want the coconut oil to be really warm otherwise it starts to solidify too quickly when I'm filling up the capsules and it clogs up your syringe and it makes it a real mess so try to keep this as warm as you can you'll get into a rhythm and you'll spill a whole bunch over the edge a whole bunch of times as well but you'll be able to fill these up relatively quickly and then we'll put the caps on them altogether that took me about seven minutes to fill those capsules up so it wasn't as bad as I thought so my capsules are filled with oil I'm going to put this orange thing on top of the capsule lid and then you flip it upside down smashing clothes they kind of clip closed then you have a bunch of Hana capsules now what I like to do with these right here is put them in the freezer for about ten or fifteen minutes and then you can store these in the fridge or the freezer for quite a long time it's just coconut oil and cannabis and then you have a really convenient way to dose full disclosure time before we get into dosing those kin of caps that I put in the freezer they're still in the freezer it's been about two weeks and you still haven't pulled them out because it's been busy but when you're done with your Kanak apps you can just pull them out of the freezer pop them out of the mold and store them in glass mason jar in the cupboard or in the fridge let's talk about how to dose them so I have on my website and I'll link to it down below a dosing calculator that makes this easy to figure out Emily how many milligrams of THC or CBD might be in each of your capsules again I really want to stress that this is an approximate range unless you're using lab tested cannabis and all of your procedures are really on point however even if you have lab tested cannabis and everything is perfect with your dosing with each new batch that you make you should always start low and go slow and see if everything is the same on the new batch do you have questions about this I love to answer your questions so please leave them down below and again head over to reveal cannabis calm to get your free stuff and to check out all my other offerings", "-g7gbP_qyZY": "so in this video I'm going to review something called Rick Simpson oil which is a cannabis oil a few weeks ago I posted a video about the differences between CBD oil and hemp oil and that got thousands of views it got hundreds of comments and in amongst all that chaos somebody posted a comment to me explaining her plight and wanted me to review something called Rick Simpson oil so here's that review keep watching so [Music] the lady who posted the comment has some sort of a back problem and it appears to be terminal and she's been using Rick Simpson oil very successfully for her pain symptoms and she basically asked me for my opinions and to do a review about it so I started digging into this Rick Simpson oil it's not an oil I've ever heard of before and the first thing to say about it is it's not sold anywhere so I try to look on Amazon on other kind of health websites you can't get it in any major website or shop even I couldn't even see in any shops websites it appears the only way you can get this is if you go to the makers website log in I'm assuming register first log in and then order it through their catalogue so that's the first thing I notice and I couldn't I couldn't really get reviews either I couldn't get any reviews and Amazon obviously because it's not so there the only thing I hope you're on Amazon is the book written by the founder of the company who I'm assuming is the founder Rick Simpson his books all on Amazon so you can get them there but in terms of the reviews of the product I couldn't actually get any reviews it was very very difficult and the other thing I couldn't get is the price I don't know how much this oil costs because I can't see on any website I can see on Amazon they don't list the price on their website when you go there so I have no idea how much this disgust have you bought it tell me how much it costs so I did a bit of digging onto the story behind this company and I don't know if it's true but I found a nice little story on another sigh basically given account of how the company was started apparently the company was started by the rigsum son so that there is someone called Rick Simpson who has founded the company or maybe the company is named after him and apparently he was an engineer in Canada so he doesn't even have any medical background or qualifications from what I read and what happened was that he had a workplace accident apparently he fell off a ladder kind of sustained some injuries and he was very frustrated with his own medical practitioners weren't able to give him any kind of good pain relief so he resorted to using cannabis because he accidently found that cannabis gave him really good pain relief compared to conventional methods so he went back to his doctors asked them if he could get some sort of a cannabis medicament legally obviously they said you know it's not legal here and he basically started growing his own plants and doing his own research and eventually came up with this oil with this Rick Simpson oil which is the foundation of the company and the story doesn't end there because the same gentleman Rick Simpson a few years later I believe in 2002 was diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma which is a type of skin cancer and he apparently used three drops of this oil for four days and within four days the cancer had disappeared now I'm not sure that this story is 100% true so if anyone from Rick Simpson or the company themselves completely leave a comment below tell us if this is how the company started tell us if this is true we would really appreciate it so now let's talk about what's in this oil on their website on Rick Simpson website they say that this is a cannabis oil from the whole plant so it's not just safe from the leaves or bark or seeds they use the whole plant to make this oil that we know for sure but they don't really go into detail into the actual makeup of the oil the type or the strain or species of marijuana or cannabis or the type of plants that they don't go into any of that detail they just tell you it's a whole plant oil its cannabis and that's it but through some further digging I've found that this oil is apparently very high in THC so it's likely to get you high it's got some CPD but not that much but apparently [ __ ] Hines in THC so you'd be high as a kite with this again I can't verify this information so if anybody from Rick Simpson oil is watching this video please can you just confirm this what's in your oil what's the chemical makeup how do you make it please give us that detail now let's talk about the website because this is where you can this is the only place you can get Rick Simpson oil so when you go on the website what strikes you is the website looks very professional it gives that air of it almost feels like a medical clinic the whole website is in white there's lots of pictures of medical professionals in their white coats you know working looking at images you know scientists doctors and so on so they are really working very hard to give the image that this is a medical clinic but what really personally really worried me is that the website is divided into pages and there's a page called treatments treatments so obviously they they are claiming that this product treats ailments and I'll come to that in a second so they have different types of treatments available in for in the form of oral drops I think and suppositories which are basically methods of administration of drugs through the back passage through a rectal administration basically so in the treatment page they list all the different formulations they have they have some oil drops which are for oral use and they also have suppositories and they talk about the different areas where this this treatment can be used including relieving pain even some dietary people who want to use cannabis oil or CBD oil as a kind of dietary supplement people who undergo in physical therapy so they list the different types of treatments that their oil is aimed at personally I find is really amazing I mean how can you claim that this oil treats very serious conditions such as you know cancer terminal pain when you don't have much evidence and if you do have evidence can you please share it with us if you just leave a comment below or even link to your website and publish these evidence that you have and what's really interesting which is really really quite suspicious in my's is even though you can find a page on the front of their website that says treatments that Rick Simpson oil can be useful if you go to the disclaimer section right at the bottom of this clip of the disclaimer section they have a statement and I'll read it for you in a minute just once so the disclaimer says Food and Drug Administration FDA so these are the people in the US who regulate also you know all the medicines and drugs on the market and disclosure says these products have not these products as in the products on this website these products have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose treat or cure any disease so let me just repeat that and are not intended to diagnose treat or cure any disease okay so what was all that about as in other treatments listed on your mom or you know on the main page of the website clearly when you come to the website you see all these categories of different you know different treatments available but then in the disclaimer you telling us that these these treatments are not intended or these products are not intended to diagnose Q or treat anything oh my final verdict on Rick Simpson oil I find it very hard to make my mind up about this oil because we don't have enough information we don't know the price we don't have any reviews we don't even know what's in this oil in terms of chemical composition let alone clinical trials and results of tests we don't have any of that so very limited information that's number one number two is I don't really like the way they market themselves as a company and as as a product because they this is not a medically proven products yet when you go on their website they give the impression that this is a medically proven product and that is quite risky because then what if somebody who has serious symptoms delays see in like a health care provider and says you know I'm gonna have a punt and try this all to see if it gets rid of my symptoms that is a big danger but this is not to say that this oil does not work just because we haven't studied and tested something doesn't mean it has no medicinal benefits maybe in ten twenty years time when we do proper trials on this oil will find out that it has amazing benefits and you know it treats or cures many different ailments but that time hasn't come i think the sensible thing to do now is just to say to people you know this is based on traditional herbal beliefs it's not yet you know it's not fully proven so try and this is a punt just be honest like that and i think most people will be fine with it but to say that is proven is that's not right", "CTZPND_4O80": "I'm a Verizon engineer.

RSO by RSO go and with that let's hop right into the numbers so THC a our THC comes in at seventy seven point four two they don't really have a whole lot of anything else in there but as you guys know I don't really buy my candles based off of THC i buy it off of a different you know a whole bunch of different factors that I'll go into in a different video here in the near future and with that let me break down so ara so this is what RSO is let's see RSO RSO go is extracted with essential innovations patented pending patent pending system using a hundred percent pure grain alcohol this results in oil containing both polar and nonpolar properties giving you the most complete oil on the market today so what that means is this is extracted using alcohol that is not extracted using any sort of butane or propane or any sort of like those chemicals this is an alcohol extraction base and with that let's get right into it so I'm gonna go ahead and open this I think I should have no nice so I did that that popped right out when you see something just flew and I'm not really sure what it is but I hope it wasn't important anyway so this is what we got let me zoom in for you guys real quick so this is the RSO go applicator and as you guys saw in my last video for them this is all you do you take this off and then you just squeeze this on to either your dabber or if you're gonna eat this and go with the edible form of this then you're gonna put this on like a piece of bread or if you guys saw my Instagram a little piece of tortilla and then you're just gonna parachute it with some water swallow it and then let it do its thing with that I'm really excited to go try this and I'll be back again with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how went hey guys what's up so I went ahead and tried that Betty Page RSO and as far as the flavor is concerned when you dab it it does have a little bit of like this floral kind of flavor there that kind of hangs around for a bit when you eat it since I don't really recommend and most people don't just like put this stuff directly on their tongue because you just don't want to do that you parachute it basically in like a piece of bread or a tortilla and then so you don't really get any flavor when you eat it as far as the highest concerned this one was kind of different than the last RSO so if you remember the last one it kind of had a different high when you adapt it than versus when you ate it this one didn't do that so this was the exact same high pretty much both both ways whether you eat it or you you smoked it and that was a energetic happy kind of like uplifting euphoric almost kind of high the only real difference is when you ate it you did kind of get a little bit more of the behind the eyes kind of like tiredness so you get a little bit more drowsiness with with you know eating it than you do when you dab it but not really a whole lot it's just just a little bit sensationalized um but as far as this goes I would definitely recommend it if you're a newbie again this is an RSO so it is still strong take it light give yourself plenty of time especially if you're going to eat it before you take some more so you don't end up getting too much and then having a really bad time because nobody really likes that so with all that if you guys enjoy what I'm doing and you're watching this on YouTube go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page this has been recreational 420 and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "wmAOe_klMKY": "[Music] hello looks like Alistair is making a transaction here of some kind I don't know what you think you're gonna get out of there hey sweetie are you cold hey Connor all right yeah it's no one all right okay so we're up in Lake Tahoe area is that for cove on the Nevada side so we came up here originally to my sister Eden because we're not certain on all the Utah laws regarding CBD oil now it doesn't mean that you can't take it in Utah they do sell it I think some people say like hey you need a card from a doctor it really just depends because we were uncertain about the laws we decided to come out to Nevada so anyway yeah because we were uncertain we just came out to Nevada my sister lives out here in Reno so we came up the mountain to Tahoe she's gonna meet up with us here and give you guys a little bit more information I also want to stay in fatica Lee we are not legal counsel you are responsible you do your own research find out what it is you need to know and your local laws hi my name is Ian Wakefield and I am a full-time cannabis consultant and I also run a cannabis coaching business on the side yeah and why are you here what are you doing well I'm Robbie's oldest sister and I'm here to help with Ian's issues that he faces with his autism with some CBD oil okay and what kind of this can you pull it back to your face love it yes this is the harmonious brand CBD it's a full spectrum that's different from a distillate in that this contains all of the compounds of the hemp plant versus distillate which would only contain the CBD itself so this is better than what I just said find over the shelf at like my local mall or like that absolutely also because you may find full spectrums here and there in that way but you won't always have somebody who has put their lab testing next to the product online there is always going to be current lab tests for every batch with the bottle okay and in full disclosure we are using this for free thanks to the generosity of Ian sprint Eden's friend at harmonious I'm Eden Eden Ian we screw it up sometimes so there they're gonna offer this this to us for free so we could try it out yeah so that's nice yeah very nice of them yeah anything else you want to say about it or huh you know I stand by a hundred percent i I tell everybody about it that I can and especially people who are afraid to try THC or you know any of the heavier products this is a really really great alternative well and that's another thing too so THD THC versus CBD why don't you tell us maybe just very briefly the legality involved but also you know how THC is a neurological inhibitor or that kind of thing yeah THC has many medicinal benefits that are we're still exploring in science and the legalities kind of put a damper on that because federally it's not legal to actually perform lab testing on actual cannabis in the United States this is from the hemp plant cannabis is cousin and it has all the other medicinal medicinal compounds that you're going to want but yeah as far as something that has higher THC in it that's going to be where you're going to need to be in a legal state and and deal with it on your own make your own decisions accordingly mileage may vary no this is fine this is this is over-the-counter type stuff yeah yeah you can order this this is this is legally able to be shipped throughout the United States without problem including Utah including Utah yeah so we just found out about this recently and sorry if my voice is a little bit muffled behind the mic but we just found out the laws change so rapidly that Utah has legalized CBD oil over the counter I think it's okay to give it to minors in Utah we were unsure so we came out here to Nevada because I knew my sister would know better than most in accordance with local laws and customs and things like that yeah this is completely legal to give your kids the FDA is trying to step in and stop CBD from being able to be given to pets and kids and things like that and we're working on fighting that because CBD isn't regulated though that's why I prefer to go to this brand because he does things through state regulations so even though it can be shipped Internet you know anywhere you wanted to go it's still above board for a product that you know is going to be regulated you know that this is going to be factual okay awesome yeah was anything else you wanted to say I'm just really grateful to Brandon and Anthony and the guys over at Harmonia CBD for being so generous is to offer us this opportunity to see how we can help Ian with CBD oil okay how long I'm gonna do another Tong three drops one two three that's it hmm three jobs three jobs to start yep sweet drops looks perfect oh good it's better than a half one because a half one makes my likes crazy I just like your spirit on does how was it taste I taste a low flame a little fight yeah what would you say to people who just say you're judging your kid you're just making them passive and zombie like that would you have to say about that well at first I'd say that's not true that's not what happens I mean Ian's as talkative and has as much of his personality as ever he's he's a bit calmer and I'd argue that this medicine isn't really for us the parents it's honestly more for the kid they're less anxious they're able to sleep better they're able to concentrate better on the tasks they have at school and the tours they have at home and whatever choose for their mind - I think it's highly beneficial yeah and that's been for a spiritum so we think so far of the oil well I'd say the biggest difference I've noticed between risperidone and the CBD oil is that risperidone immediately makes in sleepy and he is actually more tired and more lethargic on her Sparrow dome than he is on CBD oil although the CBD oil has a more calming effect yarr that may not be true for so much my understandings of you in facts so I'm trying to get through this it affects people differently based on their um their body chemistry and their neurological I'm not sure why that is so it's really nice to see and reacting well to it it's still too early to tell if this will be a permanent replacement does it risperidone but again whether it's perd\u00f3n it's just there's too many side effects that long-term we think what could be detrimental especially how it makes him a little bit sleepy to begin with and then that is kind of like pacifying him not that we want him to behave that way it's just how he responded to it and so as many people have mentioned online with medications there's a kind of a cocktail that people go through where they try risperidone and that doesn't work so they try a belif and vilify abilify and they just kind of go down the list of different medications until that wears off then they go on to the next thing and we want to try something that's made available more natural a little bit more long-term the Ian can take and not have any major side effects so far the only side effect we can see that I guess you could say was major was that he woke us up at 4:00 a.m. and he goes daddy I'm hungry so he he had the munchies for a lack of a better term so one of the things we did want to mention is we're starting out small and we're working our way up so we started a very small dosage and we monitor Ian's heart rate and things like that so I put my hand on his wrist I did a stopwatch and he was about 75 beats per minute so he did well in the middle of the night I checked his pupils made sure that they weren't dilated or anything like that and they reacted just fine another thing that is nice is the cost it's about half as much as risperidone how did you feel I feel I feel good I feel good what was the word you said fantastic you felt fantastic a little bit fantastic well that's good yeah do you still feel fantastic yeah cuz I've done a lot of I was playing with my freak imaginary friends they're right they're directors it's crowded there are there's a lot of them there's a lot of your imaginary friends yeah they're all come to a party with me and us nice dear hey everybody we're back in Utah right out here walking with Ian you can probably hear him say hey hey guys yes you are so I just want to do a quick little recap here kind of a summary of the week in Nevada where basically ending Ian's dosage on the CBD oil I'd love to continue it actually I had some pretty good results it doesn't last as long as his or spare at all but I like that it doesn't have as many side effects especially the drowsiness that comes with her spear at all hopefully it doesn't get too loud we're heading into a construction area I would have done it inside the house but the kids have been super noisy so I come out here and there's construction everywhere what do you do so anyway um basically the the Utah laws are such that we can't continue the CBD oil to the best of my understanding you guys can correct me in the comments section if you want let me know more but as I checked the last bill that was passed in 2018 was like 200 pages long I don't have time to read it most people don't and it basically covered things like epilepsy in terms of getting a medical card and autism wasn't even on that list so yeah you basically need permission from a doctor or a medical card saying that you know your child needs CBD oil I forgot to mention too if any of you are new to the channel it's been well documented that ian has autism you can see his paperwork there just because we get that question a lot because he is more or less high-functioning now and you can talk a lot of people are like is even autistic should you be giving him medication yes he is but anyway aside from all that we would have loved to continue using CBD oil and you know many people do no matter what the laws are I don't think anyone's going to come after those people we want to be careful because we're putting on YouTube and inevitably you get one or two zealous parents who are like that's it I'm gonna call Child Protective Services on you you're torturing your kid you're a terrible parent blah blah blah long story short you know they're they're calling people and just making your life miserable because they've got nothing better to do we're trying to do the best we can for our son that's the honest to goodness truth we really want Ian to be happy and healthy and when it comes to more severe autism and he's not very severe but the further you go down the spectrum the more difficult life becomes just doing basic things just feeling like you can go outside without being overwhelmed and he has a difficult time with that kind of stuff he gets overwhelmed so it helps him yes it helps us to that's an added benefit but the the first priority is to help him out so he can go to school you can go to church you can go to public places and not be overwhelmed and just make it through the day without tons of problems so we appreciate my sister and her friends for letting us have the oil for free I'm very nice of them it doesn't reflect anything on our review we just tell the truth you know how it is it's not a magic bullet it's it's been great though so far I would recommend it to those who want to try it of course your mileage may vary just depends on the person everybody's chemistry is different so yeah I hope that was helpful and if you guys of course have any comments questions let us know appreciate all of our supporters and we will see you next time", "dbwjb94BBHo": "[Music] today I'm going to be talking to you about taking medicines sublingually this is done by putting a cannabis extract usually a tension under your tongue or rubbing it on your gums and letting it absorb there for a few minutes taking your medicine this way allows the extract to go straight into your bloodstream without passing through your stomach or your digestive tract now this is useful because it offers high bioavailability it has a longer effect at inhalation and is a really clean way to take medicine this intake method has a wide range of uses and it's a wonderful way to start your relationship with cannabis it's predictable and hasn't even killed onset and this can be really useful for a more subtle effect for instance when taken for general lifestyle enhancement here are some key things to keep in mind with sublingual intake products use sublingually come in the form of tinctures infusions or concentrates this method allows for extremely accurate doses tinctures are often measured by the drop and concentrates by weight and if you're using a concentrate we recommend that you use a high-quality digital scale as well because this will really help you with your accuracy it's really important to use clean safe medicine and be aware that not all cannabis extracts are created equally the concentration levels and the extract processes can vary quite a bit and as always we recommend lab tested as best as you can easily see what you're getting now the onset time with sublingual in takers generally between ten and thirty minutes and depending on your goals we suggest starting with a minimal dose and if more is wanted or needed you can easily increase in a really short period of time now if taking a THC dominant cannabis oil there is likely to be some cycle activity you may like to go back and revisit the introduction to cannabis intake methods video in which we shared some typical effects of psycho activity tinctures are typically dissolved in either olive oil coconut oil or alcohol we like the oil versions because cannabis interacts really well with fats and they also tend to be a little bit more pleasant to take as well in terms of taste today we have some examples of tinctures infused oils and concentrates to show you and they're going to demonstrate how to measure your dose and take each of them sublingually so let's get acquainted with products that can be used for sublingual use now remember sublingual use is when you put a product under your tongue or on your gums and inner cheek so that it can be absorbed into your body now today I'm going to show you concentrates as well as liquids or tinctures that can be used for something we'll use before I get into those specifically I want to make a point really with sublingual use and with any of these products you know the form of the product whether it's a concentrate that hasn't been dead looted into any other substance or a tincture for example that has been diluted into something like alcohol olive oil or coconut oil but remember no matter the form of the product you don't necessarily know by looking at it how concentrated it is you can dose it but without knowing the concentration of cannabis within that specific product you won't know exactly how many milligrams you're taking so it's a little bit of what we're gonna get into today now concentrates obviously from their name are one of the most potent purest form of cannabis usually this is a pure form of cannabis that has been extracted from the plant either from bud from shake or any other forms of the plant itself now given that how highly concentrated the medicine is you really want to be careful with it and be able to measure it one way to do that is through the syringe where it has actual measurements but the other tool you want to use is a digital scale so that you know exactly how concentrated the medicine is inside as well as the exact weight that you're getting when you take when you actually put it in your body and those two combinations of pieces of information really tell you what dose you're taking and that way you can track what dose measure its effects and then dose effectively going forward now a great way to do this for concentrates is to use a piece of a rice paper now rice paper paper because it's edible and it dissolves in your mouth and that way you can actually get to concentrate on the scale put it onto the rice paper weigh it know what you're taking and then simply put it into your mouth under your tongue and let it dissolve there that way it's not messy rice paper is also great if you want to just measure your medicine once maybe put it in the fridge or the freezer and then take it later you can have those doses for yourself ready for at a later date so that you don't have to create as much of a mess these products can be a little bit hard to deal with they're a little bit of molasses II as you can see from the color of this all right so constantly it's very effective usually they're used for much more severe conditions when you're trying to get much higher dose of medicine into your body let's move on to liquids or sometimes called tinctures now these can be infused into a number of liquids as I mentioned that you're usually alcohol or oils which can be usually coconut oil or olive oil what happens with this process is the medicine is extracted through various methods there's co2 there's butane there's other alcohol extracts and then that concentrate is then infused back into an oil or they leave a little bit of the alcohol and put it back into alcohol that way diluting the medicine a little bit to be able to take and be taken in liquid form when taking it's pretty intuitive it's nice because you can dose the medicine very effectively with the dropper now ideally your dropper has some type of measuring mechanism on it so you know exactly the milliliters that you're taking and can dose that again you really want to know how concentrated you dis medicine is it could have for example one corner oil and a lot of medicine that's a very concentrated tincture it could have you know 95% oil and 5% medicine those are very different products very different medicines depending on the dose okay so pay attention to that know from your labels and from your medicine providers how concentrated that medicine is now when taking medicine simply put it on your tongue as mentioned let it absorb there and that's how you can take a sublingual tincture all in all sublingual medicine is a great way to take medicine get it into your body effectively with high bioavailability remember the points that we touched on it's really important to know how concentrated your medicine is and it's important to measure it effectively to be able to track", "YEE2l3497Zg": "as we're here today at number nine on farms and we're going to make another teacher today I've got one ounce of botanical in my food processor and I'm going to chop it up a little bit and I'm already doing that fours I have preheated my oven to 220 degrees for one hour and we're going to release the oils from CBD CBD bay it's CBD a because it's an acid and then you're gonna decarboxylate it into Danny you know that's a yeah we gotta go back and delete no you're okay just keep going alright so now people made mistakes I make mistakes every day alright now we're gonna put in the oven for one hour and then I'll come back we're going to make attention that we make with our magic butter machine right now and I finished decarboxylate and the our botanicals we did one hour at 220 degrees and what we're going to do now is we're going to take two cups of pure food grade and therapeutic grade hemp seed oil to use with our teacher okay you can see on there that is food grade and it has a purity sheet of it what it contains and we always use a food and third therapeutic grade material all we used alcohol Everclear so I'm gonna take two cups of this okay what we're going to use is two cups of this whole and one ounce of botanicals and we're going to use our magic butter machine and this runs automatic does everything for you then we already have a video up on how we used it with the Everclear yeah yep and I'll make another alcohol teacher we even done some butter it does a great job on the butter actually works really well okay absolutely okay now we're gonna put the 1 ounce of the botanicals in there and this is already pre-measured and decarboxylated so now it is actually CBD course just it was just him before so now we've released a CBD a and now we released a fat acid I'm so smart today I tell you alright alrighty that's what you have okay now we're gonna take the Machine and put it on there okay put it in this is regular household current as long as you're living in a nice thanks yeah that's right all right and so we use the eight hours oh the temperature that was where the it's 1:30 for the temperature in 8 hours and that's it it goes ahead and doesn't something and we can keep checking it and everything and the whole time the lights are going and like I said that's in my first video ok we'll come back when we strain it and bottle it and show you guys what we do and sample it all right thank you back this morning our teacher finished last night and what we're going to do today is I'm going to strain it here and the magic butter machine came with a screen and what we're gonna do is we're gonna drain the contents into here to squeeze it and get everything out I have a one-point wide mouth mason that's what I use so I can come back and make my other goodies out of that so here we go and it's absolutely beautiful magic butter machine does everything for you just scrape it all clean get as much in there's our Candace that's a nice smell mm-hmm smells really good in case you guys are wondering I wear all these getup because we sell our products and I want everybody to know that we use try to stay as clean as we can cuz we're in our small commercial kitchen on our farm and we try to follow good good clean practices and all our foods that we make all right so let's pour this in here and then I'll scrape the rest it's oh wow you already full oh you're gonna yeah you need to pull up there cuz you is sometimes that's happened to me too wow that's excellent excellent excellent you better try to get no more out of this one you'll get another job just let that strain and I'll get all the goodies out of the bottom actually if you notice since you normally we do it when it's hot that's what the gloves for but since its said overnight actually most of the solids have settled to the bottom as you as you can see there so actually by letting it go overnight and coming back it actually did settle it maybe and it helps with the heat you know because it's really nice nice and thick yeah I wouldn't do that to be on the safe side for going over just a wee bit Wow look at that gas huh and it smells really good it smells so good I can't believe that I made and we will be sampling because it does work better than it smells it's one of our viewers asked us well how was it we have added that to our videos we're tasting and Sharon yeah so as you guys can see we use a good quality botanical to start with good hemp seed old food great therapeutic grade as we wouldn't want you to buy anything from us or use anything for yourself too then the safe so well we'll be back when we bottle it thanks alright guys we're back now I've drained everything strained it and squeezed it and we got about 17 ounces of CBD oil out of that and I've saved this I want to show you guys that that's all that was left out of one ounce of pure bud botanical after running through the process and squeezing it and there we are now what I'm going to do now is I'm a bottom on it I can't say enough about how great that machine works it makes it really simple because we were doing them with a double boiler very time consuming this you just basically set it and forget it and you know I'm really into that idea and it has a motor on it so all right so what we do here we're going to bottle up a one ounce bottle and a half ounce bottle and this is what we sell so the reason we make these videos is for you guys to understand that quality is number one and we want you to know where you get your product and that you can trust your source as with anything you eat you want to know where it comes from and I'll be making a alcohol based teacher next one video on that and I'm gonna make another one but we find that some of our customers can't don't drink alcohol so that kind of let them out of the teacher and we'll do a video on the butter have we already done that we'll make a butter video as well as some body butters yeah I really like those and if you have any videos you want to make or any questions just ask us alright thanks thanks for watching guys alright guys we're back and now I finished bottling everything and what i bottled 10 2 ounce bottles in to 1 ounce bottles and i saved myself 6 ounces of CBD to make some butter with and do some teachers and some some body creams and some lip balms and just a little bit for our personal consumption and i wanted to touch base for a minute because what we do whether you buy your CBD from us or anyone else a good reputable sources should have your lab results and we get a lab result with every batch and it shows exactly what you got and we showed you earlier that we use food grade and they've got a 15% off coupon right therefore if you use the words actually at the discount card from if you order from down where is there's their email mean address website address yes guys we just try to use quality products and that was one of the main reasons we started making our own stuff for ourselves and so that we know what we have what we start with and what we finished with and it works really well and do a little sample now and you guys can easily make I think that's a pretty big set yeah that was a little too much that was the buffet sample mmm got a great taste that's delicious okay guys so if you have any questions or anything about any of the stuff that we do you just send us a message answers ask us a question and if you'd like to purchase any of these items just send us a message and we'll get it shipped right out to you all right thanks you", "DTpGzjOV5Mk": "you're watching telecom TV for Mobile World Congress 2018 in Barcelona and welcome to our panel discussion on bringing zero touch automation to 5g networks now the concept of zero church is becoming increasingly important as the industry develops it virtualized network offerings to support 5g deployments and joining me to discuss the issues I have on my immediate left Chandra's Ruparel of in term we have Gabriella DiPiazza from VMware okay francisco javier among Saku era of telef\u00f3nica and Kevin chukkamma from Dell EMC Kevin thanks very much and all of you thanks for joining us today thank you what I like to start with is the whole concept of zero touch can we'll be absolutely clear as to what we mean by zero touch Gabriel how about you're honest as well pick me first yes please ah very white question I think at the end of day zero touch is a very white concept I would like it's really a process right will eventually lead from taking an order all the way to delivering a service but I think this problem get disassembled into multiple layers right how do you go down into the different layers in the network and with networks changing and evolving gets even more complex over time as the components is disassembled into pieces and multiple clouds and and application so again let me stop here because I think this way more to talk about it Chandra so yeah just as Gabriel II mentioned if you look at the whole planning process to deployment right day zero day 1 day 2 you're going from planning to activation of the service and deployment all the way to in service management zero touch the way you know I conceptualize it and I guess in discussions with industry is really about minimizing human intervention so you are sort of reducing human error but not only that introducing a level of agility that that addresses the SLA and that in the new age application and service requirement and Kevin um this all leads to automation and the importance of automation why was seeing this odd little automation as being so important yeah I think I was actually gonna bring that up as next topic of conversation anyway you know when we think about the the automation area what we're seeing its first off the terminology has become very overloaded in the industry we're seeing a lot of interest in automating all these tasks that have traditionally been done manually right so taking scripts and manual scripts that were originally designed to automate the deployment provisioning of infrastructure turning that into capabilities for that to happen automatically we see it on the fault management monitoring and starting to close the loop when we see something resolving right and I think it even extends further as we start to talk about machine learning and automate artificial intelligence to really get to the point where there's almost no manual intervention so we think about automation the first layer of this it's really about the provisioning management of the infrastructure without human intervention and then when we talk about AI and ml it's now this layer above it that takes out the decision logic as well and it automates the decision processes as well Francisco you know you're surrounded by three vendors here you're the solar service provider yeah what's important to you how is how is it helping your business yeah I mean in the transition of the new type of networks that we are they're going I mean if you if you think of it I mean if you are being honest in your network actually you have an explosion of the composition of soup components so it's no longer the case of operating some boxes that are identified that you can imagine it is no longer feasible and you actually if you follow the same procedure that you traditionally follow in that explosion of components in in massive deployments you would be unable to handle that in a man in a manual manner semi automated manner so here is is the automation which comes to the rescue I mean in enduro in otherwise you can't afford not even exploiting the date the potential that a beautiful environment will give you or all the they construct that a slicer will give you or whatever but also that you will be even unable to do the same thing that you are doing today with the new paradigm so they would be it is not a choice it's actually a mass in order to be able to to deploy massively that new type of networks and also get some real benefit of it it's not about removing the human being in the operation of the question is about letting them focus on what we add value now instead of that explosion of subcomponents and try to figure out every tiny navigated way I think you're absolutely right I mean you mentioned change a number of times right and I think one thing that we've learned in this industry is that change is inevitable and we've gotten used to I think accepting and learning how to adapt to change but I think what's new for for this industry at the moment is a couple of things one the rate of change right how quickly comes customer and consumer expectations are changing how quickly there's new options in the open source community and vendor community to select different technologies right and and because the rate of change has accelerated to such a great degree you're absolutely right doing things the way we've always done them is just not an option I was gonna pick on the same thing so try to focus on automation in a new world of networks going in using the old paradigm would be a mistake in fact I think that a big part of this is not so much does it we discuss a lot about technology transformation application decomposition new networks and topology and so forth but is a big aspect in people processes operations so think of the skills require the retraining require in effectively two worlds coming together the worlds of IT in cloud and the worlds of networks you know think of the operations aspect and the provisions aspect becoming a very different from a process perspective so this will require a change in the skills in the service provider space in fact I may just add a few things so so I guess exactly to your point earlier that it's not an option it is it is something that you have to do in order to adapt to the new network in 5g world you cannot be hard-coded and this a very simple example if you look at network slicing you are trying to set up and tear down a new SLA structure a complete network and and you can't do that if it's not automated it's it's really the agility with which you implement it but into your point Gabrieli the it's it's really two worlds coming together but it's not that the automation is a new concept it is being implemented with the cloud service providers today but it is a little bit siloed and it's it's not something where you have a convergence and that's the reason why we have Etsy is g40 touch network and service management which we have set up and I and on the other side of the standards that we are trying to set up here so it's really how you bring these together to really make it a reality yeah and I think you know you mentioned that it exists today I think generally that's true but the way it exists is what's changing right today it exists in maintenance windows that exists in fixed time periods where I can roll out new capabilities and new services and those fixed time periods are gonna shrink very rapidly and the number of them is gonna grow very quickly across the calendar year so how do we get all this working because we've mentioned we mentioned there that this is the standards aspect we mentioned people and processes has been so important we mentioned what the the cloud scale companies and web scale companies can offer how do you ensure this all works and we're talking like new collaborators new ecosystems require to to achieve this so to go back to my earlier point I think one is really driving convergence and this is where you know Intel sort of has been contributing as it does with nfe mono and and this is the next logical step so last year we worked very closely with Telefonica with with the Deutsche Telekom and in a number of partners to pull together this is in launch is gvd net c40 test network and service management and now it has grown to you know 40 plus members so first everybody coming together to figure out what are the staff what are the requirements that we all agree to and secondly at the same time you have to sort of harness the ecosystem capabilities so if you have you know organizational structural changes that you need and you need consulting around that who are the experts that you can bring to bear and working together to sort of plot this puzzle will be very critical but more importantly I think the the support of operator community will be will be extremely important yeah I agree in fact funny enough somebody this money asked me well as technology moves on and networks are becoming simpler right say well in reality I think going to see an edition later complexity be caught before simplification so this would require way more collaboration standards bodies absolutely but also between vendor and an operator community a completely with you here I mean operators I actually seen operators just in this last two years way more active way more active than in the past where you know you could argue some of the standards bodies or communities being very vendor centric now we see very clear requirements by carriers this will help drive and clarify how to how to proceed to move forward can make anymore I mean the deployment that we we have all these changes the transformation process did you try to boil the ocean term it has so many components there are so many cool things around that is quite easy to lose the focus I mean and anything that one part of this journey that you describe pretty well this is not just a mission is peaceful journey is it requires heck leading solid foundations gradually and that the role of the cities right it is key I mean to decide what works in practice for them what it doesn't work in practice for them and iterate and PI work I I think that that and that can only happen in in a in a place of collaboration it can happen in a in a waterfall like thing with HQ process and try to learn from there is yeah you know I think if we think about the the entire history of communication service providers communication service providers have always had a very strong voice in terms of of providing requirements back into the industry but historically the way that has been done isn't documented words to vendors and vendors were expected to implement interpret what those words meant I think what's really changed in the industry is that the operator voice is coming out in open source communities and it's no longer just an expression of what they want to see it's a demonstration and it's code that's a lot harder to and that it that is not interpretive this is how we want it to work this is the api's that we want to see this is how we want to see it exposed and we expect you to conform to these standards and I think technology helps because moving from a siloed proprietary network with infusion of IT technology it actually allows to have a better you know even technology collaboration I think the advancements in technologies and it's something that will actually help in this process and in fact this technology collaboration will become even more important as we try and integrate artificial intelligence machine learning and Big Data into it a few things to consider here right so so I mean this is an area again you know Intel can contribute in terms of data science and in platform technologies but but what is important to understand is that any application of these new technologies even if you were to go trial first and then make improvisation slowly you have to have prior to that quality data so your infrastructure has to be able to deliver the quality data otherwise you cannot apply these these competencies into it that effectively right and and that is where I think the first step from the operator community will be is like can the infrastructure be made ready so that the data is right and then we are able to implement all of these but it will be a small step effort where it's not just one-time download of the vendor it's really about collaboration together working and then improvising with every step absolutely and that's part of extending the agile development process that all of us as vendors use internally out into the ecosystem right and starting with Minimum Viable Product and continuing to iterate on that as an industry as a whole and I think that you know when we talk to service providers and maybe you can comment on this you know the expectation is no longer that we can deliver the entire stack or that we have all the capabilities but instead that we're open collaborative members of a broader system of partners that the service providers want to see well the vision that all the requirements are met right but gradually and we and we and we are part of the process we we make we realistic assumptions about what we can expect at each of these phases 18 fully agree I mean we were discussing about the general framework that the specs providers intended the open the roll the double took place that is really important and anything that in in that case in in conferring of being true believers of that that both want semi conciliated I mean the way that you need to evolve in the final day in details and iterate probably is not that easy to follow in an spec but the spectrum is a very good framework for doing the things and understanding at least put in a label and what is the function that are looking for right so yeah I fully agree with you and isolated in some basic foundations need to be needed to be agreed and then iterate on them and still be mean from small to something that is more complex crevalle so we we are running out of time unfortunately but a final word we started this discussion looking at bringing zero touch automation to 5g networks fought for service providers who are taking this 5g journey you know briefly if I can ask you all how critical is it that they fully understand zero at such an implement zero touch how well does the service provider in the community understand yeah so how critical is it for them it's it's extremely critical as we all agree it is preparation in again in the 5g world you can be hard-coded right but the the critical piece here is the the other question that you asked do we really understand it and I think that is where just in getting the requirements in place and making sure that we all understand what it means is going to be a collaboration and community effort I don't think that there is a clear-cut answer to it today there is a lot of work to be done and I'm and I'm very optimistic that the ISD formed will start making headway on that front really I think again there is a good understanding gap between understanding and execution I think it's still there my my let's say recommendation final world would be we are living in the world of software definition so and if you want to execute on this we will need to start thinking that way so apply maybe some different methodologies that have been applied in the past Francisco very final word from yourself yeah I think that this inevitable and we either do it and now I will do it later but if we want to get the most in terms of the benefits that the new technologies that are available in terms of business and in terms of opportunities for for the people for real at that scale can offer we need to be able to automate that successfully and Kevin I think it's not a matter of it if it's a matter of when and how and how quickly and how much right I think you know for when we live only in a technology bubble it's easy to say that the technology is very complex but if we then step outside the technology bubble and think about the impacts of that IT transformation on workforce and process it is that much more complex because now you're dealing with people and trying to evolve the skill sets of those people into those new processes so I think it's gonna continue to take some time but I'm afraid that's all the time we have I like to thank our guests for participating in the panel today and also I have to thank our sponsors VMware and Intel and of course our studio hosts into digital you can catch all our coverage of Mobile World Congress on the website telecom tv.com thank you very much goodbye you", "SCc6Dr_iLwg": "[Music] there is tremendous pressure on data capacity operators as well as in the Wi-Fi community people are always looking for ways in which they can offer more data rate better service to the end-user one of the things that we actually think about in five GNR is it's supposed to handle all sorts of spectrum types ranging from below one gigahertz all the way up to you know 28 gigahertz 37 gigahertz and so on and as a part of that we've been building up our own prototype testbed prototype base stations and devices which showcase what can be done that 5g strictly speaking millimeter wave would be anything that's below one centimeter of wavelength so anything about 20 gigahertz is loosely called millimeter wave it's not the first time that we are trying to use those for wireless communications in fact we actually have been using it for a long time for fixed wireless back hosers millimeter wave does not like obstacles in its way because the waves attenuate much more rapidly compared to the lower frequencies beamforming is all about setting the right arm platoon and phase for each of these elements so that collectively they steer the beam in in a certain direction this has to be done dynamically you can think of it as a spotlight on a stage where a performer is on stage he's moving around on the spotlight kind of follows them in our testbed which we have in New Jersey we've been testing all these concepts going from a white board to to making them work in practice in fact one of the demos that we showed in Oklahoma Congress in Barcelona was a mobile millimeter wave system wherein we had users in a mini-map driving around switching between one access point to the other inside our own office premises we have millimeter wave pay stations which are located just like Wi-Fi access points if you think of it then users walking around in the conference room and so on and still getting pretty high data rates with it it's a very exciting time seeing it from its birth to our prototype and being able to demo that prototype working with both operators and infrastructure vendors to showcase this in the field in the subsequent a few quarters we still have work to do in that but these are very promising techniques and we think that these will be the main ingredients of what will constitute the 5g in our millimeter wave system [Music]", "TzqDZA6EVDI": "I'm about to take a

to our channel techeltv so our today's topic will be 5g call flow that is uh inode pg node b dual connectivity so let's let's start with the call flow so uh first of all what exactly the dual connectivity means so dual connectivity basically enables the 5g service in existence with the 4g network so that's why its name is named as endc dual connectivity so the whatever the uv that will be the supporting endc can connect both lt and the 5g that is a secondary node and lt that we know that we know is a master node simultaneously at the same time so in this case as we know that our epc that will be a 4g only through which the ua will register you will do the first registered registration through the 4g epc only through the indc and the based on the ue supportability it will go on reporting the measurement of fibre frequencies which are available and the lte node b will communicate with the that secondary node that is g node b for the uh 5g and a resource assignment and the 5g in our resource assignment is then signal to the uv the uv that which is supporting the 4g and february both that is through the or you can say the via rrc connection reconfiguration message and after reconfiguration processor completion the uv will as i already told you that you will now capable of connecting to both the networks 4g and 5g simultaneously so now we will go and go through the complete call flow with whatever the message which are carrying so as we are as for the diagram we can as for the call flow we can see a u with which is supporting the lt and nr both and the a node b which we are telling as a master node so first it will prepare the list of the p element that are supporting the 5g nr and the message that will flow is like the you can see here c2 broadcast the presence of whatever the 5g nr plm is available via the uh uh where the p element info list r 15 through this it will be providing all the 5g nrp11 list and after that the write process will start you can see the random access preamble is sent by the uv to the master node b and in response it's getting the random access response so whatever the first message that you can see and the random access preamble is sent so you will pick a random preamble here and this having the id that is rapid that is random access preamble id and each preamble transmission that we are talking about is associated it associated with the ra ndi okay so now uh this first random access primal will go now there will be a response as a random access response so in random access response what what actually you will do so you will be gathering or listening on the pdcch that is addressed by the rar india and once the pdcc that is associated with the rar india is decoded the uv used the rbs to receive the downlink transmission block so after this random access response in message three it will be sending rrc connection request that is message three so in this the information that that will be going from uv to uh master node you can see that is blinkside channel crnti the u identity will go and the establishment cost will go there a lot of establishment cards it can be it can be emergency high priority access empty access mo signaling so means this establishment calls carries this much of things so air demo signaling will move and the master node b then responds with the message 4 that is rrc connection setup so rrc connection setup that you can see uh this also carrying the messages crnti and that will win search srb identity and uh dlul uh um rlc modes and phr configuration uplink power control that also these are uh in message for this are the this information will be getting there and as a message five as we know this is rrc connection setup complete message that is message file so in this it will be carrying the attach request ue mrdc capability that mrdc is the multi-radio dual connectivity and the pdn connectivity request so in message 5 this will be carrying this this information and this uh so here we can see that the master node b will be sending one initial uv message towards mme so this is the nas message that is uh which will be signaled to the core network by this uh through this message only and after that the mme will be sending the authentication request so now here the authentication process will start so after the authentication request and now you will be sending the authentication response so in authentication restaurants it will be matching the autn and the xres that the nas security mode command which will be for uh go through mme to uh to uv and here the other security security process will be got completed so in this after that the you will be responding of the completion of this now security mode complete so up to here the next level security process will be got completed and after that the mme will be sending the initial context setup request so basically what mme uh here the mme respond the e note b that is a master node b with the few things that is s1 ap initial context setup request nas attach accept and activate default bearer request so these three things will be you can say responded from mme to node b so now we can see the initial context setup request here this this carries uh the era it have set up items that is erev ids and already which i mentioned that is a attach accept and it will be activating the default eps bearer so after that the ev will be sent from master node b to uv the that info the message that will go with the ui capability inquiry so here uh it will be in and you will be inquired about the lte and endc capabilities so now the ue is responding with all the ui capability information the tv capability rat container list the track type what are the right types it is supporting and now the it it is sending the capabilities like eutron and our uv mrdc capability that is multi-radio dual connectivity it supports support the band list and our r15 so all this information that will be sent out by the ue to the master node b in this u capability information so after that now this inode that is master node is sending all this u capability info indication to the mme whatever it got from uv so that is got forwarded towards the mme now we can see that the master node that is in lt node b is asking for the air security mode command so this is basically for the security between the node b and the uv here only from the both the directions refereeing is safety is got enable and after that completion of the air security mode now the ltn would be that is master node will be sending the rsc connection reconfiguration message so air the eps radio bearer identity rlc mode pdcp sequence number all this thing will be going through this rrc connection reconfiguration message so now here after this message after the rrc connection reconfiguration uh which is also sent by uv to master node b that is rsi connection configuration complete and then the master node will be sending the initial context setup response to mme so this basically contains the gtp tunnel id which is further used for sending the downlink data towards a node b so the main purpose of this uh is for sending the dl data and now the use sends attach complete request to mme up to this message now here we are seeing that signaling um mma will be sending for the modification bearer request and it is after uh then signal getting a signaling gateway is replying with the modif um that the modify bearer response that is activated and now the genome we will be acquiring the nrpss and sss all the information through uv and now the measurement report is getting sent by uv to inode b so whatever the measurement report which i was telling before uh that is after the default dps b error except so that all the miss results miss id miss result uh b cell rsrp rsrq range all the miss result of the never sell on the miss result of the never n r cell so all this all this information will be uh going through uh going in this measurement report and after this measurement report sjnb addition request will be goes as the audition request will be getting a lot of information that we can see it will be carrying all the era parameters tunnel address that is ip address and taid use security capabilities and all the keys which is related to this ng-ran node and all like rand modu aggregation maximum bit rate and you can see a lot of cell grouping for config rc connection reconfiguration cell group radio bearer configuration measurement measured frequencies of sn that is the list of frequency it will be sending and the sng node b measurements sng node b configuration that is you con all the ui capabilities and the coordination results and the security information on for srv3 so a lot of information will be going through sjg not the edition request so after this as a sjnba addition request there will be acknowledgement from the secondary node that is the g node b to master node that yeah the video session resource admitted to the added list video session resource not admitted list so all these messages and you can also see that sj node b to me not b container that is a cg configurations all this will be sending by via this sjnb edition request acknowledgement so these are the list of the parameters and the information which will be going so there are if you go through more log detailed in unlocks there are a lot of information that that will be going but that is inform but that will be helpful if you uh go line by line for each and everything so the video will be you can say it will be to a big video for to cover it but here you can see what i have mentioned like sgconfig so xz config will be uh like carrying all the information related uh to the sgs cell group configuration so that is basically for this and drx information and misconfig of secondary node all this information will be going through uh this lg config and after that rrc connection reconfiguration will be uh happening for uh 5g nrb error that will be going from master lt node b to uv so here also there are a lot of parameters a lot of information which is going that is nrconfig r15 endc release and add r15 secondary cell group information here it will be going cell group id will be go max cell configuration physical cell group configuration and this u identity crnti timers so all the information will be uh going uh through this message as you can see uh like vmax utra r15 radio bearer configuration of r15 so all this thing will be going in this particular rc connection reconfiguration for the 5g nr and after the completion of rrc connection uh reconfiguration of 5g nr from uv to node b now sgnb reconfiguration complete will be sent by masternode that is lt towards the secondary node that is g node b and then the status transfer will be also sent by lte node b to uh nr node that is g node b that we are calling as a secondary node also so up to here the s transfer will be done now after this ascent transfer and we can see after this sn transfer now the we searching for the nrpss and rss and our pvcc pm pvch so all the synchronization will be uh you can say radio level synchronization will be uh done here by the g note b now again the uv will be sending the nr preamble not the lt premium so now nr preamble will go and then the uh genome we will sending the pdcca dci format 1 0 and and after that the nr random access process a response will go from g note b to uh uv and nr mac paid u and after that the dci uh pdcc dci format zero zero so this is basically now the call flow uh now the secondary node is getting added so this is the messages for the nr uh nr basically so we can see here the pdcca dci format one zero why why it is going so pd this dci format one zero is used to assign the as you know that this is for the downlink resource and and as you know that dci 0 08 is used for assigning the uplink resource to the ue and this can be uh scrambled from crnti so now the you will be sending the dual connectivity phr maxi and the measurement report in measurement report it will be sending the miss result of the never sell list of nr pci of nr means result of misread cells so this will be sent in the measurement report and after this the lte node we will sending the rrc container that will be containing all the 5g measurements and now the second cell will be responding with the secondary rad data users report that is the sec means what are the erev uses reports are there so that will be sent by the secondary node that is g node b and the g node b status indication so that will be the g node overload information we go through this message so in total here we can say that after this now it will be both the dual connectivity got activated up to this messages so for the as i i as i have already uh told you for going much more deep into this it will be the big video so i will be uh writing already i have one article on the on website on our website take care t1 for this 5g and our call flow so please go through that and thanks for today and please let us know uh whatever the things need to be added and whatever the if there will be any mistake or which need to be corrected or any extra information that need to be added please let us know thank you", "6yCPpUWCQ7w": "hi good morning I know it's a bit early for Vegas standards so thanks for waking up and joining us if you look at the the title that we published we call it new solutions leveraging 5g network we couldn't say when we register this session we couldn't say 5g plus wavelength the reason was we were under embargo and it's only announced yesterday what we want to do for the next 60 minutes is take you through this tech what have we done on the on the verizon side whatever we done on the aw side and we also have a customer on board and they'll kind of know he will take you through the experience so a quick way of introduction Shree Nikola Paula I have the tech development at horizon George is the guy behind wavelength but the biggest treat is we have the legendary game developer Robert Duffy if you if you google him you'll find all the kind of cool games that he's created he's behind in fact he's going to push the envelope for us to take the tech where it needs to be all right so we want to talk about what have we done and Andy said eighteen months we've been working together is simply putting wavelength tracks and Verizon sites or have you done anything nor deeper so before we get there I'll I'll take you through a little bit of Verizon 5g how we're building a network what are the things we are trying to trying to make you know bring to life and then we'll go through a little bit more about our own journey in terms of our technology the network virtualization that what led to to this this outcome that we're looking at so if you look at 5g networks there are lots of 5g flavors.you here but the one that we're building is the one that's actually going to bring all of these currencies to to life if you had gone to our booth for 426 and howdy al D or C you will actually be able to experience a band that you're talking about we're seeing 1.8 gigabits per second per device you can actually speed test and see now that's where we are today give us another six twelve months you're gonna see about you know three to four gigs per per device and when the next generation of chipsets come in three years from now we should be able to see eight nine gigs per device now that's a that's a fundamentally different level of bandwidth you know when compared to the 4G right 4G today some viewers can get up to 100 Mbps but this is foundationally very different not only that fighting Network at least the way we're building it is it's a dense network we use a combination of millimeter wave and and other spectrums and that means we have nodes ed call it every half mile and because of the dense network we're able to deliver within a given square kilometre area ten terabytes of bandwidth so that means you can have take a stadium take you know other other areas where you have inner dense amount of population likes airports we're able to deliver that you know 1gbps for a number of users couple of other things to point out the number of devices Phi G is going to bring in a lot more connected devices just not the the smartphones are used to but many others and the network will allow because dance it love up to you know that 1 million per square kilometer a couple of other things because the wave 5g network is built will be able to deliver new services very dynamically matter when we say 90 minutes we think it's it could be on lower than that and then latency is absolutely one of the things so when you look at the network the 5g itself by GNR brings in an R is a new radio that's the that's a term that brings in lower latency but when you pair that up with a an edge compute when you actually put the the computer right next to the packet core within the network then you're going to see you later and see you sub 10 milliseconds so we'll cover a little bit more but this is the kind of network we're building now to build a network like this you'll need significant amount of fiber look each node can carry multiple gigabits of a bandwidth and they all have to be backhaul to somewhere else and that requires significant amount of fiber it also requires spectrum we have uniquely the almost 1gb bandwidth width worth of spectrum compared dollars that allows us to deliver these you know four eight eight Gbps per device Phi G is going to be a fully virtualized network and that allows us to do some of the things we're going to show you in a second and then to really enable the edge compute and the related applications you need a lot of real estate and in an in a you know key dense populated urban areas and Verizon happens to have a number of those locations whether it is our ce o--'s or whether it is our an aggregation points and others these are things that allow us to kind of you know deliver the the sort of Phi G that we are working towards the other thing that you'll see with 5g coming in the next you know few quarters would be slicing so today's network effectively you have three kinds of slices you have a the the broadband the enhanced mobile broadband you have voice and messaging with with 5g a device can actually simultaneously latch on to eight different slices the the standards talk about 128 slices that you can actually deliver examples are things like massive machine type communication things like ultra reliable low latency communication these are some examples but we think the way it's gonna evolve is we will have slices that are meant for a type of application that could be a gaming slice there could be a v2x slice they could be each one of them have a very different set of characteristics and they have different needs but with one common network you're able to deliver all of these different experiences so how do we do before we go there where are we today we were the first to launch 5g here we will have 5g in 30 cities by the end of this year we are already there in 18 we have it in 14 out of NFL stadiums and we are looking at other sports when used to and we see this being the kind of network it's going to be very attractive in these dense environments so how do how do we build this kind of network unlike the traditional networks and by the way the folks who've been in the cloud journey this looks five years or ten years ago but networks because of the way they're designed to deliver the reliability and others we've been lagging behind in terms of college technological advancement so till till couple of years ago when we were to deploy a network application it used to be in our plans it comes with fully loaded the hardware software pre-configured everything we go poured into one of our sites hook it up and it does what it's supposed to do and we had appliances like that spread across across our entire footprint few years ago we started working on virtualizing all of these applications so generic infrastructure OpenStack you know kind of running virtualization layer and then you have the network applications now 5g is going to be a cloud native core and cloud native baseband application so we're gonna have the way we are deploying 5g is going to be a fully cloud native stretched all the way to the edge what does that mean what it means is if you look at our footprint we have radios macro towers and others they are talking to what we call a Syrian side centralized radio access network sites then they get aggregated through an aggregation point this is where we have packet called the the packet gateways and others and then from there they go to data centers whether it is the Amazon whether it is somebody else's data center to actually host the application that the end user is looking at now as we are virtualizing all of these points look start looking like our own network cloud site so we have our own effort you know deployment internally we use that infrastructure and a combination OpenStack and others to host our applications but when you start looking at us couple years from now this is our I'm guessing all the telecoms it look like but this is all we going to look like they're probably a little bit ahead than others now what what the intent of the slide is that if you look at the Layton sees at each of these points if you were to bring let's say a cloud like Amazon and put it close to a sell side we can deliver three milliseconds to five milliseconds Layton sees so you have an application which is a highly latency sensitive you want to kind of deliver that sort of experience you put wavelength right there and you can deliver that experience so you go to Syrian side about ten milliseconds go to aggravation side thirty forty milliseconds so these are the kind of latency is that the mobile users and and by the way this can also be delivered to in-home broadband users or others but these are the kind of latency is that they can they can start experiencing so so what does this mean how are we kind of leveraging that this to deliver college emerging application so soap so let me take you to how we're doing that the way we're doing that is if you look at our network today you use your smart phone and let's say you're trying to browse the site or go to an application this is a path is going to take the red dotted line it's going to go through the different cell side the base bands on others it's going to go through a packet gateway and then we'll get to some sort of a peering point and then eventually gets to whatever cloud is hosting their protocol application this is typical internet latency anywhere between seventy to hundred milliseconds is what you see here now what if we were to put a NH compute a cloud right there in our aggregation sites then we can start delivering 30 milliseconds or lower experiences now let's take the bit further so we are working on so today the way it happens is net the traffic between a smartphone or device to packet gateway goes through tunnels called gtp and the first point where it anchors to an IP is going to get a packet gateway so it is very difficult to recognize what is the traffic before that point what if you start isolating the different kinds of traffic may be based on a slice may be based on the kind of application and start delivering that traffic to the the compute right close to where the user is then you can you can get to these ten milliseconds we're talking about so the way we are we are looking at is that through the control plane user plane separation we're deploying these integrated gateways that dart and and we have some technology internally that can detect the kind of traffic that requires the processing close and then you can you can start delivering that latency now what if you move that edge compute even closer to the end user the same elements that we're deploying will allow us to detect the traffic depending on the latency and whatever requirements are there we'll be able to route the traffic to that the closest cloud server and Dell elects perience the so water fit is this the sort of it is there's a bit of animation here if I can let's see yeah this this is the world we live in today and especially if you're dealing with VR AR and some content rich and latency sensitive applications typically the way they are working is that you either download the entire content ahead of time and then you play through these clunky headsets and and and the experience is not so good you can't have a very thin device or you can't have a device that is a low battery consumption and then you actually end up carrying all the processing power with you because the processing is actually happening at the the end user side so what if we move this is this is the the point of what we talked what was announced yesterday what if move AWS closer to there to the network edge what you end up getting is very low latency you can actually offload some of the computing power whether it's GPU capabilities and others from end device into the cloud that means now you have a low power consuming devices even potentially low-cost devices but still delivering the kind of experiences that that the developers and others are looking for so the essence of what was announced yesterday is this that we are bringing wavelength servers into Verizon's edge network sites and we're the way of kind of undertaken through in the previous slides that's how we're integrating them between us and and wavelength now I'll let George will actually take you through the food details of wavelength and how it allows you as a developer to leverage the entire a SS ecosystem to develop applications that can get this sort of benefits thanks really hi everyone my name is George Ellis I'm the general manager of aw wavelength super excited to be here today with Trini we've we've been through a long journey working through this finally been able to announce this to you and actually get it to the hands of some of our customers is super exciting for us so when we when we look at Sweeney's slide about how the latency plays across mobile ads and and internet and the AWS region we we want to look at what we are really delivering at Casa to customers and when we're thinking about the value proposition of what we're doing what is it really that customers really want and that we're giving to into their hands with either with wavelength latency is the obvious one we talked a little bit about latency and the latency of today's situation when you have a mobile device trying to reach an application server up on the cloud is that you have to go through these multiple Network hops right you have to go to the antenna and then you have to go to the through the mobile network in various aggregation points reads a transit or peering point of the mobile network that then routes you through the internet up to the area's region so that route actually implies that there are a lot of hopes but there is also a lot of unpredictability you have because the routing goes over the Internet you have internet whether you have various peering points you have the location of the end-user where they are determining your latency and that that gets us to these hundred milliseconds or more of latencies from today's mobile devices and yes you can do some optimization and 5g does bring some of that optimization on for example reducing some of the networking latency from the user equipment to to the mobile core but those are incremental improvements what we are trying to do here is to find out what if we do some drastic improvement on the latency and and kind of like try to revolutionize the latency game by bringing the cloud very close to the to the end-user and get down to ten milliseconds get down to single-digit millisecond latencies what what does what happens if we can introduce this step function improvement or on latency and rather than thinking about marginal improvements and what we see from customers as we're talking through them these are these are these are obviously very new capabilities is that the game changes the experience that you can deliver now and the applications that you can build when you're reaching those limits of human perception or when you're reaching applications that can be truly reactive to their environment is a game changer but it's not just about latency when we're talking to customers we find out that latency in averages are great but when latency becomes mission-critical what also matters is the variability of that labels and you can easily not easily but you can deliver a few milliseconds of latency but also what matters is can I liver that consistently so can I deliver instead of the 50% percentile can I deliver it at a 90 and the 99 percentile and the approach that we're taking here with bringing the cloud very very close to the end-user is cutting out a lot of these unpredictable routing decisions that the Internet can make this inefficient and changing conditions and reducing the latency jitter and minimizing it allowing customers to our customers to deliver consistent experience to their end users think about for example and an editor that is doing color grading on a big film on on the cloud on the cloud desktop what happens is actually our brain learns how to adjust to latency so as you're going through those frames trying to color grade a film your brain can start predicting what the latency is going to be and you can actually deliver a pretty good experience however if that latest in changes as you're interacting with your application as you interacting with your with your film then your brain gets confused about what to expect and reducing that latency actually increases the improves the user experience dramatically so we talked a little bit about latency we talked a little bit about jitter or about the variability of that latency but there is more value here that a wavelength and 5g can deliver to customers and a Streamy took us through five g's a step up in bandwidth and connectivity in number of devices that you can connect and it's fascinating to see all of that innovation that's happening in the network today that makes 5g a different G than the other G's as as you guys often explain but what happens then when you have now let's say you're when you're trying to build a solution that has 20 high-definition cameras 10 K video that does intruder detection now you have five Deacon carriers all that data but how do you really process that data do you see everything back up to the cloud and try to do phrase detection there or intraday detection there that's a way to do it however that's inefficient because you're shipping a lot of data up that you might not need you might need only a few frames of that or part of the picture of that but also requires a long long-term connections from your end devices whether they be cameras or other sensors which makes them less efficient it it makes them less efficient it makes them require large batteries etc what if you could reduce that time and do some of the processing at the edge so that you don't have to see 20 high-definition streams up to up to the cloud but do that you know very close to where data is really generated and you can take that example in kind of like think of more and more use cases of how that plays and when we are when we are looking at the use cases this is very much in our DNA in looking at who is the customer what are the cues cases what do they really really need we see a lot of use cases that are true today we see game streaming and we have robert davi very proud to be on the same stage as you today he will talk through some of the work that great words are you doing with project Ryan later but you have virtual reality you have real-time rendering you have a lot of these use cases that are very obvious you can see them today they are emerging they're still a little bit nation but you can predict them however you see other use cases that are a little bit more out there like you know when you're talking about industrial automation about Marc city's IOT Trina mentioned vehicle and you know automaton amis vehicles or vehicle to vehicle communications and things like that that are a little bit more further out these are all super interesting use cases that we can predict today however if I were to tell you ten years ago that your phone will have 10x the processing power that it has what you imagine your phone would do maybe video calling right that's the incremental imagination that we have right like the things that we can predict and we can think of today are based on what we know today these are with delivering our customers this very low predictable latency compute at the edge we're giving them an opportunity and a capability that they didn't have before so what we really think is that 99% of the applications we can't imagine today so we think that our customers are gonna be using these capabilities to innovate beyond the use cases the immediate use case that we hear today whether that is a thin client whether that is a vacuum cleaner that looks at pathogens on your carpet and kills them automatically but doesn't cost $20,000 because it can use a $20,000 server that does GPU processing at the edge to broadcasting and to autonomous drones and cars etcetera etcetera so when we're looking at how do we deliver those capabilities to to our customers in order to innovate where do we start and where the way that we approached it is we want to start with giving them some very very strong primitives that they they already know how to use and they already can can predict how to use and not have that extra degree of learning in order to use this so our customers are used that today at regions they're used to availability zones and they're the use of making these deploying the deployments in a certain way and using certain tools and that's what we're trying to mirrors here so when we're building wavelength we're delivering AWS Ozzie's to the ads with minor changes the the way that we're doing that is through the wavelength zone a wavelength zone is you can think about it as the equivalent of an availability zone today it is the same ws that you have today in your region but it is in your data center but it is designed to be delivered at the edge of the 5g network it is basically a zone hosted in a site within the Phi J in network and srini told us a little bit about the the architecture of that network and depending on on the latency that we want to get we can place it in different places within the 5g network it's managed from a region so you can think of the wavelength zone as an additional as an extension of the that region you can see it doesn't as a zone that you cannot extend your VP c2 and assign a 72 and then you can build on top of that so we're using the V PC as the abstraction layer and it's fully integrating to the 5g network which means that you don't have to do any of any work yourself on understanding how do I connect to the user equipment you'll get an IP that's an IP within B verizon 5g network and you can talk directly to the 2d to the n device there's no integration for you to do there so what is kind of unique of this approach is what we've seen again and again our customers really enjoy which is that you can build once deploy anywhere it's a single pane of glass you go to your management console you go to your AWS API and you can see the wavelength owns like you see you know your us is a daisy you can easily include ads within your applications today so you can easily extend your applications to have those low latency parts deployed a tea a tea at the edge and the key here is that because this is an extension of AWS and it's not like something special that we're doing it's the same aw that you get in the region anything all of the innovation that we put into our services into our region's automatically translates to the today to the wavelength zone so when there is a new feature of ec2 you directly get it when there is a new tagging feature there is a new identity and access management feature you just directly get it when there is a new VPC feature and and of course because it is connected to the region you can do failover between region and AD and and you can split your application to optimize them we already have one wavelength zone going in Chicago connected to the 5g Network live and we have some demos and you guys should check out the Verizon booth afterwards because it's there are some really cool demos going on there but you can think of the of the wavelength zones as we go into the next year and beyond having dozens of those across the u.s. and being able to serve your users everywhere they are whether they are in a big metropolitan urban center or whether it's a an industrial center across the u.s. so we're spreading out as 5g also evolves and deploys so when we're thinking about the architecture and I won't go into a lot of detail here because there is another session right after I think it's at 11:30 we have the the code at the end you guys should check it out if you if you want to go into more detail about how do you use wavelengths the key thing here is that the control management and monitoring happens through the region and the wavelength the drone is an extension of that region so probably what you will end up doing is you will have your backend of your applications in a region your scalable back-end that is not load latency sensitive and you'll deploy the latency sensitive part of the application in the wavelength own for example your game streaming server might be in the zone but your player data or your database or state of your of your game might be elsewhere and so the the whole idea is that you combine these things in order to build applications that are both efficient but also tackle this brand-new use cases and we're really really looking forward to see what you guys do that show before passing on the mic I'll just do a quick recap of what are the value propositions here that we're bringing to you first of all wavelength is public anyone will be able to access it you don't want you don't need a special deal with us or with Verizon you go to your AWS management console and you just use it and no commitments it's not you don't have to buy a three-year or five-year or ten-year hardware or or I commit to anything if you don't wish to there is no need to own hardware there's no need to own data centers there's no need to go and do special networking any developer can use this to deploy all industry applications that survived the the other key thing is you have the AWS cycle system because this is completely open to everyone you have the AWS ecosystem accessing it whether they are ISVs where they are their solution provider system integrators we will see this ecosystem evolve and you will use the same tools the same services and the same primitives that you use in AWS in order today in the in your AC's in the wavelength owns you can therefore seamlessly leverage that breadth that we of the AWS platform that is so attractive to developers and work across region and edge to build this cool in your applications Robert hello I'm Robert Duffy I'm the CTO at it software we've been you know it we've got a what I consider a very rich history of gaming innovations and entertainment innovations from the very first first-person shooter first multiplayer first eSports commercially by first commercially viable VR at Bethesda we you know the first DLC with horse armor if anybody bought that I did and you know we've pioneered open-world gaming and we've continued to kind of push entertainment technology kind of as far as we can take it and I think you know since the you know since the early 90s with the original Wolfenstein 3d and moving on through dooms and quakes and everything that we've done kind of technology innovation is is kind of in our blood project Orion is an initiative that we announced at e3 this year and it's game streaming technology and we'll talk a little bit about that you know we we all know game streaming is coming you know if you remember the early days of Netflix though in the early days of music streaming there were rough patches and but we know it's coming and what we well where we why we started Orion was basically we have you know you know human overly hundreds of years of experience with game engines and fighting latency and what what a players expect what do our customers want and so we tackle the problem differently than than everybody else is the way most gaming streaming services work is it's just brute force you apply a hardware and you compress in real time and that's what you do so we came up with a with a with a number of techniques that are integrated at the game engine that that leverages things the game engine does and helps the streaming process and now that we're working with Verizon 5g and the ad abs wavelength you know that was a big thing for us and again from from an Orion perspective we built this from the ground up we started completely clean we have a very again long history with attack and engines but we started completely clean and streaming a high quality console experiences you know there's a lot of technical challenges because if you're streaming a movie you have the luxury of spinning as much time as you want to compress that movie at whatever quality you want and then that single source can serve millions of customers game streaming we're having to do it at 60 60 frames per second 60 Hertz real time so we're encoding real time we're having to deliver it we're decoding real time we're having the input latency back to the server and so on and so on so there's a lot of things latency is the key and the last mile problem which you know you may have heard of is kind of the you know it's kind of from your from your service provider to your house and what we found in practice is it's more like the last 50 feet because a lot of people have really great connectivity to their house but you know you're a Walmart and you're like $39 router that looks pretty good but it's so it's that last 50 feet that is really what kills us and it's the number of hops and you know keeping the hops down is really key and while we think that Orion provides the best streaming service available the opportunity to work with Verizon 5g and the 80s wavelength we were super excited and I don't know if we were the first customer we were certainly yeah because I think we were we were deploying our things as they were actually you know screwing the blade back to the racks and it's in the onboarding was really really good and you know it's really really been overall really good the whole partnership we've been running on we've run it we've been running Orion on AWS for quite some time and as George just described the transition for us was really straightforward you know all of our management software runs on AWS and I think the transition literally took us a day and a half it's a really kind of we have something running you know there were again there's bumps in the road felt brand-new technology Orion's new wavelengths new 5g edges new but onboarding as a customer on their pilot program I can say has been as seamless as you would ever expect something to be you know from a customer perspective and it's been really really good so looking forward this is this is where I get really excited you know the partnership that we're we're starting with with AWS and Verizon but has Orion tech we're gonna provide the best streaming experience that you can imagine again we want to we don't want to we're going to deliver you know console Plus experiences to gamers everywhere we want people to be able to play when they want where they want on a device they want etc that's great that that's the status quo where we're looking is in a future where what can we do at the edge with all this compute that nobody else can do and that's where again that's where we get really excited as the game developer it is we feel we can develop experiences that you've never seen what if we're not using a single blade what if we're using an entire rack no okay that's great let's use an entire cluster what kind of what kind of entertainment experiences can we build that you've never seen and that's what's gonna push game streaming into the forefront because you're gonna be able to play things that you just can't play on a high-end PC or a console and that's that's where we're starting to focus our attention and you know we're really excited about the future of all this so you know about all I've done I need water but that's where we're gonna see and it's combination of again with with a DBS and Verizon has been amazing and again we're gonna you know we're gonna change the future so this is start we can't not go forward without the next slide your creation oh yeah I do let's talk about this is the first game that's on the on the edge it's really interesting as we as we're talking to you and the rest of the people a bit si is as you guys are getting more creative with with these capabilities you start thinking about what could I do if I can scale ways what can I do if I can yeah and that that's exactly what we're we're excited because you know I want to build you know as a game developer I've been doing this long time I want to build things that nobody has ever experienced and you know you're always limited by the lowest common denominator you have to run this console and and or this and and we're starting to see those limits getting raised and you know doom is a hard problem it's a 60 Hertz game it's a twitch shooter and you know it's where we started because we're like if you can if you can stream doom you can stream anything and you know it's kind of like doom classic runs on everything from ATMs to old printers to old cameras they put you know people have ported classic doomed everything and we used kind of doom 2016 as our basis for if we can you know early on we had some really big successes one of the one of the lead designers on doom we set him down didn't tell him what he was playing on and just so what do you think and he said it seems like the you know the the the the theater mode is on on the TV so the TVs adding some milliseconds of latency and for us that was a huge win because if that's the only thing you noticed considering you're streaming this from 300 miles away then you know that's a big win and but you know doom runs great you can check it out at the Verizon booth it's running on 5g phones looks great awesome game you don't have it you should get it plus one yeah we're really excited that customers like with this I can can take this and and start thinking about what the future is you as Robert said streaming has been around as an idea for a while but now we're kind of changing the game when we're telling you hey you can scale this as much as you want and then you can scale back down and you can use most powerful servers out there placed within kilometers of your of your edge user so we're really excited that this is finally in our customers hands and really looking forward over the next few months of scaling this out thanks thanks George and Robert so in summary we are bringing the Frye gene Network and all of its capabilities with wavelength together as an offering and you know Robert talked about some of the stuff they've done and in a little matter of a couple of days to get it on board we have a few other experiences that we are already I'm showing a are we are computer vision others the the goal of this partnership is that developers see this as yet another way they can you know wait without having to learn new set of tools without having to really go redesign everything that you do and that's that's what that's what I don't know and put in front of us so this slide is effectively the capabilities it will bring together Josh talked about the 99% that we don't know that you guys are going to innovate this is the 1% this is all we can imagine but I think there's a lot more that that's how that you are gonna innovate and and we're looking forward to that quick links if you want to know more about it and I hear a couple of you can go to our booth and experience the 5g connectivity and experiences we can go to any of these sites and and there's more information on how if you want to try it on for example and at the Chicago site you know you can you can sign up and there's a there's a white listing process that we can take you through and get you on board to to experience some of this so any questions I think we got a few minutes please so it's a two-part the question was are we hosting an outpost server and within our network or are we hosting Amazon software on our own hardware right it's not outpost number one it's actually wavelength the key differences multi-tenancy and all the other things that come with its public meaning anybody can access in case of outpost it's it's meant for enterprise and others where single tenant so that's key difference it is AWS wavelength hardware that is placed in Verizon sites and we've done integration at a network API level integration between wavelength and the verizon network to kind of deliver those experiences if I cannot do that the it is the ADA base hardware that you find in the region it's the same kind of driving technology that you would have an outpost to extend the region into your data center but in this in this case we're sending the region into the 5g network so it is the it's super important for us to kind of get that across that it is the same hardware the same API is at the same the same experience so if you have something running in a region today in you know in it GPU instance and you want to pour that to a wavelength zone in GPU instance it's gonna be the same right outpost is is a way that AWS can extend the the AWS cloud into Iraq or a set of racks in order to put it in your data center but out was has a product require you will have you buying a rack and putting in your data center having it data so the technology is very similar hearing based but the key thing is is this is public and on demand so you don't have to just enough like you would do in a region you would spin up an instance you do the same here please the question was are we talking just about ec2 or everything about more services so the core thing that we are delivering to start with is easy to container services some solid services however we are being very careful on which services are the low latency services that our customer is really required to deliver to the edge rather than delivering everything locally we want to be very prescriptive about what you what you need in order to to run your application so it will be not just easy to it's a number of services but it's not the fool for example s3 is not delivered to start with in Waveland zones you would be obviously looking back into your region to connect to various services so question are they sorry yeah let me repeat the sorry the question is for everybody's benefit how do we look at network capacity in terms of slicing and how its allocated between the slices that's something that we are so number one slicing is not available as a as a capability at all there is a standards whether they there's a technological option to option to stand-alone core will start emerging into the marketplace at a chipset and software level probably sometime we're too late next year and it'll start manifesting in devices in probably in 2021 if you look at a high-level timelines once this entire building block said is deployed devices software the network and everybody has this then we will have the capabilities to start deploying slices all the way from device device will have ability to choose a slice network expose something called NSSF network slice election function you could basically decide which slices can be available to which user the point of how much capacity look it's going to start in our view broadband taking the bigger chunk but URL LCM MTC and and some other other technologies started maturing v2x and others we anticipate capacities will start then getting this route and i cross these the bigger thing for all of us and this way a little bit of AI and others are going to play a role is how do you optimize across slices the last thing you want to do is make it inefficient because you reserve some slices and capacity but it's not utilized whereas there is demand elsewhere right so how quickly do we move and that's why the underlying cloud native architecture is very important so that we can you know quickly move between the slices in a very dynamic manner and also scale up and down depending on you know where the the usages so bit of learning to go through in the next few quarters good question so the question is does this tie to all kinds of spectrum that we have and the the the slide I showed which talks about the virtualization path we are on by when it will be done and will it expand beyond what mobile networks include to the wildland network so to the first question the the way we are deploying is that look 5g is not in every location today right I mean as you saw we said 18 cities 30 cities by the end of the year and then it'll expand will be nationwide you know fairly soon the but when a phone is not 5g coverage it's going to fall back into 4G this network is connected to both for this particular cloud is connected about 4G and Phi G which means through the packet core whether it's 4G or 5g packet code without the packets to the to the wave length and then gets also let's say applications not requiring that high bandwidths can still be served and you'll still see the kind of you know latency and all our benefits so they'll come with it our journey towards virtualization we are we are fully virtualized in a packet core but the way carriers tell you is we got the entire packet core and everything virtualized but not all capacity is already there and the the reason for that is we have appliances that we've acquired two three four years before and as they get to end-of-life the migration path is now you go towards virtualization so most of the our entire network functions are virtualized we are carrying end-to-end traffic through the virtual infrastructure if I'd you will be fully virtualized there's no physical gear out there what we deployed even what we deployed today is virtualized the ran is going to become fully modular so the base band which is where the most of the complexities that that is now fully cloud native and will start applying with with the NR starting next year the by the way we use the term mobile access our sorry mobile age compute but it's actually multi-access edge compute to simplify for for everybody we kind of started using mobile it is multi-access in fact we can we we will eventually think of having the wavelength Star Wars not only on the wire line but wireless network I'm sorry the other way Wireless as well as wild lion networks which means that we have our fires network in in you know nine different states that where we offer a home broadband we could deliver these low latency and high you know intense experiences through those the network integration why is it we're pretty similar just different protocols and different servers we all deal with but we're starting with mobile this is where the excitement is but we equip Lant expand for the mobile integration is something that I'm also really excited about both your questions about how do we expose some of those those network functionalities to developers is and that's why we think five g's they think that we should prioritize and work first on because of all the promise of additional capabilities that you can deliver to the to tourism oh you mean instead of wire instead of wireline yeah yeah so well the the whole wire conversation is I think a completely different conversation because there are so many different solutions there but here here's what's happening with five g 5g has a promise of replacing a lot of the connectivity solutions out there from wired to Wi-Fi to other other solutions and if we look at that future where 5g they let's say single connectivity one of the few connectivity solutions out there we think it's super important and it's the thing to prioritize to be because we see the promise there ya know we did we actually live tested in Chicago a few weeks ago and we sent a couple of our QA kids out there to basically you know test to make sure everything's working and their experience was 5g was was better than Wireless and you know that's what we're looking for we soon as I get out of my house and you be good to it right you don't have to switch over your I know you're moving from place to place you're switching over from Wi-Fi to to wealthy etc so it's the ubiquity it's the promise of eight nine gigs down you know speeds to your to your handset where there it can become like a single like a very thin client if you if you can run so it's an interesting question to see how the world landscape evolves given that because everything kind of evolves is not only five the other things involve as well so but we do think that 5g has a promise there also for this integration between cloud and networking if you look at Verizon beyond those eight nine states where we have files we also have not only we are offering 5g as a mobile offering but there's a fixed wireless offering we already offer and five cities and you'll see that ramping up next year and in that world you know there's no difference I mean you could be at home you could be outside seamless so you're on the same network and you experience the the similar experiences please yes I see yeah yeah the question let me repeat your question in summaries if I don't get all of the aw services at the 5g edge then does it defeat the purpose that I have to go back and talk to the region etc so when we're looking through how applications are architected this is not how we expect people will build here for example you may not need your database to be at the edge of obviously the edge is a more constrained environment and doesn't have a scale of an AWS region so do you really need five millisecond latency to your database and even if you do does your database really give you five minutes right like well you know you'd have to use they're the right types of databases and the right they so you it's not like we can't bring RDS yet it's full people really need earlier said will our developers needle yet yet so what we're doing here is we're we're building the platform and then we can build on top of that we can bring more iw services to be as needed but we don't think that this is a priority for customers right now so there is a big part of of course yeah yeah so if you if you architect your application to have a communication to your back-end database in the path of low latency then you might need to make some changes there but the way that we see people building here and customers building here is for example if you have a if you have a game streaming service you won't put everything at the edge you put the game streaming server at yet but you may you may put your game stage or other things like that in your database in the region where it's more scalable more efficient and you know obviously the edge is a more constrained environment that you can't necessarily build everything up I mean I doubt that with example if you notice yesterday's announcement inference was one of the things that Andy announces new item we expect that eventually could be on the edge along with ec2 because you're running computer you also want to lose some inference a and ml inferencing at the edge with the computer vision others so that's a natural extension of what what we do compared to RDS for exam yeah that's a great example you wouldn't train your models at the edge yeah but you do the inference at the at the inference part so you will move parts of your application and and that's why we think it's so important that you're connected to the region and you have that seamless connection between the two which we provide you don't have to all right we have time for one last question what games do you mean a are we are or another set of applications computer vision in fact in some of the examples that we get from our customers who are actually talking to us quite a bit is they would like they see computers and cameras as the the most ubiquitous sensor it can sense any kind of thing and they want to do the inferencing at the edge so I'm Tyler to their leader manufacturing processing there you know we have an example we announced I think Corning is one of them where we have a campus network deploy 5g campus network with computers and cameras and others and we're using that to do some sort of inventory management and tracking others of their manufacturing process so those are the kind of applications start seeing I think this is where we we I think we're not the the smartest ones to tell what all applications we've come we're looking for developers to come back and say look we gave you all these ingredients or can you live with it that's an option where you could actually have a campus network with a kind of an outpost co-located and yeah that that could be an example so the way that we're planning the scaling of this over the next year is we are picking large population centers like larger urban environments Metro centers industrial centers but however we are already in discussions between us and with customers on what happens if I have my campus which is not in a major metro center and I wanna extend wavelength in the 5g into there and and that's a definitely something that we're we're looking at on how doing thank you thank you very much [Applause]", "LSfMDUKfylo": "my goal for him is to hear his voice to hear him

to find gene well first of all 5g is not just about smartphones and not just about consumer adoption so if you want a seraph IT attention you must talk about enterprise when you talk about enterprise you must talk about compute gets who decides what to buy an enterprise CIOs so you have to make it more IT like more cloud like so you will sell them here fight you without edge compute so 5gh camp you are freaking out how to get this into the CEOs hands how do you attract the developers the app developers that tradition that isn't for enterprise but now moving them all to 5g but at the same time making sure that they don't have to worry about what there's a 5 g of 4G or Wi-Fi because the other day is all about multi connectivity and using the right connectivity for the right job for the right amount of latency and compute and that is a key so in my point of view to two pi G a Suribachi adoption you need to take care of enterprise use verticals and making it simple to move software to if the fellow suffer on this platform Caroline can you tell us about these specific projects you are working on with HPE so there are some projects we've been working with them on around virtualized ran virtualized EPC we work with them on edge compute in fact few are lucky enough to be at this Mars colony walk out of this chamber you see a lot of demonstrations around edge to cloud so we work with the HP or all of their paralyzed that run on Intel we make it such that it's a nav adoptable it's not just for the network but every single one of that contains this na VI that can and on for any of the NA VI applications we are working with them on blockchain v2x these are the two new the new ones among all the others were working on we also work strongly with the Aruba team to putting on edge compute on shoot a robo-wife at which is a very strong presence all over the enterprise so if you go back to that what I just said 5g adoption is relaxed or Enterprise so so you must looked at what Enterprise are already using except making them the change you change to adapt into the enterprise business practice so yeah it's been a great partnership very profitable and I hope that will continue down the path Caroline chant that you very much thank you you", "sTbYGXCsOd8": "It's going to require tremendous investment. It takes time to deploy that sort of infrastructure and the sooner we start the more we will be able to lead in the future. Small cells are not your traditional wireless infrastructure on towers or very tall poles, but are smaller units that are deployed more ubiquitously in much larger numbers. Small cells are key because my propagation distance is so short. And that's really a future that is dramatically different than today. In order to get the benefit out of small cells from a capacity perspective location is incredibly important. With the antenna technology that will come from the use of millimeter wave bands, very small form factors that can blend into the environment in a seamless way. That makes it easier to deploy.

how you can use it and what the benefits are of cannabis oil made in cold methods furthermore I will explain briefly how I came to this method cannabis oil can be used for many projects such as cancer skin problems patents on digestive problems rejuvenation of bones and even your brain cells to name a few for skin conditions like eczema or skin inflammations or skin cancer the use of cannabis can be very effective and very soothing to for people with cancer the use of cannabis oil is very beneficial and ensures that our body can relax and it gets the ability to heal itself in addition it is a pain killer in his entire inflammatory it strengthens your immune system and has an anti-tumor effect it reduces the damage the femur therapy can cause to the nerves and brings the body in a more balanced state in the case of colon cancer laboratory studies show that it really works with lung cancer the sputum production will decrease and it prevents choking cold oil is highly recommended for Parkinson projects the raw oil has many active ingredients that are very beneficial to Parkinson when taken regularly this effect is also noticeable when ingesting Cokely obtained juice from the leaves of the cannabis plant how to use cannabis oil the application of cannabis oil can be done in a number of ways for two are the most efficient the one is on the skin and the second one is under the tongue the oil can be rubbed in daily on the affected area like a kind of ointment it's best to dilute the wheat paste with castor oil instead of other oils in the preparation process because castor oil is a bit thicker and easier to apply and it helps the wheat oil to pet deeper into the skin in the case of any other conditions the cannabis oil is taken orally you can do this in front of a mirror so you can see easily how many drops you take then drop the oil under the tongue and leave it there for a couple of minutes before swallowing it this is done because under the tongue the oil is absorbed by the body much quicker the dosage it's advisable to take the oil every day and to continue the treatment for as long as possible for paint projects it's convenient to take the oil every few hours to keep the analgesic effect constant when it comes to treating a tumor or preventing a cancer from coming back it's enough to take the oil once a day because every oil has a different strength it's very useful to test your daily dose with every new obtained bottle of oil you can do it very easily by taking for example three drops and the next day take four drops build it up slowly every day with one drop until you get slightly high if you're slightly high you know you have to take one or two drops less to set your dose if you become very stoned during this process it's best to relax and enjoy it the effect will decrease sometime the advantage of cannabis oil made on occult meth is compared to the heat of method cannabis contains at least 200 different potentially active medical ingredients other than THC and CBD because there's little research done about these ingredients there's also little known but what we do know is when heating it a lot of it will be lost this inspired me to do a little research on cannabis oil made in a cold method the most common cannabis oil is made with the use of heat this process is called decarboxylation and ensures that the THC acids are converted THC the THC and CBD strongly stimulate the cannabinoid receptors that are naturally present in our body these receptors activate human system and heal the body an additional effect is that the intoxicating effect of the oil is strengthened and therefore more suitable as an anesthetic painkiller in cannabis oil that is made without heating air the assets from the THC are preserved as well as all the other ingredients that are present in the plant the THC acids have a similar effect as the family let alone Aveda the pe\u00f1a from our body which is a balanced riparian molecule this molecule provides an analgesic and and diplomat ory effect it has a positive effect on the immune modulation of our body and takes very effective role in protecting the nerves in chemotherapy the pe\u00f1a itself is also stimulated by the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience in the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience with the use of cold oil is that it works very well it keeps and makes the body healthy if you want a stronger effect you can even use to both oils at the same time because they work in a completely different way I hope this

"hey guys thanks for joining me today we are here with my newest video blog because this video blog is my RSO trip so this is my journey with art with the RSO I'll be doing 100 grams of RSO in less than the next hundred days so figured I would kind of show you my journey where we're going to start and where we're going to go we are working with Rick Simpson oil so RSO oil this is what we call new on the market it's called gorilla balm it is a 28 percent THC it is a hybrids of gorilla glue number four and THC bomb which are both hybrid indicas so it'll be really really good so we're gonna dab this RSO first so just to give you a look at what we're going to be dabbing this is the gorilla balm RSO so a little bit more about me my name is Nicola thanks for joining me today I have bladder cancer as well as interstitial cystitis and ulcerative colitis I am a terminal cancer patient so I decided to go on the journey of our SLE oils with this I will be marking my journey through this calendar as we start so here tomorrow on the 24th you'll see here is where we're going to be starting our our XO oil so tonight our your today are we're going to be doing setting this up putting in the refrigerator and then getting it ready to start for the morning and then you'll see notes on this if they appear every day so it'll be pretty cool so just as a little bit of an introduction this is the are so this is the gorilla balm just to give you a kind of good look at it this is what a one-pound amount of cannabis will turn into RSO so we're looking at about a hundred grams of RSO here that we have made into our cure so I'm going to put in come with me we are going to set this up for tomorrow's dose so the first thing I'm going to do is I like to have these little containers to where I can close them up but this has the silicone drums inside I pull them out so I have a duplicate because my skill likes to turn off and on on its own so this way we can keep the scale going then when I refrigerate it it all goes into the plastic container sealed up and we're good to go so let's go ahead and start measuring this so one of the things that I have learned is to make my spoon a little sticky to get the RSO off of the spoon otherwise it drips really really slowly and I just want to get one gram 1.0 on the skin kind of looks like fudge and that would be word skillful mouth so 20:51 was an underrated way it let it zero out oh yeah okay so this will be our first dose of the medication and now I'm going to pack it and seal it forever refrigeration overnight and we'll be back tomorrow to take the medication so remember you can also dab with your RSL oil but the cure is ingesting the RSO so if you're dabbing method or you're putting it into your pre-roll you are still consuming it but you're not consuming enough at one point in time to really work so if you're using this as a cancer treatment or as a debility debilitating condition treatment or pain management do

dependent on the phone you own which supports different spectrum bands and the carrier you are with such as at t verizon or t-mobile because each carrier has access to one different spectrum bands and two amounts of that spectrum known as bandwidth which they are making available to you in this video i'm going to give you a quick overview of three key types of 5g spectrum being low mid and high band additionally we discuss which spectrum bands can be used in the latest 5g capable smartphones further we give you a breakdown of which us wireless carrier think verizon at t and t-mobile has the best spectrum holdings and finally we discuss how this all ties into a greater need for digital infrastructure you will find out what the best phones and carriers are to get the most out of 5g service using real data points as opposed to trying to figure it all out through the company's advertising campaigns so stay tuned and i'll break this all down for you before i do be sure to subscribe to the dgtl info channel and turn on the notifications so you don't miss my next in-depth video that is coming out soon now let's jump into the video so what is spectrum and why is it important spectrum is the lifeblood of the wireless industry in order to build a fully operational 5g network us carriers need to have three layers of spectrum specifically these include low mid and high band spectrum low band is typically the first layer of coverage as it provides much better coverage compared to mid and high band frequencies low band is comprised of 4g frequencies that are refarmed to be used in 5g through what is known as dynamic spectrum sharing in the middle are mid band frequencies which are sub 6 gigahertz and include frequencies like three and a half gigahertz a global standard finally high band spectrum bands comprise ultra wide frequencies that are typically 24 gigahertz and higher ultimately all frequency bands will be part of 5g indeed this means that the united states carriers will be able to leverage their full spectrum portfolio and coverage capabilities carriers will have to combine their low mid and high band spectrum in order to deliver users the performance that they expect whether that be for video streaming or advanced enterprise use cases so united states carriers are deploying 5g spectrum in what is known as a layer cake the combined channels of low mid and high band spectrum together combine to what is known as a layer cake specifically the layer cake is critical for the type of 5g services that customers can use on a ubiquitous basis nationwide in urban suburban and rural environments indeed it is this combination of low mid and high band spectrum that enables more capacity and an increase in speeds for customers for nationwide coverage of the united states the only way for carriers to implement 5g is through the layer cake approach to spectrum firstly low band covers broad geographies and penetrates buildings very well secondly the populous areas use mid band and thirdly when it becomes very dense high band or what is known as millimeter wave also in short form is mm wave this type of spectrum covers areas such as inside stadiums and at event locations so now that we understand the different layers of spectrum what can 5g spectrum and performance do for you the 5g performance that you receive depends a lot on what signal or spectrum your 5g phone runs on recall that there are three categories of spectrum bands high band mid band and low band higher frequency bands are characterized by signals that have higher capacity meaning a higher amount of traffic or data can be transmitted over them but the downside is that these signals travel shorter distances lower frequency bands are characterized by signals that have lower capacity meaning a lower amount of traffic or data can be transmitted over them but the upside is that these signals travel longer distances and therefore provide more coverage so let's walk through now five examples of major phones that have come out over the past years to show you their compatibility with different frequencies used in 5g so first is the apple iphone and within that we have the iphone 12 which has just been released and is compatible across the three different spectrum bands so the iphone 12 is compatible with low band spectrum including 600 megahertz 700 megahertz and 850 megahertz frequencies the iphone 12 is also compatible with mid-band spectrum which we'll call old mid-band spectrum because it was used in 4g and lte this includes aws which is 1.7 gigahertz pcs which is 1.9 gigahertz and brs which is 2.5 gigahertz the iphone 12 is also compatible with what we'll call new mid-band spectrum meaning this spectrum has either recently been released such as cbrs or is going to be released by the end of 2020 and into 2021 such as c-band so the iphone 12 is compatible with new mid band spectrum including c-band which is three and a half gigahertz and cbrs which is three and a half gigahertz finally the iphone 12 is also compatible with high band spectrum including both 28 gigahertz and 39 gigahertz moving over to the iphone 11 which was released prior to any 5g services going nationwide we can see that the iphone 11 is compatible with the same low band spectrum such as 600 megahertz 700 megahertz and 850 megahertz frequencies it is also compatible with the old mid-band spectrum including aws pcs and brs but it is not compatible with new mid-band spectrum such as cbrs and c-band and it does not have capabilities for high band spectrum the iphone x or iphone 10 is compatible with the same spectrum bands as the iphone 11. so let's move on to some samsung galaxy devices the latest edition of the samsung galaxy is the samsung galaxy s20 which is compatible with low band spectrum including 600 megahertz 700 megahertz and 850mhz frequencies it is compatible with the old mid band spectrum including aws at 1.7 gigahertz pcs at 1.9 gigahertz and brs at 2.5 gigahertz it is also compatible with some of the new mid band spectrum specifically being cbrs at three and a half gigahertz but the device is not compatible with c band which is another three and a half gigahertz spectrum finally the base samsung galaxy s20 model is not compatible with high band spectrum you need to for example get the samsung galaxy s20 uw which stands for ultra wideband and uses that high band millimeter wave frequency finally moving furthest to the right the samsung galaxy s10 is compatible with the same spectrum bands as the s20 except it is not compatible with cbrs at three and a half gigahertz therefore it is not compatible with the new mid band spectrum in its entirety so we discussed how 5g is deployed in layers and different spectrum bands but what does this all mean for you and how can we interpret the performance so high band you can think of as capacity spectrum it typically ranges from 24 gigahertz to 40 gigahertz if we look at the three distinct triangles in the middle of the page it helps to compare the three different layers of spectrum to one another so starting with high band on the left side coverage in high band is more limited millimeter wave spectrum has limited propagation given it does not travel much more than 500 to 600 feet away from the small cell that it is being broadcast on however as we move to the next triangle capacity high band can offer speeds that are 10 times faster or more than low band 5g networks in terms of this capacity you're able to transmit a lot of information and thus high band is used for those extreme bandwidth needs in dense urban areas the trade-off as we talked about with coverage is that high band does not travel very far because the signal gets easily absorbed or scattered by obstacles so even if you are standing close to the node where the signal is being broadcast from such as only a few hundred feet away there can be some degradation because high band signals only travel well within direct line of sight so obstacles like trees walls buildings and even raindrops in the air can block or disrupt the high frequency signal finally moving to the rightmost triangle latency on high band is very very low particularly when compared to mid band and low band now moving to mid band which is known as the backbone spectrum and includes frequencies like three and a half gigahertz looking at the first two triangles midban is really a mixture of coverage and capacity for 5g services meaning fast speeds and good transmission distances mid bend works well in cities but is not as effective for rural coverage mid band is important for providing wider bandwidth for things like enhanced mobile broadband services and to support internet of things use cases moving to the third triangle the latency of mid band is lower compared to low band spectrum but it is higher compared to high band spectrum finally low band which is known as coverage spectrum includes frequencies such as 600 megahertz 700 megahertz and 850 megahertz signals which are the foundation for the 5g network in low band if we refer to the first triangle the coverage of low band can be described as signals being able to penetrate walls in a similar way in which light goes through glass it provides better coverage in buildings and provides the widest coverage in general moving to capacity compared to 4g low band provides higher speeds for 5g mobile broadband coverage across urban suburban and rural areas but it's much slower in comparison to mid band and high band 5g the final triangle latency for low band is much higher compared to mid and high band frequencies now to sum up all three of those 5g bands and compare them to a reference point which is 4g 4g was deployed on existing 2g and 3g spectrum bands primarily 1.8 gigahertz but in some cases 700 megahertz 800 megahertz 900 megahertz and 2.1 gigahertz so now that we know the differences in features between the different spectrum bands let's move on to the spectrum that is held by the different carriers in the united states so the four largest holders of spectrum in the united states include verizon at t t-mobile us and dish network which owns boost mobile and is building a new 5g network companies like us cellular comcast siriusxm charter and cox also own spectrum but their holdings are much smaller than these big four carriers therefore we will focus on a high level overview of the low mid and high band holdings of verizon at t t-mobile us and dish network to reiterate this is a high level overview if you want more detail of each carrier's precise spectrum holdings by individual band then please check out our shop section at dgtlinfra.com shop and look for the product united states carriers spectrum holdings in this document it provides you with the raw data for example that t-mobile owns a 31 megahertz block of spectrum in the 600 megahertz band but now let's focus on our high-level overview of the low mid and high band holdings of verizon at t t-mobile us and dish network just to note when we quote spectrum holdings we are referring to the weighted average holdings in megahertz so verizon is the largest carrier in the united states with 120 million subscribers they are the third out of these four carriers in low band holdings they are the fourth out of these four carriers in mid band holdings and they are number one out of these four carriers in high band holdings so in low band verizon holds 47 megahertz of spectrum depth in mid band verizon holds 84 megahertz of spectrum depth and in high band verizon holds over 2 000 megahertz of spectrum depth moving to at t they are number one out of these four carriers in terms of low band holdings they are number two out of these four carriers in terms of mid band holdings and they are number three out of these four carriers in terms of high band holdings so in low band att holds 55 megahertz of spectrum depth in mid band at t holds 93 megahertz of spectrum depth and in high band at t holds approximately 1200 megahertz of spectrum depth moving to t-mobile they are number two out of these four carriers in terms of low band spectrum they are number one out of these four carriers in terms of mid-band spectrum and they are number two out of these four carriers in high band spectrum so in low band t-mobile holds 55 megahertz of spectrum depth in mid-band t-mobile holds 256 megahertz of spectrum depth and in high band t-mobile holds over 1500 megahertz of spectrum depth finally moving to dish network and they are number four out of these four carriers in terms of low band holdings they are number three out of these four carriers in terms of mid band holdings and they are number four out of these four carriers in terms of high band holdings in low band dish holds 24 megahertz of spectrum depth in mid band dish holds 91 megahertz of spectrum depth and in a high band dish holds over 1 100 megahertz of spectrum depth so from these numbers we can see that verizon holds the most high band spectrum att holds the most low band spectrum albeit t-mobile is about the same and t-mobile holds the most mid-band spectrum by a significant lead but what do all these numbers mean in terms of takeaways for the carriers so i'll highlight a few implications for each of the carriers based on their spectrum holdings for you now so verizon has the strongest position in high band spectrum but it is worth noting that highband spectrum is not readily used today as it is still a nascent technology that will develop further over the next five to ten years remember as we talked about that it does not have good propagation characteristics meaning it does not travel very far to the user's phone on the flip side verizon has the weakest spectrum holdings of the combined low and mid band spectrum which is collectively known as sub 6 gigahertz spectrum as compared to both at t and t mobile however verizon will be buying significantly more mid band spectrum specifically c-band spectrum in the c-band auction which is taking place right now in december 2020. moving to at t at t has the weakest spectrum holdings overall as compared to verizon and t-mobile additionally because verizon will have more mid-band spectrum than at t following the c-band spectrum auction it puts even more pressure on at t and further att currently has the lowest amount of high band spectrum holdings as compared to both verizon and t-mobile finally at t as a company has a significant amount of debt and other declining business lines such as video services through directv which makes it difficult for them to even buy more spectrum licenses in the future moving to t-mobile they have the strongest spectrum holdings overall as compared to all us carriers t-mobile has the second highest amount of low-band spectrum which is basically the same number as a t and is far and away the leader in mid band spectrum with 256 megahertz of spectrum depth which is approximately three times the holdings of both verizon and att indeed t-mobile also has the second highest amount of high band spectrum overall t-mobile has a well-rounded spectrum portfolio fitting that layer cake that we spoke about earlier finally moving to dish network at face value dish may seem to have low spectrum holdings compared to verizon at t and t-mobile however the company is in a strong position relative to its 5g network built firstly dish owns boost mobile which has a subscriber base of only 9 million which is less than 10 percent of the subscriber base of the big three carriers specifically this compares to verizon at 120 million subscribers at t at 94 million subscribers and t-mobile at 100 million subscribers therefore dish is in a strong position on a spectrum per subscriber basis secondly dish intends to build a real 5g network which will be powered by 50 000 tower sites dish estimates that it will cost 10 billion dollars to build out its greenfield 5g wireless network thirdly dish has a 7-year mobile virtual network operator known as mvno agreement on the t-mobile network which allows dish's wireless customers to roam on t-mobile's network for the next seven years before dish even has to start using its large spectrum holdings so as it relates to learning more about the four major wireless carriers we talked about if you are serious about wanting to get detailed background about the 5g plans of verizon at t t-mobile and dish network then i would recommend checking out our ebook titled the geniuses of 5g we have linked to it in the description below and you can grab your copy at dgtl infra dot com shop this ebook gives you access to the ultimate behind the scenes look at the 5g industry specifically you will be able to unlock the most valuable stories secrets and case studies directly from 10 of the most successful 5g corporate executives and industry leaders including the current and former ceos of verizon at t t-mobile and dish network finally it would not be dgtl infra without talking about how this all ties into digital infrastructure recall that the four sectors of digital infrastructure include towers data centers fiber and the combination of small cells and distributed antenna systems generally speaking towers are used to broadcast the frequencies for low band and mid band spectrum in suburban and rural areas larger antennas will be placed higher up on towers to deploy this low and mid band spectrum typically the lower the spectrum band the larger the antennas will be on the tower additionally when antennas are brought from a high point to a low point it reduces the size of the coverage area which brings us to small cells so small cells are another piece of digital infrastructure which are used to broadcast the frequencies for high band spectrum small cells are located in dense urban areas where high band spectrum is applicable smaller antennas placed at lower heights are used to deploy high band or millimeter wave spectrum through these small cells these small cells are placed on city infrastructure like street lights utility pools and the sides of buildings so hopefully you found this video helpful if you did then please share it with somebody you think might also find it helpful and consider subscribing to dgtl

have a recent device like an iPhone 11 you might already be compatible hi I'm Chris from the mobile internet Resource Center here to share with you some news on the cellular front yesterday the FCC gave full authorization for the rollout of a new cellular band this is the 3.5 gigahertz band otherwise known as CBR s otherwise now known as on go so this a band also known as LTE band 48 this band has been in the works for six years to try and figure out how to bring this new cellular band out to market and that's because it's kind of complicated because this band actually has current users who are still using it namely the US government this is a band that has been used for military radars and for satellite communications and the military doesn't want to give up there are particular radars using this band so how are you gonna let people do cell cellular devices on this same frequency band without upsetting naval destroyers patrolling off the coast and the system that they've worked out and about 150 companies have spent six years working on this system is to have a way for the network to share and coordinate access to this frequency band so you'll have priority going to the incumbents so when the Navy is turns on their radars it'll send a signal up to a server that says nobody in this area can use this frequency band but well they're only using it a few times it's actually kind of a rare rare band for them to use so most of the time it's free and open so the next teardown will be licensed users so two or three different carriers will be able to buy priority access and they'll be able to expand their cell towers to support the second tier down kind of like how Cellular works existing existing studies it works on most regular bands and then the third tier of CBR s is actually public access open access unlicensed access so any compatible device as long as it's paying attention to if it's currently and used by one of the higher priority users will be able to use this sounds really confusing it's really complicated but the good thing is this all just happens behind the scenes and automatically so if you have a phone that is compatible with this and your carrier is using this frequency band it does all the negotiations behind the scenes and is basically saying hey do I have access to this express new express lane that is being built kind of cool it's a hundred and fifty megahertz of a new spectrum that will be being enabled by cvrs the cool thing is because this has been in the works for so long the LTE modem chipsets of most that many of them have already been updated to support this and the latest generation of devices like the Samsung Galaxy S tens or the iPhone 11 already have radios that are compatible with this band so once your carriers start rolling out service you might start getting extra coverage extra speed thanks to CBR s going online now now the other thing is well they're calling it on go that is just a marketing name a branding name to label devices that have been compatible and certified with this but it is just CBR s behind the scenes and it's kind of cool to see a new frequency band coming out for cellular and this is not just for LTE this will also be used for 5g and potentially for other innovative uses like private cellular networks so a lot of interesting stuff coming that's the news on CBR s these

here at the Brooklyn 5g summit showing off our brand new 28 gigahertz 5g new radio demonstration so we actually have a full over-the-air network running today on my left side here behind me we have our ni millimeter wave transceiver system which is a millimeter wave software-defined radio and we are running a full 5g in our compliant protocol stack on our software-defined radio so this is essentially a 5g handset running at 28 gigahertz over on my right side on the other side of the table we have a multi vendor standard compliant ji node B so we've partnered up with comm scope and Radice for this demo and we're using an Intel flex ran for our baseband processing a protocol stack from rad assist and a 28 gigahertz are are you from comm scope so we have multi vendor G node B and then it's talking to our ue on the other side this is really important because we're showing how different operators can be combined to make a compliant G node be like a lot of people are talking about with things like Oh ran right now and then on the other half of the system we're seeing that it's really important to be able to take those different pieces of the network and these commercial denote abuses and really evaluate that they're performing as expected so that's where the test UE comes in we're able to make an attach and actually do a full phone call with our base station but if that's not working we're able to provide information through a UI and through data logging to show more details about exactly how the link is performing and what might be going wrong or also provide information for doing optimization of the link itself so if you want to check out more information we just also launched a sub 6 gigahertz version of this product and fillable on our website so check

ride when that happens yes you are yes and it can take days for it to get out of your system I know many people have eaten marijuana edibles and then they call me up the next day like dude I'm still hot yeah yeah so so so I think I think the legalization community has sort of said for years like oh there's basically no downsides to this there's only upsides the cops will bus smokers they'll be tax revenue all these people have a way to get high that's clearly safer than alcohol and unfortunately that's just not true I think you're right and I think the the issue that people from what I've read are having with your book or people that are marijuana advocates that think that your position is unbalanced and that you've ignored the positive aspects of THC in terms of like what he was talking about cognitive benefits for people with psychotic episodes and that you were only focusing on the negative plead guilty today yeah because I think that for 20 years people have only heard the positive right eye I think that's I think that's also I'll plead guilty that myself because I think that I've only been discussing the positives and one of the things that I've tried very hard to do and one of the things I've learned how to do from doing this podcast and experiencing criticism and communicating with a bunch of different people with a lot of different viewpoints is examine my own positions and try to figure out am i coming at this from a truly balanced position or am i trying to support a conclusion that I started out with and I'm trying to you know somehow or another back up my own work or back up my own just my own statements and and and sort of prop them up instead of being really honest and objective right it's very difficult to do listen I wrote a book called tell your children that yeah about marijuana mental illness and violence you're I don't think you can you can think that that book is gonna be a compendium of the pros and cons above if you want to tell your children the truth though you really do want to tell them the pros and cons right and you did indicate Alex you said you know we should tell people the truth yeah in the book right so you know I think that when you're telling and you're saying that that you're telling the truth and Alex I'm agreeing with you that you're telling part of the truth right but part of the truth is you know a little bit deceiving and deceptive it in some ways right you want to tell the whole truth when you tell the whole truth then you give the whole story and then people can actually make you know a good informed decision based upon that like if people are going to just read one part of the story then of course they're going to make a decision just based upon that one part they're not going to make you know an informed decision based upon all of the price and because of that people are going to make you know some very poor choices I completely agree with that but to me the last 20 years have been an exercise in the other side in the legalization side doing a very very good job talking up its arguments and essentially there's there's almost nobody on the other side there's this one I bet what's got Jeff Sessions you had the [ __ ] goddamn attorney general that's telling people that good people don't smoke marijuana that's literally a quote yeah God that little morons not an office anymore but that's that's a terrible thing to say people don't smoke marijuana there's a lot of wonderful people who smoke - is not true and and and by the way I think this is a personal choice okay especially for adults yeah okay and and you can make bad personal choices you go look I play cards I'd love to play poker I'm said that on this trip to LA I didn't get to go to a poker room but you can go a new casino and you can see people of Los Angeles but you can go to a casino and see people who've lost their houses it doesn't mean that gambling should be illegal it also means that there's less and more dangerous forms that device in your hand where you can bet on what the next pitch is gonna be gonna be a ball or a strike yeah that's more dangerous than my having to drive to the commerce and play there and one hundred percent or 98 percent THC that an 18 year old vapes is a lot more dangerous than a 5 percent you know CBD 15 percent THC product the doctor heart might suggest his patient uses once a night to go to sleep but that that's the message that you know we should be putting out there right we shouldn't just be you know focusing on one side of the story like that part you know should also be you know and in the book and like you know your book you know in some ways has made me rethink the way that I write you know because my first book was co-authored with Jeremy cost and called friendly fire you know my second book that I'm writing now is called cannabis for PT G so it's how to transform post-traumatic stress into post-traumatic growth right because I feel that and you know we all know examples of people that have you encountered really difficult obstacles in their life and some people have you know succumb to that stress and they've gone down you know the wrong path kind of thing and then other people have used that stress to their advantage and they've actually become you know better because of it and you know CBD and THC can both help facilitate that process you know when you're looking at someone like like a veteran for example you know the hallmark of someone with PTSD is someone who doesn't leave their home and they can't sleep at night so like when I see a debt in my office a lot of the times they'll be leaving their home like five to ten days a month right so when you give them CBD and this is really important for people understand CBD has been shown to decrease learned fear that's incredible right so if you can get people outside of their home because I'm not talking about again you know someone who's you know too nervous to like go to a you know at the bar with like the friends or some like that I'm talking to people who like you know it's difficult for them to go to the grocery store just like pick up a few things so you know those are the type of people that I see in my practice with CBD is really excellent for that then when you look at you know the the nighttime component you know THC again is excellent for reducing nightmares that's been shown in studies and it was even shown with one pharmaceutical drug now blown again I don't really use now blown very much because it's only one cannabinoid and I do believe in the entourage effect and using all of the cannabinoids so I don't use that that much but that shows that she she can reduce nightmares and you know if you have you have you have PTSD I mean if you talk to someone who has PTSD and again this is this comes from a clinician support of you they will tell you I will try anything and that's the same way when you get with like you know the parents of kids who have see shoes all day nobody wants to see that yeah and like Alex you know if your kids you know ever started getting getting seizures which you know I hope I hope they don't because it's it's terrible you know what it can do to people but your when if that ever happened you know I would hope that you would consider you know CBD as a potential treatment I think she's not against that I think we have to be really clear as tension like CBD you know again CBD at all I don't know I don't think anybody is I think no one really is arguing except maybe the federal government in certain levels is arguing against CBD that's probably some pushback from the pharmaceutical industry the reality is CBD has proven to be at least as far as I've read very safe and very effective for a bunch of different disorders especially those that are about reducing and have it something do with inflammation or seizures yeah one of my good friends his son has developed seizures and CBD knocked it out just killed it this is very recently you know you're somebody who's you know who's a cannabis user you obviously know a lot of users why do you think it is that people you know in legal states where they can really express a preference they can go into a dispensary know exactly what they're buying why is it that they want such high potency THC product because they get used to it your tolerance develops it builds up you know every year we do this thing called sober October well we don't do any no drinking no no pot and then we do some sort of crazy challenge me and three of my buddies and when we do it what it's it's very interesting how your tolerance is radically reduced like I'll smoke pot at the end of that month and I'm like holy [ __ ] like I don't even know what I'm talking about in the mid-sentence and I'm just bullets creaked whereas you know now like I smoked a little weed last night did some stand-up had a great old time there's no issues with it at all but I'm used to it and if the weed that I smoked last I assume you don't smoke right I do not okay if you and me were together last night and I gave you a hit of my joint you'd be still there in the corner in the fetal position gone what and the [ __ ] is going on because the marijuana is ridiculously powerful but once you're accustomed to it once your body acclimates it's really not that big of a deal the problem is you you're dealing with a lot of habitual daily users and for those people like my friend Joey Diaz there's a video of him giving this other comedian how many milligrams of those stars of death Oh Tilly like when we give Owen what did he give oh I think just one he ruined his life and about 200 to 250 oh I made a video but the day changed Owens life like literally [ __ ] the guy's head up like he went outside he vanished he's gone yeah well I think I think there's a real argument to be made it's particularly with him well I was gonna make two points on that so you definitely can develop a tolerance yeah and I tell people all the time trying to take at least one three-week break but the evidence does show that if you stop for four weeks generally all your receptors return and it'll be like you've never used cannabis before yeah and that's even with people who are really really heavy users I can go back and get the study but I mean these people are you using I'm pretty sure it was like close like seven joints a day well really heavy users and noop dogs a good example of that you know my friend Tony Hinchcliffe his good buddies with Snoop Dogg and he said Snoop Dogg just smokes all day and he just like is always high and you know you're like well what do you do when you're not high he's like what I'm never not high so everything he does he is high as [ __ ] everything he does look for that guy it's not that big of a deal and for the way he lives his life like he's just a relaxed easygoing guy it's no problem you could be high all day and live his life and he's obviously wildly successful with this strategy yeah loudly second point I was gonna I was gonna make on that too though was there does not appear to be any tolerance at the cb2 receptor so she she attaches to the cb1 receptor and that's and that's where we know we can get tolerance you know some people you know they they have some pain they use some THC and sometimes they need a little bit more same sometimes asleep you know they use THC it'll work and then we'll stop working with CBD - we haven't seen that meaning like the people who you know get get seizure control generally they don't need to increase of dose like the girl I was talking about earlier you know I first subscriber I think when she was 20 and she was by him 20 she's 25 now she's never increased her dose and she's just used the same amount to CBD for the last think we should really stop talking about CBD I just wanted to make a note on the on the Italian someone I just want to make a note that CB to the doesn't appear to be tolerance it's all yeah it's just there's just such a significant impact when when it comes to especially edible THC it's a there's a significant impact on people's state of mind and it's not always good no that's just a fact we", "amJbbPl3IbI": "in the final years of the 19th century engineers inventors and entrepreneurs began to discover the wonders and the promise of the electromagnetic wave it allowed for the seemingly miraculous transmission of sound over the air an era we now refer to as zero-g more than a century later the world is on the verge of the fifth generation of wireless technology so what is 5g how does it work and how will it make your life better the first generation of commercial wireless technology debuted in Japan in 1979 before reaching Europe in the u.s. in the early 1980s every decade or so since there's been a new generation of wireless technology that's meant new guidelines tower upgrades chip advancements and software developments and handset improvements all with the promise of a faster better way to send and receive communication 5g will be exponentially faster than what's currently available between ten and a hundred times faster in 1947 engineers at Bell Labs set out to fix a problem that eventually evolved into modern cellular networks LAN was divided into hexagonal cells each with its own short-range radio tower by the 1990s these cellular towers were popping up across the country in preparation for 5g carriers are now dividing up land into much smaller cells and rigging them with busters of tiny antennas to essentially beam a signal in a straight shot to each and every device many of these assemblages will be as small as a shoebox and fitted on building rooftops telephone poles and other existing structures in more conspicuous places than ever before they transmit super high frequency waves that can carry more data faster but only travel short distances with no physical obstacles so what does it mean for you and me first incredible speed we're downloading and streaming is more or less instantaneous autonomous cars could exchange real-time traffic alerts and communicate with stoplights power grids would be able to receive information from buildings and street lights to better apportion electricity appliances could communicate with utility companies to save on monthly bills and surveillance cameras will be able to stream directly to home security companies vast connections could revolutionize health care through telehealth video services ambulances will transmit real-time information on patients vital signs so hospitals can prepare for their arrival the differences between traditional TV and streaming will be my new offending the broadcasting business that first utilized that revolutionary electromagnetic wave all those years ago so will five do you live up to the hype the inventors engineers and entrepreneurs of today are betting billions that it will [Music]", "ZmxjMmDGnrU": "but before I'd start I just want to indulge myself with a bit of all a patient so I'm going to ask of hands but don't worry it's all about bricks it it's it's actually about a particular thesis of mine so my question to you is how many people in the audience play a musical instrument okay that's about 25 optimistically 25 percent and how many play a musical instrument in a band and do concerts on a regular basis to you and me I'll see you afterwards okay when I worked at Phil it's about a million years ago with Liam who's around somewhere still about 50% of the other group were musical of some kind so it's kind of interesting to see the difference today okay nothing to do with millimeter azor or whatever but interesting nonetheless so who is blue Wireless I'll start with that first so we've been around about 10 years were based in Bristol we actually started out as a as a digital modem company to develop gigabit rate modems for millimeter-wave applications so the core team we have about 30 silicon engineers in the team are focused on developing incredibly complicated baseband modem technology based on our own proprietary processor architecture but along the way we figured out the best way of selling it at the best price was actually build products I'm not just to build chips so we actually work with millimeter wave of RF partners to integrate with our modem and then develop cutting-edge products for for various applications like transportation which Helen mentioned at the outset sorts of few examples here so here's here's a 28 nanometer chip we heard about 20 nanometer before but this is a digital chip this is around 800 million transistors 17 individual processors six proprietary hybrid hardware software parallel engines of our own design and 23.5 gigas ample adda converters that's Giga sample adda converters so this thing can process to 2 gigahertz channels and generate a data stream of about 6 Giga bps from one piece of silicon which consumes about 2.5 watts so and it was right first time which was a big surprise to our customer who was there clearly not expecting that anyway as well as I'm building the chip we then put that into various products with millimeter-wave and we actually have two ongoing application projects the first one is fixed wireless access and this is in the city of Liverpool where we're part of a UK 5g testbed funded by the DCMS the UK government and we have a network of around 100 millimeter wave nose on lamp posts around the borough Kennington Kensington rather attached to the Lupul Hospital the the other project is a 5g testbed at Millbrook this is nominal but this is actually on the top gear test track at Dunsfold this is a McLaren sports car we work with McLaren on on various aspects of this so they wanted to know how fast millimeter-wave would go and they didn't believe us when we said it will go it will work rather at you know many hundreds of kilometres now so they they got this guy out of the garage and that I think we need to 80kmph was that down the down the runway before they got apply the brakes and no problem with our with our system and the in the final project is this one this is guess what it's a train case you didn't know this is actually one of the new cross rail trains on the kunas was lying when they finally open it this is on test at the Network Rail riddick test facility and melted mulberry and we've piggybacked on millimeter-wave on the track side there's a couple of our notes here on the roof of the train and we went up and down the line for three months or so characterizing the performance of millinery to aid in a training environment and this was a preamble to a commercial project that we started earlier this year with the first group company first group is the UK's largest train company they run the southwest line they were on the Great Western line and now they've just won the West Coast franchise as well from London to Glasgow so we're putting millimeter-wave on trains for Southwest line to start with and that will improve the the on train Wi-Fi cover which I'm sure everybody would agree if you tried it it's pretty rubbish at the moment so that's that's a leading application for us as we go forward so I mention these two projects auto air is the Millbrook testbed and the other one is Liverpool 5g they're two out of the six projects and coincidentally DCMS think these are the two best projects and of course I would say that wouldn't I remembers the Wi-Fi lines you k 5g IC which is the organization at the University of Surrey and we're also involved with a Facebook tip project and next week in Amsterdam there's the Facebook tip summit so we'll be there demonstrating our stuff and of course we need we'd to spend lots of other people's money to do all this stuff so we've got arm and calculus and many others in our investment investment pool most of our customers are either stateside or Japan and in fact first group is arguably the the first odden upon UK customer that we actually have alright so let's talk about spectrum and this is this is my Mickey Mouse guy to the millimeter wave spectrum we've heard about 28 gigahertz so far today where there's a lot of licensed activity some people might know that Verizon spent three billion dollars in the United States buying 50 percent of the u.s. spectrum at 28 gigahertz lotta money for fresh air and 39 gigahertz is another license frequency the US side I think in Europe extends down somewhat low land out into 26 and below the one that's interesting to us is unlicensed millimeter wave we like unlicensed and sort of our customers because it cost nothing and there's no better number than zero as far as the customer is concerned when he talks about a cost and recently the cpt changed the rules to be more in line with the u.s. FCC rules for operation between 57 to 71 gigahertz so that's 14 gigahertz of free bang weeds with 10 watts of the IRP you can do a hell of a lot with that from the point of view of a of a radio engineering product company and this is being adopted through so European law through directive 30 45 from the first of January 2020 and I have to thank Ofcom off the chair of that committee at CPT and and they were very instrumental in in helping push that forward and this allows well I've said here six by two gigahertz you've got 14 gigahertz deployers so you can move it anywhere you want to cross that band with that 40 DB MI and in fact the cpt rules light to go to 55 on the proviso you've got 30 DB I of game so you can go even higher than that if you have a high gain antenna okay here's my beamforming slide lots of people have been forming slides this morning so here's mine so on the transmit side you start with a with a single input you split it anyways you phase shift it to steer the beam you perhaps attenuate it to put some attenuation profile across the aperture then a vamp 'la fire per per chain as mentioned generating parent millimeter wave is challenging for mr. McKinnon to perspective typically around Tim only what's plus or minus a bit is is the KPI for that and then you put that into an array antenna and then you've got this coherent so wavefront and you steer that across the the face of the face of the array and you reverse the process in the receive side in this case you've got long as amplifies feeding receive chain you combine it then you then you down convert it to two baseband and then we do our meld m-magic to generate the gigabit data stream so on the power budget sign on th you get an N square gain and being the number of elements you get coherent addition form the P age and here an additional omni antenna elements on the receive side you only win once because noise goes up as well as power as it goes up by n power goes up by N squared you get an end gain on the receive side so 20 log on TX + 10 log on rx the other interesting point to to make is that for constant aperture gain goes up by a factor of s squared with frequency so of course 57 to 71 you get 1.9 DBS for free if you set your aperture for 57 so that's interesting from a link budget perspective so one of our partners is a Swedish company severs ima many of you have heard of them they've been around since the 1950s with various microwave components these days they're making a our FS or C's this particularly device they call EDA it's a ciggy by CMOS single chip memory to wave device which integrates 16 receivers 16 transmitters beamforming networks with around 5 bits of a face yes and amplitude control into an IQ up and down conversion this is a direct conversion architecture choose across fifty seven to seventy one gigahertz excellent phase noise we can do 64 gram or even better from the face not in seeking to deliver and when we combine that with this this simple phased array antenna where we've got 16 columns for TX and 16 for rx each is a four-element patch combined to a passive array we get about 23 DB i from that guy put it together we can exceed the the limit of 40 DB MI and get up to 40 3 DB MI and the scolson beams in action these are the six channels which are defined by the 11 ad spec that we generally use in most of the stuff we've been doing we can work around these channels but anyway these are the 6-2 gigahertz channels and you can see the 40 DB ml eyes here and then the beam is steered plus or minus 45 degrees a bit more than azimuth and there's around 64 beams across that aperture each beam is about 8 degrees in in being with so we get multiple beans per being with so we got a pretty good Clause all that so it's a very useful very powerful powerful radio and in the protocol what we do is we used a beam book to actually do a scan so we acquire the TX and rx beams dynamically as the TX is looking for the RX or vice versa so it's a beam book based approach if it's pretty common in most of the phased array solutions you hear about in the marketplace including 5g new radio from this we GPP okay so so what so the on the baseband side what's what's the big deal what's the problem well the problem is we've got a 3.5 gigahertz sample front end throwing this deluge of data at this modem it's going to turn that into useful packets and bits that can be connected to to an internet connection or whatever so unlike most wireless where the sample speed is much lower than the clock speed of the of the processor the opposite is true here so so we need a lot of parallelism to keep up with this 3.5 gigahertz front end in fact we need about ATX parallelism to cut with an S or C clock speed on my 28 nanometer chip of about 500 megahertz so we've designed a a parallel processor DSP engine that can do that and can do that with software-defined capability so we can fiddle around with Equalization we can fiddle around with modulation to your modulation and do a lot more tricks besides so there's a whole menu of items that we have to process in real time in the nanosecond time frame and then successfully capture decode demodulate and present those packets to the Mac layer then the Mac layer has to keep up with around a million or more packets per second encryption decryption point to multi-point control beamforming control and synchronization for example for a small cell a lot going on very quickly and all that requires around the terror of DSP you want to do that without burning a hole on the planet with a whole array of FPGAs as you see in most LTE base stations which seem to be more about boiling water than generating bits but nonetheless without without putting onto an SOC we'd have the same problem so here we've got effectively two terawatts you have two modems on one chip within within a 2.5 watt envelope so this is an our Hydra one technology which is 11 ad with extensions for infrastructure outdoor applications each physical layer can go up to 7.5 Giga bps with 64 cram we've got a bunch of stuff in there to cope with co-channel interference RF phase noise mitigation and a long list besides of all the different things we're working on the next gen which is 11a why that takes it up to 34 gigabit so that includes channel bonding time radiation and MIMO there is some ability to do meanwhat millimeter wave by using some reflections but that's that's coming soon so so we designed the architecture we spent a lot of time with our 30 or so silicon engineers we turn it into this lump of 28 nanometer we then put it into metal boxes we faced away in 10 GPS in case somebody Nix it to where it's gone so that's an important function so base by Miriam that so the other thing we do is we like to we like to license our technology to companies who are much bigger than we are so IDT which is now part of an SS took a license from our technology and we did a turnkey chip design for them so this device is actually available for purchase from IDT it's been in mass production since last year I can say two modems IQ in an ounce physical layer Mac layer we combine the two streams we put it through PCI Express and connect that to a network processor for the applications radio wise we started with psybeam soybean was a famous company very much a pioneering millimeter wave on CMOS and then we've moved to the civilly my device which I've already described and we don't see work with Nokia Bell Labs on their 90 gigahertz radio and for those Radiohead's in the audience if you want to look at that chip it's a fantastic piece of work there's a J SSC paper which was published in August of last year which describes that ship it's worth a read on its own so yeah okay on the rest have already said I think of course it's heavily software-defined so we've got a very sophisticated Linux framework and a driver that talks to the chip and sets it up with all these various modes then we put it in the metal box we call it metal box typhoon and we support all the features and we we have a an API which allows our customers to go in there and play and every time I present list the customers renters they usually come away with a purchase order so that it's a it's a very interesting box for for many reasons and one of the key KPIs is that this entire box only takes 40 Watts 40 watts for a box that can do three gigabits that's extremely powerful tat these at these face and by the way of that 40 Watts 30 watts is the Linux computer they rarely on the mo denry's less than 10 watts all right so the other thing is what is the data rate and isn't 60 gigahertz a waste of time because of oxygen absorption well okay it is if you if you look at the plot of DB per kilometer versus frequency you see this famous peak which is 60 gigahertz for option absorption somewhere around 15 even to 20 DB per kilometer but as soon as you get was 65 virtually nothing so you into into very low loss there so one of the first things we did was to go find the long stretch of beach and do some measurements earlier this year with the new civil radio integration and you can see on the left-hand side channel 2 which is down at 60 gigahertz you got the 15 DB per kilometer overhead we're getting about 300 meters at 2 Giga bps as we go out to channel number 6 which is right at the other end of the bands around 69 gigahertz you can see that that range is effectively doubled and since then we've improved the performance of the front end with various various methods and went out over a kilometer at the other top ends of the band so millimeter way B's not short range we can we can shoot Giga Hertz Giga bits over half a kilometer or more okay until the mill block thing which is what was exciting Helen at the outset so so this is the high speed test track at Millbrook this about 30 miles from here this is a two mile circumference four-lane highway which is a banked highway it was built by General Motors in the 1970s for testing Vauxhall motor cars and trucks but it's now privately held facility and this is a consortium of companies working on this all to wear 5g testbed DCMS funded project and our our piece of the project is to deliver this millimeter-wave testbed so we've got a network of 11 towers around the circumference of this of this bowl each tower has a red you're looking backwards and forwards then what we do is we put a a dual radio on top of the vehicle we call it a TN it's called a train nailed for reasons that come apparent later then we look up and down the track and as the as the car goes around the track it makes some brakes association with each of the towers to generate a continuous connection all the way around and then all the towers are fiber optic connectors together at layer 2 so a switch into into a gateway then off to the internet so so it's a very convenient way of tracking data and we can sit in Bristol and control this thing I'm on to the data in real-time as the car whizzes around the track phase 1 we started at 60 gigahertz with the aforementioned cyber radio and that was a bit limited in performance but we've doubled that now with the new 5771 gigahertz radio and it's really really looking extremely exciting in terms of performance at given these nice photographs this is the typhoon silver silver box that the radio is behind the under plate here there's a GPS I don't think is any favorite being peaceful anyway it's there and we've got you can see the four-lane highway the bank is such that you can do 130 miles an hour of the the top end of the of the bank and sometimes faster than that if you've got the right car one in the middle is the car mounted unit in fact this is a prototype for the for the Train mounted unit I'll show you later ready your friends come back again and that's a side view of course then of course you need some cars to make this or hang together so he's been photographed some some some customer meetings that we had at Millbrook to show people were careful bility so this is a mclaren 570s this is a Honda Civic R in fact this is the first on the Civic R built at Swindon so it's an extremely fast piece of equipment arguably almost as fast as the McLaren and then this is a high car Mercedes much more space inside of Mercedes so we can take customers around in comfort so there's EV the three three cars used and again you can see the the tier mounted on the roof inside the car is the is the Linux processor which happens to be armed based so then some results the other thing I mentioned was McLaren so if you watch Formula One you'll see all the squiggly lines that are on the curves as the cars go around the track that's generated by a tool they call Atlas we have Atlas embedded inside our system as well and what we do is we record all the key kpi's from the modem we export that to the server and then we can display that in real-time to see what's going on with the modem and the system so here we're showing the modulation coding scheme the higher the better so typically 0 to 12 12 is 16 km 0 is 27 megabits 16 km is around probably of its physical layer 3 Giga bits at the other data layer and we shall signal-to-noise this is amazing we're seeing synchronized in the region of 2018 DBS normally was scrabbling around in the 5 6 7 8 DB region and so it shows that these radios or where they are much more powerful than previous generation and then finally we have sweet pot we have friends on back radios and we also overlay with speed 13171 90k mph this staircase is association for each of the 11 towers so that's basically one lap around around Millbrook so so the so the net of all this is that we see at 1.6 Gbps average speed and a 3.1 gigabit peak and what's really interesting is the latency the latency is unbelievable not 0.72 not point nine milliseconds and that's through a gateway which is a McLaren product on the car and the on the track side and over there millimeter-wave the 5g guys the 5 g new radio guys I should say are talking about two milliseconds as the magic number and they're struggling to meet that we're already less than half that with with this solution we haven't even bothered optimizing it yet so this is extremely low latency system and as a comparison we also have a private 4G stock 5g network I should say at sir Millbrook which is also part of the same ole to air project typically they see 40 to 60 milliseconds latency and peaking around 300 when they have to do some difficult handover so this is extremely low latency system and that in itself is an interesting consideration for applications okay so picture of a train okay so Japanese train Japan is interesting country for this but I think it's also interesting in the UK and working here with first group as our as our partner we're going to market with first group and using they're using their contacts to generate business with various train companies around the world the first question is why bother well the reason - why bother is twofold number one what they do at the moment is they they take LTE off the roof of the train through 4 Sims they aggregate that and feed that through the Wi-Fi access points in the Train problem is that the LTE coverage along train tracks is not great and also the the moving village of passes change anyway it's a super chunk of demand which is really difficult to manage as as the train crosses through cell boundaries so it's a difficult sell your problem anyway and the second why bother is the cost the average cost of wholesale data is around $3 per gigabyte and if you do that some assuming at each train is consuming about a gigabit of traffic it's an enormous amount of money and therefore if a train company wants to support that kind of demand the economics show you that it's much more much more economic to deploy your own dedicated trackside network than it is to keep buying the data from the operators so that's another very important consideration and where is this demand coming from well if you if you go to Ofcom's website they did a report last year to the UK government on estimating the demand and they came up with demand curves which were at least a gigabit and going north of that as trains go into ever a higher capacity donc Siobhan did the same thing in Germany and they came up with pretty much the same numbers so the demand is there and the economics point to a different solution other than just using 4G or even 5g5 GNR at six you get about three gigahertz I should say will give you about 200 megabits and what dr. bond said was if you point to the inside capacity of the German five GNR network at the trains you only service 30% of their demand so clear that's not going to happen but that's not that's a limiting case okay so what we're doing is we're putting trackside towers roughly every kilometer if we have a straight line and we putting radios front and back of the Train each radio is a dual radio and that's on a 200 meter length can be anywhere in some longer trains there's an untrained backbone an Ethernet backbone which we use to aggregate the data and feed that's through Wi-Fi access points in the carriages and then the the trackside network has a dedicated 10 gigabit layer 2 network which then connects through a lathe we switch onto the external internet and here you see a couple of the couple of photographs this is the the TN unit which sits on the roof at the front and back most expensive component in the entire product is that chunk of aluminium which is there to short-circuit the overhead line when it falls on top of the Train welding short-circuit the passengers inside the Train that's a pretty important safety consideration for the for the system and the guy over here is the trackside unit these are mounted on the poles they have two radios looking up and down the track and the rest of electronics is the modem and the and the network processor to control the controller system so we're in the in the midst of developing these products they go on through radio type approval now we'll be deploying them in q1 of next year on Southwest Rail here some more Hardy snaps this these were from the Network Rail riddick trial from last from last year you can see the the TN unit here it's mounted on a riser to clear the HVAC unit which is the front of the train there it is again and then there's some shots of what's happening on track sign here's a couple of units mouth on the overhead lines tension there's 25,000 what cables here and there's a dedicated town that we that we designed and put up another point in the in the network one more point to add the system also can switch between existing Wi-Fi and 4G services using Yangcheng aggregation unit because the the train company isn't going to put this everywhere it's going to put it where the demand is at least to start with so the system has to switch backwards and forwards between the existing 4G based system and the millimeter wave system and this is a map of the Southwest rail network in the middle of doing some proving trials on the Isle of Wight at the moment and the deployment will be between just south of Clapham Junction all the way down to Basingstoke that's about 70 kilometers and we're going to put that around 200 trains that go up and down that line as the first step and that that meets the that meets the criteria set by Southwest well in their franchise agreement with the UK government okay so so that's that's the end so some takeaways so phased array radios at 5771 gigahertz are here today they're commercial elements you can buy them from because from partners such as citizenry in our case your work extremely well they deliver carrier grade performing by combining that with some of the features on modem we can really deliver some very interesting infrastructure style applications we can meet and exceed the 5g KPIs are set by the ITU at the beginning of the FRG story more than a gigabit unless in millisecond latency for the world and rail applications we're talking to Road application companies as well particularly in Japan who really are interested using this this band for for Vito X applications the 5g testbed at Millbrook was already validated many of the kept yards I'll be talking about in this presentation and we're deploying this commercially starting in the UK from for the begin of next year ok thank you very much and there's a picture of a train [Applause]", "nV5Fzm1Z1k8": "smoke haze to the cheese smoke cheese to the couch smoke cushions [Music] [Music] yes sir we want to burn one bee [Music] good okay so take the material the trimming flower and then ever clear and put it in the freezer to get both nice and cold place them in there overnight now i poured the liquor over top of the alcohol my dumb ass forgot to record it but i basically pressed all the flour and trimmed down uh about halfway in the jar and then i just just enough ever clear to pour over top of the liquid and i just constantly shook it for 20 minutes taking breaks every so often but that'll get you where you want to be then you want to strain it so i took a strainer funnel and a coffee filter and basically strain the liquid through now at this point this is kind of the tincture part the uh what green dragon or hot bath method where you cook it in a double boiler you see i got quite a bit from this one i think overall i got about 18 20 ounces or so and uh poured that into the pan yeah cook that for 30 minutes uh now here's my pot i feel this about 60 of the way full just let it get to a nice low boil [Music] now it's the double boiler part now i wanted to show you this this is what the tincture part looked like uh it's very liquidy now for the green dragon tincture you basically cook this down for about 30 minutes i went a little bit further trying to make the rick simpson oil the rso and uh cook this for about i'd say about two and a half hours or so just trying to show the uh progression of this a little bit on the inside you want it to bubble but you don't want to do out of control you want to keep the heat relatively easy okay that's my next addition of the tincture was still draining yeah that's the remaining bit of the tincture that strained out once i switched jars now here here i want to show you a little bit of bubbling you want it to bubble with you don't want it to get aggressive don't want to destroy the thc or the little terrapins that are left in there i guess that's the point of the double boiler now you see this is kind of thickening up a little bit but still very very liquidy this is probably about the 45 minute mark or so yeah this is about the time you're supposed to watch it they say about the last 10 minutes it's a real quick conversion from uh liquid to the actual oil okay you can still see it bubbling going away the whole [ __ ] kitchen smells like uh corn corn liquor uh from cooking this off with the everclear oh my goodness it stay for about a day or two so yeah i just wanted to kind of go in the little bubbles on the ridges this is a nice little boil going and then i turned my back and boom ashore holy [ __ ] get that [ __ ] up it turned on me it got real thick real quick that's my little capsule i wanted to scoot everything it's just a lip balm uh holder i think carmex maybe you excluded all that in there then yeah it kind of got messy once i got it trying to get all the remaining stuff just wanted to see the thickness and consistency of it now at this point they say put it in the oven for about uh 10 to 20 minutes at 200 degrees to kind of get the last little bit of moisture out but because i put in this plastic my dumb ass couldn't so i had to air dry it out for about two days and uh yeah now this is about 30 minutes after i put it in there you can see a lot of the bubbles rising to the top trying to get out of there thickening up so at this point it's ready to be dabbed ingested the oil is ready so like i like to put it on blunt right now smoke a little bit eat a little bit thanks for watching i'll let you go out to the smoking and the bubbles of the hash oil burning away enjoy fellow cannabis", "ednzdxlGUSY": "Hi I\u2019m Fereshteh. Evaluations of the over-the-air performance\nof wireless devices for frequencies up to 6 GHz are well standardized and can be performed\nby a large number of laboratories. In addition, mmWave test systems are currently\nbeing developed by test equipment manufacturers for testing 5G NR FR2 enabled devices - and\nother systems operating above 6 GHz. In this video, we introduce the first set\nof phantoms and fixtures designed to be compatible with any mmWave chamber that provides a quiet\nzone of 30 cm or larger. This new mmWave phantoms set is the two-hand\ngrip phantom package \u2012 or in short called \u201cmmW-THG phantom package\u201d \u2012 for mobile\ndevices used in gaming or landscape mode operating  at frequencies above 6 GHz. The features are the following:\nThe hands are fully compliant with the CTIA target values for human hands for\nthe 3 \u2012 6 GHz frequency range. The hands also have a low-loss coating\nthat mimics the matching effects of the the dead layer of the skin - and extends the maximum\nfrequency to over 110 GHz without having an impact on the OTA performance below 10GHz. Second, the cut in the hand to position the\ndevice inside the hand was extended as requested by the CTIA Near-Field Phantom sub-working\ngroup to have more realistic contact areas between the hand and the phone. Third, the set is easily assembled: The hand phantoms are connected to the corresponding wrist with a click mechanism. The wrists are made of high-density foam to\nensure minimal reflection of electromagnetic radiation. And fourth, the hands with the wrists are\nthen mounted on the fixture. We have minimized the reflections by reducing\nthe amount of material used in the mounting fixture as much as possible. Once the phone is fixed between the phantom\nhands, the entire set can be mounted on the turntable. The OTA manual can be downloaded from our\nwebpage and provides detailed instructions on the assembly and alignment procedure. More phantoms compatible with the same fixture\nwill be introduced in the coming months. Thank you for watching this video", "pkMLk5amiQg": "all right what is good what is poppin it's wool I'm coming with you guys with another we're coming at you guys with another video this is gonna be a quick one this is just gonna be a quick little tutorial on how to make kids she capsules like pills basically um out of oil that you buy from your dispensary you can do this if you're using black market oil and stuff but it's a long process and you have to decode the loyal and make your own our tips Rick Simpson oil alone so basically you're going to go to your dispensary and or you know just a choir i've been sick lately but you need to apply or some RSO or are while this is activated activated oil there's it's a 1 gram syringe let me get it off for you guys so you can see what I'm talking about yeah it's a 1 gram syringe I'm down on my last dose of it I'm gonna get another one but I just wanted to show you guys before this one was gone just what's up with it and all the hype and everything so basically it comes in a 1 milliliter syringe obviously you can tell I'm getting down to the last of it and with these these are technically a thousand milligrams like there is a thousand milligrams it's one milliliter of fluid so it is a gram of oil but for the usable THC you have to pay more attention to the percentage of the THC on the package so when you are dosing this into your capsules and Oh for the capsules you can you you can buy you can buy empty capsules they're fairly inexpensive em in there they don't cost much at all for me I'm super super cheap so I go to Walgreens or Walmart or whatever I go to the like there herb kind of area well I go to the pharmacy section but then I go to like to all the herbs and the vitamins and all that stuff and I find whatever's on sale that's in cat form and I find stuff that's in caps I buy it for whatever I buy for like a dollar or whatever like this one I got a hundred caps for like I think there's like eighty nine cents on clearance or something so I got a hundred cats for the nine cents so I open the caps wash them out a little bit you're not gonna get sick or anything this stuff item its little vitamins like it's good for you so it's whatever but yeah that's just how you acquire cats or you can buy empty ones online it's just more expensive to buy empty for some reason I don't know why and that's your but I million of them but you don't need a million them because you're only gonna be dosing maybe once a day probably um if that like I use this stuff every every couple every couple days I would use it every day if I have a larger amount but it's kind of expensive so but going off on a tangent let's get back on topic so back to the dosing so when you are dosing these yes there is a gram of oil in this one milliliter syringe but when it comes down to the Tate's you have to look at the THC percentage because that's how much THC is gonna be in each point out of all ten points of the of the milliliter you know so it be point one point two point zero point oh point four point five you know all the way up to one so this one for instance this strain that I have it's just an indica blend so it's uh it's a mixture of multiple different indica strains it's a little bit of a cheaper buy because it's a mix of different strains but it's still a really good it's still really good like it's still top-notch stuff but yeah so this stuff the THC the total analysis is 85 point five percent so we'll just call that 85% to make it easier on ourselves so if it's 85% that means that point one milliliter in your syringe so that means that one of these lines if it'll focus a little bit yep so like say from point 6 to point 7 right there that'd be 85 milligrams of THC and what I have left is just about point 1 let's see how many are these scored into 1 2 3 so I have a point 1 5 so yeah I have a point 1 5 so if you did the math on that it would be like about let's see if it's 85 that'd be about a hundred and sixty yeah no no no it'd be 85 plus half of 85 so f 85 is forty two point five so 85 plus forty two point five would be a hundred and twenty two point five so I have a hundred and twenty two point five milligrams of THC left in here roughly like I can't be exact because I can't tell you the exact line and there's no way to be fully 100% exact with what you have because I mean there's still oil on the end of it too so that could easily be another another twenty milligrams right there I mean the if I pull it up will see if it if it pulls and and we can actually see how much we have okay so there once it gets to the bottom yeah we're more or more on the ballpark of almost a point two so that's where we're gonna go for we're gonna go it's about it's about a it's about a point one eight so we're looking at about 100 and 150 160 yeah 100 150 hundred yeah yeah about 100 45 milligrams I'd say just off the top of my head I'm not trying to do math and talk to you guys and make a video at the same time but I could have had this all written down everything and been prepared but I don't do that I just make videos I use an iPhone I get an idea or I get a new product or something if I like it I make a video about it and then hopefully the video is good enough and I don't sound like I'm like really stupid or I don't articulate my words correctly or my vocabulary or anything but yeah so let's get to making these capsules so basically the capsules when you when you pull them apart they just twist right apart if you need to empty em if you don't have done same concept is choice right apart and you'll have a longer part and so you think that longer part you'll take your RI so you'll take it right here and some of this stuff since I haven't used it in a few days it's gonna be a little thick right off the bat um but yeah I'm gonna use the rest of it so I can press as hard as I want um so yeah just kind of squirts right in there just like that it's really hard to press the last little and a little bit but the last big old glob there when the syringes are brand new they're a bit easier to work with this one's you know you're at the end of it so you're trying to squeeze out every last little bit you can get we got a little bit right there bee I don't know if you guys have ever heard of Rick Simpson oil but you should do some research Rick Simpson oil is what there is what they actually recommend to most people that use cannabis to help with cancer Rick Simpson oil is one of the most beneficial ways to medically take cannabis yeah Rick Simpson oil is is really good stuff I can talk too much about it because I really just don't know all every every little fact about it but I will be more research and talk about it in the future when I make more videos about RSO and stuff because that means Rick Simpson oil so I will learn more of our Rick Simpson oil and stuff but yeah today that was just a quick little video to bang out about how to make THC capsules or pills or whatever you want to say from from oil that you can just buy from your dispensary and this is by far much cheaper than buying edibles I love edibles I've got nothing against them at all I love I love them to death like I drink THC syrup all the time I eat chocolate gummies I ate everything but this stuff in comparison is gonna cost you about a twentieth of what edibles would cost you realistically I mean edibles they go are for medical and only no edibles go for around like 30 bucks on our milligrams so just putting that in perspective for you know you get a Rick Simpson oil syringe for you know 50 60 70 80 bucks depending on what you buy you know 200 milligrams compared to 800 to a thousand is pretty is a pretty big difference so but that's all I had for you guys today please hit that like button and subscribe I'm gonna be more active I'm trying to crank videos out every three days I just like don't know what like format to make them and I don't I'm just not experienced enough to do this thing I'm really I'm really trying to learn I'm watching I'm watching all kinds of vlogging and all kinds of stuff to learn more about how to get the right camera angles and how to talk in the videos and how to try to grab the audience's attention earlier you guys as a viewers attention just so I don't bore the hell out of you um so I'm still working on what like my thing is gonna be you know what I'm known for but I'm really hoping that this channel is gonna move forward because I'm nowhere near done with it I just started I'm ready to go I've been doing YouTube for years and years and years I used to do it for video games I've done it for multiple other things I've done it for clothes reselling shoe reselling blah blah blah like I just really like YouTube a lot and I've watched probably 15 hours a day YouTube so I figured might as well contribute to the community and try it out and especially if I have something unique like this there's not there's not a lot of illinois medical marijuana patients so for people that are interested in what in what illinois is producing because obviously we can't be bringing stuff across state lines to our dispensaries you know the black markets one thing you can ship [ __ ] all over the place but in the legal market like it's state legal not federally so that means that if I were to take if I were a dispensary owner and I were to take a pound of weed or if I were a grower and I were to take a pound of weed from Indiana to Illinois that's federal trafficking but we can grow and we can grow all of our own weed and everything obviously as well I have all this stuff that I have but yeah it's it's just something that I that I find interesting personally and I could never really find much on YouTube about Illinois's medical market and what they had really to offer I didn't know any of the brands any of the cultivators none of the dispensaries anything and now I'm up-to-date on most of it and I've learned a ton I love my dispensary I love my bud tenders I love everything about this whole about this whole movement I really hope it keeps going and the cannabis finally gets recognized as the as the medical I don't want to call it a drug but the the medical benefit and just the the magic that this plant has and what it has to offer us so yeah that's ramen in the video because I'll just keep going on stupid little rants like that that are going forever but I hope you guys have a blessed day it's cold out where I live I live in the Midwest it's real cold out nice and windy so bundle up if it's warm where you live you're lucky I'm jealous hope you guys have a great day it's been will or midwestern buds and I'm out I'll see you guys next time", "q67NBrG_kHM": "hi my name is Casey a topless I'm here with analog devices here at EDI con here at this booth we are showing our full millimeter wave 5g solution which you can see is a full signal chain in order to enable testing at the

second RF DAC and which then feeds to our ATM v10 13 10 14 which is a twenty four to forty four gigahertz up converter which then would feed into our ad RF 50 20 hundred megahertz and 30 gigahertz

have one right here which is an example it's the ADT our 8000 which is a 25 to 30 gigahertz TR module which contains a PA LNA and a switch to switch between those then on the receive side those same signals that you would output at this TR module would then be received and come back through the beam forming chip the ADR 1004 and fed back through the SPD T switch but then switched to our down conversion side of the of the solution here which is the ADM v10 14 which is the twenty four to forty four gigahertz down converter which then we're down convert the twenty four to forty four

patience it's me again medical Mary and I thought today since I have to go to the hospital later in the week that we can make a nice edible to take with me I've decided for this edible on using a Cresco RSO a nice sativa blend you know can't go wrong has some cbgc BC THC so what's next what do we do with it after trying lots of different ways to try to make different edibles and doing baking I really wanted to make some hard candies I don't want to get a candy thermometer I don't want to boil sugar and corn syrup so I found something about melting down Jolly Ranchers and then just pouring them into a mold and doesn't that kind of sound fantastic if it works hooey you already kind of know it works as I showed you so you want to see how we did it we just bought Samara so and I have a ton of Jolly Ranchers 22 and we're gonna try to make some melted down Jolly Ranchers and add the RSO and these levels this is gonna be real time-consuming taking them all apart separating them crushing them up and then hopefully make it easier to melt the fam well it's we're gonna use strawberry and pineapple watch this like now let's crush it up [Music] so we're probably going to double triple quadruple bag these ranchers before we smash it off with a hammer [Music] I don't have any three years of thanks are being so quiet she's terrible [Music] empty out we're emptying the contents of the crushed-up Jolly Ranchers into a pot and we're gonna put out on the stove yeah she looks all innocent this girl's been Barkin the whole time I'm gonna make sure some little butter in there just to give the heart so something to stick to so look a little sour - hey Zeus all this butter over here jacked up with candy on it just keep stirring just keep stirring [Music] it's kind of the consistency of like previously chewed bubblegum yeah accurate it looks like that too yeah it's five minutes away from giving in and becoming a liquid and you how long do you think we've been like stirring this on low oh my gosh at least 10 15 minutes okay not there yet it wasn't really doing much so we turn the heat up just a little bit it's like number two or three right in between there like a little past three but now it's really starting to melt down and I think we're almost ready to squeeze the RSO in there we have to heat up a tower so a little bit we're gonna fit the RSO in there for a couple minutes let it soften up so it doesn't break that click container so and we're gonna squeeze about half of this into that mixture if you could only smell this right now remember it was pink mmm no it's dank I'm gonna just pour it into the mold but it's to meet you hard to film that so I'll show you the aftermath here's the aftermath the pan came pretty clean only burned a couple fingers definitely a whole bunch of edibles I'm working on cheeping my own it's a little edible to be [Music] yeah I was just told that people don't keep confectioners sugar in the fridge comment below and know where do you keep it [Music] yellow like it was definitely worth making him this way but it seems like definitely a team effort yeah if I was alone I would have been really stressed out there's a audibles calculator online if you go to how to add a bowls calm and you type in the amount of product you use and the amount of THC that's in that product so you can use or so you can use distillates you can use your own can of butter and it tells you how much each of your edibles is when you divide it by the amount of edibles you make out of it so I'm not a math person it makes me real stress to even think about it the how-to edibles calculator is a lightsaber doing the math on our half gram of our so that we added and and we made oh I forget how many pieces but we had done the math the other day so the larger pieces that we made around 14 to 15 milligrams and the smaller heart pieces that we made were around 7 so I'm not mad at it I tried on the other day it was good it didn't last as long as people claim that their edibles last but if I get a couple hours of relief it's worth it for me and you know just keep eating them like you would a gummy bear so it's nice to have like a hard sucker so medical Mary approved", "YvvaUdh1VFg": "I just couldn't get up they had to call the ambulance because my blood was I wasn't paying attention to my school the color of this tool and you need to do that I know that now I thought it was a hernia I just thought well I could I can take care of this I probably woulda came in sooner if I would have known it was gonna be colon cancer and it was pretty bad I like to look at pictures and I wanted to see what were you're talking about that's scared I mean it's a huge operation entails cutting close to 70% of this gentleman's liver off in order to ha render him cancer-free and then rien estamos a basically put him back these pieces of bowel that love outside their body for me a lot surgery when it was done emerges me to save his life will give him a new chance of life and hopefully an extended life compared to what he would have met had he not had a operation I felt I felt it's really excitement of transplant was truly not a single cancer of this area that needs to leave the Central Valley and definitely the community medical service I think industry happen was essentially a wonderful example of that he had general surgery involved in acute care surgery but when he presented with an acute obstruction subsequently he was referred to the oncology it was about you in multi disagree fashion he had nurse navigators nutritionists dietitians genetics doctors I mean so on and so for every subspecialty together at some point need to see him GI to repeat colonoscopies you know essentially every subspecialty that would have to deal with the portion of his care was involved but everyone was in constant communication to allow a seamless progression through the care without delay and that's the key good job here all of them - that's everything but when I was here the first time I was here for nine days and I hugged everyone we're on and they're just they become family what impresses people when I talk to a motel fault they ask how I'm doing and I'm telling them coming on Thursday they can't believe cancer is the jackhammer to the head that reminds us all that we have leaders need to pay attention to your body if your body tells you it's time you need to go in somehow some way to get a physical or something because you can prevent a lot of this", "iqVg3YVx8l0": "well good afternoon everybody how are you guys doing today I'm doing fairly decent fairly decent I just wanted to do a video today because I'm gonna give you an update on my latest scan my latest CT scan about two months ago I started getting a lot of abdominal pain and I wasn't sure why I had this burning sensation and my gut and it was pretty really just relentless it went on a lot and it was especially bad at night and I remember there was a couple of nights when I actually went to bed with a hot water bottle against my stomach remember the old fashioned hot water bottles anyway went to bed with a hot water bottle across my stomach because it was so painful and then just after about a an hour or so just said screw it and got up and had about a half a banana and a couple of excedrin and that took care of it but I was starting to get kind of worried well did I also mention constipation I know TMI TMI but that was another problem I was really constipated and that gets to be very disconcerning because then the thoughts start going through your mind did the RSO really work has the cancer spread to my bowels has it spread to my liver you know these are all the things that go through your mind and you're just not sure so back to the internet I go for some further research and I was also trying to remember did I make any major changes in my diet and I remembered yeah I did I not major changes that I started incorporating dandelion root into my daily supplements now I drank the dandelion root tea no problems so I ordered some of the capsules and yet something else you know dandelion is really good for you and I remembered okay I remembered at that time that did the Aki berry hearing that it was so great for you and started taking Aki berry and it just tore my gut up so maybe the dandelion root was doing the same so I eliminated the dandelion root from my diet and lo and behold my stomach calmed way way down and as far as the constipation was going I started reading about everything that causes constipation and one thing that just really jumped out at me was cheese I thought you know I do a lot of cheese no no you know I'm not a brick a day or anything but since I'm not eating very much meat I do fill in with cheese so I thought okay let's see if we eliminate the cheese what happens so I eliminated the cheese and there that was the answer to that however I still thought you know it's been over a year since I've had a scan and maybe it's time to get that done because then I was just starting to wonder just okay I really need to know I need to know for sure what's going on inside of me so I not okay I'll get ahold the Native American Health and talk to my physician's assistant Christine Palazzo I talked to Christine miss Christine and she said you know she said I can order an MRI for you she said and I can order a scan for you but she didn't think that she felt qualified as qualified as say doctor bold in the oncology department at UC Davis as qualified as he would be to understand the scan and I said well you know I don't think I'm their patient anymore they did release me to go back to Native American Health and she thought she said no Linda she said you are still their patient and she said however if they refuse or or they put you off she said I will order the scan for you and she said and or an MRI and so that's on her advice I went ahead and I called dr. Boggs office and I talked to his secretary or I talked to the receptionist or the nurse or whoever she was and she said that she would ask him about the scan and get back to me and she did she got back to me and she said yes he definitely will do a scan he just needs to know where to send the order to so I said okay I will find a place down here to do the scan so I did I found Northridge imaging and got everything all arranged and they wanted me to come in ahead of time to pick up the paperwork I had an appointment with them I don't know and on a like a Friday I think was Friday and I had an appointment at 10:30 in the morning and they said to come down I don't know the day before so and pick up the paperwork and get the barium drink that I needed to drink because I had to not have anything to eat for 12 hours and then drink this barium one bottle at 8 o'clock one bottle at 10 o'clock and then come in for the scan and so that's what I did and you know the barium drink hasn't been it's vanilla and I was hungry you know no coffee no smoothie no nothing so I drank that vanilla barium and it satisfied my hunger okay so I'm in there I've drank my barium I'm on the table I am all ready to be him to put the the attendant to put the dye in my I guess right they were gonna put it in right there for the contrast and he asked me if I was allergic to any medication and I said no and then I kind of thought for a second and I told them I said however I am allergic to shellfish and he froze it's oh well he said this dye has iodine in it and if you're allergic to shellfish it's probably the iodine in the shellfish and he said I need to go ask my supervisor about this and he came back in a couple of minutes and he said no dye we're just gonna do the imaging but it's gonna be a little bit more difficult for your doctor to read it because it's not gonna have a good contrast okay so they told me down there at the imaging center that those images would be sent to doctor Boldt office on Saturday the next day so okay that I imagine that was done and I had gotten a notification from UC Davis an email and there was new information in my chart well I haven't you know I realized I haven't looked at my chart from time so I open up my chart and I start going through the different little things that you can look at in my chart and I found a scan that was taken my last scan that was taken a year ago last May or last month and I started reading then I thought I don't remember seeing this scan before have I did I find this before and look at it or not and I really couldn't remember having seen it before so I start reading it and I noticed that I've got I have a small cyst on my pancreas in the area called the unica process I don't remember hearing anything about a cyst or seeing anything about assist okay that's interesting and then I see that there's been a partial occlusion of my portal vein and my splenic veins a partial - complete occlusion of my splenic vein and that was something else I don't remember hearing anything about or did I even see that scan I don't know I don't recall anything and I asked Lou I said did dr. bull talk to us about anything about a a cyst on my pancreas or occlusion of my splenic and portal veins and what that might mean and he said no he didn't remember it at all so naturally I'm on the internet looking up occlusions of splenic and the wood that portal vein that's not too good if it is completely blocked of course no blood flow is going to be getting in but it's very prone to thrombosis blood clots and they said there really isn't a whole lot that can be done it's very common with pancreatic cancer common and the only thing that they can do for you is give you blood thinners so that your blood doesn't clot well I'm already taking the Hawthorn and I take the C the Co Q 10 and there's something else I take that is kind of you know a blood thinner too so okay I'm okay on that one but it there's really there's nothing that really could be dead about that as long as the cancers there I would imagine there's nothing that can be done about that and as for the cysts oh that's even better nothing can be done about the sister if it it talked about two kinds of cysts one is more of a thinner liquid a clear liquid and more as a heavier liquid inside of it and they can go along for years with no problems but they also can erupt like a cyst and if it does it's going to go into your abdominal cavity and cause peritonitis like a ruptured appendix isn't that nice but it's not a super common that they do that and so if you get like a really bad pain and immediately start getting a fever because it can go into blood poisoning as well so you get a big fever with it so that that's something to keep in mind on on that but up to this point I did not know that I had those other things besides the kids ward so it was a good three weeks later before doctor bolts office got in touch with me I called a couple of times and found out that he only came in on Fridays he's only been coming in on Friday since the the great quarantine has been in place and so that was what that was all about so he did he called me they arranged for a video conference type call or a video chat and even though I couldn't go to Sacramento we could do this video chat and so that's what we did and he seemed like he was really to see me they all smile and and very very cordial and not half as serious Issy was okay so he said essentially that my skin has not changed at all from the scan that I had done a year ago in me it looked to be exactly the same he said but because of the lack of contrast he couldn't see the edges of the cancer of the tumor and whether it's shrunk or not he's not sure and also about the the splenic and the portal veins couldn't tell about the blood flow going through there because of the lack of imaging as well so those were two things but he seemed very pleased that nothing nothing had changed he said all my other organs looked absolutely fine there was no cancer has spread at all so doctor Boldt he never asked what I've been doing he did not ask maybe it's on my chart that I was doing the THC but he didn't ask and he really didn't have any suggestions he just said he's gonna order the MRI and and see if he can discern a little bit more meanwhile as long as the assist doesn't rupture and I can get some blood through those portal veins I should be fine because the cancer is not spreading it doesn't seem to be getting any bigger so I could probably go along like this for years I just I don't know like I say as long as those other things don't play into this it is looking rather promising so what he wants to do is do an MRI he said he can get a better idea with an MRI so we're gonna do that I'll find out a place down here but the whole visit ended quite nicely quite well so did the RSL work the way Rick Simpson said it was gonna work I don't know it hasn't I don't know about the apoptosis I don't know it how much smaller the tumor is than it was before but did it do something oh yes I am sure it did I know the CBD keeps it from spreading and it certainly has not spread and the containment of it is is that's a very good thing you know because pancreatic cancer is a stubborn one it is a stubborn one so do I think the RSO is helping oh yes I definitely think so so like I said I'm just gonna have to wait and see I think the jury is still out on the RSO but I do know that something something has stopped that cancer from growing and I you know I'm betting that it is the RSO because I haven't done anything else so drastic and that it would stop pancreatic cancer from growing so we'll just have to wait and see and on that happy note of waiting and see on that happy note I'm going to say goodbye and thank you for watching my video and I'm sure that I will be keeping you up to date on what is happening with me and my pancreatic cancer and my RSO treatment okay all righty bye bye", "rRlb4y84cMk": "what's up YouTube new girl here today I want to tell you about xxx this is a company just a guy he sent me out some RS Oh Rick Simpson oil I he asked me was it on 84 I let him know that I was X cancer patient and he's like yeah we got to keep the cancer in remission brah and he sent it out to me no problem he also he sent me another tube to the other one was for a friend of mine that had seizures and so I had to say that she took the oil and during a seizure and I heard that it prevented her from having multiple seizures so this is a miracle it's his miracle oil so I'm gonna lead to dudes Instagram link in the description you can go check him out talk to him and see where his head excuse me I'm on let's see where his head is as far as getting some of this oil if you need it I think he's looking for more patients so go ahead and hit him up link in the description please people share this with your family and friends I I see so many people still dying from cancer and if this is the cure why is that happening I went to a Children's Hospital picnic and I seen that these babies running around here a ball headed because they're getting chemotherapy it helps some people but it's not the way this is the way right here if this is gonna help people go ahead and get this out I don't want to make this video too long so go

Moylan Sir Alan [Music] [Music] you hello everybody we are at Mobile World Congress 2017 in Calkins booth where we find out here a special sector dedicated to see clue mr. Kimball is here with us today he is a CEO of the company hello mr. Kishan Bao how was this year here at Mobile World War Congress very very busy very busy we see a lot of interest in millimeter wave mostly because of the 5g trend to go to millimeter wave what are you submitting here well we were exhibiting here first of all our regular product line which is point-to-point at a band and we Bend which relates to backhaul applications and I mean we've been this is the most selling millimeter-wave product in a line in the in the world but what we are more more excited here is to present actually to show here our point-to-multipoint product this is our new point-to-multipoint product which provides two gigabit 2-8-2 up to eight stations and is actually the main application that we see for this product is residential access or what we call fixed to home and which is going to be mainly the early 5g application what is the connection between Qualcomm and secure a Qualcomm is an early investor in signal so Qualcomm is you are we are hosted here by Qualcomm ventures you can see here the log of Cochran ventures which invest in SICU so this is the main connection and on top of that of course you know the the new point-to-multipoint of products we're using is based on on quark oh my geek chipset which is - ro - our opinion the best hwagok chips that you can find in this is why we use it so we are new to the 5g we have been always providing Connect connect connect tippity - two homes and two buildings but you know the whole trend of millimeter-wave - 5g is a new trend and we are going we are having the first product which is going into that introductory product the first breakout was actually last year when Google acquired one of our customers web bus to actually provide the broadband connectivity or the gigabit to the home connectivity and since there we have gained Google as a as a main as a main customer and what you can see here also is a slide that shows how AT&T and other companies are looking at millimeter-wave as a way to do the last hope of gigabit to the gigabit to the home and what is more interesting I think that we have one slide that shows the signal deployment in San Francisco here you can see in 2012 there was almost nothing there but you can see here all San Franci and these are all sick lue radios in San Francisco connecting people who is gigabit internet so you can see that it's really a huge deployment and you can do with millimeter wave you can do very dense deployment of high-capacity radios which is the main advantage of of millimeter waves that this is why it's a it is the choice for 5g earlier occasion today if you want to connect things in the urban environment and you want to use like Wi-Fi we have so much interference that you cannot get any good connectivity okay you get really very low rates because of interference millimeter wave has very narrow beams and because of the narrow beams actually you don't have interference between the systems so you can see here as an example the narrow beams of millimeter wave compared to go to Wi-Fi that allow you to actually have a lot of transmitters working in the same environment without it the film to each other and the other thing you can see here is actually the wide spectrum that we have compared to the Wi-Fi spectrum which is very narrow so we have more spectrum and we have very narrow beams so we can do a lot of dense urban installations why do you think the mobile operators and the service and the equipment's provider consider the lack of spectrum a big problem because the only way to provide high capacity is by actually reusing the spectrum and they don't have enough spectrum but when we are talking here about 5g we're not talking about mobile operators what are what while and operators and now they are also using spectrum in order to actually enhance the fiber nobody can put fiber to any house so actually millimeter wave is now becoming a fire legitimate fiber extension mean and this is the the new thing about how we look at 5g with millimeter wave that 5g has become a that millimeter wave is becoming the extension of fiber 5g will be Wireless but the wireless part of 5g is going to happen from 2020 and 24 word until 2020 the early stages of 5g are all going to be about fixed wireless you have a general overview a worldwide one how do you see your opposition in the 5g fight in front or in the back of the US and the Asians I I don't have a good view on 5g on the mobile part because we haven't been following that and I think that on the wireline part of fiber-to-the-home I think that by far us is in the front I do in the US we see in the in Europe we see a small rise of that in the UK but we don't see it in many in many other places in Asia there is a different dynamic because in a jet will take more time because the developed countries in Asia like Japan Korea and China have a lot of fiber so they will they will move into this fiber extension in a later stage [Music]",

children okay that's right yeah because we break it down everybody in this room is negative number one number two all been tested number two", "stEq6s5hefY": "Thank You senator Baldwin senator wicker Thank You mr. chairman this hearings been going on an hour and a half now I mean maybe it's maybe it's time to sort of summarize what we've learned so far I'll start with you miss Baker we are behind in 5g are we in second place or third place and how far behind are we and and how big of a problem is that I don't think senator Schatz has elicited an answer yet about our spectrum now Act which he and I have introduced with you to all and Moran so maybe some of you have an opinion about whether that's a valuable thing for Congress to do what else is the role of Congress in getting us where we need to be on mid-band and what's the role of the FCC specifically do they need to act more quickly in in addressing the mid band spectrum such as the preceding own the c-band so we'll start down here and and see if we can bring this hearing up to date thank you for your question as a big one I would say we are behind we announced that we were number three in the global race behind China and South Korea we were number one in industry readiness we were number six in mid bands that averaged out to number three since we announced that this committee in its leadership as well as the FCC has stepped up so we are making progress we have a plan we now have a plan on spectrum which is airwaves and we have a plan on siding new the new the new small cells with streamlined so we we we as in this committee and the FCC and and the country as a whole to win the race to 5g we can still win but we have to act and so I think it's very important both for our economy because of we were leaders in 4G it enabled the innovation of the app industry the innovation of the sharing economy to be here in the United States and we want the same thing for 5g we don't know exactly what 5g is going to unlock except for we know it's going to be remote surgery we know that at a hundred times faster and you know and virtually no no lag time we know it's going to unlock all kinds of things in transportation and energy and education we want all of that to happen here so that we can export our innovation instead of taking the Chinese innovation here yes yes senator wicker thank you so much for that question I want to clarify two important points first when Miss Baker says the United States is behind no one no one is the head of Qualcomm and making the chips for five she okay that is and that work is being done in the United States of America just this week we announced something that no one in the wireless industry thought was possible when 5g was first conceived no one thought it was going to go into a phone because for these millimeter wave bands you have many many antennas and the ability to have many antennas you know there's no place in one of these phones to put more antennas what we announced this week is a module that's half the size of a paper clip that has supports four to eight antenna elements and will be three of these going in the first five chief smartphones so in terms of the technology we're ahead qual comes ahead and we're or America well let me just interject though with regard track spectrum now Act which we still don't have any testimony on its intended to make spectrum available by providing support for users to research new and innovative ways to increase spectrum efficiency is this a bill any of you have looked at my goodness absolutely okay I apologize it was a big question I didn't get all of it right we support it and then the other thing I wanted to clarify on mid-band is there is something the effort the FCC just announced this 3.72 four to notice of proposed rulemaking thick document asking a lot of questions that just happened but what they so they're going to have to wait for the private sector used to make their comments and they're gonna have a series of issues that they have to grapple with but what the FCC could do and both mr. cotton and I have alluded to it for more mid-band spectrum today is the FCC's had this proceeding going on about the rules for the CB RS ban which is three point five to three point seven gigahertz that's a hundred and fifty megahertz which could be used for 5g but there's an FCC proceeding that they haven't finished up it would be fantastic and it would help us on the scorecard that Miss Baker keeps if we could finish that if the FCC could finish that proceeding quickly in ten seconds you know real quickly I would say while there are some issues in terms of Technology leadership and ranking us in the world with 5g development one of the critical issues with 5g regardless that many infrastructure providers are already doing anyway is building out expansive wireline connectivity because when you go to 5g you're going from these macro towers to small cells those small cells need wireline connectivity and so we're not stopping or waiting to build out that wireline infrastructure and that really is the long pole in the tent so to speak and so I want to be clear while there are some technology issues to deal with infrastructure providers are building out the wireline capacity to enable 5g when that equipment becomes available thank you Thank You senator wicker Senator mark", "fsDPi5KxITo": "so today we're going to talk about setting up the yavi cell advisor 5g for beam analysis the default screen is a spectrum analyzer so let's hit the mode button in the upper left corner and let's change this to 5g nr and beam analyzer from here i'll give it a simple name so we'll know what to call it later we call it ba1 enter select beam analyzer hit done and let the tool change to the beam analyzer mode from here we just need to enter the channel or the frequency i'll go with the channel number on the top of the screen there are some shortcut buttons i'm going to select the channel button and then channel number enter in my channel number 665 apply from here we're going to take the screen on the next shortcut which is our preamp and we're going to turn on the preamp so we'll go attenuation to zero we want to set our attenuation to zero when we're dealing with millimeter wave because of the sensitivity of the receiver we're also going to turn on our premium from here i just tap on the screen and that side screen goes away and now we just need to set the beam analyzer up to the specs of the 5d signal we're looking at so we're going to look at the bandwidth select bandwidth come over here to bandwidth ssb and you'll see that the cell advisor can do either low band fr1 frequencies or high band fr2 today we're going to look at high band and high band can be 100 megahertz wide signal or a 50 megahertz wide signal and your subcarrier spacing can be 60 120 or 240. in this case we're going to use 240 for the signal that we're analyzing i hit apply once you do that the analyzer will then look for the center channel of the beams and start displaying them on the screen if for some reason you don't have your display set up like mine you re-select the bandwidth you come down to search type select full roster and hit the auto button this will scan the entire 100 megahertz signal and look for the location of the beams itself takes anywhere from 10 seconds to 3 minutes depending on the location and once it finds it it'll auto set up the signal tap on the screen and you'll start to see the beams across the screen on the left side of the screen the dark blue one will be rsrp for the given pci and in this case our pci is 315 and you can see we have a beam index of 14. so we can look at our rsrp on the secondary sync and the rsrp on the primary sync as well as secondary sync synar and lastly we do an rsrq measurement so right across the screen you'll see we have up to eight different beams that are able to be shown and upon recording we can record up to 64 views so to record in the screen you hit the save button on the right side you select log to csv give it a name and we'll call it save one hit enter and hit save and now the unit is recording all of its stats and all of the measurements to a csv file this runs automatically with a gps timestamp as well as gps location when you're satisfied with your recording you tap anywhere on the screen and if you'd like to save it you hit yes if you don't want to save it you hit no and if you want to keep recording you hit continue i just recorded that file and it's now in file and that's setting up the beam analyzer on the yabi solutions cell advisor 5g find out more at vicon's website you", "BNfIYn4NJVo": "hi everybody Andy here with Nick dink entertainment and I am back with another product showcase just for you guys so first off before we get into this make sure to smash that like button if you like and support mcdent be sure to share this video if you found it useful and as always hit that subscribe button so you can stay updated with more stuff that we got coming out all right so today here I have with me is Genesis farms RS oh now this is a pulp plant extract okay I'm gonna pop this open and kind of bring this out here this is the RSL by Genesis farms and this is a quite again a full plant extract okay now RSO is Rick Simpson oil that's what it stands for that's who created it and this is a lot of things you hear about like ah oh it's helping cancer or oh it's helping with seizures and epilepsy and all kinds of stuff this is the kind of this is it okay this is one of the things that they're using to help with cancer to help fight cancer help you know fight various other you know ailments and diseases and stuff like that this is this is the medicine right here okay this is the cannabis medicine and anyway so what you do very simple now you can take it orally or you can take it all rectally okay now if you're going to take it rectally that's something i recommend it you're in late stages of cancer do you have a serious condition that's something I would recommend and take it retro late but I take it orally as do many other people and so what you do here with the artist oh okay very simple now I might explain dosages to to you because a lot of people don't understand their dosages so what top their top here now what I like to do some people just put it on their tongue you know and just do the damn thing what I like to do is I get a snack so here I got some peanut butter crackers and yeah gonna open these mobile pop-ups so we got our cracker here and so what I like to do is I like to just put it on the food and just it's so don't such is why so when you're starting out if you don't have very high tolerance if you don't use RSO at all on you're gonna want to start out with like a ballpoint pen you know mount just the tip of a ballpoint pen amount so it's like a little B you know and then you work your way you gradually work your way up to like the size of a grain of rice and you know the size of the piece and then you know eventually you will work your way up to almost like half Rams programs depending on you know if you need it or not so anyway so I got this I'm gonna put it right here gonna put a little bit push so I want everybody to see it come out - now I have a high tolerance and I do take our ISO so I'm gonna be taking a little more than I you know recommend everybody that's a little bit it's a little bit bigger than a grain of rice but that's that's what I take and I'm telling you guys this this helps out with a lot I mean my father uses it he's using it for his blood pressure and and whatnot and it's working great you know I know people have used it for diabetes all kinds of stuff so do some more research you know Google RSO do some more research if you're interested I'm not an expert on it so I can't sit here and tell you everything about it but I can tell you that it does work and it does work wonders okay so here we go oh my god hands up it does not taste good okay [Music] nope occupation now I can taste it oh there's a reason I mix it with food and just don't do it right on the tongue whoo it's got its own unique taste to it it really does wash it on down with a good spray and yeah and we're ready to go you know you got to give it 30 45 minutes or so to activate but once it does you'll feel a nice relaxed mellow feeling and it will last you almost all day if not until I know some people that experience on until the next day so yeah it's a great it's a great product and I really enjoy it and I really enjoyed my Genesis forums they make like some of the best not or they make some of the best if not the best RSO here in the state of Oregon okay and again it's this 45 minute activation time so like I said you got to get it you know some time to kind of sink in this is one gram cannabis concentrate and let's see let's look at the container here see if it's got any other ol concentrations are produced with pure alcohol okay so this is made of pure alcohol store in a cool dry place keep tightly capped when not in use so yeah because obviously you don't want to be pushing down this plunger and getting it everywhere and making a mess and all that kind of stuff so be careful with that always make sure you put the cap back on when you're done so anyway that is the artist so that is a great product this Genesis farms RSO is available in a lot of different disciplines cerise throughout Oregon so go ahead and Leafly it search it you know so you can find the closest dispensary to you so you can pick it on up and yeah I mean this is the RSO and something I take daily it's something that you know my family take daily and it's something that I highly recommend all right they do come in the high THC that's what this one is it's the high THC and they do have a high CBD one I believe so either/or but this is a full plant extract that means it's got the full plant in it all the cannabinoids all that stuff it's all in here so check out some ourselves check it out by Genesis farms and as always much love and I hope everybody's having a great night Mick take interchange this tank Entertainment thanks entertainment go past it come on you ain't got [ __ ] to do", "aT-iU_xRItM": "working with our customers on developing the next generation of 5g handsets we're finding that integration around the antenna and the entire our front-end really is is a key trend and that's because you know there's a lot of new frequency bands to cover we're covering all the 4G or LTE bands and now adding 5g bands sometimes a new spectrum and sometimes we're using 4G spectrum but there's also requirements for E and DC which is dual connect technology allowing you to use for G and 5g bands simultaneously it's a great benefit to the system operators in terms of efficiency the network and also for the users you'll have seamless connectivity but it really drives up the complexity of the RF front end and to get those products to market efficiently with high performance it turns out integration is very very helpful there so the handset manufacturers not having to do a lot of work on the board itself highly integrated modules from Corvo and others can help get those products to market faster and with high performance", "qa73sA5iQgk": "hello my name is colin brice director of technical sales in the outdoor wireless segment at comscope welcome to this short video where we're going to be discussing a new product that we're bringing to market in collaboration with our oem partner nokia 2019 has been an exciting year in our industry it's seen the launch of 5g across multiple networks in the us in asia and in europe these networks have primarily been launched with massive mimo standalone antennas most of you will have heard the term 64 t64r antennas this has been important because this early deployment using these products has allowed operators to test the new technology and give customers an experience of what the 5g world is going to be like however as we move forward as we start mass deployment of 5g across large numbers of macro sites in the network this is not necessarily the most cost effective way of deploying the technology and operators have been asking companies like comscope is there a way to integrate and consolidate current technology with 5g can we support the legacy 2g 3g 4g networks in a similar product to the 5g one this is going to make it easier to deploy reuse sites without lots of additional work to strengthen or or consolidate the sites and generally make it less error-prone to deploy 5g onto the network to this end nokia and comscope have developed a new product we call the integrated passive actor active antenna the ipaa the ipa effectively consists of two parts a bottom box and a top box primarily the bottom box delivers the functionality for the legacy fdd networks everything from low band let's say 600 megahertz through to 900 megahertz and mid band 1400 megahertz through to 2600 megahertz so this can support all the legacy networks that are widely deployed the top box allows room for a beam former generally this will be deployed at 3.5 gigahertz to support 5g new radio the beam former can deliver services that are either provided from a separate 888r remote radio unit or it can provide the service from a fully integrated massive mimo antenna so what's the great new thing about the interleaved antenna haven't we had top boxes and bottom box antennas in the past yes we have but these have had a limitation and the limitation has primarily been the length of the array that we can provide for the low band technologies then the gain of an antenna is directly related to its length the shorter the antenna the lower the gain and this has meant that where we remove a legacy antenna and replace it with an old version of a top box bottom box antenna the gain has reduced and therefore the footprint of the cell site is not able to cover exactly the same area as previously which clearly causes a problem for the operator what we've managed to do is to develop a product where we can split the low band array and allow us to change the top box and reconnect the low band array together giving us a full length array and providing the same gain or very very similar gain to our legacy products and this means this bot this antenna system can replace legacy antenna systems with no loss of coverage no loss of service to the end user at this point i'd like to introduce darryl davis from our collaboration partner nokia daryl welcome to the video please introduce yourself and give us a little bit of the perspective of this product from the nokia point of view colin thank you for the introduction as todd mentioned my name is daryl davis and i look after nokia's air scale portfolio including the interleaved passive active antenna which we are discussing today with that in mind uh let's give you some details from the nokia perspective as colin already mentioned it's imperative that as we move to mass deployment of 5g in 2020 and beyond that the the the the solutions that enable that make it a lot easier for operators to do so in a most cost effective manner there are many situations now with multiple assets on a given site which make it quite frankly very difficult for operators at least very challenging to deploy that extra antenna on the cell site with that in mind combining the two the antennas the passive and the active elements in one enclosure means that it overcomes some of those issues making the deployment easier so nokia's massive mimo antenna and that's being used in this instance is a 30 a 64 t-64 antenna operating in the 3.5 gigahertz band that's n78 it has an instantaneous bandwidth of some 200 megahertz and an occupied bandwidth of 100 megahertz it's got 192 active elements making it a very versatile unit indeed uh providing sufficient capacity and coverage which would map quite nicely with the existing lte grid so with the combination of the the low band and mid band antenna elements and that of the active beamforming massive mimo antenna provides the ideal solution and a compact sleek looking unit for operators to deploy moving forward with that colin back to you thank you so this has been a very short introduction if you feel that this product could bring benefit in your network ease your deployment issues make it faster and more effective to get 5g out there to your

recreational purposes and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has spoken out backing the use of cannabis oil for medicinal purposes I wanted to open up the debate further so why do I feel the need to open up the debate well my nephew Jack here was diagnosed with glioblastoma great for in September 2014 and eventually being told there was nothing else the hospital could do for him he started looking into alternative therapies and cannabis oil so far as prolonged his life expectancy and made the daily task of living with such a life senator changing disease more bearable it's also allowed him more precious moments with his beloved daughter so take me back to the beginning when he was first diagnosed Jack how quickly did things escalate not work on rhetoric kitchen and I decision ended up in hospital it's now possible which I just wanted to get out as either statically who called I wanted to get our to this rather surgery can go well so I just talked to go after that and have another big seizure while I'm there fortunately I didn't settle to me and said you prior to clear the size of a grapefruit so when the sacred name would be boy detector it's benign certain cancers to infect are no major side effects oh yeah I did that after the surgery where you were fine weren't you told 2014 changed yeah I want to change for the word and had it moved again yeah our 2015 yeah memories not too clever or either that's when they tell you the tip is definitely grateful although suspected in September yeah yeah just Carol to fill it off do overcome I understand you looked into was a alternative therapist and went to Germany for some treatment tell me about that yeah I just found myself every night walking on the internet or on the phone and on the internet constantly searching wire blast over news fire blaster and retrievers oil everything everything benefit and I come up with some brilliant cannabis oil today offering the latest in latest in modern technology knows what no other medicine have to say I think we treat to lots of time it's about positivity it's about positivity and I'll stay positive for a spell to walk through everything to this out where the picture so I no one's ever said to me there were real life so I know about wonderful students I would believe for one minute that they were just going to get hit get it on maybe first time that had pizza made it sound so simple I own a bar and when they went to we got it are the words after we're yeah we gotta roll it all up complete success complete exit don't need anything else don't need no more treatment it was no radio no keep out of it tell anymore treatment for score and live a normal well never knew about it coming back for players lair from space I thought you'd only last it last about it where did you hear about the benefits of cannabis all of that and when did you hear about it ages it just seems like some new fitna for people to be waving about now it's seen as some sort of weird little cure for cancer awesome they don't mean that in a bad way I just be kind of it's all good about the years and there's probably majority for the certain ailments as well for this is what no what no about there until someone pond from not CBD one well yeah it just seemed like it's literally just going to mainstream I believe it's bad there's no budget smiles joke one before the parents and how do you think cannabis oil has helped you and that's definitely what reducing payments and helpful sleeping still in the taller conservative how our it will help but as in terms of what what merit in the fact I can only put it out - I just got a quick just as I presented here about to be a very very strong history I recommend it I understand the Imam is out you raised the money required to go to Germany etc with a lot of help from a lot of the people we've had ruffles and afternoons of places and we had a lot of wedding gowns given to us it drops into 80 some brand new some X display some of them worth about 1214 under pound so we've been selling them in shops that we can get three for nothing we've now still got a shot although not many people know where it is that we've got a shop in

thing to say about cannabis oil to the gooey thing which is to say they all get into it what they're doing is they're looking into it as to what the ingredients are the oil my fifth one Sochi billion are THC CBD for fibers they are trying to it seems to be allowed to trying to make a westernized CBD of THC I don't believe that one all those are work is what's working there's all these different compounds and chemicals coming together to grow their own as they are do it now obviously and then pharmaceutical pump is a problem lose money shouldn't be about money no shouldn't well we'll end it

systems for prototyping Millie ruda wave research so what we have here is a demo of system that has up to a gigahertz of bandwidth right now we're showing just the baseband portion of that this is a system that was developed with nokia so in that system there were additional RF up converters are down converters right here we're just showing the baseband portion of that so we have is a generator right here and an analyzer right here the same thing on both this system and the system so right here we're just doing a loop back from the generator of this chassis to the analyzer this chassis and then the same thing from from this generator to this analyzer so yeah using this customers could do whatever that they need to do to evaluate the millimeter-wave portion of the of the spectrum though in the current regions of the spectrum that are being used for communications you know 2.4 five point eight ish areas starting game or more crowded by moving to these very high frequencies these

My name is Tom and today we're gonna be talking about 5G. What is 5G,\nand what can we look forward to with the arrival of 5G networks? So, I did do a\nlittle bit of research myself, because with all the new phones and technology\nthat's coming out, many of it is going to be and currently is 5g capable. So, with\nthat anticipation of purchasing 5G products in the future, I wanted to know\nhow would that impact me (being in a less populated area) that currently doesn't\nhave 5G. 5G is, and essentially stands for, the fifth generation in wireless.\nIt's the latest and fastest iteration of wireless technology that uses a series\nof frequencies to give us the Internet in places you otherwise would not.  5G's\nbiggest \"claim-to-fame\" is it's insane bandwidth. As you can see, here my homie\nMarques Brownlee [MKBHD] is standing in Providence, Rhode Island and he is\npulling some insane numbers... **shock intensifies** **shock intensifies more** Aaaa ha ha ha. That's hot, That's hot! So the major issue with 4G versus 5g is the frequency lengths so where 5g has a\nvery high frequency and is able to give you very very quick download and low\nlatency, it's not able to travel as far as a low frequency. 4G which can go\nfurther but give you less downloads and lower latency. This is stated in multiple\nsources online, saying that 5G is unable to travel through trees or buildings.\nThat's gonna be an issue because if you don't live in one of the hot spots that\n5G is currently enabled, chances are you're not gonna get it anytime soon. But,\nit does seem that 5G on the horizon is going to be great!\nWhy wouldn't you want an insanely crazy download speed or very very low latency\nin gaming. There's no doubt in my mind that 5g is definitely the future of cell\nphones and computers and the general Internet, but as of right now I see a lot\nmore issues than I do promising features with it.\nIf you know something I don't, please leave it in the comments below and tell\nme your thoughts on 5G. So, I know it's a super short video, but I hope this helped\nyou kind of get a better understanding of what 5G is and what we can anticipate\nfrom it. Thanks so much for watching, if you guys enjoy this make sure you smash\nsubscribe and I'll see you in the next video. Peace.", "g7bApQhA1H8": "on today's video I'm going to teach you how to make cannabis infused butter or oil in the instant pot so we're gonna talk about why to use an instant pot how to do it I'm gonna give you a quick demonstration as well and then just so you know the instructions for this recipe are printed below so you don't have to write anything down hi my name is Andrea hard I'm a cannabis coach and educator and I post new videos here every Saturday morning I also offer private consultations over the phone in-person workshops around the London Ontario area and online classes from the comfort of your own home okay let's talk about why we use an instant pot well this is the number one advantage the instant pot internal temperature gets to 242 degrees Fahrenheit which is literally perfect for D carving and infusing and it's a nice constant steady temperature so you don't have to worry about fluctuations it also makes it so that it's really not all that smelly at all infusing in your instant pot in a mason jar is way less alerting to your neighbors then doing it say on the stovetop or in a crock pot and it is crazy quick this is why people love the instant pot or any kind of pressure cooker in general is because it makes things really fast the first step in the process is to deke our beer cannabis and that turns your THCA and cbda into THC and CBD which is what you want you don't have to grind it first you're just gonna put it into a mason jar close it up finger tight and put that into a bath in the instant pot where the bath water is about halfway up the jar so if your jars halfway full make sure that the water is halfway up the jar as well and you're gonna set it to 40 minutes on manual then let it release for 10 minutes natural pressure release and then release the rest of it pressure yourself and you have d carb cannabis in a flash you don't have to infuse this cannabis you could just use this d carb cannabis as a sprinkle on top of spaghetti or you could put it into capsules the point is you could use it right now as a ste carb you don't have to infuse but if you want to the instant pot is great for that as well so now you're gonna lightly grind the bud you're not trying to make it into powder you're just trying increase the surface area slightly add in your oil or butter make sure that it's melted first and make sure that there's at least of enough liquid to cover the cannabis that you have in there the more liquid you add the less potent your infusion will be then put that mason jar back in the instant pot and it's a little bath for 40 minutes on manual again ten minutes natural pressure release then open it up and strain it or not and you have cannabis infused oil or butter which is amazing super fast much much faster than any other way as for storage you can keep your your all of your abusers always in a dark and cool place butter should be kept in the fridge or freezer and coconut oil could be kept on the counter or also in the fridge the great thing about infusing cannabis into oil or butter is that it allows the cannabis to last for so much longer it doesn't degrade once it's infused into an infusion as for dosing there's no real precise way to find out exactly what's in your infusion unless you have it lab tested but for the home cook I have a little solution for you so this infusion calculator allows you to put in the information that you know about your cannabis and it will spit out how many milligrams of THC or CBD are in your infusion so I'm going to show that to you now this is at the wake-and-bake website and if you haven't been here before you should definitely check it out it's amazing so if you know the THC percentage of your plant material you can type it in because you have lab tested cannabis if you don't you can go to a site like Leafly and type in the strain name and get a general idea so you type in how many grams that you're gonna be using for my infusion that we're gonna do today I'm doing 14 grams into one cup of oil so I know that with my cannabis I'm gonna have 20 100 grams of THC and not very much of CBD and that in each teaspoon I have about 43 milligrams of THC so that's really helpful for me to have an idea of how potent my infusion is again this is not perfect there's lots and lots of variables to go on there but it's a great starting point and even if you have used the dosing calculator it is still really important that you start low and go slow and be your own guinea pig each infusion that you make might be slightly different and you don't want to have a really bad experience because you're going off of what you think will happen so I encourage you to keep a consumption journal and write down how does it make you feel how did you feel before you took it how long does it last keep all that in mind and that will help you really homey and Nona how potent your infusion is all right so let's get started I have here coconut oil you couldn't view this infuse this into butter or any kind of oil that you wanted but I'm going to use coconut oil this is sunflower lecithin we'll talk about this after this is bendy car and here I have my 14 grams of cannabis I'm gonna put this into its little water back in here again you want to make sure that the water in the pot is at least enough to cover what you have in the dark put the lid on and set the timer for 40 minutes and then walk away I'll see you in a bit as you can see my D carving is done it's already done about 10 minutes of natural pressure release and I'm gonna just let the rest of the pressure out open it up alright so I have some perfectly he D card to cannabis in here super hot careful when you're opening this so um D carbon cannabis will be a little bit browner than when you put it in your don't smell a little bit different once your cannabis is cooled off you're going to grind it up I have a coffee grinder here I have a separate coffee grinder for coffee or that would make for some very interesting morning the great thing about this method is that you can do it all in one meter so you're just gonna put this back in your mason jar then I have a cup of coconut oil that I've warmed up in the microwave first I'm also putting in a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin this helps to emulsify the mixture so that the cannabinoids don't separate from the oil it also helps the cannabinoids to enter your blood-brain barrier a little bit more quickly so it doesn't actually make it more potent but it does help to make it feel like it's working a little bit better however so I'm flower lecithin tastes like crap and you know I really hate it so I only had a teaspoon most people recommend a tablespoon to two tablespoons per cup but I recommend that you start low with that inserts and go slow and see how it goes for you then you just put it back in your jar and shake it up back in the instant pot before another bath of 40 minutes on manual and then we'll be done I've got my infused cannabis oil here you can now strain this using a cheesecloth make sure that you really squeeze the cheesecloth to get all the beautiful camera soil out you can then take that cheesecloth and dunk it in a tea and a pot of chai and then you can have some high chives there's still some medicinal benefit left in even the satchel of spent cannabis material but with this one I'm not even gonna strain it I started to add my unstrained cannabis oils and butters right into my baked goods and nobody seems to notice I'm gonna make this into cannabis infused protein bites and that would be next week's video all right if you have any questions I am super happy to answer them just leave them in the comment section down below and are you following me on Facebook and Instagram I really hope you do the links are below I post daily cannabis education there every day and if you head to my website reveal cannabis column you will be send some free stuff like an awesome recipe book

to be opening my latest haul from true leaf Panama City Beach dispensary location let's see what we got we've got some 9 pound hammer Rosen man 83.5% TCA and 3.1 percent of THC for a grand total of eighty eight point six and we've got some co2 oil this one we have a Skywalker og and this one gorillas grapes will see the Skywalker og eighty point three percent THC an eighty percent THC on a gorilla grapes last but definitely also least is the I got a little syringe warmer because you know I've been using hot water and all kinds of stuff like that for a long time and I just figured I'd give it a try seems like it might be more convenient let's take a look at the total here they actually forgot to put the warmer on the first time I use my trigger points they let me stack it for twenty percent this time that's the first time I've ever had them do that I don't know if that's a new thing or what but I was allowed to get twenty percent discount from my true liver points and so instead of being two twenty five that came out to 180 so that makes each one of these sixty bucks apiece 60 bucks for the co2 and sixty bucks for the rosin I think that's a pretty decent deal you make rosin at home you're gonna be paying probably forty to fifty bucks or so to make it grandma rosin maybe a little bit more depending on the strain and you know $60.00 co2 oil is just a great deal because usually it's their regular distill it that's at $60 price point and I don't really like the regular distill it that much I mean it's just not the same level as the co2 this syringe warmer right here is $20 normally with the 20% off that 16 bucks total and here it is so this thing right here what you will do is take your battery mod that fits a 5-10 cartridge on it and hopefully you can unscrew it I guess mine's a little bit leaky we have to well there we go whoo yeah that'll loosen it up just enough darn I can't get it here we go finally how'd you get a glove alright so yeah that's the problem is I've got a bunch of leakage right here so I need to get a q-tip with some alcohol on it and cleaning that thing out that can also cause your your mod to stop working I actually found this on the ground somebody just threw it out and this thing was all gunked up and so there you go now it works let's see if this works even though it's still all gunky you just screw in the syringe warmer on your battery mod see if I can feel it it doesn't really have any structions with it smells like it's heating up in there yeah you just take this sucker look how pretty it is I love how pretty the co2 oil is just take this and stick it in there I guess maybe you take off this cap I'm not really totally sure what you do I've never used it and there's no instructions but see if this does anything hmm wonder how long this thing takes there we go it's certainly heat up right here I don't know it might be easier just to do a lighter guys seriously like what in the heck maybe I gotta try it like this take this thing off it doesn't seem to make much sense to me but I'll try it when the heck was that oh there's a spring I don't know the here is like a spring weird okay let's see this is holder for ten seconds to see if that doesn't so the video cut out there right after I held it down for ten seconds but yeah it does it does heat it up you know it's not as fast as a lighter and you have to sit here and hold it so mmm if you don't want to mess with a lighter I guess it could be worth it but yes here we go there it's all it's all melted now it really doesn't take that long you don't get sick all over it you don't have to worry about using all your butane there you go you can just keep this thing plugged in if you want really so it looks like that works pretty well I didn't get any flour because I'm all out of my flour recommendation you know I got caught up in the one plant slash three boys farm ordeal and so I spent my recommendation on that now I mean I'm not regretting it you know it's like it was a really good deal hundred twenty-five dollars for an ounce so 250 for two ounces that's pretty awesome I mean a quarter pound for 500 bucks you know medical grade pretty awesome but you know I I do miss the variety I wish I had I definitely wish I had my recommendation open when I went to the grand opening of this truly Panama City Beach because they had a nice selection of strains they had like four or five strains that day and they also had all the cups I'd use all the cups I got I went back and I only had there yesterday it was just cups of what is it wine wine dream Dutch wine yeah Dutch wine and I just I've already got cups of that so I don't really care about it yeah you know it's good stuff but I like a variety so I should my recommendation should be coming up here and about a week or so so I'll be getting a bunch more reviews on actual flour in here soon hopefully maybe I'll take a couple deliveries from other dispensaries to and branch out with what I'm reviewing instead of just doing and all the stuff that's closed or that I've gotten from before but like fluent I know I can get deliveries from them and possibly vitae can and med men I'm not really sure but yeah I'm ready to taste some variety I've been stuck on the same strains for a while now and that'll teach me something in the future too you know don't get stuck on the big old hype trap if if you might have some new openings coming in your area but it's all good I just got to say that that the employees at the Panama City Beach location seem pretty cool they're all very friendly and polite so far the atmosphere in general up there is really nice you know it's not there's not a bunch of grumpy people I mean it's not a bunch of people arguing or whatever perhaps the limit on minis help that I don't know but they said that the minis I talked to I guess my team in a shift manager I'm not sure but he said that the minis are still selling out and they'll be you know usually they'll be gone by early afternoon even with the two person or two per person limit so it's just a really popular item and you can't blame them when they're you know giving out really fat jars of minis they just baton for social media with those things you know they want to get on in line they want to get their message out they want people who don't have a card and who are getting from a dealer to say hey wait whoa whoa you can get four grams for the price of 3.5 and it looks good you know like that I mean so you know it's a work in progress this is like the Wild West phase that we're in right now once everything gets sorted out you know once the competition gets more firmly rooted wants some acquisitions take place then we're gonna start to see a more stable environment with better prices and better customer or care I think right now they're just you know that some of these people are some of these dispensaries are gonna get snapped up some of them are gonna get bought out some of them are gonna you know have really bad financial problems I mean just depends you know you got to see how it plays out and in the next two years I think we'll see the market stabilize a lot we'll see a bunch of acquisitions and stuff like that and it'll be a lot better for us at that point you know we just got a grin and bear it for now it is a kind of a [ __ ] show you know trying to get flour in this state hang in there and we can do it and you know another thing I just wanted to say I think I'm gonna start adding this as much as I can to everything I say because I just noticed that online we've got so much negativity not just in our forum not just in the medical marijuana community but in America we just in our whole country everyone is so negative everyone is always wants to be right everyone always wants to prove someone wrong everyone always wants to knock somebody down a peg and I'm guilty I'm just as guilty as anybody else or more so and you know we got to just start being kind man just please please please be kind", "0sGWxz0DMSI": "Oops!

out 18.1 ounces for free plants who are we herbs", "D3Uyelbp7vw": "everybody it's Loki gen computing Casa del lucky I have been had I've had tons of questions on RSO or Rick Simpson well the stuff that generally comes in well a much smaller syringe than this but I'm used to higher volumes and everyone was wondering in on I don't have a full rig in even though I have a rig I don't know exactly how to use it I don't want something that too big and bulky Zoar something that's portable well I noticed that a lot of the the events that are coming out with that are you know cannabinoid an alkaloid enriched they leave a little to be desired they're good to keep you know the cannabinoid levels up in your body but if you're looking to get the analgesic or the euphoric effect from it I found out that this little thing the Green Lantern fits on to just about any size each cigarette battery I'm sure if we've all tried and I'm sure those of us that smoke cigarettes we've all had these and we have them lying around this is about 30 bucks and as you saw in the photos it comes with an extra fall plenty of extra plates and it's pretty stiff to use so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get up nice and close and I'm gonna show you how to take your extension oil add it to a vaporizer similar to this like a said this is the Green Lantern and I'll show you how how you can use it and this is the one I I so far prefer I've tried many in the past those of you know me I know that I've worked a lot with these e-cigs but this is one that I found that works exceptionally well over and over again especially for someone who's such a heavy user like myself so let's get up close and personal see how this stuff works alright alright everybody so what I've done is I've taken my epen and I've taken it apart for you it's actually just a little mouthpiece here's the dome as you can see I've already tested it out quite a bit I'm still working on the same heat plate now this actually screws on it's a little sticky right now from the excessive use so I'm not going to mess with that part but it's it's a simplest growing on the battery so this is your heating element it's got the titanium dabbing bowl in it nice titanium screen there's a heating element at the bottom that you'll see now you just add it on to the battery like so and when you engage the power you can see that there's a heating element that starts producing a vapor this one called the Green Lantern has these colorful little LED a I'm sorry LEDs yes little green LEDs which give for a really cool effect you know and and everyone loves the cool effects so the dome goes on as such very simple to parts it screws on and we just fire that off and as you can see it starts to build up in there now when I take a toke it's it's heated it's to the point where I can actually take a decent toke but you'll see that it fills the chamber with a good amount of vapor you get a good toke off of it and it's not messy at all and it's very smooth so let's go ahead and talk it that's awesome this is amazing I love it and you can at your smoke shops you can find flavoring so don't have any nicotine in them and if you're out and about and you want to be a little less open about it little inconspicuous you can add a drop of that flavoring to it and it adds a little flavor and it changes the smell most people aren't going to expect this smell of the Rick Simpson oil or hash oil I'm and the ones that do they generally have a history with it and they're probably ok with it but just to be on the safe side you can always do that so I know there's many models out there I happen to pick the Green Lantern so far I have no complaints it fits the budget growers pocketbook for those of us that you know have to live on a budget those of us that are just frugal it's it's a pretty good buy for 30 bucks and I am a very heavy user so I usually tear through these things pretty quickly and this thing has yet to get screwed up so now that we know how all this works let's show you how to load the Rick Simpson oil onto something like this now you can load it directly on to the screen takes a little bit you want some airflow in there this titanium bowl is beautiful because it heats up and it melts the oil into the screen slowly so all I'm gonna do is I'm going to push out a dose of my RS Emma this looks really dark there is no chlorophyll in this this was actually a poly nonpolar extraction I'll show you here there's no chlorophyll in that it's just very dark and has been decomposed lights making it orally active so should I need to and I can't vape I can put a little bit of this on my finger and rub it on my gums or just swallow it so now we have our dab in there and we have our battery ready to go in the heating element so we're put on our lid and at first all I'm going to do is I'm going to heat it up to melt it in there and you'll see it start to kind of play them a little bit when my batter might be running dead beautiful thing about these things is that they did have backups so let me grab a backup all right so here we go we firing it up start to see the plume coming there at this point this is why I want to start talking and that's still good to go for I don't know quite a few up quite a few heads at least 30 20 30 song blows so for something inexpensive found anywhere you can reuse all these old batteries that we've all gone through it's not as messy as you see what they want container and comes to beat that one up and it's real simple those are your pocket it's no mess and the replacement parts are inexpensive as hell now I don't know what happened if I drop this I'm sure it's glass it'll break but for everyday use I I have no complaints so this is the Green Lantern and how do you use your Rick Simpson oil and one of these little portable favorite pens I like these far better than I like the ones that come with the VG and the PG in it but I'm a pierced at heart so this is Loki Jenna from Casa della keep bringing you guys another little simple thing to think about and use in your everyday life for those of you that are coming into this community and not knowing too much about it or just plain curious damn it I hope I answer the question so yeah Green Lantern you can find it anywhere", "7E6pxDesewg": "[Music] hi it's Brandi with green wellness life it has been a bit since we've done a video and I've been getting some customer requests so learn a little bit more about a few of the products that we offer so I thought we would take a few minutes to do just that today so we are going to talk about the plus CBD oil raw whales that we have now and you might have seen our other video on a raw tuile and how that works and that is from USM wholesale and that is an a standard oral syringe real easy to use you just push down that plunger the only problem with it is that the serving size cannot always be exactly precise we recommend that you and would put those serving sizes in terms of grains of rice and I've actually a customer say well what type of rice brown rice white rice long grain yeah super good question it's pretty it's pretty standard so everybody is a grain of rice size serving might be a little bit different so plus DVD has taken some of that guesswork out of it for us now they don't have a raw version they have what they call the total plant complex which is their full spectrum still has plant matter all the cannabinoids included there and then they've got their filtered option so that is their gold option and it does have a little bit more precise serving these come in a one a three and a six gram applicator so that's pretty similar to our other offering but the us have does have a 10 gram and that is a bit of a better value same percentages so the gold is going to be about 25% or 250 milligrams of CBD part of one gram serving and then the total plant complex with the green label that guy is going to be about 150 milligrams of CBD for the one gram applicator because they have that precise serving size each one gram gives you 20 servings so if we're go back to our grain of rice analogy that's about a grain and a half of rice per serving so these are super easy to use all that you do is twist until you hear the click this has been my sample guy for a while so it was little bit dried at the top I was just cleaning that off because well yeah so this is the gold you simply turn it until you hear the click I'm not sure if that was audible to you but we turned it until here to click that will go right onto your spoon to your finger to whatever you want to use and it's going to dispense about that much because the Gold's more of a gel rather than a piece that's going to hold its shape it does turn a little bit liquid I'm gonna give you one more serving size example so it still kind of looks like a grain of rice to me I'm not much of a cook just ask my husband but it probably is a little bit thicker in that application still gonna have that almost popery flavor of the filtered CBD oil with no added ingredients no carrier oil no flavorings no anything just those different cannabinoids in a filtered form now the total plant complex green label again 15% versus 25% this is still going to be more of a paste then that goolge a little different consistency little thicker we're still just going to turn it to here one click and then we will have we will have the one serving of the total plant complex so one serving of that guy just turning til we hit the click easy-peasy this is gonna look about like that so again our grain and a half of rice I'm a total plant complex this one's still going to taste really grassy and earthy heavy is our adjective but grassy and earthy and the difference between the two is that this guy just has not been as filtered so it's gonna still have some of that plant matter all those terpenes in there that some of us really like thicker green paste we're gonna pop it under the tongue let it dissolve a little bit 30 60 seconds whatever works for you and then move on with your day it tasted either of these is a struggle for you I get asked a lot about mixing them with a liquid I wouldn't do that as these are they're just not gonna mix that well with a liquid so try mixing it with honey coconut oil something of that nature to help you out with that flavor

everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis simple syrup so let's get into it [Music] to make my simple syrup i'm going to be using an eighth of cannabis all right guys so once you measure out your cannabis the next step would be to decarb your cannabis so now we're going to put this in the oven for about 40 minutes and the temperature that i'm going to be using is 240. [Music] all right guys my cannabis is now the card remember guys once you decarbon your cannabis your cannabis should be brown if it's not brown you may want to decarb it for a little bit longer [Music] alright guys so now we're going to start working on this simple syrup so let's get into it so the first thing we're going to do is add our water [Music] once the water starts boiling add your sugar i'm going to be using a half cup of brown sugar and a half a cup of white [Music] sugar [Music] all right guys my sugar is now completely dissolved so now i'm going to reduce the temperature and add the vegetable glycerin [Music] all right guys so now i'm going to add our cannabis [Music] now that your cannabis simmer for about an hour on low all right guys so it's been over one hour so now we're going to string the simple syrup [Music] [Music] all right guys my simple syrup is now done i'm going to pour it in this little container right here so you guys can see how it looks my simple

review how you folks doing this chilly Friday this Friday though at least we got that going for us I am so on today's review we've got a two-part review on edibles being able to eat marijuana you know okay so I've got a high tolerance when it comes to smoking grass I don't know if it's a gift or a curse or somewhere in between take it for what it's worth you know what I mean but um the main thing on this that I was going to get to this is a two-parter crunch all this into one video I'm going to have like four videos coming out today um so I did a I made brownies I made brownies that were made from I think eleven and a half grams of wheat I'm gonna put their clips of these videos in with this they're not going to have the typical backdrop in all the you know theatrics I think I'm in my top hat in a t-shirt so it's you got to bear with me on that but needless to say yeah try brownies I made him with like eleven and a half grams of flour and maybe like three grams of concentrate and wow those brownies were intense they weren't intense they just knocked me out they pretty much just did me in yeah that's pretty cool so um what had happen was to further explain what's going to take place in this video um so I made these brownies and I ate a brownie and I waited about 45 minutes as I was like edibles you know most things that you eat in you know edible form take about 40 minutes to kick in give or take 30 minutes 40 minutes 50 minutes so somewhere in that ballpark I had decided that the brownies were not going to work they won't do in the job so I went and I ate browning it wasn't a big mistake but it had the equivalency knock-back of eating close to 1/8 weed and no yeah that actually did me pretty good and uh you know later on in the video here's you could see me plastered to the couch I tried to record several videos more serious but I just kept laughing at myself so on the review for blood brownies I would say they definitely work eating marijuana works considerably oh that being stated the other half of this review I got some RSO some Rick Simpson oil professional-grade rumor has it this is the [ __ ] that cures cancer that comes in a syringe future bounty projects will be made with this and I will tell you why so okay I eat a lot of weed in the course of a week and it didn't bother me per se but like I I felt like I always had to taste the weed on me like in a different sense like I could always smell like the bacon brownies of weed brownies in my clothes you know what I mean because I hear baking them in my kitchen so that I don't know I mean there's some if I had a choice yeah and I'm not against the taste of weed but it was a very overpowering weed taste so I'm definitely gonna try to do it with RSO and um yeah you know we'll do some sugar cookies or something for the Yule celebration or whatever y'all celebrate I know Hanukkah started sometime I didn't get the memo um sorry about that respect but um I'll try to catch these holidays as I find out about them I know in Christmas is though it's uh I think I'll be doing a winter solstice special maybe on 12-21-12 around 12 21 18 sorry yes we'll do a winter solstice special and um yeah maybe eat some cookies or something so yeah the my personal review on the the baking edibles is that it's it's 100% I give to the point I've been eating this REI so almost regularly it's not something I thought I'd be doing but I do kind of like the body bows unfortunately I've been working out here lately and when I get done working out I'm not sure if it's it's like after I'm done working out and I go to that like sitting mellow out stage I feel achy as [ __ ] like trying to get up and I feel like completely blasted and worn and I don't know if it's the working out or if it's the combination of the the stuff I'll be eating yeah but I yeah that's my honest opinion if y'all get a chance I would definitely try making edibles if you don't do that sort of thing yeah decarboxylated my weed I think it was it like 200 degrees for an hour and 15 minutes maybe something like that um I did try to put it in a turkey bag I saw some things on there the turkey bag did work but it didn't really I don't know like it held us the head off with this I think it's going to smell no matter how you do it but I was trying to contain the flavors in the essence in in the material you know what I mean I didn't want all the good [ __ ] to bake away and maybe like 15 10 15 minutes after putting weed in aluminum and then in that in a turkey bag the turkey bag inflated very much and as soon as I grabbed it and flipped it it went flat so all my smell and all my flavor went out of it you know what I mean um so next time I do this I will definitely try maybe making a butter or something because like I say I don't mind the taste of it but it's eating 1/8 away today or close to it you know what I mean it's a lot of uh a lot of weed to eat and I'm not I don't know that I like that personally yeah yeah so whatever your folks get into this fine Friday I hope it's good I hope it's entertaining and from the bottom of my heart I hope you all do it safe because though times are tough out there it's Christmas people be struggling to get deals or just get around you know what I mean but that you all enjoy it's been an absolute pleasure from one stoner to the next Steve Stevenson over and out thank you folks couldn't do it without you peace hey Digital collective this is Steve Stevenson with Maryland marijuana review what's happening folks I know this is a bit of an impromptu video from a location that actually I'm waiting for my pets to come and attack me yeah my cat staring at me right now wondering what is going on so I'm gonna make this video quick about five or six minutes ago I finished making brownies I made brownies from 11 grams of marijuana ranging in the 23 percent THC range to knows a 3 or 2 or 3 grams of of premium concentrate yes all things considered these brownies should be fairly bonus we'll see how they go I wanted to start this video as a tutorial or maybe I'll put it somewhere in the middle of a video but um yeah this is the first time I've ever made brownies like this I've eaten brownies like this but they didn't do anything gotta be honest so yeah if this works I'll try to get a full tutorial or at least give my honest opinion on how well this project worked how well it came together again you folks enjoy it's been a pleasure Steve Stevenson over and out enjoy folks peace hey what's going on yes recap on what was going down it worked for sure ISM [ __ ] plastered to the couch I can be honest with you spiderwebs ain't got [ __ ] on this man spider-man [ __ ] with me", "2mraBnTUS38": "hello senior Stunna Fantas senior starter back at you and I want to talk about liquid pain relief that's right liquid pain relief I found some things that can make you feel good I don't know if they're gonna make pain go away but they'll make you smile and take take the feeling away that things are bad how's that these are triple hacks medicated drinks they're 300 milligrams in an 8 ounce serving and this is for medical use only and for example this is made with RSO Rick Simpson oil and one of the reasons that I bought these is because I have good success with Rick Simpson oil and they have made me feel distracted over the last couple of afternoons when I have used them one drink before lunch I'm gonna do it today as a matter of fact with you I've tried this also this is called loud house by SC labs and this is also 300 milligrams but I haven't found this to be as exciting and as comforting frankly on a personality side so I'm going to move that aside for the moment let's move that aside let's stay focused on the triple hacks lemonade the triple hacks half and half and the triple hacks t he might say looks like a kids box juice type of thing or it looks like something we had in day camp at snack time at rest period well this is a little bit different today what companies have come up with our ways to get the medicine into your bodies I've got some muffins with RSO in them I've got I believe a few gummy belts with RSO but Rick Simpson oil is a very unique type of concentrate and what it does it has an ingredient that I respond to so I bought these I respond to that ingredient I don't know what it does or how it interacts with my brain but it takes away my sadness and despair and anytime you could have something that would do that I bet you would buy a couple yourselves so I call these happy drinks senior stoners mrs. stoner will come home and say up what did you have because she'll know because the personality goes something uh it's just kind of a muddling through I'm making it through - you don't notice it anymore you don't notice it anymore so then what you do is you relax more and try to enjoy the people you're with more and the things around you more instead of dwelling on your pain so these xxx liquids are a wonderful way to get medicine into your body in a liquid form they taste good I highly recommend them so without further ado I'm gonna have my tea cheers everybody 300 milligrams of RSO it's also tasty which is a good thing delicious Jimmy nice really tastes like tea probably is tea with a little something extra right okay so let's call it what it is liquid pain

specifically those in the millimeter wave bands they are considered a sweet spot for 5g because there is a large amount of unused spectrum at these higher frequencies which have traditionally been the domain of military and aerospace systems using millimeter wave frequencies will allow more bandwidth to be allocated resulting in faster higher quality video and multimedia content technology advances that the millimeter wave frequencies are also making it possible for consumer devices to be manufactured economically enabling millimeter wave systems in 5g however will require overcoming the channel impairments and propagation characteristics of the high frequency bands additionally millimeter wave signals are susceptible to blockage from buildings and other structures making intelligent beamforming and beam tracking techniques necessities for 5g all of these factors are placing a great deal of pressure on engineers designing 5g chipsets and devices helping them solve these challenges our advanced test solutions from anritsu the MA 2806 a high-performance waveguide mixer can be integrated with the N ritsu ms 28:30 a spectrum analyzers signal analyzer to create a millimeter wave measurement solution that is a much simpler and cost-effective alternative to conducting fast measurements at higher frequencies it replaces legacy methods that use a Down converter that requires a separate mixer spectrum analyzer expensive microwave signal generator multiplier and other equipment the ms-20 830 a with the MA 2806 a can measure extremely weak signals at v-band frequencies that are typically missed by conventional measurement systems it can be configured to support spectrum masked measurements of one gigahertz bandwidth signals to eliminate image response effects such as displaying ghost signals that exist with conventional harmonic mixers and result in inaccurate measurements for research and development of a band device and components there is the vector star series anritsu employees patented monolithic microwave integrated circuit based non linear transmission line technology also known as shock line in these VNA's the result is high-performance broadband measurement capability in small modules making vector star ideal for high frequency designs vector star is also a valuable tool for engineers designing and developing high-power amplifiers that

10 cc's worse so I'll get back to you is how good it is from what the people say the dispensary it's the best around so we will find out here and it'll like for more more videos of any kind of body one babe cartridges", "Mj7PpES8NDs": "I can't a lovely here IG canna critic today talking to you about RSO oil I'm gonna be talking about noir stargenetics Rick Simpson oil and if you don't know a little bit about Rick Simpson oil Rick Simpson was a man who discovered that concentrated amounts of cannabis oil was able to cure his cancer people use RSO or cannabis oil for cancer for seizures for for chronic pain for inflammation for nausea they find that they can cook with it they can use it topically again concentrated cannabis oil means 60 70 80 % THC the best of the cannabis is taken and cooked down leaving you this sort of black goo be yummy Rick Simpson or RSO oil this has been all about the talk people are looking for it everywhere please please don't just buy it from somebody online it needs to be made out of pure cannabis bud if it's high CBD it needs to be made out of high CBD bud not see em oil so there is a big difference please educate yourselves email me and or ask somebody at a dispensary in California if you can what the differences are so today North Star genetics came out with their own version of Rick Simpson oil quite a bit of oil right here I would say probably two to three grains of rice as people say they tell you to start with a half to one grain of rice for me I eat two to three this is what I'm going to eat right now I just put it in my mouth and eat it yes it's ingested that's the way Rick Simpson works it's an ingested product if you watch Rick Simpsons video and he says you don't get high I'm sorry you do get high um you can take it at night like he suggests and that'll minimize that to get started with but you do need to start off small because you will feel the effects of the THC so back to Northstar they make two brands and this is still sold right now at Sonoma patient group on Cleveland in Santa Rosa California the THC version that they have is a 1000 milligram syringe it has 444 milligrams of THC and 25 milligrams of CBD Perce Rindge so that would be great but if you are using Rick Simpson oil for cancer I'd really recommend you look for a Rick Simpson oil or RSO oil that has both THC and CBD THC is the part of the cannabis that gives you that head high and CBD is the part that helps you with the medicinal benefits aches pains and tae Naja anti-seizure well in cancer THC helps tumors shrink and CBD helps tumors not grow so having a balance of the two or even talking to North Star genetics they've done some research that combining THC and the THC CBD combo giving it more of a four to one ratio seems to be really helping cancer patients who are trying to shrink tumors so you may want to play around with it but the understanding is is that you need to consume a lot of this stuff you start off small you start with a half a grain to a grain size of rice Rick Simpson says at night I encourage people to eat this oil in small amounts every four to six hours it helps the cancer cells not grow by consuming it more on a regular basis I would play with both the THC and CBD ratios the whole goal is to get and consume 60 to 90 grams of this to cure yourself of cancer so it is a big program it costs a lot to get started you can make it yourself we encourage you to make it yourself if you can't this is we're going to a dispensary like being a California 215 medical marijuana patient allows you the opportunity to go into a dispensary and buy it I would ask dispensaries if they have some kind of cancer program to help you with the cost but I highly highly recommend this especially if you were told there's no other options for you there's no other way we can help you please give Rick Simpson oil a try it can't hurt and if you have the opportunity and the willingness to I recommend that you do get started right away I hope this helps I love North Star genetics products they make top-quality products all of the time always lab tested these numbers are off the hook yeah if you just even want to make something with our our so oil I would suggest you give their products a try what I like is is it doesn't taste funky there's no aftertaste of alcohol like some of the RSO oils that I've tasted and it's just pure great concentrated cannabis medicine and I hope this video helps and educate you and please comment below I'll get back to you and happy to answer anything any questions that you have on RSO oil Rick Simpson oil or like I love to call it concentrated cannabis oil have a great day bye bye", "ozVuOlGZVbA": "[Music] [Music] so many people are suffering and dying these pharmaceuticals are not working when you and when you look at chemotherapy radiation as far as I'm concerned that's nothing that madness I mean why do people think that poison is good for them you know you take this poison that the medical system gave you all your hair [Music] [Music] very simple thing worldwide wonderful results it's just a matter of getting the abstract stabilized you know and making the medicine available to people at a reasonable cost and it's time for these governments to repeal these absurd laws I'm not talking the legalization or decriminalization those terms come with a lot of regulations and restrictions total repeal that's what's needed you'll extend repeal all of these absurd laws worldwide it's time to get the mankind back on the right track so maybe you're familiar with the term child it's wet from color I know these guys TV do you know them so that we have the situation that we have hands refugees in Colorado that people go to that state to treat their patients family relatives what do you think when you hear that is that the price have refugee well it's very disgusting that people would have to travel you know hundreds of thousands of miles to simply come to a place where it's legal I think there's so much Emilie's the emphasis being put on the CBE thing right now there's too much emphasis on I mean CBD does have its medicinal values I don't deny it but the extracts I they had very high levels of THC and if you look at all the research it was ever done in times with THC you know then mt8 to me I mean just like I said for cancer patients CBD does have some benefits but if you want to see the real healing power of these extracts don't forget you need high levels of THC it's all too simple anybody who said you can grow their own cannabis and they can produce their own extracts this is something to government pants stop you know the cap is under the bag and you know the future I think the future is very bright but I want to see this happen as quickly as possible because we have so many people suffering and dying just don't worry this is ridiculous plus he knew these people okay let's get them back on the right track this is what we have to do [Music]", "pS5hSLZ6Tqk": "all right so in today's video we're going to look at how to set up the cell advisor 5g as a carrier scan for a 5g nr signal so we'll hit the mode button in the upper left corner 5g nr signal carrier scan and i'm going to give this a name so we'll call it ca1 and we'll select carrier scan done once the measurement sets up you will need to set up the parameters in order to monitor up to eight different 5g signals for this video we're going to only monitor one signal so first thing we want to do is there's a small wrench in the bottom right corner we want to select that wrench we want to set our center frequency or our channel number to the 5g channel of choice i'm going to select 207 1675 apply and you'll see it automatically set the frequency form i'll hit the x to uh to get back to the main screen from here we just need to set up the parameters we're going to need to set for this signal so as before we will hit the preamp button i'm going to turn my attenuation to zero because we are dealing with millimeter waves and we want this machine as sensitive as possible i'm also going to turn on my dnc preamp to help increase the noise sensitivity lastly as we showed in our beam analyzer video we need to set up the bandwidth of the signal so i'll select the bandwidth button i'll select the bandwidth ssb field and i'm going to set this to the signal that we're going to look at and then for to this how-to we will do a millimeter wave or fr2 100 megahertz with a sub carrier spacing of 240 kilohertz once we do that the unit will start to scan for the signal takes about three seconds the first time it does it and then you'll notice you have very similar to the beam analyzer your pci your beam index as well as rsrp what's different in this unit is we also have an error vector magnitude measurement so on the screen here we'll monitor the strongest pilot in this case pilot 315 beam 13 with a evm of roughly 16 as you can see on the right side of the screen that'll give me my qpsk modulation and if you're interested you can also hit the mid button and look to verify you have a successful mid decode in practice you would then hit the wrench and set up your carrier number two so select carrier number one come over here to number two turn it on and again enter your channel number and or frequency uh to enter 207. and then it will start scanning the second channel and running the exact same measure x over here and that's our carrier scan functionality [Music] find out more at vicom's website you", "Hyhb5UDTAQE": "Hey everyone, welcome back its master-blaster and we're back at Johnny's green extractions Alright today, we're gonna show you how to make your own CBD edible oil, so if you have any arthritis Anxiety insomnia Back pain this might help you out. We're ready to start with our procedure As you can see we have a quart we're going to be working with a quarter pound of mazar-e-sharif I hope I pronounced that correctly because Where we live that was a highest CBD plant that we could find. I'm sure out in Colorado. There's a lot of Really high CBD plants. You could probably get out there What we're going to do is we're going to crush this up a little bit in our little bullet here and then we're going to fill up our 14-inch extraction tube And just show you some of the bud and it looks like It's filling up a little bullet now, we're gonna grind it a bit All right You guys I should mention that if you want to make your own medicine As far as CBD oil goes you have to work with a plant that is high in CBD You have to use a  marijuana plant, basically Indica sativa, whatever that has a high count of CBD because They can go up to at least 20% in these plants So that is crucial if you want to make effective medicine Almost make it like the material like you're all in a joint not too too fine Okay, we're getting close to the top we're gonna use These unbleached filters, I'm gonna put I'm gonna put three of them on So Get all the wheat off there all right, so We should probably stick these outside because we're sitting at minus 40 right now So you should end up if you order a machine like this You'll end up with some legs like this and the machine and I'm going to simply throw this together Set a legs and throw that bad boy in there Leave enough room for your can about right tighten their down And then we're going to add the can with the proper tip, which I have I Believe this is the one I was using that work quite well in there Strapper it alright, so this is ready to take outside and to Start blasting. We're gonna cool the tube off before we do it though, and then we're gonna throw we're going to throw three cans through 14-inch - Alright folks we're gonna set her off here outside This is the This is the juice. We got out of doing the extracting with the green machine. Now we've We've placed it on this element that is The spark resistant it's it's safe And I've set this to 160 F Normally, we don't do it that high for shatters and stuff but we're making a an edible CBD oil here and our next step here is going to be to decarboxylate it so that if you ingest it, you will get a medical effect from it and We're gonna do that at roughly 250 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 to 25 minutes Then we're gonna soak it up into little syringes and it'll be ready to apply under your tongue also, this process here was done without a perjure because of the amount of heat that we used that was sufficient enough to Let all the butane rise and escape So it's a pretty clean product. This is also the same way as you would make your butane honey oil If you didn't have a perjure, that's a great option for you That's it subscribe you guys thumbs up peace we'll see in the next video", "TSljVYnnQDw": "[Music] 2020 is going to be a very interesting year in proving out the capability from millimeter wave and a mobile handset at Corvo we've worked for several years now to enable infrastructure a millimeter wave based on P enabling technologies that we have in the handset side we also worked with many customers and platform providers to show the capability of millimeter wave of course it promises much greater data rate and throughput for users but it also has challenges with path lost cost and implementation so we'll see as multiple handsets ramped this year into the industry and they get into users hands will get real data on how they perform in the field and that will really determine the trajectory of the technology and the penetration rate of this new capability", "B8VBMurJI4w": "i'm ashley brennan founder of sabine holistic health sabina holistic health is a non-profit organization that helps medical cannabis patients with medicine costs cost is the biggest problem medical cannabis patients have with medical marijuana treatment we believe that all patients who need medical cannabis should have affordable access to it today i'm discussing using medical cannabis suppositories medical cannabis suppositories are cannabis infused oil in a suppository form that is inserted into the rectum while this may not sound like a very attractive way to use medical cannabis it can be absolutely necessary for some patients who can't inhale or ingest cannabis orally or those with extreme nausea and vomiting medical cannabis suppositories can be made very easily at home if they are not available at your dispensary so let's talk all about medical cannabis suppositories medical cannabis suppositories are small cone or bullet shaped substances that can be inserted either rectally or vaginally for women medical cannabis suppositories offer the best absorption rate of all methods of using medical cannabis no cannabinoids or terpenes are lost with suppositories cannabinoids and terpenes may be lost through heating cannabis in inhaled methods or through digestion in ingested methods suppositories are felt quickly usually within 15 minutes after being inserted the effects of a suppository feel the same as when cannabis was smoked or vaporized however the effects last much longer than inhaling cannabis using suppositories the effects will last between four to eight hours when inhaling cannabis they can only last about two hours because of how the medical cannabis suppository is inserted into the rectum or vagina these are often considered an exotic form of using cannabis although this form of marijuana may be considered exotic for some it is necessary for others medical cannabis suppositories are excellent choices for delivering medical marijuana to patients who can't take medication orally due to extreme nausea or vomiting or due to a throat injury that prevents them from taking oral medications medical cannabis suppositories can also be very effective in treating rectal conditions such as hemorrhoids rectal or pelvic diseases or inflammatory bowel diseases medical cannabis suppositories are also good for elderly patients who can't take or swallow pills or those on restricted diets who can't use other methods while medical cannabis suppositories may not be a preferred choice by many they offer superior absorption of cannabis and are essential for patients who can't use cannabis in any other form or those who suffer from certain medical conditions medical cannabis suppositories may not be available at all dispensaries especially those new to medical marijuana if they are available they range from about five dollars to thirty dollars medical cannabis suppositories are available in some states with more developed medical marijuana programs such as dispensaries in california but definitely not available in all areas at this time medical cannabis suppositories can be easily made at home in a short amount of time if they are not available to you use the link in the description for a guide to making your own suppositories all you need to make suppositories are cannabis infused oil and suppository molds if you have the oil prepared suppositories can be made in only five minutes if you need to make the cannabis infused oil it will take several hours but it is fairly quick considering you can make a good quantity at a time upwards of 50 or more medical cannabis suppositories are also good for one year if you make them using the recipe linked in the description they should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator so check out that link if medical cannabis suppositories aren't available to you and you would like to make your own the downside to medical cannabis suppositories is they may feel uncomfortable during insertion and they can leak during a bowel movement or with flatulence it is recommended that you use medical cannabis suppositories at a time when you are not experiencing gas or expecting to have a bowel movement medical cannabis suppositories should be firm and cool when they are inserted they should be kept in the refrigerator if the suppository is not firm when ready to be used it can be placed in the freezer until it becomes firm usually after a few minutes medical cannabis suppositories should be inserted with clean hands or medical gloves they should be inserted around 1 to 1.5 inches into the rectum the effects of a medical cannabis suppository will depend on the strain used to make the suppository there are some considerations if you are buying medical cannabis suppositories or choosing a strain to make your own suppositories the first thing to consider is the thc and cbd in a strain medical cannabis suppositories and their effects will feel very similar to inhaled cannabis so if you're familiar with a strain that you use in inhaled forms it would provide the same effects in a suppository high thc suppositories or strains will produce euric effects high cbd suppositories or strains will be non-intoxicating one-to-one thc to cbd suppositories or strains may produce mild euphuria or none at all depending on the person a 10 to 1 ratio or higher of cbd to thc will completely eliminate any intoxicating effects one-to-one ratios are good for patients who need higher levels of thc but don't prefer the high of thc you can also consider other cannabinoids and terpenes in a strain and their medical applications to help you better treat your symptoms find a complete downloadable chart of all the cannabinoids and terpenes and their medical uses using the link in the description this can help you in choosing a medical strain to treat your condition no matter what method you are using after determining the thc and cbd ratios and other cannabinoids or terpenes based on the euphoric effects and the levels needed to treat your condition you can look at strain types indica sativa or hybrid indica strains are relaxing and sedative and best for nighttime use sativa strains are energizing and best for daytime use hybrid strains are popular choices for balanced effects of energizing and relaxing depending on the strain these are things to consider when using suppositories or any other method and just generally good recommendations for choosing a medical strain medical cannabis suppositories can be used by all patients but are especially beneficial for those who can't or don't want to use oral methods for elderly or young patients and in treating gastrointestinal or rectal conditions suppositories work quickly and last long offering the best absorption of all methods of using medical marijuana use the links in the description for resources to make your own suppositories

is now now [Music] [Music] rick simpson the godfather of cannabis oil was a guest at the cannabis Liberation Day in Amsterdam the Canadian cannabis oil producer put the medicinal use of cannabis on the worldwide map over the years he has treated many patients and he even claims to cure cancer with cannabis i cured my own cancer years ago three spots never came back since in 2003 to 2009 I treated over 5,000 people and since that time too and we had the information on the Internet I mean I get emails every day from people that you know I read read your information three years ago my father was dying I made the extract I treated him he's still alive today cancer free that's a pretty good feeling Rick Simpson is symbolic of a new group of users of cannabis who arose in the Netherlands the medicinal consumer this new cannabis consumer may also want to make use of the relaxing effects of cannabis but is mainly focused on it's beneficial medicinal effects first off I think we all have the right to grow this plant and produce some medicine for ourselves there should be no issue about that but if someone wants to produce the extracts on a grand scale and provide it to the public that would have to be regulated like quality control and standards would have to be maintained beyond that no regulations are needed I say the people should control it the eighth cannabis

the drug I want to perfect these oils there's our extracts to their highest healing levels and I want to do it as quickly as possible I know how I know how to produce these extracts now with no solvents at all and you know let's get this medicine out there to the people and I'm hoping in the near future to get a project underway and maybe with the help of some of these seed companies if they'll provide me with some good strong indicas to begin you know the project with I think that we can bring this I know we can bring this up to much higher levels in a very short period of time that the bill knows that I have two years ago I didn't believe that it was a medicine whatsoever thought it was a way for the Americans to sell marijuana and like a hidden coffee shop you know to call it in dispensary and then sell the marijuana how wrong was I here because I really see now that people coming to me and that I don't know and I'm helping with my products and they telling me that I'm helping them and that's unbelievable with the growing rise of the medicinal user who had previously no bond with this plant seems to grow rapidly the human right to the use of appropriate medications could open the way to legalization in the Netherlands in the past years I've seen a lot of patients that 95% of them starts with saying that they never used drugs before and that they don't know anything about cannabis and after I thought them what I want to teach them and after they had some experience with cannabis oil the the biggest Pro cannabis activists that you can imagine and they will change the world for us they will win the war on cannabis for us and how long will it take you think oh I think another five or ten years may be your source of cannabis use Oh [Music]",

only walked out the iris over again so I like to play with it see what it's like and I realized maybe you would like to see what it's like to so rather than it being in the tube I want to take a little bit out for you see how we go comms is an oil and slugs were on the plate and we get it down close to it it is Gary Glitter bugs on it I people see that glitter on everywhere this stuff is absolutely magical just got all the cannabinoids inside it all the oils has come from the plant just therefore pure utter medicine then there's this helps anyone out there where you can see it spread out they'd see someone on the last comments and what's it like when you spread it out that's what I see when I spread out did see the comment in the last one probably what ever inspired me to put it

might help them yeah sure let me just turn this", "XQMHIiu1JFs": "hello I'm venom 4:20 and today I'm gonna be showing you how to make caviar [Music] before we get started with anything else let's go ahead and take a quick dab so one of the big keys to how I'm showing you to do this for cheap is because I'm showing you how to do it with some reeds and you'll notice when you take a nice low temp dab you're gonna have a little bit of reuse I tend to keep mine in this little jar just like that got that out of the way so first off the things you're gonna need are some nugs something to do this over I'm using some parchment paper you're gonna need a little Bowl or a little dish to hold the key then you're gonna need the actual Keeffe itself just from the bottom of three-part grinder you're gonna need some type of oil to cover the nugs in so the idea is you're going to be covering the nugs and oil then rolling them and Keith this is all stuff I have already at home but it's even better to use like honey oil another good one you can use is distillate another good one is rosin and you're also gonna want some gloves too because this is going to be a sticky mess at some point so it's then good to sticky in here [Music] so now the goal is to wrap this whole bud in oil let's go ahead get this going and we'll just take a nice see there [Music] see that's just pretty gettin towed it already just coat it as much as you can [Music] now that's fully coded and then we're just going to take our little jar keep like that and we're just going to start pressing it down just like that [Music] [Music] and now it's probably starting to look a lot like something you've said you know we're expecting [Music] that is what I'm talking about right there that is a fully formed ball perfectly round Moonrock for you oh one down we're gonna go ahead and do this one more time I'm gonna go a little bit lighter on it than I did last time because this one's like a little bit like a play-doh ball you know it's it's too soft [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah that one's this one's mostly hash oil kind of the difference is a little bit this one feels a lot better just a little bit less oil I spread it out a little bit more even this one has a bunch better texture as this one's like a [ __ ] gooey mess I put on so much hash oil but it's just I mean look at that that's too much there's a little nugge pot in there but I mean not much so I'm actually I break that little tiny piece and make it its own little moon rock so that guy too he's an hour like it's so so and this one I can I'm just flying away that's just so like kief so oh yeah but way to get my channel on this one I am like I'm just pulling off the hash oil and rolling it in the key I think I'm creating my own new thing right now I'm calling these comments with AK a little venom comments and that's just pure hash oil and Keith rolled into a little low ball making new things the cat see Ziggy likes a chef I'm just glad he's sleeping on the chair next to me and not [ __ ] getting involved with this one cuz it's too messy those are cool they feel like a little like candies or something a little caramel balls but they're just pure oil drops rolled and Keith from the excess I had made off that moon rock just pulling it off now that I pulled off all that hash oil look how much smaller that is I was able to take all of that off of that by pulling out so I weigh over did the oil you don't want to do that because that actually sucked like this one and this one now are like perfect you got these perfect ones so now these ones have like a great consistency and these are kind of cool I like these little new inventions I came up with I'm sure it's been done I'm sure someone's had it if anyone knows about these put it in the comments below and tell me if anyone has a name form or anything like that because if not I'm coin in that [ __ ] they're little little comments but okay so got your moon rocks here and now these ones feel really good they're really solid and they're gonna break apart fine we got this little mini moon not here another way I like to do it is to take all that oil we got it and just start spreading it onto there we're gonna touch it for two seconds and really [Music] it's got all these little chunks honey there yeah Randy the same thing just go spread it over anything it sticks to alright so there you go that's another way to do it right there to is to take a paper cover it in oil cover it and keep and there you go I've heard these called caviar or moon rocks I think moon rocks is more of a thing that's been coined to a certain brand I think it's corrupt its corrupts moon rock that's it yep so I believe that technically moon rock is coined by that guy and that's like a brand that he grows and that's his thing so technically this is all caviar so let's let's clear that up I've been calling it moon rocks and a little insider knowledge on that as well as when caviar was first coming out I need someone who had you know the hens had just a dispensary they knew what was going on in there they worked there and he always told me not to get caviar and I'm like why and he's like well okay did the coming Aaron type thing is like the thing is is sometimes we get bud that's just really really shitty it looks like [ __ ] there's no crystals it just doesn't really do much for us so what they started doing is rolling it in oil rolling it in Keith and hiding it just like you know you could take something that's not very good and turn it really good you know what I mean you could take pretty much swag and make it besa got one more thing for you now the last one we're going to do is something called Sun rocks so what we're gonna do is actually instead rolling it in Keef we're going to roll it in all this and you'll see how there's all these shards they actually work a lot better if it wasn't so [ __ ] warm right now and every time you break it up you know there's a little tiny shards all over the place little flecks so we're actually going to be using that we have that all piled up put that to the side I'm gonna steal one last rap [Music] he's pretty much covered now we're gonna go ahead and take that and start rolling it [Music] [Music] [Music] and then you got one of those guys it's like a quantum Jim Rohn [Music] [Music] [Music] this is an OG Mike Montgomery double bubble bubbler Mike Montgomery is one of the original artists at the Chong glass company and this is a UV one it lights up really nice I'd like to eventually own a piece by like all the dudes who used to work there let's go ahead and load one of these [ __ ] up so I'm gonna go ahead and break that apart you can see it just [Music] crumbles and there you got the layers like to give a special thanks out to mr. Chuck I'm gonna put a link to his Instagram he helped me acquire this bad boy I love this thing so it's got the Homer smoking a blunt [ __ ] Satan Flanders to Satan Flannery's I should say and playboy Oh Marge oh yeah that's [ __ ] awesome awesome piece awesome moon rocks again gather so it was a little son rock here made ourselves some new little comments I don't know if that's a thing and also just I think the easiest way is to just roll it on paper and smoke it that way a lot of people put down the outside of the paper but that's kinda I feel like for show more which is fine sometimes because it's cool to can I don't look at it do its thing you know but it makes a mess I think when it's on the inside it only makes sense anyway so that's how I make my own caviar for next to nothing that's all from reuse I saved from my dabs and put my jar for later it's all from Keef that I collected on the bottom of the three-part grinder and it's from you know just any type of bud you want to use like I said I like making it myself because I know what ingredients this is the cheapest way to do it not the best you know what I mean you know all stuff that we've collected now if you get some really good distillate or some really good rosin or you know all these different ingredients you can make it yourself and excellent excellent quality this is just a really awesome link to experience if you even like it again super awesome thank you to everyone who helped make this happen thank you to everyone who watched go ahead and let me know how you like to make it I'm sure this is kind of an

got a lighter which I do this is a nice belt by the way I highly recommend it Dicky's you probably can't see the logo there it's kind of worn out but uh this is good leather made in China Dicky's belts are pretty good highly recommended it's almost like a straw you guys want to see my strop it's pretty cool I'll show you another time all right so back to the discussions at hand I'm searching for patients who are cancer patients that have decided to not undergo conventional treatment and instead attempt alternative measures specifically Rick Simpson oil if you know anybody out there who is like that you need to contact them right away and tell them to contact me in May we're planning it's sort of still a bit uh know in the preliminary stages but I'm expecting somebody in May to come to Philadelphia in order to speak to my patients who I have that decided to not undergo conventional treatment and instead choose the Rick Simpson option putting my belt back on done and the reason that that we need these people is because it's for a study that we're doing and and it's very important and we're gonna have a lot of things going on at the time and the general theme of May is going to be cancer because of this amazing person who will be visiting us in Philadelphia we are going to be very very fortunate to have this particular person coming to our area let's just say they're flying in from out of the country and they're kind of a big deal the thing is I need to provide them as many of these types of patients as possible and the results of this paper that's going to be published or written is gonna be it's gonna have an effect for years to come and we're gonna have talks and discussions where patients can come and it'll be public you know public forums and it's gonna be really exciting so who is this person I'm just gonna say it it might not happen still because it's very very preliminary and just in kind of an idea but I sense that it's gonna be a very powerful idea and one that gains a lot of momentum the person that's coming is going to be Rick Simpson's wife Daniela and she's got to be treated like a goddamn queen when she's here because she is the lady of a very important person if you don't know who Rick Simpson is then look him up he is known as as someone who created Rick Simpson oil concentrate for Canada for a cancer treatment that apparently has had tremendous success in the grassroots medical community and I believe in it I very much do and so the creators wife is coming to America and she's coming to Philly and so dr. Roman is gonna be hosting and making sure that everything is perfect and that not only does she get what she needs but the patients get what they need from her and what she can provide to them will be available that's why we're gonna have discussions we're gonna have talks we're gonna have people I'm already contacting some high-level people to see if they want to come and take part in this and and also to help me reach out to as many cancer patients as possible because we need just you know she's coming here and specifically to research the patients that are choosing Rick Simpson oil above conventional treatment so please guys help me find the patients that are like that out there I don't know how many there are there are some and we got to make sure that we spend as much time as we can from now to make recruiting such people I don't recommend necessarily recommending that they don't do alter you know traditional cancer treatment but keep your eyes out for those who have values that are different from that and tell them to come on over because Rick Simpson Brooks Simpson's wife Daniela Daniela Simpson will be coming here as part of a big study so exciting stuff I gotta say that was kind of a cool thing that came up today thoughts anybody everybody know that guy messages retracted left in a rain I could have swore you as a PA doctor I am my Friday night oh it's Friday night right now I totally forgot not that I forgot I just it doesn't mean anything to me Friday night hasn't meant anything to me in years years and years weekends you mean the time when things are a little slower during the week and I can get more work done that's all it is to me yeah Friday night let's go get trashed and party no how about we smoke a J on the stream update the viewers on what's going on in today's world of Nature's Way medicine and get back to you know end a day routine crap like vacuuming and cleaning up and arranging things for tomorrow's doctor Turgeon PTSD day because once a month doctor Turgeon comes to nature's main medicine to see our PTSD patients and to help approve them for marijuana if they are deemed to find a benefit potentially so tomorrow's that day and I'll be here and if you were planning to see me in Philly tomorrow ah hold up I'll see you Sunday how about that I'll be in the office Sunday to make up for it and then Monday and Tuesday and then we go back to the five-day street thing stay boy no it ripped no I've never had that happen before these are lame papers anyway not a fan I think it'll still smoke I'll show you where I ripped in a second good this just got a little bit more packed it's basically a perfect roll except for this little tear that is a little bit of a tear when I pushed that crush in deeper oh it's popping out even more maybe I can make the crutch reach the tear so it won't even bother it well that is a super tightly rolled J I mean I wish I could prove to you how tight it is like really ridiculously packed one of the probably the tightest one I've ever rolled no wonder it exploded at the bottom we can fix that right well patch it up boom wow this is the nicest J ever yeah we so if you want to patch up a little hole like that take the sticky part of the paper and just get it put it on top you know that part you can even put it on top dry and lick over it Oh God no more of a problem holy crap this is such a good Jay I love it it's just so tight I've rolled it up quick too sick great all right I like to wet a little bit around the edges it helps it light a little bit more even just dampen it a little bit of along the edges and then lay it on fire just like the loud that's inside that paper by yeah alright other news we had one of the dispensaries come through the clinic today nature's be medicine in Philly mm-hmm Terra vida was kind enough to stop by the clinic and update us on what's going on what their plans are and the news for the dispensaries when they're opening what the when the products are gonna be available and they dropped off some awesome brochures tri-folds things like that for us to give to the patients who are wondering about where the local dispensaries are around Philly I'm surprised that the other dispensaries haven't done that so much I know that integrative restore I believe is the name shout out to Steve oh what's up dawg they have they've done it you know they haven't given me brochures actually they gave me a nice nice holiday gift package even with some amazing I believe Korean cakes and deli delicatessen slash pastries but nobody else has so I'm surprised about that everybody's going to Terra Vita I guess from from nature's we medicine yo do you hear about Terra Vita check it out brochures there you go we're Shores for everybody they got three locations they had one on stead in Avenue in Philly but unfortunately that got shut down because of the local community it's like some jackass that was causing a stir you know a big stir about it but they got a new location in Malvern which is also a great location there are very few dispensaries within the city limits I believe the only one planned is integrated restore I hope that's the name I can't remember sorry steveo everybody's got pretty lame names for dispensaries except one no two there's two awesome names for dispensaries out there in in Philly I think actually Terre Vitas number three so we'll give it to them cuz that's a good good name I don't know what it means I think it means earthlife Terra as in terrain Earth I'm assuming that means like Earth veida like I think that means life somebody correct me if I'm wrong it's called etymology the origin words people so um what else was going to talk about oh yeah no totally forgot never mind lost it couldn't have been that important alright so we can talk a little bit about when they're gonna be opening things like that apparently Bethlem Pennsylvania has the only dispensary that's open can of something oh yeah I was gonna talk about what the best dispensary names were number one in Pennsylvania is Firefly best name number two is what was it [ __ ] called now I'm forgetting it's like it's like justice grown or something like that somebody help me out here what's the name of the dispensary or thought yet the dispensary it's like justice grown something like that it's a real powerful name then it's terribie after that I got to add the Malvern dispensary from Tara Vita to my dispensary map that's on nature's way medicine calm check it out if you haven't already guys can you do me a favor go to that website Nature's Way medicine calm and tell me if it's still because this is actually something I just figured out that was happening didn't realize if it's still giving you like a unsafe script warning in the browser I'm pretty sure this has been happening since September which means that my google analytics have been fighting the current swimming against the current this whole time since November when everything is just still December is rocking it so what happens when I don't have a you know warning this site is a hacker site for a couple of months you know when that just stops in fact it's not even released not only gonna stop I got so pissed off when I realized that was happening that I spent all night last night with comodo credit agencies and in myself going through business incorporation documents as well as other things in order to get a stupid blue or Susan a green bar at the top of the page that says you know nature's we medicine like secure oh [ __ ] my point is about the dolly no we're gonna have to listen I'm gonna just pop right back on when it Oh side please don't die on me it's going to though okay first thing I got to do right away is turn down the brightness down to zero that's the only thing they would see cuz the screen light is the brightness of the screen I'm pretty sure is like 50% of the battery life in most phones at least that's what it seems to me when I look at my settings god I love this long cord it's so awesome so you want to turn off this screen / dim it as much as possible and what do you think little music or something or or we cool I wouldn't mind not having to think about sound levels am i loud enough should I turn it down you know that again what do you guys prefer the pimped-out streams that I have with you know 420 smoke and background music Devon you know the mike song but about half the time in the beginning is spent on is it working and like every 20 minutes I'm like oh [ __ ] the camera and running over to fix it or do you prefer the more boring no music I'm talking streams but it's just it just works until the battery dies no no quick nurse call code nevermind he's back I don't know why I made it an ahi this could be a female joint her joints more feminine hey any Spanish speakers out there me latina chicas but if I thought let me know what the word is for jointed and I want to know if his fin you know feminine or masculine let us know we all know what marijuana is of course you got to have a female plant right to make the marijuana cannabis on the other hand gender neutral essentially almost more of a Man Thing but Jenner neutral because it's just that means the form of the plant used for industrial purposes Oh", "hwhUjdXVwyY": "I hope my YouTube subscribers so I wanted to go ahead update you guys it's officially now one month and three days since I started the Rick Simpson oil protocol also known as fecal full extract kind of a soil so definitely I've been taking it very very well I'm taking a lot more so I'm going to show you guys at the end of the video how much I'm consuming now at this 4 plus week mark basically over a month so the goal that I'm trying to achieve here is to get an undetectable thyroglobulin number on my blood work I just recently did blood work on Friday and on Saturday morning so I'm gonna get those results this week I'm not sure if I'm gonna use that too much because I barely have a month using our so so I'm not really gonna expect an undetectable number because that's what I'm aiming for and that's what the doctors are aiming for and in order for them to classify me as cancer-free also in their terms it is called disease-free or no sign of disease which is NSD so I'm trying to get no sign of disease in my body at this time and the only way that will be for sure no that is if we check the thyroid globulin numbers and they basically have to be undetectable right now I'm at zero point zero zero point zero three okay I have to be at nothing basically the blood work shouldn't even be putting any number on that part of the blood work if it's gonna be considered undetectable so I'm going to show you guys a chart of what I've been going through these past few months as far as my numbers so on the first in the beginning of this year which is January 2018 which is the first line where it says TG that stands for thyroid globulin so sorry globulin was 37.6 in January which is realistic because at that time I didn't have the neck dissection yet I still had a lot of lymph nodes that had positive for papillary cancers so you know we had to go based on newer results as you can see as the time went on March it was 3.2 that's literally a few days a week after actually a week after my neck dissection okay so that's a huge improvement from 37.6 to 3.2 but I have to be undetectable so as you see I win from 3.2 to 0 which is great this is great so even though that I have great numbers here the doctors for some reason still wanted me to do external radiation immunotherapy of course I did go ahead and get a first opinion I mean a second and a third opinion the first opinion was the aggressive way which is to give me more radiation as I explained in the other video I sought a second opinion and the second opinion says well we don't need to do radiation right now let's just do it me no therapy immunotherapy is literally like for my understanding so far is and basically infusions so injections and infusions into your body to help with your immune system and I learned about this when my second opinion doctor sent me an authorization for his services even though I didn't actually tell him that wasn't do it I just said I'll think about it and here prove me for this all these services which is crazy like look at all these codes for immunotherapy well I'm not gonna do it either because my third opinion says I don't need it I'm too young for all of that to happen right now my numbers are looking great as you guys saw that my numbers have dropped that's why it's a good idea till we seek second and third opinions so for my third opinion I went to USC CAC Medicine and they literally looked at my whole case because my case is a little like fluctuated because of the way that they treated me and that radiologist agreed with me that it's okay for me to be to the beast going under active surveillance I don't need to do radiation he says that it's too it's too harming for my for me as cuz I'm too young he performs that external radiation every single day that's what he does and he says that the side effects from that are gonna be a lot worse for me so it's better not to do that I don't my cancer is literally like slow growing now but it's all at least I know it's always available if I run out of options or if I find out that Rick Simpson oil didn't help or something happens and and if I have terrible symptoms and maybe I'll consider it in the long long final run but I'm not gonna let these doctors get to my head tell me I need all this stuff when in fact I actually do not so I'm happy that I sought those authorizations I was complaining with the insurance letting them know hey you know this isn't fair you know I need to get where I want to be I need to go with a doctor that's updated with the most recent information based on my complicated case and they ended up saying that yeah we'll send you there after a big fight they ended up approving me to go there so I had to fight to get there just wanted to give you guys some insight about how I got to my third opinion don't give up if you feel like you're being pressured by your doctor or any new doctor you barely even know the doctor do not always just take their advice there's nothing wrong with getting a second even a third opinion take your time you know because honestly now that I've learned this much I really wish I would have done this when I first got diagnosed like I really wish then that I would have sought a second opinion and got everything like my first surgery like done well instead of having two different surgeries things would have been a little bit I mean a little different but I learned and Here I am like still you know going through it so that's my advice to everybody if you feel like pressured by a doctor or telling they're telling you that you need an aggressive treatment or anything that doesn't sit well with you go ahead and seek another opinion sometimes they won't tell you about other options that may help you or maybe open to you don't give up you know there's just too much you know information out there you can easily like ask them anything and don't let them rush you and also bring your documents this is literally a whole year years worth of imaging and everything since I got diagnosed so I don't play around I have everything so that when I wanted a doctor they have no excuses I have it all you know so that's that's my insight and my advice on getting yourself proper diagnosis proper treatments and proper care because we all deserve it I also wanted to share with you guys that I did get my state medical marijuana card I got it obviously you know to have my back up and just to pretty much have it on hand since this is related to a medical condition so it looks like this it doesn't have any information on it as far as your private information it only had identified you as an ID number and an expiration date so it looks like this so that's ID number myself and then the Department of Public Health so I recommend getting it just for backup there are gonna raise the prices of your in California eventually so you can have this and they'll take away the tax and also I may be seeking for further for future positions and I wanted to just be able to present it even if you know marijuana still considered illegal under federal law but still I wanted to make sure that any employer that hires me I'm gonna be you know ingesting oil by then I'm sure so I'm gonna be positive for marijuana so I just wanted to make sure I covered all my bases and you know it's just good to always make sure that when you're out there ingesting it you know try to hop back up otherwise if you don't need it then it's fine all right so here are the syringes I mentioned in the first video that I didn't that I said I didn't order separate syringes what I meant is that I didn't get separate 15 of these single grams there's literally there was 10 grams in here or 10 milliliters okay this right here was at the 10 I have now consumed 1 2 3 4 5 grams 5 milliliters of Rick Simpson oil efficiently so I keep this one by the kitchen the fat one because I eat I'm passing by the kitchen most of the times I'll eat this and then I have one upstairs in my room this one has 5 milliliters also known has 5 grams so I probably haven't jested like what 2 grams yeah that's to 2 grams so and in basically a month in 3 days what I've adjusted 7 grams so that means I need I need to order 45 more grams so that's like almost over $100 worth but I'm doing it little by little because it's a financial thing I'm not working right now so I got to get it little by little but I'm glad but I'm trying it out I'm really really striving for this and I'm gonna show you guys how much I am now in taking but definitely and the first video I also mentioned that I was putting in bread cuz I was getting to know the texture getting to know the oil getting to know the way it's gonna get stuck on my teeth now I understand why people just take it out and then they put it under their tongue and let it sit there a while and then and then you can just eat it so I've been doing that so I don't have to get bread plus I don't even eat bread like that so I just was like I thought I'll just do it that way it was it's faster plus when I'm on the go or something also yeah and I now I adapted now I can have a dose in the morning and I don't not not even my eyes are red not even and my feeling I'm nothing I just feel like a totally normal sober when I hit my 2nd or almost to my third dose that's when I feel the high of the day so I wait till the end of the day to because I already know I'm done working I'm sorry doing errands are working out or doing whatever then that's when I will take the rest so if you think you know you're gonna be really really really faded yeah you probably will be in the first few weeks I can say around third to fourth week fine like I can hit this all day and I'm fine nothing you know nothing will happen also it's really really oily like it literally sticks and it looks like this like [ __ ] oil straight up so this is how much I can now take so I'll be before I started here which was like a little dose now I can take this much or more but I can pretty much take this lunch and then I just put it under what's on there you go I'm just leaved there wearing it a little bit nice hole oh this is pretty good so used to it I totally get why people are saying that it really helps them like I'm really glad I found you know this protocol that people have been doing I really hope it works for me and I really hope it works for you so if you have any questions or anything like that let me know I'm gonna probably update another video maybe in a few weeks or a month I don't know whatever you if you guys have any suggestions let me know I'll probably do another one like a two month follow-up because this is literally what like 90 days that I'm supposed to be doing this so stay tuned guys I'm gonna go ahead and keep updating if there's anything else you guys want me to talk about or I didn't clarify or anything like that let me know because I know a lot of us that have hot thyroid cancer or have current Theret cancer is very confusing and all that so I'll see you guys later enjoy your guys's day bye", "czBc55tXjqI": "along here buddy and I'm making a little RSO and I'm so mad I got leaf material in it I think I need to stop and strain

set it for 45 minutes now take the cannabis and place it into the oven and then set the clock for 45 dirt now take the but shake right and add the MCT oil until it just soaks it this is enough so you can swish it around if you want it really potent this is how you do it we're going to put too much in and you take this put it in a pot of water and boil it for about 30 minutes now take the MCT oil and but shake place it in the pot that's half full of water and let it boil for half an hour put it in before it starts boiling so you don't break the jar let it heat up slowly with the water I'll leave it boiling like that for half an hour pick it up and swirl it around every once in a while be careful where I met don't drop it let's make it slippery be careful now take your cannabis infused

can see I'm doing the vertical video this time because it'd be easier to shoot how I'm doing the brownies today it's not very easy as she was on Tilly for that so I am starting to make a little late so I and I'm still finishing up watching my I think it's called a week with John I know I'm political revolution as I was watching earlier on my video I'm playing it mostly so that there's background noise for the neighbors because I don't want them day here with him recording about it so I'm just going to turn the camera and get started because I usually try to use different kinds of medication because I never had very much of each time this time I'm not going to use any Keith I was able to get a bottle of the medicated canola oil at my dispensary so I planned on using some of that as well as the RSO that I got I was recommended this by one of the dispensaries that I could put this in edibles and it would work a lot better with edibles so I decided to try that and I looked up on YouTube how to make edibles with our so and what he I believe it was I will link I will link the video I used in the description because I don't remember his name it was mudflap but I don't remember where his channel was so anyway I'm going to infuse the RSL with the oil and I'm just hoping it'll work well because in his video he shortening or coconut oil I'm going to pause the video and I'm hoping against hope that this doesn't give ruin because he actually used a double boiler when he melted the the coconut oil and put this in it I have it turned down as always like you turn it without it being heated up enough I'm hoping this will melt so I'm gonna put this on it and this is actually supposed to be one gram I believe and it's $40 here so it's gonna be allowed as I waste and again we were to waste it well you can see this here but we're thinking about trying this I'm used to having it looking down at the stove so this is different but it's infused trust me are so into the oil stuck to the phone anyway I'm guessing it's fine it just got stuck to the sorry guys there's just I think it cracked open somewhere cuz it's all wet anyway let me move on to the next day weird correct them yet not correct eggs and okay I'm gonna pause just for a minute so I can get all this stuff okay so I also had to add three tablespoons of water no it's all mixed up as much as I can mix it there's still some of the water that's kind of not wanting to mix in but pretty much done trying to keep in mind that you guys are watching here about three dollars so I got this whisk in a smaller spatula let's do it my gosh I still want to get a couple other things to keep my videos these are pretty thick I'm hoping I can spread them out far enough just cover the pan I don't have any other pan the small when I was using was borrowed so now I'm using this one just use a smaller pan it's easier I thought maybe I would be able to use this one so they would be thin right crispier babies you guys can here's our bathing room that's cuz my neighbor's moving out okay got it for the most part bread oh I try to get all of them okay it says for the biggest pan size 26 to 28 minutes so I'm gonna check it in 20 minutes just because it's so thin hopefully the camera stay so while I'm waiting for the bonus to get and I'm gonna take a quick break with my clear concentrates pear flavor and my CBD pen and their muscle watching coral reef first on Sunday from today while I book cloud there hope to blow juice my favorite kind of juice [Music] [Music] you smell pretty good it's no pretty strong probably and I will let you know how they turn out probably my snapchat my twitter peace up", "75uA97peU98": "On RSO suppositories RSO stands for Rick Simpson oil which is a concentrated form of cannabis made using an alcohol extraction process It comes in about a 1 gram syringe, so it'll look something like this and can find at most dispensaries What you find with suppositories is you get extended pain relief that lasts for a very long time without being Unable to function throughout your day one hour patients come in they're usually treating something like Crohn's disease or they have a severe lower back pain or sciatica or Sometimes they'll even use suppositories to deal with their menstrual cramps as well When making suppositories, what you're going to need is your RSO coconut oil or cocoa butter or some combination thereof? You're going to need you're suppose to Tory molds a syringe or a funnel something that you can pour the suppository into the mold with you're gonna need a heating element and you're also going to need a freezer and Plastic gloves for the end as well. The ratio I'm going to be using is with coconut butter I'm gonna be having about a hundred grams of coconut butter. You can also use cocoa butter or a combination thereof whatever combination works best for you a Hundred grams of coconut butter looks about like this And the first thing I'm going to be doing is taking it and actually getting it liquid So I'm going to be throwing it into the stove here and heating it up on low heat The coconut butter will melt very quickly. So you need it on a low temp so you're not burning it Again, the ratio I'm using right now is about a hundred grams of coconut butter to 1 gram of RSO Some places we'll have our so available in 10 grams. This is one gram right here as You can see this is kind of like a more runny consistency here So it's gonna be a little hard to get all out at once so this is just What it looks like when you're combining the RSO? with the coconut butter as you can see It starts to get a little more of just like an overall brownish greenish color to it You just want to make sure that when you're stirring it up here that you're not seeing any clear lines It wants to be thoroughly mixed This is the color that the RSO and coconut butter turned out for me for my suppository mix If you use coconut oil or cocoa butter or a combination of any of those oils or if you even use two grams So instead of one you're gonna have some color variation and that's okay Okay, so as you can see here, what I have ready to go is the RSO is really mixed. Well with that coconut butter So what I'm going to be doing next is I'm going to be using this syringe here to draw it out of this pot here And actually place it into our suppository molds. Both of these things you can get at any local pharmacy or online I definitely recommend using something that's easy to tear apart like this too because you get single dosing as well So then over here this is gonna be Here What I usually do is I put the suppository Moulds into a cup like this because it's really easy to fill them up and just be ready to go I'm not using both hands. I can actually do it like this, but for this video I'm actually going to hold it out So you can see it this way when you're filling them You kind of just pop them right into there and you'll start to see it fill up The part that I usually stop at is just where this little bend is here The main thing is to make sure that each part of the bullet is filled up at the bottom and there isn't any air bubbles in there And the third one It does come out really slowly so you got to be patient with it if you try to rush it You can spill out your suppository mold everywhere, and that's no good Perfect So when they're done? When you look down into them You'll be able to see just a little bit of the oil right there when they're filled up They're ready to go into the freezer or into your fridge to set Once the suppository molds are all filled. You're gonna want to put them in the freezer for about 15 to 20 minutes if you don't have room in your freezer, you can put them in the refrigerator you're just gonna want to wait a little bit longer because what you want to make sure is that the Suppositories are completely solid before you start taking them out of their package It's gonna actually look a lot like how the original coconut butter did before we started mixing it So I'm just gonna put these in the freezer It's been about 10 minutes now the suppositories should be ready to come out of the freezer Don't forget to put on gloves when you're using your suppositories because that coconut butter will kind of make your hands a little oily, too So when you've got your cup here The suppository molds here are nice and solid some suppository molds come perforated like these ones here so you can just break one off Some of them though, you're gonna have to cut so keep an eye out for that one to try and get the preffer ated ones So this is the one dose suppository still in its mold. It's not ready to go just yet We need to actually take the suppository out of this plastic casing some suppository moulds We'll have a little preparation right on the end here This one doesn't so I'm actually going to have to take it some scissors and cut it here just to get it started Just like that there and then what you'll do here is you'll tear it open Just like that and This is your suppository. You're ready to go See, I've only been holding on to it for a few minutes while making this video and it's already starting to liquify and get really oily all over my hands which is why you want to make sure you're using gloves when you're Inserting it and applying it also when you're inserting it You're gonna only need to put it about as far as one knuckle deep You don't need to go much further than that, and there may be a little bit of mess afterwards But the pain relief is definitely worth a little mess because everybody's body processes THC and CBD a little bit differently You're going to want to make sure that your monitor how your body is reacting to using Suppositories by even just taking a note and checking in on how you're feeling every hour what I like to do is I'll actually set an alarm on my phone to go off and then I'll actually put notes on my Phone so that I can monitor how it's worth", "Y1f83hvsGnI": "welcome to a special edition of your cannabis news update today

into shock and Rick fell off a ladder hitting his head on the way down you'll go on to suffer for years from this accident having dizzy spells and a terrible ringing in his ears traditional medications prescribed by doctors had no effect after brief exposure to a documentary aimed at displaying the positive benefits of using marijuana Rick took this information to his doctor but the subject matter was shrugged off time and time again after many hours of research Rick sourced his own cannabis supply I started noticing slight improvement in his symptoms in 2003 3 suspect bubs had arisen on Rick's arm he was diagnosed with skin cancer more specifically basalt cell carcinoma upon some critical thinking and some studying Rick had found a study from the Journal of the National Cancer Institute where they demonstrated THC was found to kill cancer cells in mice he decided the best course of action would be to treat his condition topically and started experimenting with indica Candida strains and food create high quality green alcohol and developed his first batch of concentrated cannabis oil he applied it to his cancer spots and covered them with a bandage for four days to his astonishment roger after he removed the bandages spots had completely disappeared from then on he refined his process began cultivating his own cannabis and made it his mission to distribute cannabis oil to those who need it just like he did here many hurdles such as police raids thousands of plants been confiscated and mainstream medical denial helped treat over 5,000 people rick is that

As Nate was getting into high school, the aggression levels just really started spiraling out of control. He randomly started running\ninto other classrooms, punching people for nothing. It took four adult men and\nhandcuffs to bring him down to the ground, cuff him and restrain him. At that time, he was taking\n18 pills every single day. And it wasn't even helping. I started researching the\nmedical marijuana states. We were able to come to California. I remembered seeing the\nbig neon cannabis leaf in the window, I'm like, \"Well\nthat's gotta be where we have to go.\" (laughs) (upbeat music) - [Interviewer] Why don't you\ntell me a little bit about your family, you have three kids. - Okay, my name is Jenni Mai. I have three sons on the autism spectrum. Each child is of course so\ndifferent, like any other child, and as far as them being on\nthe spectrum, Nathan is what is considered to be at\nthe very severe end. And rather than trying to\nfind the right medication, they just gave him more\nand more and more of it, and that was really the\nonly solution they had. I did not want him being\nchemically restrained in a bed, being (crying) taken care of by strangers. I'm sorry. I had come across this little video clip of a young boy who was just\nrepeatedly punching himself in the head. - [Reporter] 11 year old Alex\nEkels is severely autistic. His self-destructive\nbehavior brought on by-- - And it caught my attention because it was something that Nate had done. His parents were talking\nabout giving him some kind of an oil. I was confused, because it\nsounded like it was some kind of a marijuana derivative,\nand I was actually shocked and maybe even a little bit disgusted. - [Reporter] And after a\nfew months of treatment, the Ekels say they saw\na dramatic improvement. - Within just a few\nminutes of this boy taking the oil orally, he was\nsmiling, he was calm, and he wasn't hurting himself\nanymore, and I'm like, \"Wait, what just happened there?\" (laughs) I watched it a few more times, and I was completely\nshocked and desperate. - At that point, Jenni\nand her family just moved from Wisconsin to Missouri. Two states where getting pot\nlegally for really any reason is super difficult, but particularly medical\ncannabis to treat autism. Currently only 12 states include autism as a qualifying condition. Five other states and\nthe District of Colombia are considered autism friendly, meaning doctors can\nrecommend medical cannabis for debilitating conditions. So that leaves 33 states\nwhere you can't access medical cannabis to treat autism at all. - I was raised in the Nancy\nReagan \"Just say no\" era. - Say no to drugs, and say yes to life. - I would have never in\nmy life considered this to be a medicine, but I\nbasically told my husband, \"We have to try that.\" - Like most illicit drugs, the scientific and medical research of\nmarijuana has been challenging. But the tide appears to be turning. The first large scale\nclinical trials underway in Montefiore medical\ncenter in New York City. And it may be the key to\nunlocking access to treatment for children with autism, nationwide. Dr. Eric Hollander is leading that study. - I've been involved in research\ndeveloping new therapies and treatments, in\nautism spectrum disorders for about 30 years, and there's a big need to develop treatments for the\npoorer symptoms of autism. - This study focuses on a new\ncompound called Cannabidivarin or CBDV, it's an extract from\nthe cannabis plants similar to CBD, it doesn't include THC, the psychoactive drug that gets you high, and what Jenni uses to treat Nate, but it's the first step\nto studying cannabis to treat autism. - This particular\ncannabinoid has some effects on some of the underlying mechanisms that we think are essential to autism. The problem behaviors,\nthe destructive behaviors, and also in some of the\ncompulsive behaviors, or repetitive behaviors or\nperseverative behaviors, so it gets at a key mechanism\nthat we think is important. - There is reason to be optimistic. This new CBDV based drug is similar to one that's already been approved by the FDA to treat a severe form of\nepilepsy that shares some of the same symptoms that\nDr. Hollander is studying. This new research could\nhelp cement what has largely been anecdotal support of\nusing cannabis to treat autism. But while that research is\nongoing, parents like Jenni are moving to states that\nhave more lax marijuana laws. For Jenni and her family, that\nmeant packing up everything and moving all the way across the country. That decision may sound\nextreme, but for Jenni and Nate, it's been worth it. Their lives have been transformed since first visiting a dispensary. - We got home, and he\ntook a hit immediately. We got this one. - [Nate] Okay. - And within, not even five minutes, it was just like a light switch. He was happy, and just kind\nof looking around like, he had never seen the world\nin that way and he was smiling and looking at me, and\nI just knew right away, 'cause nothing acted that\nquickly or that positively ever. - Jenni has learned a lot since moving her family out to California. There she joined forces\nwith fellow mom, Ronda, to start the non-profit\nWhole Plant Access For Autism. Now it's a team of moms\ndedicating their lives to helping other families\nnavigate the challenges that come with getting cannabis\nfor their autistic kids. - I feel like a lot of people\nthat come to our booth, someone in their lives has\nbeen touched by autism, and they don't know that\nthis is an option for them. Other times we get people that you know, come to us after the event, they email us or they find us on social\nmedia and they want to learn. And that's kind of what we're\nabout, we're about educating. - We decided to take a\ndrive out to Joshua Tree. I had him vape and take an edible right before we left the house. He saw that I saw taking\npictures and most of the other pictures that I've\never taken of him in his life, it was kind of a vacant stare,\nhe wouldn't really look, he wouldn't really smile, and\nhe ran over in front of me and sat down. He sat there and he posed for a picture, like everybody else would\nin a situation like that. (sniffs) And I just, I'm like, \"That's it. That's basically his birth picture.\" You shouldn't have to go\nthrough the whole gamut of medications and side effects\nand long-term consequences of some of those side effects\nin order to get to it. Just look at cannabis as another tool in your tool belt to try. - Thanks for watching.

quarter pound roughly we're kind of where I like it hey look up put a little bit more in there mmm that's pretty awesome oh say about three ounces maybe two offices another two or three ounces of us other stuff I had budgeted to fill this up so now we're going to we're going to cover it with Everclear we're just going to get a little bit more about like half an inch over the the buds there really enjoy making this you see the buds just are soaking it up you see it's nothing it doesn't really get spilling down here yet there's my butter just open it up there we go people use other solvents I don't feel good about using anything that I wouldn't actually drink you know some Everclear some punch and that's a good time some lemonade some Everclear that's a good time so I feel good about making it this way using naphtha whatever alcohol uh I'm definitely not down with the butane I don't know what that's going on there yeah why not just extract using gasoline understand that's cool all right so you see that you've got to filled up lots of buds in there the alcohol never ever clear in there and we're going to put it up put a lid on it now and we'll shake it up a little bit I'm gonna take out in the Sun and have a look at it there your doors and taking a good close look at it here so it's pretty green you see the little trichomes floating in there yeah that's why I use good start Ontario now doors here in the back of my house got a power source so I'll be bringing my rice cooker out here you", "Wm3xANxxohM": "yo yo yo what up everybody it's been a minute i l w a and i'm here today to show you guys the easiest way to use rso otherwise known as rick simpson oil a lot of medical programs they don't have edibles this is the closest that you can get to edibles in pennsylvania not sure about a lot of states but uh it's very very potent stuff and you can make your own edibles with it but i will show you the easiest way to use it just to properly dose yourself out if you don't feel like cooking or you ain't a good cook in the kitchen you ain't about all that life so this gram of rso has is 90.94 thc almost pure thc 1.2 terpenes too so if you enjoy the entourage effect if you believe that terpenes accentuate the experience uh more than just taste if you believe they have some type of psychoactive effect there's sign there's science at the base that does there's signs that the beta doesn't but the uh this is farm fx gorilla glue rso and they do have a lot of terpenes the um grassroots rso also has quite a lot of terpenes but i don't have any of that i got this on sale for valentine's day it was my gift to myself 54. gram so one thing is you got these [ __ ] caps farm fx has these caps they suck there you go run the cap run it under hot water if it has a screw cap like this these are [ __ ] pain in the ass pran uses these too and i don't really get why they do them uh grassroots has just like a stopper cresco has a stopper another one just has a little stopper it's they're a lot easier to use i don't [ __ ] get it where the [ __ ] there you go all right let me look real quick so like i said this is 90 thc so there we go so like right right here if you guys can see that that's about point one so there's ten of those point ones in here and like i said it's ninety percent thc thousand milligrams to a gram of rso so one point one is going to be 90 milligrams and for me about a 45 milligram 40 milligram 30 milligrams dose in that range that is perfect for me if i'm not trying to get destroyed if i'm trying to get destroyed i'll eat a lot more you could put this on crackers you could put it on bread you can mix it in peanut butter i've made chocolate with it but honestly this is the easiest way to do it get yourself a cold glass of water i'm a weirdo i fill up my gatorade balls with water so i stay hydrated all day and then push out a little bit of rso this has been sitting in my kitchen my kitchen is cold so this [ __ ] is actually pretty tight in there actually normally it flows a lot easier it hit the gym it's like awkward i don't want to bust the syringe i've never used the form fx or so yeah so if it's moving like this i'm going to just keep pushing it for the sake of video but um if it's ever really tight like this you can just uh you can run it under hot water warm water and that'll loosen it up don't do like boiling hot water damn i'm surprised at how tight this [ __ ] is coming out you can see there's a little bit coming out of the bottom this like this [ __ ] is thick uh rick simpson got the name because that's the dude who came up with this it's just potent [ __ ] i believe he cured himself of cancer rubbing it all over his body i don't know wrapping himself in like bandages with it i can't say that would be that pleasant but it's [ __ ] crazy you got rid of all these tumors i believe all right so there's a nice little globber in there it's starting to curl up but like i said the easiest way to do it if you put it on something you chew it up it's going to get all stuck in your teeth if you cook with it that's great but you have to cook the easiest way for me is just that was actually it usually works better than that but you just rip it off with your teeth real quick toss it on your tongue the cold water will make it fall right off of like any tooth that you have stuck to and just swallow like a pill i'm gonna try to even maybe eat some more i guess i could use a toothpick too i didn't even think about that just like i said this is the first time using the cresco you also could put it on like a dab a piece of dab and or like a dab mat stick that in the fridge and uh you'll be good to go yeah there's some on the toothpick so it takes usually you know hour or like 45 minutes i feel that kick in with edibles you don't need to uh you don't need to eat food with rso it's good if you have something fatty on your stomach because the thc you'll have more areas to bind but this is already like cooked up decarboxylated like this is t it's like i said ninety percent thc not that that's that's not thca so you could eat this raw and it'll be great thca you can't eat raw it needs the heat to be activated this has already been activated so that's the simplest way to do it guys i'm going to keep pumping out some more videos i got a sunday drama driver by enso amazing but i really want to review that but not a lot of people uh people over complicate rso in my opinion they want to cook with it they want to they don't know they should dab it they like trying to dose it out correctly just multiply your percentage divide it by 10 basically your percentage and that will be your milligrams per tenth and then just squeeze out as much as you want and just heat it straight proper dosage i just got about 30 milligrams gorilla glue put me out for a nice night all right everybody appreciate the love as always thank you for the subs thank you for the love thanks for watching hope this was informative and if you guys have any more questions please feel free to hit me up in the comments uh much love as always peace guys", "1tiMkgCVB_8": "we waited from the herb table put this here for me yeah you guys so what's here guys it's like Sunday night I was down at the UM the healing corner over a weekend on Saturday supposed you picked up a couple new things that I put on pre-order there and uh I'm pretty excited I'll bring you a medication that's just this is probably one of the like most special medications that have actually brought you throughout this whole entire Lake series or whatever that I want to call it um I do have two products in the bag that are new to the healing client you know more numbers Connecticut Connecticut we dispensary just a state of the earth that makes sense but I got some not a new crumble from from key relief the cherry Thunder [ __ ] that's a fire s strain if you've seen the flowers when we were through the flowers [ __ ] green they were great many guinea pigs so I got the Chinese Thunder [ __ ] crumble here but then I also got a one millimeter syringe of the Rick Simpson oil I've never really about the risks of spoilers it's supposed to be like um almost like a miracle cannabis product I mean for what it's worth and I don't know if it does or does not if it does it's an amazing product it's amazing thing it's supposed to have the ability to help remove more possibly like remover we're emitter eight or just kind of back off I guess I don't want to say the word cancer or certain other elements like a masters I guess apparently the medical qualities of this product is supposed to be amazing I can't vouch but I've never had it I've never tried it in if it works for patients ask me I don't want to say does or doesn't just that's a really fine line to walk on which I don't want to walk that line all I want to do is bring you the medication that they present and if it works for patients and it does amazing things that is so amazingly good and if it saves lives that's awesome I don't want to say it does or it doesn't because I can't say if it does or doesn't but if it helps you here it is it's the rigsum soil and now Richie Simpson well is not actually an exact strength it's a process of extracting all of the cannabinoids in all of the medical properties from the candidates plan into a super super decarbonized super super potent pipe you can basically I just make it out of any string man and you can make it those TV can make it out behind it it's the process of doing it that strips all the community blades off in all the super pumped th C's off it just makes you super pulling and that it cope you know a lot of products okay we're gonna try it out now I did a little homework on it was really debatable you could definitely eat it I think that's like the main process of Rick Simpson oil is that over time it's not an instantaneous thing like you're doing than all your animals click yes take it over time and increase your dosage over time I think basically what you do is you're supposed to work your way up to almost to the before you take off a gram of it actually predate throughout the day like a morning doze an afternoon dose and the night end goes and if you take it orderly a drop here you know and then you increase the three or four drops or 600 ups orally or and this is I guess debatable or not you can also vaporize it I don't know if you're supposed to if you actually vaporize it I don't know if you get the full medical benefits that you're supposed to I think it's actually for medicinal purposes better to eat it and just it orally and what'll happen is when you do in just orally it's gonna make you very tired or over a period of time you're gonna like that tiredness will wear off during the day but the main point of is to get rest they said the rest is what actually helps the medicine the body heal rejuvenating do its business and that's what it's supposed to it's just a great night time sleep relief which is awesome during they make you tired that'll pass when you doubt it I don't really know what's gonna happen with medical effects we're gonna find out I mean I guess it's nicely in a bowl you're instantly better I use me medical morning for a lot of who's mental symptoms and this isn't necessarily my necessarily more for physical animals but we'll see so with that being said let's check out somebody Simpson well you know if I do and I'm gonna dab this don't you know I talked about I asked lost a small group says well I guess I understand the more beneficial way to user exception or else to ingest it we might even track drop of it as well so let's find out but it's gonna be super super super potent that's that's that's really so this right here this is the UM this is the sapphire crumble this is the umm not the friction well obviously but this is the Sapphire crumble which is the UM trained under [ __ ] this the chase under [ __ ] Rumble we get stag review I'll bring you that in the next up day or two and then I this is what it is it's from sarah plant by the way I didn't mention that I apologize this is a third plant product and here's what it's called see the third plant 360 X they make it out of a hybrid strain now look at this now look at the numbers here if you can see the numbers on here the THC right there five hundred ninety seven milligrams see how high that is and our pollinators and then the CBD there's 12 milligrams but five hundred ninety seven milligrams of THC and 60 milligrams of the THC a and that's that's obviously pretty potent so let's see what's up with that no that's that's actually pretty awesome look at this alright so here's what happens when you get this money to show us when you get this I was gonna dump on the table what you get you get not only do you get this nice syringe here it is you get these no I do get the syringe here this is pretty interesting so this is going back to the oral aspect of it like to take a little medication table here not only do you get the syringe and this is it yeah this is the 360 when the little oil syringe but look this came in the package - it's all right here in the package look capsules here so you inject it put it in there and then make your own Akala you orally take so with that being said and look to see yo you can get a little bit more than a milliliter this is what you get you get this syringe strapping is puffing and just put on your dab or if you put it in your mouth this is what you get so you could see in this little bit of just this little bit of oil maybe that little tiny bit there's actually six hundred million wounds the THC says give you some super super potent stuff super potent stuff um like that's that's amazing and it's just just an awesome just basically an awesome thing that they have this product available to patients now I okay dear I uh I don't even know exactly how the process they make this is I really highly doubt they use an alcohol product but I could be wrong so what I'm doing is I'm not screwing cap here and now that smells smells very like actually smells kind of chocolatey oops they just uh come in my house okay this is very costly and very holding like marijuana let's see what happens I'm gonna squirt out a little bad here onto my god damnit here yeah there we go we got what I did here was I pulled out I'll try to show you guys this put this cap back on here sure pull the string me back a little bit take it around okay no here's what I got he's pulled off nothing huge just a little tiny dab like that now besides that miss I'm also gonna try to eat it I think before we leave so let's see what's up great hey let's see how it works as a dad Rick's Epsilon so this is supposed to have amazing healing properties up and down the board for basically a ton of symptoms it's if you read up on the brick zip similarly you can also look at it it's the websites Phoenix tears dossier with Phoenix tears d800e ni x te AR s dot CIA thinks there's that's his actual site he'll tell you how to make this writ exceptional if you want to make yourself because you can't just actually buy like the actual exceptional farm and you gotta like coming to yourself these guys always have a hair care plan for us cuz I was pretty accessible for us and there to get medical marijuana patients which is awesome okay so I'm not even sure how this is gonna taste I'm not sure what's gonna be like but it's more for the medicinal purposes over the wall so by all means big sips low you can absolutely dead that that doesn't taste bad at all not at all pretty heavy taste pretty heavy tastes air and uh that was a taxi really potent that's weird feeling I think that just feels like you really did just ingest a lot of TV in your body you know weird Whaley if you look alive your body don't and then feel really like them a head that really did go right to the body effect like way to my body effect um it kind of gave me like a heavy feeling it feels like there's just stuff going through me right now yes that's the best way to describe it um well it's that's definitely pretty potent we're gonna do another dab here and yeah it feels like I feels like it's almost like a freight train just hanging a body lime just overload you I think that's the actual whole purposes is really just supposed to overload body with TV and just so much of it at one time but it actually just rips everything out of you I think that's the whole purpose of this whole rig Snorlax trains cuz they you're supposed to get and will be reunited under the mothers out there that actually is definitely doing the trick so yes you can a down on it for sure just there if I didn't prove that and yes I do feel it a lot I could see if you did this on a daily basis continuously this what village up where you kind of mean um down just walking around tennis I'm you know well but it's just a strip your body clean basically everything that's nice it feels like because they connect smoke ball joint and if there's so much t18 and once we sleep all right the power factory over to joy like the way the medication is instantly super medicated that's kind of how this is especially in that Hydra feelings now they can make this an indica or sativa form as well like it said it's just made out of strains and you run it out of it's the process of making it's a whole plant extract sit sideways here the whole thing is extracted so Russia has bono it's good now with that being said you can definitely feel pretty medicated that will all turn into an oral ingestion of this right now and see how that is I guess I'll uh just make myself a little pill here I guess um what I'll do is I let's make until yeah let's see what's up just try to uh I guess ok I set this up every year could see me what I'm doing I guess nothing they see anything there's a great day so Portuguese you okay let's see you see don't you see hey let's try to make a pill here and we got a little work here it and we'll do a so grab when these things here in one of these things here and then uh just uh a little squirt in and [ __ ] and they'll see what happens okay so I didn't use as you can see I didn't use too much that one milliliter there's still a decent amount of it left so I think this goes on the inside so yeah what we'll do is we'll just grate this in here if you can see take this no just push there goes now I put like basically right there I just put totals probably does a good amount we put a quarter about a quarter of a leader into there as you can see so that's probably was the equivalent of like [ __ ] at least five good dabs ok so let me just cap this up for her Oakland and then I do so now I got that there and what we do is take this little chap right here this little piece right here and basically just squeeze it together boom okay Wow well we just made it was wrong personal Rick super simple so yeah be nice huh okay so that being said right yeah okay right so that's pretty cool um hey guys so this has been pretty fun uh yeah now we got oh man okay okay so the Rick ships it oil from our airplane it's at the healing corner right now go get some guys CT users but she'll hit me like a ton of bricks and a half hour worth piece", "GspPPGZm4C8": "[Music] hello it's Ted Corliss with News munchies follow us on our website at WWE scam also look for us on Facebook Instagram and Twitter news munchies dedicated to the legalization medicalization and reformation of America's marijuana laws welcome to News munchies with Ted Corliss where we continue to find the cleanest healthiest forms of cannabis in the marketplace today's subject something called solvent lists hash oil let's begin with the hash oil part that means that we're taking either fresh or dried flowers and we're exposing them to some form of solvent or something that allows the plants to give up those delicious trichome glands that will precipitate out when we gather them all together at the end they look a little bit like peanut butter and they contain all of the pollen that is within the trichome pollen glands well the most state-of-the-art version of this as of today is something we called solvent list hash oil see it used to be that they would take the plants and expose them to things like denatured alcohol or to some form of butane because butane works as an amazing solvent very quick solvent to accomplish that purpose of course the problem is when you introduce these kinds of foreign solvents into the mix you have to get rid of them before you consume the cannabis and so if you have butane hash oil they will take that hash oil and expose it to different forms of pressure which will force the butane out of the system the unfortunate thing is is that despite efforts to do that three four and sometimes even five different times you can't get rid of the butane therefore you want to look for a form of gaining access to all of that material for medical or recreational purposes without having that in the process well the way they've now accomplished this is something called solvent las' hash oil well how can you get the trichome glands off without dissolving them first easy expose it to extreme cold and extreme pressure because those things don't add anything into the process thus giving us what we call solvent list hash oil I tell you about this because as you enter any dispensary anywhere in the United States and you're having conversation about concentrated form of cannabis again either for medical or recreational purposes it's best to find the cleanest form of it as you can and in this situation by asking for solvent less hash oil I think you're gonna find the healthiest and the cleanest product we're gonna continue to look for these kinds of products in the marketplace and report on them to you and keep you informed go to our website at wwlp.com [Music] is munchies follow us on our website at WWE com also look for us on Facebook Instagram and Twitter news munchies dedicated to the legalization medicalization and reformation of America's marijuana laws you [Music]", "gUTCmb0-le0": "[Music] [Music] [Music] hello this is chef Vita and welcome to my kitchen I am licensed to produce medical marijuana and everything I do here is perfectly legal now today we're gonna make cannabis while we're doing the revised edition why because I've learned a few things since the last time I made this video so let's get it on with it now what I'm going to do this time around is freeze the herb and freeze the the jars that I'm going to be using I'm gonna be using glass jars instead of plastic I don't want to use plastic at all in the procedure because okay so freezing we're gonna do two ounces of bud same as last time we're going to try using 500 milliliters of alcohol this time the saturation of alcohol is about 1 pound to 1/2 pounds meaning that do you know if you go any further than that you're just gonna be ballistic honor is the alcohol won't be or all the kind of annoys her so if you break it down it works out to about six point six milliliters - but which is the maximum my formula is a little under myself some Headroom so you know I should be okay and the formula for yield is you know you should get 12% so from two ounces of but I'm expecting about seven grams of hash oil now if you don't get that yield the problem is most likely you're not using okay about two ounces of high quality cannabis here and what you choose is is up to you if you're going to be using this for medication for serious chronic illnesses then I would go with a strain that's very high to CBD strains like Charlotte's Web or kind of trauma now the more CBD your strain has the less THC it will have that's because CBD is a regulator okay your other choices would be whether to go with indica or sativa now indica is more of a heavy relaxing high to it where the steel is a more energetic energetic and creative and good for stress so your choice I have a string here that is halfway between indicas yeah I really don't know what the CBD content is but most commercial strains where the Charlotte's Web or the catatonic is 4% okay so that's what we're going to do is grind up the bud in this machine because I frozen but the trichomes and when you grind this up you don't want to [Music] [Music] this is gonna make really high quality hash the best you can get now of course the quality depends on the quality for her just a couple more things before we take this outside whether you deed carboxylate or her first is again it's your trace it all depends where you're using it before if you deep carboxylate then you're gonna have a higher THC content to the finished product but also what you're going to do even at 200 degrees you know some of the terpenes are gonna vaporize so you can lose some of the kind of roads in that process so you know there are like 55% different kind of an audits in in cannabis so THC is only one of those kind of atomic so we're all going for different things here so whether you choose to the decarboxylate or not it is up to you I've chosen not to okay methodology how we're going to do this how we how we go reduce the alcohol or vaporize the alcohol now there's a few different ways the ultimate way is co2 extraction now if you're if you can justify the expense that's definitely the way to go and the newer technology is a lot better than the older technology because you can just load it up walk away and come back and there's no fuss another way you can do it which is you know co2 extraction but using dry ice so I'm going to work on that okay now the next level would be using a disco even a water just because alcohol burns at 170 you really don't need a lot of heat the advantages of using it to store is that you can recover the alcohol rather than you know or the more you know the more sophisticated distillers you can recycle that alcohol that use it for a second or third rinse so they do have their advantages if you're producing you know a fair amount of oil the most common method though I believe is to use a rice cooker and it works well and that's the message that I'm going to use okay I think we're ready to go outside now okay it's in the wintertime it's not that cold right now we had some snow a couple of days ago so it should be fun okay let's get this stuff we got that and we're gonna do containers oh wait a minute just one more thing I'd like to talk about before we do go outside let's put this back now there's a lot of debate on the net about what kind of alcohol tea is that a lot of those people are very passionate you know you know everyone thinks that they're right and you know but you know everyone you know it's I've done I've done some research on this yeah I don't drink alcohol I didn't know a lot of and in the original video I used isopropyl my gut was right because I see well I believe is the best choice because it's 99% alcohol it's pure alcohol and it's made from organic compounds and there is one percent water so it's not really a toxic substance but you know if you do drink this stuff which you're not supposed to you know the alcohol will turn into a stone which is which is toxic but it's not as toxic as the alcohol that you would buy from a liquor store so really isopropyl alcohol is a less toxic product to use than Everclear and Eclair is it's one night so yeah well we'd influenced my choice over Everclear an isopropyl would be the you know for whatever reason I'm using the oil for smoking it I'm gonna want to go with every clear because it gives you a nice honey oil but if I'm ingesting am using for medication then I don't mind the chlorophyll that comes with the the isopropyl I mean that's the big difference use everywhere you're not gonna extract the chlorophyll but you know every clear is more toxic than I suppose and it's probably going to be a lot of arguments about this but you know do the research okay now you know this is fo ethanol alcohol thing is don't use methanol methanol is very toxic you know you know yo go blind you know two ounces it's it's not good so don't use methanol it's the as far as botanical extracting those this is the most popular way to go because it's the cleanest and most effective okay and I'm sticking to that and I think okay we're ready to go out here one other point I would like to mention about alcohol is that some of the confusion about isopropyl is that some companies put very nasty stuff in here to prevent you from drinking it and that stuff is toxic so you have to be careful what you buy make sure it's a pure clean product 99% alcohol 1% water nothing else okay now that's good started we're gonna pour the herb into the jar whoops try to be eight all right pull the alcohol on I've got a fan going over here keep the air moving okay we're gonna stir this up this is going to take three or four minutes okay it's been a few minutes now and what we're gonna do is strain this we have our second jar here and what I'm going to do is put an elastic band around the wick here to act as a gasket and what we're going to use is this cake sifter it's something that your grandma would use I took out the inner in a party and it fits right on top here very nicely with the rubber gasket there we'll have a nice seal now what we do is we're gonna pour this we're going to strain it through the sifter here like so okay I've got a wooden spoon here and we'll just help it out and let it drain okay now it's getting pretty slow here what we're gonna do is rinse it with a little bit of alcohol here this will get off this bowl I'll get whatever kind of a noise or oil whatever whatever resins are left behind so we don't waste anything okay now the next step is to filter your alcohol now we get another jar I've cleaned up this jar so there is no sentiment okay now I need another rubber band [Music] I'm just squishing it against the side of this can here so I don't wreck the mesh okay what we're gonna do is discard this now not everybody does that there's a new thing called paste now what some people do will cook this down in the alcohol they won't bother filtering it they'll cook it down and it turns into a pace it's called pace so cool some people claim that it's better than hash oil but I don't know but what I'm gonna do is make paste in my next video so that's something to look forward to okay let's put this over here for now I'm just going to clean this out okay nice and clean adduce rinse it out and dry it with a towel what I'm doing here is just gonna make sure I've got all the sediment out of here okay now what we're gonna do here is put a coffee filter in here like so and set it up so it's in there kind of snug I'm going to put it on here now we're gonna pour this I'm gonna start slowly maybe we should take this rubber band off we don't want the alcohol to come in contact with any plastic or rubber okay we're going to pour slowly okay we're moving along as you can see here the liquid is pretty clear compared to how quality this is I think we're ready to pour the rest of this just put the last of it in here I should take the time to give you a few tips on safety like I mentioned you know make sure you have a fan going and make sure you do this outside it's a good idea to plug everything in before you set up you know so there's no sparks or any kind of you know things happening no smoking and it should be okay should be fairly safe okay they will salvage this later I'm gonna get going here okay the next step is to pour this alcohol into the crock-pot I mean the rice cooker and we shall turn it on now this this does not take very long at all so don't walk away from it you know stay on top of it it's gonna start boiling pretty soon it'll start boiling fairly rapidly you just got to make sure that you don't fill the rice cooker too much so it doesn't fly all over or anything okay well let that we do this down okay I'm just gonna pour the rest of the alcohol in there it's still boiling fairly rapidly here like I said it's not gonna take long [Music] there you go she's flying pretty good there okay we're getting somewhere as we get closest to the end there it will get thicker okay we're getting pretty close to the end here we don't want to take it too far we don't want to burn the oil we're gonna add some water now the reason why I would do this is because alcohol burns I mean boils at 170 degrees and water will boil at 212 so the alcohol will burn off before the water does so when it stops bubbling it means that it's done there's no alcohol okay this punch in the game before it gets too thick we're gonna pour it into a container and finish it so before this gets too thick we're gonna pour it out okay now we're back inside we're just going to put the kind of a soil on a hot plate this is just my coffeemaker here it works just as good now it's going to start bubbling that means that everything's not boiled off yet when it stops bubbling then it will be done this could take some time okay as you can see it has stopped bubbling which means that the UI was done as you can see it's like a syrupy consistency right now and when it cools down it'll become like a tar like become very tar like all right now as far as the yield goes the formula is right on this cup here weighs 28 grams 85.5 35.4 - the 28 grams to the cup that's seven point four seven and a half grams from from two ounces of Bud as you can see here the oil is getting getting a lot thicker already we have a look at it it's oil actually it's a golden color it doesn't seem to be a lot of chlorophyll of oil sweet well the reason why we've got a nice golden color here instead of a darker green color it's because I used but no sugar shake so this is this is premium premium quality and that's that's very expensive but this is this is a product that was not intended for recreational okay I think that just about wraps and the storage I would store it in a dark glass jar I think that would be the best as far as dosage information goes for chronic illnesses or just like maintenance just visit my website Derek calm and click on my medical marijuana page okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "oOpyWDlPIuM": "so on our so you can see this it's just regular paring knife compared to my fingernail this is about a dose for me this is my homemade stuff so I would guess there are about 20 milligrams of THC in this RSO I'm gonna go ahead and pause the video and then I'm gonna show you how I take this so what I've got is a pudding pack I don't like anyways and my RSO is really tacky if your RSO is really really sticky you might want to use a toothpick to transfer the art so from whatever you've got it on being spoon or a knife or a tabletop or a slick or whatever you have dosed it out of your container in so sometimes it comes in a syringe my container is this so the reason is on a knife is because I dip the knife in here and they scrape out the amount and like I said it's tacky so I'm kind of able to form it into a little ball and amount the substance I mean and so then the reason why I like the little pudding pack is because like the pudding itself really going anywhere and so I can take my little nugget of RSO and like I said you might need a toothpick to for this process or you might need a flat surface like a tabletop however this is easiest for you the idea is that you want your little nugget to end up on top of your dollop pudding okay so for me it's tacky it's really easy for me to just Boop right there there went my pudding so it might be really easy for you to just transfer that with a toothpick or you know distribute it in whatever fashion you need to just like right there on the pudding but for me it's easy to just pick it up and then because the pudding will just keep it there you can put a little bit more pudding if you want on top of it I don't really need to because I passed the taste but if you put a little bit more you get absolutely zero taste I find you get zero taste if you just kind of like massage it in there with your tongue but then you just go I just don't chew it you can do jello but I literally just goltz the whole thing down like it was some big ice cream you could probably even do that with the ice cream if you wanted to anything that you can really just make sure the RSO is kind of buried in and then swallow it all as a whole if you're one of those people you know pee under the mat not peeing under the mattress but you know princess and the pea put the pee under the mattress and you can still feel it and you can still feel that little nugget going down your throat just eat the rest of the pudding unless you're putting is on the ground like mine is if you can't do pudding cuz you're lactose-intolerant go with the jello if you're vegan go vegan jello vegan ice cream like I said whatever soft gooeyness you can find you just pop that a little bit of RSO in the middle of it use a toothpick you can get a little dab spoon at your local head shop that's another good option you may end up wasting just a tiny bit of the RSO which is why one of those little dab spoons is nice because then you don't necessarily have to clean it every single time you can just put it in a little baggie or have its own little slick but it just kind of rests on and put the whole little container in a baggie I just try and keep those things as clean as possible if I'm worried that I'm gonna be wasting some of my product every time I'm gonna wash it off I just keep that thing as sanitary as possible and like only bring it out when I'm going to dose myself if that doesn't work for you because you're sanitary conditions just have to be that rigid do what you can maybe if you get really good with the syringe maybe you could just syringe a little bit onto the top of your pudding whatever you have to do but of all the ways I have tried taking that are so it really can taste bad and if you put it in the middle of something that's really gelatinous in in form it's one of the best ways I've found to dose that stuff and not taste it whatsoever so that's helpful", "LfK70dsE2RU": "all right so this is my third day of doing this if you can take a look at it it's been hurting really bad today like it was strange like I can start to move it and stuff like this and as you can see there's no like nothing's all easy and trusty or nothing like that so go ahead and apply this stuff for today I don't know if the pain is just because of like I said I'm not experienced with having wounds or anything but maybe the pain is just it healing it's my first time putting this on today so I'll remark tomorrow to see if the pain goes away at all alright so that's my treatment for day 3 I've only been doing it once a day and yep that's about it folks", "QxAfyWrqrS8": "hi everybody my name is Reggie reg rule otherwise known as reg but Zilla this is my mom Louise school today we're bringing you a video on how to make suppositories it's much more easier to actually get the THC in your system through your bumbum uh-huh what do you think about that mom interesting the good thing about suppositories is that there is definitely a medical application that you can use this material with for example you can use a suppository for PMS premenstrual syndrome that can get pretty intense for the ladies and also there's a lot of uses for cancer for example colon cancer and as well general chronic pain in your spinal area when you use suppositories you get about 70% absorption rate because it goes directly into your blood as opposed having to smoke it which you would get 25% of the effects from so we're gonna show you a little bit of how easy this process is at Budds illa we make infused coconut butter which solidifies at room temperature a jar from bazzill a-- is a hundred and thirty milliliters you can melt this down at one minute in the microwave and then it becomes liquid at room temperature congeals like this and its really simple really we've picked up some silicone jars thank you very much Jen Bennett appreciate that shout out to Jen Bennett out there one love challenge yeah basically what you do is is you would gather some oil which has been melted right now we're using a a baby ear dropper because it's much easier to collect the oil and then you just put it into the cavities fill it up to the top it's a pretty color in pink too yes girl friendly yeah this is the the ladies version right we've got different molds here pink and blue now once you're done with your silicone cavities it's really as simple as just refrigerating it how long would be effective dis fast the effect is generally I would compare it to sort of like an edibles effect so you're looking at typically between four to eight hours of pain relief it lasts longer because the way that it's ingested and processed through your system so you don't need to have a go through your liver for people that have issues with consuming cannabis and having liver issues it gets dissolved like and it takes longer I guess yeah there's different degrees of pain right and so you could adjust as well or have us adjust the strength of the coconut oil you can make it really in a CBD blend where there's no euphoric effect you know so for older patients or much younger patients you don't want them to necessarily get high you just want people who don't use cannabis all the time obviously yeah so we make this product in-house here in Canada in Vancouver British Columbia we're located at two to six seven Kingsway their website is buds Ella dot CA these are CBD capsules they have no THC the CBD is grown off of hemp which Garrett's guarantees that there's no THC I might try it and now they even get my good buddy to try it yeah so hey yeah I spread the wealthy or whatever I mean if it works for me so this is what it looks like after the suppositories have congealed in the freezer you're gonna want to wear gloves because again this is going in the medical cavity right so super easy all you want to do is pop out the congealed oil out of the silicone tree now looks a little bit harder than it should be normally because these are coming out of the freezer normally these would just automatically slide out well they still do they're just a little bit harder right really simple really easy you want to take your time right because this is medication so this is what it looks like when the suppositories are inside the silicone inserts and this is what they look like once they have been pressed out of the silicone inserts thank you very much for joining us folks have fun with that big shout out to Freddy Prichard one-man smoke show and also a Jen Bennett for helping us out with the silicone tree insert that's the one love challenge take care folks so what but Zilla is doing is we're braiding in two for one so if you bring in one gram will give you 2 grams bring in one down so I'll give you two ounces you", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "SM12-6QEfLI": "what's up everybody we're here in the smash lab and today we're gonna be making some very very strong THC oil using 17 different rosin pucks [Music] the thing about these rosin pucks is they are still loaded with THC we haven't been pressing super high pressure lately we've been doing around 650 to 700 so there is a lot of rosin left over in these the great thing is we've got a new teach egg tester so we're gonna find out just how many milligrams is left inside this oil at the end the last video you saw when our boss drank that entire thing he was completely loaded we are gonna find out just how many milligrams that was and we anticipate this one's gonna be a lot stronger so stay tuned to see just what the measurement comes out to we'll start by getting a little bit of coconut oil 60 milliliters and our beaker over there and warm that up to about 140 degrees for 5 minutes alright so there's our 60 milliliters what we're gonna do is add it to this larger beaker because we're gonna be putting the pucks inside here we need a little bit more space [Music] all right so we're gonna let that heat up for a few minutes it's at about 170 degrees right now okay so our oil is now at around 125 degrees we're gonna go ahead and start adding our pucks like I said we have 17 bucks right here if you want to take a look at these you can see these things are cake this thing has got a nice yellow color still kind of sticky smells great wish you guys could smell this we're gonna start by adding 2 at a time try to save a little time here so I'll take these two right here take a look at these I want you to see what they look like before and after they're gonna be a lot more clear and that oil is gonna be bright yellow by the time I'm done with these two so let's go ahead and have these in there make sure they're fully submerged and boom as you can see we can easily add two at a time in here as we lose a little bit of oil we might have to drop down to one at a time so this all depends on how much oil you're using [Music] all right so it's been about five minutes we're gonna go ahead and take a look at these pugs make sure we got all the rosin outside of them it was about five minutes and we're doing two at a time it's important to know that you can even do seven to ten minutes depending on how your puffs look after we're gonna take a look right now you can see that the oil is already a completely different color than it was originally so these do look pretty clear we'll probably go ahead and let those sit for about two more minutes make sure we get everything out and then we'll completely remove them [Music] okay so it's been two more minutes let's go ahead and remove these our first one here as you can see that was a lot more clear take a look at our oil here it's got a nice yellow color it was originally clear so we're gonna do is go ahead and squeeze the rest of the oil out of these pucks here okay so our first two pucks got them right here as you can see those things are really clear we pulled a lot of rosin out of those here's a one we haven't done yet next one we have done as you can see there's a lot of rosin inside of these puck still what we're gonna do is bill the other 15 bucks in there on a time lapse to save you guys time and go ahead and see how this oil tests out at the end okay so that was the last puck we just did all 17 as you can see these are completely clear now we pulled all the rosin out of those as you can see the oil is way dark way darker than last time we assume is gonna be very potent we're gonna go ahead and test it out but first we've got Adi carbon so let's get that last puck out of there [Music] okay so we just removed that last puck and we turned the temperature up a little bit on our hot plate we're trying to get around that 220 to 240 degrees range we're gonna let that boil sit there for about 10 minutes so we can de carve this is gonna activate all the THC that's inside that oil this should take about 10 minutes but we're gonna pay attention to the bubbles that are forming as you see those bubbles that means it's d carving and once those disappear you're pretty much good to go [Music] okay so next we're going to do is take a nug Smasher 37 micron bag and strain the oil through it what that's going to do is get rid of any of that plant material was left over [Music] all right so what were left with is 20 milliliters of completely activated THC oil what we're gonna do is use our new teach egg test machine a lot of you have been recommending this to us you really want to know how many milligrams of THC was in a in the oil when we were done what this does is it uses light to analyze the oil and give us the total cannabinoid count we know that flour that we pressed was predominantly THC however if you were doing heme it would give you the CBD results as well the only thing is it only tests up to 15 milligrams of THC or total cannabinoids per milliliter so we're gonna have to dilute our rosin oil right here in a twenty to one ratio with coconut oil so we'll do that now all right so let's get our scale zeroed we're gonna add a point 400 grams of clean coconut oil right here alright next we're gonna add point O two of our rosin oil [Music] turn this on alright so we're testing isolate infusion we're doing coconut oil temperatures about 75 and the infusion has been deep carbs we're going to go ahead and begin the test first we got to ensure the tray slot is empty which it is okay let's just calibrate yeah and while that's calibrated we can go ahead and add our oil to the tray right here [Music] all right all right we got the results ten point six times twenty so two hundred the point six times two would be [Music] so two hundred and twelve per milliliter and how many do we have twenty Destin that's that's a lot for one person to drink that's pretty heavy all right so extremely potent oil right here we just got this tea check yesterday we've been playing with it for the past two days really cool device we were really interested to see how many milligrams this was 4240 that's a lot more than most people would do in one dose like we did last time thanks for watching the video and make sure you stay tuned for next time hey guys make sure you check us out at Doug smasher com2 check out all of our awesome products we also have tons of great information on our site including calculator tools & Turf

13 first reported last May his family was really in the dark they were desperately seeking some answers well now Darcy Spirit shows us how they are seeing the lights all thanks to cannabis cream for Carter gray that is the sound of relief I just got an oil up ahead a massage from mom that means so much more we first met Carter a year ago he suffers from lamellar ichthyosis a rare skin disorder with no cure that causes dark scales where dead skin cells don't flake off despite corrective surgery Carter's skin is so tight he can't even shut his eyes he's forced to spend most of his time inside but his family is hoping this it's a miracle plan that's what it is just might change that it showed us from the first time that we used it thought it was worth continuing to use when we first brought you Carter's story his parents were dealing with industrial sized vats of coconut oil and making some progress but nothing like what's contained in these small jars creams made from cannabis oil an extract of marijuana how would you describe your reaction when you realized you'd found something that worked I cried oh haha a lot I still cry I still I'll be in the bathtub just scrubbing his back and the scales just fall right off into the bathtub Carter's grandma makes the creams in her kitchen giving her grandson a gift no doctor could completely clear like soft as a newborn take a look at these before and after photos of Carter's back and head no scarring no sign that there was ever even any buildup there at all a dermatologist told them there is nothing on the market that I could prescribe you that would give you better results than what you're getting so how does it work dr. Scott Jacobson says cannabis taps into the nature of our own bodies the endocannabinoid system is found throughout the body in the brain in the immune system in the nervous system as well as in the skin actually skin cells have cannabinoid receptors in them and so putting them on topically you're going to get that action directly where it's needed dr. Jacobson also says cannabis is known to reduce inflammation he's gonna do two for Carter and his family you get oh it's a giant leap forward relieved relieved and eager to find out more about what we

"qgMCgoAqLdA": "welcome to another in our video series demystifying 5g in the recent videos we talked about 5g our coverage measurement and I showed you demonstration and the hardware example plus how to take these measurements how to reach these measurements one thing that we didn't discuss in detail are the frequency setting so what type of frequency I have to set to find these synchronization signal blocks and take these signal quality measurements on them so in this video we would explore the five gene our frequency settings and we will learn that there's quite some changes compared to LTE so let's take a look so what you basically see here is an example of a signal let's assume we have a certain bandwidth let's say 100 megahertz so in LTE we basically had a situation that around the carrier frequency the synchronization signals psssss we are transmitted the broadcast channel was transmitted so as soon as we knew the care actual carrier frequency of the LTE signal we could find these signal components and identify this LRD and find the master information block now with five GNR that has changed so basically what has changed is that everything is now based on what is called common resource blocks common resource blocks start typically from a reference point this reference point is called point a and they are defined for fixed numerology means subcarrier spacing for the two frequency ranges the common resource blocks are based on 15 kilo Hertz for f1 and on 60 kilo Hertz for f r2 so that is something that we have to take into consideration now the frequency point a can be understood as a kind of orientation as a kind of point in the frequency domain for any frequency of allocation that's being assigned in 5g in our note that these common resource block are not used directly for spectrum allocation it should be fought as a identifying the frequency position due to the introduction of various numerology z' parameters and so the resource block size still defined by 12 subcarriers is not constant anymore so if we now think about synchronization signal blocks by definition they can take basically any position in the frequency allocation of that signal and basically we have now to define that frequency position of the SSB based on that reference point based on that point a so typically there's certain information being signal to the device for instance often to point a since the synchronization signal blocks can actually utilize a different subcarrier spacing than the data and control channels so for instance in the millimeter wave arena in the effort to frequency range they could utilize 240 kilo Hertz for the synchronization signal blocks but hundred 20 kilo Hertz for the data and control channels we need to define an additional offset from the common resource block and that is the parameter K ASB that you see basically here in our graph that I mark here for you so if we now continue with that we of course want to understand how now this type of information is being available made available towards the device so now we need to take a look at the two different deployment modes that are being defined for 5g gnar and we will learn that basically a non standalone mode the particular carrier frequency or frequency that these synchronization signal books are transmitted at I marked it here for you which is basically subcarrier zero in the tenth resource blocks that are forming the synchronization signal blocks in a non standalone mode when we have an LTE carrier used as an anchor for exchanging control and signaling information with the 5g device that information is basically being sent towards the device so the device receives layer free message with a so called a NR arfcn number that clearly identifies this particular frequency so mobile will not sweep over spectrum try and define it will exactly tune its receiver to that frequency and voila it will acquire two synchronization signal blocks because part of that message is also its configuration in standalone mode so these the mote that purely is 5g only these SSB frequency definition basically follows a different dresser we will basically have to learn what it means by understanding the synchronization roster and the so-called global synchronization channel numbers so let's take a look so what you basically see here is first for non standalone mode then NRA RFC n so the new radio absolute radio frequency channel number there's a certain definition for that due to the different frequency ranges that five gene are supports as you can see there's a certain recipe finder if we take a look at that that could change in this frequency band dependent as we can see and if you're following this particular equation then at the end of the day you see that there's a certain number in range for these different frequency ranges for an in our arfcn that again is the number that's being signaled to the mobile to find as an example the SSB frequency position now differently the global channel global synchronization channel numbers are defined so let's take also look on on this definition it's a different table here with a certain definition in terms of the Resta as you can see here different factors are go in again similar than in our arfcn covering these free frequency ranges here providing a different number set and what you can already see that the actual carrier russer is much more granular than the actual synchronization Resta so this is a compromise a trade-off that has been added into the standard so the mobile if it would have to sweep the spectrum which is it has to do in standalone mode doesn't waste too much time to find you synchronization signals so in standalone mode basically as this piece of following the synchronization raster and a much wider granularity then actually it's possible with non standalone mode so I have also an example for you that I would like to take a look at so here take the example for frequency arrange one so we are in a sub 6 cubed space I picked a bent 78 which is basically 3.5 gigahertz and now you can see here also when we calculate these different in our AFC n numbers that are possible using the correct equation and offset then we see that some of these numbers yeah for instance this particular one here some of the NR a RFC n actually correspond to global synchronization channel number M so that's a piece and standard that we have to understand but again global synchronization channel numbers have a much wider granularity than the actual channel raster that's D being defined within our arfcn as we show here on our example so I hope this information gave you a little bit more insights about into the frequency settings in five GNR it can be confusing so especially if you have to go out into the field and try to measure coverage of your newly deployed f5 GNR and network in order to optimize it so for to help with this task rohde & schwarz has developed a new feature for 5g in our frequency settings we call it automatic channel detection it's actually pretty simple what it does but this is a topic for another video in our video series demystifying 5g you", "dDUVet9sWAs": "hello everyone happy monday uh i did just do a video i'm not really wanting to do another video but i got a new microphone uh i just got the rode mini video microphone uh i realized i'm gonna do most of these off the cuff in the garage while i'm hanging out having a brandy uh and smoking some weed and and trying to shake off 2020 and and all of that so i want to do a quick video to test the microphone uh also i have some patches here um i am i i have a history of skin cancer as i mentioned in in the last video in several videos uh i had one cut off here a big one here and one on each side of my neck i have another one starting to show signs but i also have one here and here that i clearly need to have or i would clearly need to have taken off i i need to have them addressed if this doesn't work i'm using uh hso which is now the smarmy way of saying rick simpson oil which is supposed to from videos and research that i've seen cause cancerous cells to suicide something about the thc specifically that uh somehow sense re-sensitizes the lysosome bag to cause it to kill itself when it detects an error which is cancer so that's supposed to be how it works it does seem to be i am on my second week and the patch that i'm treating with the hso it now kind of looks like hamburger it's gross i know but but this this healthy skin that was around it is not affected the patch that was clearly uh basal or squamous not i haven't had melanoma um or i haven't had cancerous melanoma malignant melanoma so it's clearly having an effect on it i don't know if that's it or if i'm eventually gonna have to have the doctor cut chunks of my face off yay uh redhead um uh the other thing i wanted to kind of ask if anyone is nerdy enough to follow me or or uh star citizen is having an event this week a free fly event where you can go in you can fly log in for free and test out ships but in conjunction with that they released the mercury star runner which i had pledged several years ago a year ago so i had at some point pledged when it was for sale i purchased it and my goal for that was that at the time you couldn't get ships in game that was back when i purchased it you couldn't buy ships in-game you couldn't you could rent some but persistence wasn't in so the only way you could consistently have a ship available is to own it so i part of my enjoyment of the game and of the gaming world in general is to be part of the development i actually like seeing and experiencing the crashes uh not necessarily the crashes but the build up where you go into a planet and there's not much there and the next month you go on and you see a little more and and you see the progression i enjoy that part of gaming um most people don't but at this point and along the way i purchased different ships just so i could experience that game play consistently and uh not have to wait and i'm happy i did because it was years that i got to play uh that i wouldn't that would have been stuck with one ship or renting or it would would not have been as a an enjoyable experience so i i'm happy with my purchases that i made um but having gone through several cycles of star citizen's sales and releases now that there is a server persistence of a sort where you can buy a ship in game and you know you have that ship available unless there's a glitch but you know the same goes for for actually paying real money and owning it uh the other reason i was thinking i was wanting to own the ships is that i had expected to do some videos and as a a content creator sorta i thought i might be more into doing live streams uh the whole twitch gaming thing that i that i enjoy watching other people do on twitch and youtube and i just don't i like to i just don't i i'm pretty quiet i play with uh my niece online and and uh my stepbrother uh is that a phone call i don't know who you are i don't know also how that's gonna come out in this if i'm still recording am i okay supposedly i'm still recording a phone call first time recording or getting a phone call making recording airplane mode next time uh so one of the things that i'm kind of uh going over my head is do i want why would i want to spend real money now that i know there's persistence and uh any ship that's coming out is going to be very soon uh come out in the game and be able to purchase in-game without spending any money i'm not a giant content creator so i understand content creators doing this would want to be able to invest in it as a business because then you get to review the the ship or whatever it is first and get some draw to your channel but i'm not doing that so at this point uh i don't i'm probably not going to be spending any more money real money probably shouldn't spend what i spent uh but if anybody you have been playing there's got to be two three of you maybe that are nerdy enough to play star citizen uh are you still adding are you still planning on buying things from star citizen and i did it also just to support the game because i wanted a super cool game it is the game that i always dreamed of playing when i was a kid that has all the the the boxes checked uh but i think i'm done supporting it monetary wise only because i see i don't see a reason i'm not using it as a business just i want to know what your thoughts are on purchasing things with real life money for access in video games and to test the microphone uh safe", "7F-rOC4RUAA": "[Music] all right so we'll start with the ingredients main ingredient Betty Crocker milk chocolate brownie mix now this recipe calls for two eggs all right and then two ounces we're also gonna have someplace to put it all in makes it we're also gonna add fluent full spectrum cannabis oil concentrate now this dispensary it's one of my favorites see here this is THC 88.2 1:9 Wow and I see the name is battledore fluent they speak cannabis whenever I'm cooking this this normally is really hard to get out it's really concentrated so it always helps to put it in warm they could I normally just might crave a cup of hot water get it really nice and hot and just drop this bad boy in there for a good five minutes and come on up just like oil all right first things first you want to go ahead and preheat your oven to 350 degrees go ahead and spray your pan whoa whoa it's like that okay we have to read the hot water that's right hot in about five minutes and this time I decided to just put it in a little bowl put in the microwave for like about 10 seconds make sure you get time be careful getting that out of there it's very hot one way to tell that your product is ready is by looking at the little air bubbles you'll see that the air bowl will go up or down real fast all right so we have our concentrate and our vegetable oil we'll go ahead and dump this in there's 500 milligrams make some pretty potent brownies oh it smells it smells very good and you definitely want to let the oil cool down a little bit before you put it into the mix there's my eyes because you're putting eggs in there and you don't want to cook the eggs not yet one of the best things about coming with concentrate is it's essentially a oil and you can put it in anything anything can rise anything that use oil with you can mix it alright so now that we have our brownie mix inside the bowl we'll go ahead and get some eggs one that's two and asked for the recipe add three tablespoons of water now we have all this we'll go ahead and stir this or we'll give it one more mix ago we put it in there make sure it's all nicely evenly mixed because you don't want product that has a little bit here and a little bit there all right so he just makes us wrap around all right once you have everything makes well together should look like that nice and consistent you don't want to over beat it one of the advantages of using concentrate is that it already comes the carbonized so whenever you cook it it won't impact the THC in it whatsoever all right and we're about to go ahead and put this brownie mix into this pan and let the magic start all right now that we have everything here and in here all right we're all good to go all right so we'll just go ahead and get everything your ovens preheated to 350 we'll put it in here BAM all right now you should put it for 42 minutes if you're using a square pan like I am but just to be safe put it to 39 that's not a good time oh I think she's doing so it looks like it's sad 42 minutes right now see ain't it nice and cool now that we've allowed the brownies to cool now it's time to cut them up keep in mind that until we 500 milligrams of concentrate so what this means is that we'll divide it by how many pieces that we play [Music]", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like

there we go we're gonna give it about an hour we're gonna wait we're gonna wait an hour we're gonna wait about 35 minutes or as soon as i start feeling something i'm gonna come back and let you know let's stay tuned 10 uh 10 17. uh i just wanted to check in and already i'm feeling some of the effects of the slightly over grain of rice size rso dab which i took um yeah i'll check in with you guys the next first sign of feeling or anything i'm feeling uh throughout the course of this experiment stay tuned all right it's still only been a few minutes since the last check-in it's 10 20. and i'm already feeling it behind my eyes like a little uh some kind of warm hug around my eye area and my body starting to relax a little bit whatever pain i had earlier in my in my leg is kind of subsiding which is amazing uh i'm just i'm just feeling more more calm and relaxed we'll see how i feel a little bit later on the next check-in officially 10 30 officially 10 30 am i got to say i started i started the feeling in my body now just a nice relax uh the amount i took was only like about the size of the grain of a rice maybe a little bigger because i cleaned it you know got the excess off my breathing is slower nice calm relaxed feeling i can imagine my blood pressure must have gone down because i'm calming down noticing my breathing becoming deeper slower i i think i think i'm getting stoned there yeah i think i'm getting medicated there my friends yeah so let's see how i feel on the next [Music] check-in all right it's 10 40. and uh i think i'm i think i might be maxing out here on the or i might be i think i might be there almost all the way to the peak of this thing i don't know i'm definitely i was just phasing out a minute ago uh waiting for the i set my timer every 10 minutes or so and i think i forgot to set this one to the next 10 minutes which should be 10.50 but yeah i'm starting to phase out a little bit you know like i'm starting to space out like real starting to think more what what i'm gonna say and [ __ ] you know i'm starting to space out on my i'm not so on it anymore i think i'm i think uh yeah i think the rso has finally got to me uh a little bit slow [Music] slower motion slower motion just just a calm effect just a calm effect um i i think it might even get hit harder because it's headed it hasn't even been an hour yet see then i started at 10 1003 it's 10 40 now yes it's been about 43 minutes and i'm my breathing is the one that's really affected it's the it's a deep you know deep calm breath you know i'm saying so yeah we'll see how i feel on the next check-in hopefully i remember to set my timer 10 50 uh yeah well next chicken welcome back it's uh it's now 11 o'clock i forgot to set the timer i always also got really really hungry peanut butter and bread hmm i all of a sudden i got this hunger feeling like i didn't eat my appetite was like my stoma stomach started to rumble and they will scream and feed me it's like a real nice [Music] effect real nice body real nice just like a you know like exhale relaxation a little slow in the slower in the speech maybe slight slur on the speech here and there but if i'm not really watching myself but very much body body effect uh for it to be affecting my speech like that i'm gonna say hey hell yeah put on your and go easy because i took i'm a pretty skinny fella and i took like a little bit more than a grain of a rice a size of a grain rice like i was suggested to nice i feel nice i mean probably as you go on you're probably gonna have build up a tolerance you'd probably have to take more and whatever but first time trying it recommendation grain of a rice i did a little bit more with my poke i'm gonna say hair to hair yeah i felt like someone just came up to me and went ah you know what i'm saying i like it i like it uh definitely different from smoking i've been smoking a lot lately uh because i've been such a it's been so much pain lately uh i figured i'd take a different approach today so there you go first time trying rso um you know i pretty much i feel like i pretty much reached max or peak ready hope you guys like it like the video that's all i got so first time all right so shout out noah botanicals for the gorilla glue number four gang [ __ ]", "3wD0KpsGIhI": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats and it is tincture time guys one of my favorite things to review here on your marijuana review show uh we are taking a look at a product from select we've reviewed quite a few things from select in the past they're sort of the jack of all trades of uh marijuana companies we've reviewed carts i think i've reviewed um disposables um they're in a lot of different uh markets select they're selling a lot of different products and one of those is the tincture and they have a pretty uh wide tincture line now have had it for a while with a whole bunch of different kinds of dosages and mixtures between thcs and cbds and different potencies and yada yada yada so this one here i purchased at a dispensary in long beach for 50 i believe um and it is a pretty good value for what you get inside of this box and it is a little confusing i'll show you here um so this is a one to one tincture uh one to one thc cbd one milligram for one milligram however that's not actually true uh it does say there this is the unflavored 500 milligram thc 500 milligram cbd well actually there's a sticker up here clarifying it's actually 600 milligrams thc and 513 cbd so you get a little extra great who doesn't love that uh and then uh as i said this is their unflavored i think they also have like lemon and ginger other things uh and on the side we've got our dosing uh sort of guidelines um they recommend that each full dropper is 10 milligrams which is a single serving and they say this whole uh tincture bottle has 60 droppers in total which makes sense for 600 milligrams of thc um so we've reviewed a lot of tinctures here i really like tinctures uh they usually work pretty well for me and i absolutely love the form factor uh we'll be doing this one sublingually like we do with most of our tinctures under the tongue which means it actually comes on quite a bit quicker than if you were just taking it like any other edible uh the effects can start to hit as soon as about 15 minutes and really get going at about 45. um so uh let's go ahead and get this open i was looking okay so this is uh an mct oil based um tincture i was wondering what their base was and it is mct oil which is basically just coconut oil so it is coconut oil but just a specific uh chain of molecules i guess um okay so let's open her up our one-to-one drops now i'm not particularly a big cbd guy uh it's not something that is especially um helpful or useful for me i i don't really um uh get a lot of benefit from cbd uh more power to everybody who does i'm i'm glad you really enjoy it uh i don't dislike cbd it's just it doesn't seem to have much of an effect on me but i will definitely keep an eye out uh because this one is almost equal parts cbd in here as well we'll see if that makes me feel any different than the normal thc review uh so like all of our weed reviews we're gonna do uh or excuse me tincture reviews we do uh 100 milligrams not the whole thing and not just a single dropper i like to do that as our baseline for pretty much every tincture so that would mean 10 full droppers of this is going to be our dose we'll see how that goes uh i'll probably do three or four two or three four on camera with you and then the uh remainder that i will be doing the next you know six seven i will probably do on a live stream i've been doing a lot of live streaming thank you to everybody joining in um and i'll probably do uh a little bit more there so i hope to see some of you guys join in for our live streams anyways i'm going to shut up now and i'm going to go and open this up and get this process started smells like nothing at all not a thing okay i'm expecting this to taste uh very neutral uh as mct oil tinctures normally are uh not able to get the full milligram it's only about the 75. got to keep that in mind i have to do uh maybe closer to 13 drops in total uh hung ahaha [Music] um [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] okay that's all i'm gonna do um i i there are uh various opinions about how long you should leave it i usually go for about a minute or two and that seems to do the trick pretty well uh and as i i suspected largely tasteless just that vaguely kind of coconutty oil aftertaste um but it's so un you know it's just it's it's really uh it's not a big deal at all i took three droppers full and don't even feel like i uh need to rinse my mouth out or anything um so in terms of the uh unflavoredness of this tincture it is really unflavored um so we've done our first three or two and a half worth droppers there i've got another you know we'll say 10 to do because i wasn't able to get the full one dropper uh and as i said i'm gonna hope to do some of that with you guys on a live stream uh before i wrap this review up oh i think i forgot to mention uh like all of our wheat's reviews after i do my 10th dropper or so uh about two hours or so after that i'll come back here and let you guys know if this select one to one cbd thc tincture is as good as i am hoping until then stay high stay healthy hi guys i am back about three and a half hours after our first journey with the select one to one drops 600 milligrams of thc in the very specific 513 milligrams of cbd that's not how much i did i did about between 100 and 150 milligrams would be my guess which is probably between 80 and 120 milligrams of cbd and a lot of you got to hang out with me while i was reviewing this we did a little bit of a live stream and i appreciate everyone who tuned in uh and to all those who were there you probably remember that i liked this quite a bit this is very good um an affordable tincture i see it for about 50 bucks normally which is already a good deal for 600 milligrams of thc then you get the added bonus of that one to one cbd double-year cannabinoid goodness um so normally the cbd stuff doesn't really do a lot for me i'm not a big big big huge user of cbd or even sort of i don't really get the uh too much of the positive effects uh i respect it as a product it's just not super effective on me but i did notice it here um the the the high i'm experiencing is way more relaxed even than normal um sort of very very pleasant kind of experience less cerebral than normal for me not really neurons really aren't firing quite as much but i feel very at peace so i'm going to attribute that to the almost equal amounts of cbd in here so this select one-to-one unflavored drops it gets a really really big thumbs up for me i like it quite a bit my dog's thinking about barking but she's not going to she's not going to she really wanted to um so yeah huge thumbs up for me and before i bounce here guys i want to share with you a little cherry on top a little something that you can enjoy that i can share with you that isn't necessarily about wheat in this one you may not want any weed before you check this out because it might be a little too much i'm going to recommend a couple of books from a japanese uh illustrator it's manga i'm sorry i'm a nerd i guess it's only the second one i've ever read so don't judge me too harshly um the artist and writer is a guy by the name i apologize if i'm mispronouncing it junjie ito um and the two books i want to recommend from him that are utterly grotesque i mean truly some of the most shocking images i've ever seen somebody uh put pen to paper but i mean that in the best kind of way uh they are depraved in the most uh wonderful kind of cosmic hori sense of depraved uh and those are guillot geo again probably mispronouncing it which means fish in [ __ ] japan um and uh the other one is uzumaki which means spirals and it's all about spirals and i think adult swim is gonna do some kind of adaptation i've talked a lot about genji ito don't mix the two that's my advice definitely try this and definitely give junjie e2 a shot if you're a fan of gross stuff but keep them apart all right guys well that's going to do it for this review here on wheats really like the select give a huge recommendation my boy genji whatever however i'm sorry i'm still very high so thank you so much for watching guys stay high stay healthy and we'll see you for the next review i'm hoping my dogs aren't going to trip they might we did it [Music] you", "FWbSSVH5mOI": "okay so for the RS oh that's a piece of cereal and that is a dime so that shows you how big the piece of cereal is and then that shows you like how much I put on that's enough to probably keep me high for a good four to six hours and I have tolerance to I'm not I I couldn't really get a good video of myself putting this stuff on but this is what the thing well you'll you'll see when you get it but you just just you know be careful be slow when you're squeezing it out and then you know you kind of just have to like rub it rub it off because it's gonna it's gonna try to stick to the end of the syringe and make like a long thin gooey strand so you just gotta kind of like press the end of the syringe against the cereal and like scrape it off if that makes sense but yeah that that's a I mean that's a honestly if you did one of those little dots like if you did like out of those two dots the one that's like bigger that would probably be enough to get you high but like if you want to get like a decent like pretty long hyeyeon I would do maybe like what I have on there now anyways I'll I'll do I'll send you this video and I'll send you one for the cartridges because I want to explain some stuff about those - have a good day man", "L89qynPU4RQ": "hey Melanie toasted bun today we're decarboxylated in the insta-buck check

insta pot things like that so if that interests you check it out subscribe to my channel right now and let's get started alright I get so excited when I'm making video so I'm sorry I will control myself we are making we're gonna talk about decarboxylated now if you will click on this video you probably already know what it is you have to activate your THC before you consume it it's important step when making edibles so I have been doing the research and just definitely when I look at the scientific research because you know there's a scientific research now into this dkebabs leading at 240 degrees for 40 minutes is really like the perfect temperature to get your weed decarboxylated and all your THC a converted properly to THC with that too but not going too far to CBN which would be like very sedating which is kind of fun too but anyway we're gonna do it in the instant instant pot is perfect because look forgive in the name instant pot I mean what what more could you do also thanks to pot magically under high pressure hits to 240 degrees which is the perfect temperature that you are looking for so um if this interests you keep watching and I'll show you how to decarbonise de pot okay so we're gonna do carve a quarter ounce of canna so hard I got this a while ago at nature's medicine it's coming in at 25 percent THC and it smells so good all right it's time to decarboxylate our cannabis it is an amazing jar with a Mason lip and I just put it on loose like a finger tight like okay all the way on but not like cinched down tight okay so then I put this oh I add two cups of water to my insta pot now you can put like a you know a little tray down the block bottom the grate down the bottom but I just take this and stick it right in my insta pot I have a 6 quart insta pot okay so the cannabis is in the jar lid closed in the insta pot now in there is also 2 cups of water and closing the lid we're gonna set it 40 minutes at high pressure and that will do it hey can you hear it rattling sometimes this is coming up to pressure rattles [Applause] alright so the 40 minutes are up and we're gonna do a quick release [Music] [Applause] alright so as you can see it like you eat shoots out of there so like make sure that the area is safe and hear of anything so that's it we'll also it to you what it looks like it should be nice and pretty and brown and decarboxylate okay let's see what we've got let's check it out here is our decarboxylated cannabis I'm going to set it aside and let it cool and um it'll be perfect to use on infused oils or can of butter or tinctures I think I'm gonna make a tincture next check it out I'm gonna make a video see you soon thanks for watching bye", "fFI-Eqp5qck": "hey guys nurse colleen here i'm gonna make some suppositories you guys ready for this they are so medicinal so potent they're actually ten times more potent than uh taking something orally and not psychoactive so you get all that medicine without the psychoactive effects and they're very hard to find they can't find them in any dispensers so i'm making my own so we got some cocoa butter and you want to use cocoa butter instead of coconut oil because coconut oil melts at a lower temperature coconut butter will stay solid at a higher temperature cocoa butter so we're melting the cocoa butter and we have some butter and i just got it on amazon and then we have the um rso pico pool can't extract full extract cannabis oil and i'm gonna let the cocoa butter melt a little bit and then when it's almost done i'm going to put the rso in [Music] i'm using a double boiler method here so the pan has water in it and the water is boiling and heating up the cocoa butter in here there's no coco there's no water in the cocoa butter it's all cocoa butter melted so now i'm going to add the rso whole extract cannabis oil i actually have endometriosis so i'm going to use these pod stories for me to get major cramps so i'm going to use this depository like a tampon and use it for that you can use them for menstrual cramps back pain different cancers if someone has nausea vomiting can't take anything orally this is a good way to get the medicine in all right now i'm going to install the uh little molds i have some little molds here they actually have suppository molds that you can purchase but this is from magical butter for edibles but i'm going to use it for repositories it's a nice little shape but you could use a straw if you don't have mold and just use like some medical tape or you can melt the end of it and then fill it and then just cut it about an inch all right so we're gonna fill this and then i'm gonna use the extra as like a top of the lotion [Music] little bars down here make nice little um like topical bars so i'm gonna let them cool and then i'm going to put them in the freezer and they can stay in the freezer for up to six months [Music] okay we're ready the suppositories are done you're ready uh total it was about 730 milligrams of rso and we used about two thirds of the mixture so these have about 486 milligrams 90 there so total is about five to six milligrams each us start low go slow you could easily melt these again and add more rso if it's not enough um i'm gonna use them for endometriosis and menstrual cramps you can use it uh rectally as well [Music] it's best to store it in the fridge or freezer and it can be stored up to six months but you could it's starting to kind of melt a little bit um you could make them in a thinner straw and cut the straw into little sections if you prefer they also have suppository molds that's how you make suppositories and for more information follow ask nurse colleen", "UQRQ_wCSgC0": "I just wanted to show our setup we found out we had mold on our on the Cannabis mostly on the leaves and only mainly on one plant and so we used a method that we found online I forgot about the net guys name but he's he's very knowledgeable in the field of cannabis and he basically said to use a cup of hydrogen peroxide per five gallons of water so this is ten gallons of water and 2 cups of hydrogen peroxide just 3% solution it's what you can get at the pharmacy it's what you have in your cabinet to do in first aid and you immerse the the cut this is this has already been immersed you immerse these stems the cannabis stems and this is for making Rick Simpson oil and you immerse them into here the solution with the hydrogen peroxide for 3 for about 5 minutes at most I think he said and then you put them into water and you just kind of you know rinse them off a little bit and then rinse them off I have the hose set up here I rinse them off one at a time and then I hang it and that's it so my plants are back behind those bubble sheds you can actually see my husband working on trimming the rest of the plant right now and so this is our setup for drying harvesting cannabis that has been infected with the mold tomash what's that mold called that it has huh huh powdery mildew is what we had mostly at the base of just one of them but they were all slightly infected but one of them the most and just at the bottom but anyway we went ahead and did all this I'll continue to use this for Rick Simpson oil and then we've have them hung on our old clothesline here and they're labeled because we have three three indica strains we're harvesting today nine pound hammer is one of them and then we've strategically put up some fans here to dry them faster and then see here we got another one 398 bubba kush and this one is I think lb TK or something like that so anyway that's all we got well they're still this is only half of half a bush and then we're going to do the other half of the bushes are the more infected stuff another day and a separate time once this has been rinsed and air dried with the fans see I've got two fans set up right there and I keep moving them around once those have dried for the most part we're gonna stick them in that top it's the kids Playhouse but it's just been read it's just been built and it's really it's perfect humidity I think it's 60 60 or 50 60 at this point so we've got the heater going on in there we'll get some fans put in there if we need to a dehumidifier to keep it at that I believe it's 60 60 you want it the temperatures and humidity so that's kind of our set up for now and our first harvest half of harvest and I live in Cabot Vermont this is all medicinal cannabis I got these these are ones that he has been following me these are the three plants that I planted back in April 2000 nineteen and it is now September 30th 2019 so in May June July August September that's five months of growth all indica strains all to be used for Rick Simpson oil and I'm really excited about that there's our cute little house and yeah good stuff so I'll keep you guys posted alright see you later", "zbwAPwHTkQg": "in the video I'm gonna change the world who can help me aren't we Mike we're gonna we're gonna tell them it's gonna happen", "wkJDaIPGCL8": "hey guys this is drevis connoisseurs and we're gonna do another segment for you today and today I didn't want to do something different I want to show you how to make moon rocks at home so we've got the what ifs moon rocks moon rocks on and I get some we've usually hand-selected covered in oil and if Keef so here I have a beautiful example of moving off and you'll see those in the pictures as well and I'll show you the inside of it so when we cut into it we could see the inside is our bud covered in a layer of oil and then dusted whisky mmm this smells wonderful this also had some terpenes added to it to make it smell like green apples so you can do that as well to your oil so of course where do we get all the Keef well if you have a large bust edge such as this you could get Keef collected in the bottom of it quite a bit of team that comes off of it as you can see on the tray and this key is the same teeth that you could use to dust you our butts with as well so before we go to the kitchen to show you the process we will show you the hand selection of nuts that we want to eat so guys that our next step is nugget selection so we have different kinds here on our tray some moonbeams some of the rest by Cove some be hazed and some Keats so here you definitely do not want to use anything long like this even though it's a nice snug you know we don't want to use it for our moon rock application what you're looking for is dance heart none something like this would could work if we take out the bottom so if we sniff that piece off this top piece could be a perfect little moon or nothing same with this this is a perfect example of what we want to use again something big like this not recommended unless you're going to take off the bottom and just use the top piece and of course in your bags you're gonna have lots of best stuff and this is perfect to use for your oil and anything you don't want to use if you have if you have no other way of producing our oil you don't have your homegrown your best bet is to research some methods of making oil or find somebody who knows how to do it because not we're not going to come we're not going to recommend you using highly flammable substances to make it concentrates of this woman but if you're if you have oil and you have found your terpenes that you'd like to use the next step is in the kitchen so come on by and see what we got brewing [Music] [Music] [Music] is a double boiler with some oil and our brush that we're gonna use and when they weaken the code these guys with it so these guys are prepared little nuggets that we hand chosen and then we use toothpicks in order to hold them up once once we coated them to keep them dry so let's see how we do that [Music] [Music] so we have tried many different brushes before this one and none of them successfully worked or was really hard to clean so this so far we found to be the perfect brush for doing the job and getting clean afterwards of course you don't want to mix your if you're using different terpene flavors to make them you don't want to mix your brushes because the flavors will get right into your product and will mix and with undesired results so here we have perfectly coated nut ready to be dried and then we're gonna show you the next step [Music] would give my all to get to you if there's a chance what can I that's what can I do you can make it you can make it happen would give my all to get to you if there's a chance [Music] [Music] [Music] would give my all to

a 15 ounce box of fruity pebbles two packs of jet puffed marshmallows not the cheap kind and some chill clear from true leave a nine pound hammer coming at eighty eight percent THC and of course sticks of butter mine are salted that's what I prefer you can get the unsalted kind if you want but I like sugary stuff so here I'm basically just showing you guys all the pots I'm gonna be using two pots a cup in a pan the first pot I'm gonna make sure it gets a good boil and I'm gonna put in another pot inside of that one double boil so I don't want to directly you know melt my butter I'm gonna melt it in another pot that's got water in it it just seems like a lot easier for me to do so that's what I do so here it is here is a cup of hot water that I put in the microwave because I completely my god I missed an entire section I forgot to let y'all know that I stopped recording by accident so I'm gonna let you guys know right here that I put in are you stick of butter and a half a stick of butter so this is basically what I use a whole stick and a half a stick of butter melted that down pretty good I put a cup of water in the microwave for three minutes and then I dropped my true clear syringe in there for one minute I just took it out and I'm touching it and make sure it's good to touch and I'm trying to get the top off which for some reason was very difficult so my brother stepped in and he got the top off for me usually when I make my edibles I just put the syringe out from the end and all of it comes slithering out but for whatever reason I guess it wasn't hot enough um there is a little technical difficulties in my kitchen today but nonetheless we got the whole gram into this wonderful concoction so I'm just showing you guys that once your butter is melted you're gonna want to take that heat it up distillate and put it into your melted butter that way it's evenly proportioned throughout your entire tray of infused goodies so once you get everything melted together you're just delaying your butter you're gonna insert your marshmallows I use an entire bag of marshmallows I got this completely melted down before I did anything else that way again the butter with the distillate is completely and evenly distributed through these marshmallows okay Oh carp oh my god this is very as ASMR if you're into that okay so anyway moving on so now I'm gonna put in this cereal crazy thing is I usually use a whole box of cereal and I didn't this time I don't know I'm trying new things every time I made this exact recipe because I'm trying to make big blocks of it so I'm just trying different things out with the amounts that I've been using so I used almost the entire box I probably left like two good bowls of cereal left the box and I'm just going ahead and I'm gonna mix that all together as thoroughly as possible and then I'm gonna add half a bag if that into this so that way there's chunks of marshmallow and my treats as well because who don't like chunks of marshmallows like Hello I know I do and if you don't you don't have to do this okay to each his own but I'm gonna have a party in my mouth and I'm gonna sleep so good knowing that I ate this so here I am I'm just mixing it up let me tell you I was catching carpal syndrome in my hand I was hurting okay my hand hurts so bad my wrist was not whipping it in the kitchen honey I was ready to give up I don't have my brother come in and step in and whip this thing a few times like I was ready to give up listen I was being so lazy I didn't even flip this whole thing and put marshmallows at the end so half of it had chunks and marshmallows and the other half didn't Here I am just butter in the pan so nothing sticks like it's sticking in this pot and I'm gonna get this all out and then I'm gonna evenly Pat it down onto this pan and that's really pretty much it it's so simple to do again I'm sorry for that other half like not being in the video it wasn't even that deep all you have to do is put a cup of water in the microwave and get it heated for three minutes and then just drop your syringe in there and melt the butter mm-hmm if you need a video for that that you probably shouldn't even be cooking it on let's be honest here so here I am just patting down the goods wink wink and I'm completely done so I'm gonna go ahead and put this in the frigerator for one hour and then I'm going to cut this up into pieces and put it in a ziplock bags tada this was actually two pieces but since I put them in Ziploc bags in the refrigerator they melted together I mean about roughly 16 or 20 pieces if I cut them into squares you do the math if you want to know how many milligrams whatever whatever but nonetheless I really did that I mean look at this it's beautiful it's so freakin good and soft and chewy mmm good anyways if you like this video make sure you like subscribe and comment I will be posting more content in the future and follow me on instagram at castor oil where I am

machine-to-machine all skyrocket in popularity and as customers continue to demand greater and greater data rates to their mobile device every cellular provider around the world will continue to face the paramount problem of bandwidth shortage today the cellular world operates in small slices of frequency below 5 gigahertz all of these spectrum bands contain a sliver of bandwidth such that a cell tower can only transmit a certain amount of capacity even using today's 4G LTE technology the key to alleviate this growing spectrum shortage is to operate at higher frequencies millimeter wave frequencies such as 28 G Gertz and 38  Hertz we're so much more raw bandwidth is available and faster data rates can thus be delivered to the next generation of smartphones Wireless developers must understand and characterize this millimeter wave regime of 28 and 38 gigahertz radio wave propagation in densely populated urban environments a common myth among wireless practitioners today is that rainfall and oxygen will attenuate millimeter wave radio frequencies however our work and work in the satellite industry have shown that at 28  Hertz neither rainfall nor the atmosphere will greatly attenuate wireless propagation and while you wireless is one of the first academic research centres in the world to characterize the millimeter wave frequencies of 28 Hertz and 38 gigahertz for 5g cellular fifth generation and we've performed these measurements in one of the toughest and most densely populated areas in the world New York City we selected various transmitter locations on rooftops and balconies in downtown Brooklyn and Manhattan to mimic cell towers at different heights we also selected random receiver sites in common pedestrian areas such as sidewalks courtyards parks and plazas all within several blocks of the transmitters we also wanted to study how 28 gigahertz propagates into a building so we conducted the signal strength tests to measure reflection and penetration through building materials such as brick concrete glass and drywall in total we had four transmitter locations over 30 receiver locations and we conducted these measurements over four months to help us characterize and model 28 gigahertz propagation our measurement equipment is a custom-built channel sounder that uses a sliding correlator method as a dynamic range almost 180 decibels and we calibrated the system twice a day we use highly directional antennas which broadcast and receive radio waves in very specific directions and we automatically rotate these antennas 360 degrees using a robotic system this equipment allows us to measure and resolve incoming radio waves with a spatial resolution of 10 degrees and a time resolution of about 2.5 nanoseconds in other words we can identify and record very accurately where and when the radio waves are arriving we use the National Instruments LabVIEW programming suite to record data and control the robotic antenna system using LabVIEW installed on a simple laptop we recorded thousands of measurements over four months collecting over 100 gigabytes of raw data the raw data was saved in simple text files containing received power over time these files were post processed to produce meaningful statistics we generate propagation statistics such as the angular spread of the departing and arriving radio waves the average number of unique directions to receive energy and how long the radio waves propagate in the environment we also produce statistics such as signal strength at a particular distance from a transmitter which helped determine the cell radius and the density of the cell towers needed to provide adequate coverage these statistics are very useful in designing the hardware and algorithms for the mobile device as well as Space Station infrastructure for the next generation of cellular technology from our data we measured an average path loss exponent 5.7 at 28 gigahertz however we found that radio waves can propagate long distances in a highly reflective environment and base stations can still communicate with smartphones up to 200 meters away if using directional antennas beyond that distance the phone will need to hand off to another cell tower thus future 28 gigahertz base stations will be Pico cells of one to 200 meters in range and phased antenna arrays capable of beam steering will be needed to overcome the high path loss and improve link quality our building penetration tests showed that tinted glass it's highly reflective with 80 percent of power being reflected concrete and brick showed similar reflectivity drywall and mount in the class with a few centimeters thick had small penetration losses of six point eight and three point six DB with moderate reflectivity so indoor access points may be needed when users enter the room combining energy contained in the beams from German directions at a receiver can greatly improve signal quality and a link budget for example using our measured data we've been attached more than 70 be protected an improvement in path loss can be achieved when we combine the three strides the powers coherently which is very significant to carriers for a range extension and the return on infrastructure investment understanding the channel allows researchers and engineers to then begin building the infrastructure to provide multi gigabit per second data rates to mobile phones in urban environments using highly directional steerable antennas NYU Wireless researchers at NYU and NYU poly are leading the way in this new future is in a very exciting future you", "f60vHTwmdS4": "welcome back it's 4/20 shorty and this week I got a request to do video it was a request on how to do dosing of RSO so I have some friends that want to start taking ourselves and it's a very great thing for pain I take it every day and I want to get to show them the dose that a beginner would take which is just this much sides of a grain of rice basically and then I will show you what I take see if I can see in the lane that's what I would take it's about a third of a gram and you just take it put it on the back of your cheese I'll close this mm-hmm and you let it sit there for as long as you can take it sometimes it just starts to taste kind of nasty and I have to take a lot so I have like a big glob in my mouth then I just take my water I'm going to drink the water it kind of hardens it up and it makes it into a little ball so you can just slow it down now as you can see I still have some one to my teeth which is great because that absorbs into your bloodstream the quickest now when I took the initial dose the beginners dose I would just stick a little back my teeth and leave it there as I sort of take it more and more you can't just leave that big thing there um I I'm not a two person so I don't put you in my mouth and so that's a very very uncomfortable feeling to me and so I just take it like I just showed you and drink something cold and it just falls it up and makes it a pill so they need you swallow it and if you drink something warm it will definitely make it more of a liquid okay so it'll be everywhere in your mouth and so don't make that mistake but I want to actually get to show and share with my friends that the beginning dose is rather small and you just work up to a third of a gram which is in one of the little syringes it's like the whole up to ten and actually its 1.0 so it's a whole milligram or a whole gram and you just take a third of that three times a day and it works better than any pain medicine I've ever had and I have no side effects I eat all the time I sleep regularly and I I don't have any more I I don't have as much pain I can't say I don't have any more but nothing's ever been able to get rid of all you never had so it's the best thing that can work for me though it doesn't give me side-effects it doesn't hurt my liver it doesn't do so many things that the other meds do to your body I mean let alone take it it takes a bunch out of your liver and also does really bad things I mean you hear about all these bad side effects you don't like you know everything from insomnia to bleeding and depression and this doesn't have Anna this has none of it if you have a great appetite you're happy you feel better and so I can just I I recommend it and I just wanted to get to show a quick video of how I do the dosing and get to show that with my friends that asked me to do so so I hope this helps everybody and I hope y'all have a peaceful day and keep tuning in and subscribe", "no5A3FgJcPc": "Corvo is a leading RF supplier to all the major base station manufacturers and we work with them to bring new technologies each generation and I think in 5g in particular we've got a key role to play we're leaders in defence and aerospace which which gives us advanced technologies and millimeter wave applications when we look at extending frequency ranges up higher and into the millimeter wave spectrum you quickly get into phased array radar implementations so that you can form the energy into a beam to get as much distance as you can when you do that you have an array of power amplifiers and other RF arts in there to help steer the the beam and of course and provide the power it's all about getting as much performance as you can with as few elements as you can and also doing it with the highest efficiency to keep the thermal dissipation from becoming a problem and gallium nitride is ideally suited for these systems with its efficiency and frequency characteristics and we see wide adoption of that in the infrastructure side of 5g [Music]", "evtSWzJ-Uec": "so you want to make a cannabis alcohol tincture using the cold method you're in the right place welcome to truebuds tv it's simple but take some time grab a very high proof liquor like everclear 120 the higher the proof the better i have a half ounce of some outdoor cali an ounce of trim and shake or cheesecloth and strainer we're also going to do a coffee filter strain as well our jars to put it in and then something to pour or a portion later we're going to use some funnels too or i'll show you a hack there as well we have our baking sheet with our crinkled up parchment this is for decarboxylating our blood to activate that thca i crinkle it up just so it gets a little better surface area and doesn't burn we have this half here we're putting on you don't got to grind it up all the way you could use your hands or whatever and then we're just going to dump the ounce of trim and shake on there and then next let's decarboxylate cover it with foil for one hour at 225 degrees fahrenheit this is crucial now let's go ahead and put that in the jar it's as simple as that we're going to put that half of the outdoor decarb tally in there then we're going to put about a pint of liquor in it a little bit i'm going to break this trim and shake down a little more after being decarb just to experiment my first time doing it so we'll see what happens we're just going to go and add the everclear like i said you could use whatever bacardi 151 you could use a whiskey you know a moonshine just make sure it's a high proof we're going to proceed to go ahead here and put that 16 ounces of this 120 proof everclear in with that half ounce this is going to be a less potent batch my goal with this one is to make a can of sugar experiment with recipes with that i'm also going to take that can of sugar and do a simple syrup with it for our cocktail series so if you haven't caught any of those other simple syrup recipes i recommend checking them out next this is going to be the more potent one here we're going to do about 12 ounces total i think but let's put a cup in the start and see how that's looking so this is that full hat or part of me this is the full ounce of the trim and shake there's a cup in there eight ounces not enough let's add four more so we're doing 12 ounces total to that one ounce of the trim and shake hopefully get something nice and potent here shake it up put it in the freezer you're gonna want to repeat this daily shaking it at least two to three four times however many you want a day i left it in the freezer for two weeks the beauty here is kind of the longer the better can stay in there for however long you like let's strain it through this fine cheesecloth here i recommend wearing gloves to squeeze it out at the end just to keep that alcohol off your hands i do this really no matter what no matter what infusion i'm doing so let's go ahead strain that out and we're about ready for the next step the coffee filter and here's that little hack i was saying you could use a funnel or you can make your own by just cutting a water bottle soda bottle whatever let's put the coffee filter in here to strain it through and i'll show you at the end here why we do this to collect any extra sediment you know that kind of made it through the cheesecloth even though we used a really fine cheesecloth so i got the other water bottle gonna do the same thing to do two runs on each and here's what it's looking like trim and shake very crucial you could see how much was there flower not so much but it was still nice to get out the second run through for both really wasn't necessary to be completely honest so you could save your time do one that does take a little time too so now we're going to go ahead and do the t-check 2 potency testing device let's check the first one here and see what's going on testing the infusion okay 2.4 milligrams per milliliter pretty weak actually so we'll turn that into the sugar like i was saying it'll be interesting to experiment with i'm really wondering what the other one's going to be now so 11.7 let's see what the tablespoon is 35 not bad you know kind of weak so let's do the more potent this is what i'm really curious about because i would even do more next time make it more potent maybe do an ounce of flour instead of the trim and shake to really get it up a notch testing the infusion testing the infusion let's get it let's see what it's coming in at and i'm always ready for this always curious let's see 8.9 milligrams per milliliter that's solid that's a nice amount that's like a good tincture right there let's see i like just doing another one so you guys can see 44 basically per teaspoon tablespoon 131.5 that's gonna hit that's gonna hit good yeah so i'm gonna go ahead put three in here wait about an hour and a half or so to when it should have peaked or be peaking and let you know if i think the uh t check is accurate and my overall thoughts on my first cold methane tincture it's an acquired taste you know just like alcohol but you just gotta let it sit there enjoy the burn i took three milliliters which is approximately 27 milligrams of thc according to the t check 2 and it's about an hour and a half later and i would agree with that reading seems about right that 25 to 30 milligram sweet spot for me you know gets me feeling really good this one has me really calm just hanging but not too much so i would say it's about right and if you think this thing's dope if you think the t-check's cool i'll put a link with a discount below you know i get a little something on the back end but seems pretty accurate for everything i've done so far i need to experience more with the flower for it but this was solid i even used the little syringe they have because it's way more accurate than the dropper so i could be exact with you and now for my favorite part like what can we learn from this experience what can i do better next time i would say next time just make it stronger and maybe even let it sit longer have a couple working at all points because that three milliliters is a lot for me it's not that much but like maybe that at the same time that it's good for you if you have a lower tolerance but i want to make it stronger but at the same time too that is a good way to use your trim and shake that you have just laying around just put in some strong liquor let it sit use it at a later date so more videos coming about this experimenting with it seeing what we can do with it but that's kind of my thoughts what else can we do better sit longer more potent so when i say more potent i'm thinking use more flour that's more potent maybe even do a concentrate you know just keep experimenting because i see the value in this that it can offer especially once you get it down so it's just like oh you know half of this if it was 0.5 milliliters that's smacking that's good but either way the potency was there it was i'm happy with it i'm happy with this recipe and i'm happy to fulfill because people have been asking like dude when can you make this i'm like i'm gonna make it i'm gonna make it but i have been putting it on the back burner i'm not gonna lie because i know it just takes time i'm like but i just should have done it a while ago you just let it sit there and like i said just go shake it up it's about it it's fun always having something infusing it's like inspired me to do other types of infusions too that whatever i'm kind of want to rant right now what else to talk about i guess that's it i guess that sums up video so thank you for hanging out i hope you like this drop a comment below like i said because i will make what you want if i get enough people saying it giving it a thumbs up or whatever so see you later [Music] you", "lYyECaTnxHM": "what's going on you guys how's it going today it's David here just about a year [ __ ] I just wanted to come in chitchat for a few minutes I took my oil pill my Rick Simpson oil pill at 11:30 or so maybe noon and so I stayed awake all day cuz of the team I explained it on my videos before when I take the Rick Simpson oil to pill it the whole left side of my body which was tingly before I even had started react Simpson oil but the left side of my body is severely tingling which will not let me fall asleep almost sometimes all night long right so I'll take it in the evening and four o'clock in the morning I'll be like what are you doing awake kind of thing so I didn't take it yesterday all right day before yesterday and I didn't take it last night so today what I did was I took it at about 11:00 after I took it I wanted to stay awake all day so that I can fall asleep at night and stuff and go you know a normal sleep schedule so that's what I'm doing now I'm staying awake it's just now 8:03 so I'm gonna go ahead and fall asleep now I'm gonna take your drink of this come on Netflix on lay down hope to fall asleep all these kids over to buy they're being a little louder but anyhow the kids oh yeah remember anyway like comment subscribe that's applicable and better every day and smile as when she lost a fan today and tomorrow hope you guys have an amazing evening I love you guys", "gqOzVhwG9ZI": "you haven't heard this anywhere else Tommy Chong of Cheech and Chong Fame announces to us that he has cancer I spoke with Chung earlier this evening we're going to talk about the legalization of marijuana issue but then he told me this the Tommy Chong is here so Tommy good to see you we brought you in to talk about this New York State about lessening the laws for possession in public but you have an announcement to make what is it my announcement is that I was diagnosed with prostate cancer but a Moute about a month ago and I'm going to start treating it with cannabis oil or hemp oil or pot oil and and if the reason I'm treating it with hemp oil is because I looked at a video just recently called run from the Cure by Rick Simpson and it documents a whole how he cured his melanoma cancer with by using hemp oil you believe that you think that you you got prostate cancer in prison after you you know the the paraphernalia and the company the internet companies selling the bonds it was this was 2003 do you think that you got it in prison why yeah that's that's my feeling because I was totally healthy when I went in jail and I hadn't smoked pot before I went in jail and then while I was in jail I was cleaners a whistle because a drug tested me almost every day and I started having problems with my prostate right there I remember very well because when you have problems you have to get up in the middle of night you gotta pee a lot and and then I also contact a gout while I was in prison from the food and so I think it's a combination the food and the fact that the prison itself in Taft California is built over a toxic waste dump and and they have a thing there called Bali fever that other prisoners were getting and they don't even know what it was it some sort of wasting disease so I I think I got it there yeah we should tell you haven't smoked pot in how long people you're a pothead but you haven't smoked pot in no well I laid off for about a year you know when I started getting kind of weird health issues you know which actually turned out to be prostrate cancer and so III did everything I'm a very holistic person I went on the juices and everything you know no red meat and the whole bit and so but now that I found out that that the hemp oil will help the prostate hey I'm back man do you think people are short-sighted because many people have an issue with it morally and do you think people are being short-sighted about especially that you know what marijuana can do to you as it compares to alcohol and other drugs can also what it means economically should should we and meaning the country as a whole and our leaders be looking at regulating marijuana as a way to help to boost this economy I know actually I'm against it III think it's you lately leave it the way it is I mean we don't need more taxes we don't need to be taxing something like they're doing with tobacco you know I I mean because again where does that money where does the tax money go we want to do a black hole called the government I think you're gonna I think we're gonna think that find it out it you're saying you don't think it should be legalized let's get this straight you don't think pot should be legalized no I don't think you should be taxed you know I think it should be totally it should be totally legal yeah but it shouldn't be taxed why how can you eagle-eyes it and regulate it and then not taxes tax it most things that are regulations legalize are taxed all you have to do is decriminalize it just take away the criminal penalties we don't need a system of who we're gonna buy it from we got it growers that we buy it from we don't need to say we got people that deal that will come to your house we don't need a government regulation to tell us this is good part that's bad part we don't need any of that we've got everything in place just just take away the penalty Tommy Cheung thank you so much thank you for being candid with us about prostate cancer and for telling our viewers and that exclusive here on CNN and we wish you the very best okay thank you and I want to come back and when I'm cured and let you know how it went

other week I'm always excited to come back and do another fun episode so my team has gotten together and we've come up with a new episode and guys this one is pretty creative this one is how to make weed moon rocks you heard me pop peeps we're making moon rocks you know you heard everybody in the rap game talking about moon rocks what is moon rocks believe it or not pie peeps pop mom I've never had moon rocks so I think this is probably the second episode if you hurt me last week or a couple weeks ago I mentioned there was something else that I hadn't done before a particular brand I hadn't had I'm not gonna tell you but you should have been watching now you've learned something else pop mom has not had any moon rocks so for all my pop peeps that are new to the show and maybe just you know my regular pop peeps you follow me you may not know what moon rocks are there are rumors that the dispensary Starbuzz 761st concocted them with legendary West Coast rapper corrupt he popularized it and made it popular and it became corrupt moon rocks a version of his trademark version of corrupt moon rocks they are saying that historically they use Girl Scout cookies and you dip it in hash oil with key so if you go to Leafly that calm they'll give you just a little bit of history to rumor history it'll give you some other stuff about how strong moon rocks is but it's pop on 4/20 pop fans I just want to make sure you had a little bit of history there's reasons why people take moon rocks they're very heavily it concentrates super buzz I know a lot of people in a medical community that I know love moon rocks because it takes that pain away once you smoke them use them however it really hits the the place you wanted to hit as far as concentrate on it it really gives you any got advice about a turn so let's get into how to make moonrocks Pat peeps y'all know I love everything simple so when we was doing this video I had to make it very simple for you guys and literally you only need three things and I'm serious my peeps just three things so today we're going to be using will be called in the industry is to concentrate it's a dissonant oil so this is a 0.5 this one in particular shout out to essence dispensary right here in Las Vegas Nevada on the strip they got this to me and just to let you see pop peeps this is the packaging this is the lucid distilled oil so you do need some type of the steel or hash oil for this recipe the next thing that you're going to need is some bud this one in particular I think I'm using biology to be honest with you this one I believe is tested at about 19 percent THC this is fire OG I had it in my mason jar I believe I was gonna cook with it or do something else but we're gonna make it so we had that the next item we have is basically this is nothing but another concentrate it's called kief all of you all have it if you ever grind wheat up in your grinders you have keeping that third chamber and final chamber it's all the trichomes that come off of the but when you're grinding it and all of that so those are simply the three things you need to make the moon rocks today we're gonna keep it simple because I wanted to do something that you all can perform at home and have fun with moon rocks are fun I'm gonna make this one and I'm gonna try to save it but I doubt it but it's nice to do moon rocks holidays birthdays if you're in a lot of pain so let's get started one of the thing pop peeps that you might need just simply some tongs whatever you got pick it up cuz you're gonna have to be able to roll some of this around so you'll see how we're going to use it pop peeps I love this syringe if you're dealing with any discipline oils I'm sure they come other ways with the syringe is a lot more easier because you can kind of like just dab it all over it's sort of like you know so basically we're just gonna take this and I'm gonna sit it down and I'm just gonna kind of run all of my dissolute oil or if you got hash or you know a lot of hash at makers out there and then then I'm just gonna drizzle and as you can see this is gonna be super sticky and we want that because this actual discipline is gonna have it's gonna have Terps in it so this is where I'm gonna come and use these little tongues so I can bring it up to the camera and I think these might be a little too big okay all right so I'm just gonna keep this oil going around as you can see it will glob up on you so just kind of try peeps try to do this the best way you can it's gonna get a little messy and that's okay that's what the tongues are fourth and as you can see I'm trying to do it and do my camera the tongues are like a little bit in the way but nonetheless we don't do this okay so got all that on it and what you want to do is make sure it's on there it's tacky which it is I see I got a little bit of oil here I'm trying to scoop it up and put it on it we want all of that on there and then can we see that I have to oil on there it's really sticky can we see all that stickiness on it so I'm gonna hurry up and get ready to roll it into Keith so that's what we're gonna do see the oil a hash or whatever you use it you're gonna be able to roll this around and a Keith oil that stuck with it and if you have any oil left you can just like totally put that on top sorry pop beeps this is real life stuff and see how that just covers that because of that dissonant wheel or your hash oil is gonna let it just stick to that and I just want to make sure it gets all that Keith and pop beeps if you have a another way that you made move rocks definitely make sure you hit me up we're gonna have a conversation about this young I'm doing this for the first time my team shout out to them coming up with new recipes with a summer to keep you pop peeps interested and keep liking and subscribing but we're trying new things around here trying to keep you guys entertained we know we all staying at home right now I think that looks great I can't believe I just made a moon rock with my papi this is really legendary seriously no but you guys can see my camera guy he's pretty sharp too let me bring that over so far how's that looking in the camera see that the nice thickness and you want to use pop keeps a nice bud that's sturdy you don't want something that's flimsy once again shout out to essence we're getting this oil in and Keith to me and this Lucid oil is perfect for this so if you have any discipline oil use it if you have any cash oil use it it'll work perfectly fine so five peeps as you can see I'm left with a messy needle and one moon rock my peeps this is how simply that was literally a three-step process I don't think I've done anything that's simple but now the next part to this is letting it dry so pop peeps this is gonna dry for a few days and because of editing and video I'm gonna come back at this dry and then I'm gonna show you how to smoke a moon rock all right pop peeps see you when it dries", "exIABukh7PM": "hey guys today is day 75 of taking Rick Simpson oil or RSO or FEC oh so full extract cannabis oil and Wow kinda I'm getting into the flow of it I'm getting in the rhythm it's been 75 days I am at the full one gram a day dose which is really exciting to be feeling like okay I'm taking the full dose I'm doing it all of the healing is going to happen and is happening so for anybody just tuning in to these videos I have a really rare form of Crohn's disease that attacks my GI tract and causes a lot of bleeding and open wounds throughout my entire GI tract as well as tumors in my bones in my spine and my femur that are crazy crazy painful and so I've been doing this protocol to work to heal them so where we are right now I wanted to give you a couple updates of some changes in what's going on yesterday was the first day I was able to add in some CBD only so I've been taking the concentrate made out of Gorilla Glue so it's homegrown Sam and I made it and now I've been able to have some access to some concentrated oil that CBD only from LeBeau and Joe's CBD which is amazing there are two rad guys out of Massachusetts that are making this beautiful farm-to-table farm-to-table farm - its kind of farm-to-table depending on how you ingested a beautiful extract and so I'm adding that in and I did 1/10 of a gram orally yesterday and in addition to the full gorilla glue THC suppositories with RSO that I've been making and today was really exciting actually because I woke up in the morning and I felt a little less like hungover and wiped out and had a little less brain fog this morning waking up that was just with a 1/10 of a gram orally added in last night so I'm really excited and really hopeful about adding that CBD in to hopefully balance out some of the brain fog and the other side effects of it as well as for all of the other amazing properties that CBD can bring to the experience I mean I'll go into that a little bit more detail and some other videos but there's some research and some accounts being done of what's the best streams to help heal whatever you're taking the cannabis concentrates for and CBD has been shown to help a lot with breast cancer and especially estrogen induced problems or illnesses diseases whatever you want to call them another thing that has been interesting is my hormones have always been really regular at least my menstrual cycle has been really regular ever since I got my first period when I was 10 actually so every like 28 or 29 days I'm usually pretty exact but since I've been starting on the RSL protocol my cycles have been a whole lot shorter so right around 25 days and a lot more period cramps and symptoms and really really really hormonal and emotional and like all the tears the waterworks factor is like super on like a couple days before and during my period so that's been interesting and I'm so I'm interested about like the correlation between the cannabis and the hormones in my body since the your hormones affect your menstrual cycle so all that being said 75 days it's because I didn't can't believe I made it this far 26 days left for me to get the full 60 grams of RSO within 90 days so that I'm still counting only for the concentrated THC RSO and so I'll have some additional grams of the CBD on top of it all right I hope everybody has a beautiful day and thanks for checking in with me", "sXUaNwPebZc": "hi my name is Tommaso I don't know why I'm doing this I have family all around me they had me recording this and the significance is well I've had Ms for 21 years

thought but let me tell you the meaning the happiness that comes into my life is only for one reason and it's this Rick Simpson oil and it really does work and I want people to know that because I haven't been able to move this well without it I wasn't capable of making it without it and I want to know that people see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel which seems so absurd to say because everybody says it right but unless you believe it it doesn't mean anything you know what I found my belief and I'm going there and this is just the beginning but watch me like I said it's been 21 years that I've had MS it is now October 11th 2016 and the next time I don't know how long but I guarantee it's gonna be better than now I'll talk to you later hopefully soon bye", "L5-94-kFwsw":

whole unit of symbiotic relationships and cannabis is like the conductor in the meantime I've also had a chronic pain problem I have a bone spur on my lower vertebrae I had been on gabapentin vicodin flexural I had a nerve stimulator that I wore on my back well now I had these edibles and I'm making for other people and I thought well you know I'm gonna give it a try first I went off the flexural I had already gone off the gabapentin I was like I'm sleeping good at night and and it was I never went after this for myself it was all about cancer I wasn't trying to help myself but it's helped me it made me remember everything I ever wanted to do since I was young I always tell my mom I don't know what I want to be when I grow up I want to help people and therefore I was like okay so she's basically explaining to me that I need to inform people just inform them give them some knowledge and if they take it and they run with it great if they don't then they don't okay before I met Eddie I pen after I met Eddie I got a little better because now I'm applying this made of healing oil to my gums and I'm doing baked goods doing other products I started relieving the pain in the back you know and I'm like okay I have something here that gave me hope then Eddie had reached out to me and said because I take the medicine myself my wife passed away two weeks after my mom passed away in an accident a block up the street from my home and it put me in a depressed depressed Satan where I couldn't sleep I started taking the medicine myself because he told me you need to take this so you can sleep it'll give you the right kind of sleep and it'll help with that I was able to take the medicine and find out like you know what this is what I want to do I want to help people that are like me and like my mom and so what I started to do is I talked to him and he saw me I have these medicines this medicine and it's available to people but people don't know about it so what I did is I would take his pamphlet and I would see people that needed to help and I would explain to them how this helps and this is who you need to contact now to get on to somebody that was really helped by this my husband he had quit work years ago he had a mental breakdown he's been diabetic since he was a kid bad arthritis he's had a few heart attacks and he was diagnosed with dementia I didn't even think to give him any of the edibles and stuff that I was working with or any any of this oil even though I thought you know I thought this this really is a tool that everybody should have if they want it if it's gonna help him but I didn't think about it helping him because he's already confused you know I'm how could I make it worse I went I forgot to order his sleeping medication and the doctor was just getting ready to put him on it's the step just before hospice because I told her I said I am just overwhelmed I said I cannot take care of him the way I need to and take care of my grandson who I ads and the grandbaby that my daughter had and I was just totally overwhelmed and she says what we're gonna put him on a pre hospice and get you some more help well I ran out of sleeping pills for him and I was he's just like frantic I'm not gonna sleep I'm not gonna sleep so I gave him a cookie I said here have this the next morning he woke up and he said he slept so good and he felt so good that he wanted to try that again well now he is totally off of trazadone he's off most of his psych meds he was on prednisone every day for the horrible pain of arthritis in his joints is he can't lift his arms up because his shoulders are frozen no God he's fallen and broken his hip you know he's just a mess he is off prednisone completely for the first time in years his diabetes is way better controlled and his his mind is working again he takes care of all his own doctor's appointments all his prescriptions he's picked up chores back in the house again he does the dishes he does the laundry yeah he he doesn't he's not real good about separating the whites out you know but he converses like a normal person he remembers where we're going tomorrow this this was his miracle and my miracle this was it to be afraid to give it to me because I thought it'd make him more confused when he already had dementia and to have it be what has helped his mind recover because he's not on all those toxic drugs anymore I I just I think it's a tool that we should all be able to use if we need it but it should just be available to us I think it's a damn shame that the government has done things the way they have when they really need to be helping people not not hurting people and not denying him what can help them I watched cancer with double mastectomy 'zed and my family and I had watched throat voice boxes come out what am I going to do now you know so I just got serious about being anti chemo and once I went and got on YouTube my world changed you know ray is like a ray of sunshine for all his friends and I mean he'd walk through the hospital and just seeing him would make people smile and for me to lose this ray of sunshine to cancer was was just horrible and I said well Ray Ray Ray I said I'm gonna look some stuff up I said you want to try this oil I printed up a bunch of stuff for him to look at I said let's let's go get cards let's go find this oil we went from store to store and we couldn't we couldn't find this stuff we we couldn't find it at all we saw lots of lots of just marijuana bud and all kinds of different products and some edibles and stuff but we just couldn't find it and so I told ray I said well I said I'll make it", "0ygtX2nyexo": "I would like to tell you\nabout the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me in my years\nof working as a palliative care physician. This happened a couple of years ago. I was asked as a consultant\nto see a woman in her 70s -- retired English professor\nwho had pancreatic cancer. I was asked to see her because\nshe had pain, nausea, vomiting ... When I went to see her,\nwe talked about those symptoms and in the course of that consultation, she asked me whether I thought\nthat medical marijuana might help her. I thought back to everything that I had learned in medical school\nabout medical marijuana, which didn't take very long\nbecause I had learned absolutely nothing. And so I told her that as far as I knew, medical marijuana\nhad no benefits whatsoever. And she smiled and nodded and reached\ninto the handbag next to the bed, and pulled out a stack of about a dozen\nrandomized controlled trials showing that medical\nmarijuana has benefits for symptoms like nausea\nand pain and anxiety. She handed me those articles and said, \"Maybe you should read these\nbefore offering an opinion ... doctor.\" (Laughter) So I did. That night I read all of those articles\nand found a bunch more. When I came to see her the next morning, I had to admit that it looks like\nthere is some evidence that marijuana can offer medical benefits and I suggested that if she\nreally was interested, she should try it. You know what she said? This 73-year-old,\nretired English professor? She said, \"I did try it\nabout six months ago. It was amazing. I've been using it every day since. It's the best drug I've discovered. I don't know why it took me 73 years\nto discover this stuff. It's amazing.\" (Laughter) That was the moment at which I realized I needed to learn something\nabout medical marijuana because what I was prepared for\nin medical school bore no relationship to reality. So I started reading more articles,\nI started talking to researchers, I started talking to doctors, and most importantly,\nI started listening to patients. I ended up writing a book\nbased on those conversations, and that book really revolved\naround three surprises -- surprises to me, anyway. One I already alluded to -- that there really are some benefits\nto medical marijuana. Those benefits may not be\nas huge or as stunning as some of the most avid proponents\nof medical marijuana would have us believe, but they are real. Surprise number two: medical marijuana does have some risks. Those risks may not be\nas huge and as scary as some of the opponents of medical\nmarijuana would have us believe, but they are real risks, nonetheless. But it was the third surprise\nthat was most ... surprising. And that is that a lot\nof the patients I talked with who've turned to medical\nmarijuana for help, weren't turning to medical marijuana\nbecause of its benefits or the balance of risks and benefits, or because they thought\nit was a wonder drug, but because it gave them\ncontrol over their illness. It let them manage their health in a way that was productive and efficient and effective and comfortable for them. To show you what I mean,\nlet me tell you about another patient. Robin was in her early 40s when I met her. She looked though\nlike she was in her late 60s. She had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis\nfor the last 20 years, her hands were gnarled by arthritis, her spine was crooked, she had to rely\non a wheelchair to get around. She looked weak and frail, and I guess physically she probably was, but emotionally,\ncognitively, psychologically, she was among the toughest\npeople I've ever met. And when I sat down next to her in a medical marijuana dispensary\nin Northern California to ask her about why she turned\nto medical marijuana, what it did for her and how it helped her, she started out by telling me things that I had heard\nfrom many patients before. It helped with her anxiety; it helped with her pain; when her pain was better,\nshe slept better. And I'd heard all that before. But then she said something\nthat I'd never heard before, and that is that it gave her\ncontrol over her life and over her health. She could use it when she wanted, in the way that she wanted, at the dose and frequency\nthat worked for her. And if it didn't work for her,\nthen she could make changes. Everything was up to her. The most important thing she said was she didn't need\nanybody else's permission -- not a clinic appointment,\nnot a doctor's prescription, not a pharmacist's order. It was all up to her. She was in control. And if that seems like a little thing\nfor somebody with chronic illness, it's not -- not at all. When we face a chronic serious illness, whether it's rheumatoid arthritis\nor lupus or cancer or diabetes, or cirrhosis, we lose control. And note what I said: \"when,\" not \"if.\" All of us at some point in our lives\nwill face a chronic serious illness that causes us to lose control. We'll see our function decline,\nsome of us will see our cognition decline, we'll be no longer able\nto care for ourselves, to do the things that we want to do. Our bodies will betray us, and in that process, we'll lose control. And that's scary. Not just scary -- that's frightening, it's terrifying. When I talk to my patients,\nmy palliative care patients, many of whom are facing illnesses\nthat will end their lives, they have a lot of be frightened of -- pain, nausea, vomiting,\nconstipation, fatigue, their impending mortality. But what scares them\nmore than anything else is this possibility that at some point, tomorrow or a month from now, they're going to lose\ncontrol of their health, of their lives, of their healthcare, and they're going to become\ndependent on others, and that's terrifying. So it's no wonder really\nthat patients like Robin, who I just told you about, who I met in that clinic, turn to medical marijuana to try to claw back\nsome semblance of control. How do they do it though? How do these medical\nmarijuana dispensaries -- like the one where I met Robin -- how do they give patients like Robin\nback the sort of control that they need? And how do they do it in a way that mainstream\nmedical hospitals and clinics, at least for Robin, weren't able to? What's their secret? So I decided to find out. I went to a seedy clinic\nin Venice Beach in California and got a recommendation that would allow me\nto be a medical marijuana patient. I got a letter of recommendation\nthat would let me buy medical marijuana. I got that recommendation illegally, because I'm not\na resident of California -- I should note that. I should also note, for the record, that I never used that letter\nof recommendation to make a purchase, and to all of you DEA agents out there -- (Laughter) love the work that you're doing, keep it up. (Laughter) Even though it didn't let me\nmake a purchase though, that letter was priceless\nbecause it let me be a patient. It let me experience\nwhat patients like Robin experience when they go to a medical\nmarijuana dispensary. And what I experienced -- what they experience every day, hundreds of thousands\nof people like Robin -- was really amazing. I walked into the clinic, and from the moment that I entered\nmany of these clinics and dispensaries, I felt like that dispensary, that clinic, was there for me. There were questions\nat the outset about who I am, what kind of work I do, what my goals are in looking\nfor a medical marijuana prescription, or product, what my goals are,\nwhat my preferences are, what my hopes are, how do I think, how do I hope\nthis might help me, what am I afraid of. These are the sorts of questions that patients like Robin\nget asked all the time. These are the sorts of questions\nthat make me confident that the person I'm talking with\nreally has my best interests at heart and wants to get to know me. The second thing I learned\nin those clinics is the availability of education. Education from the folks\nbehind the counter, but also education\nfrom folks in the waiting room. People I met were more than happy,\nas I was sitting next to them -- people like Robin -- to tell me about who they are,\nwhy they use medical marijuana, what helps them, how it helps them, and to give me advice and suggestions. Those waiting rooms really are\na hive of interaction, advice and support. And third, the folks behind the counter. I was amazed at how willing\nthose people were to spend sometimes an hour or more\ntalking me through the nuances of this strain versus that strain, smoking versus vaporizing, edibles versus tinctures -- all, remember, without me\nmaking any purchase whatsoever. Think about the last time\nyou went to any hospital or clinic and the last time anybody spent an hour\nexplaining those sorts of things to you. The fact that patients like Robin\nare going to these clinics, are going to these dispensaries and getting that sort\nof personalized attention and education and service, really should be a wake-up call\nto the healthcare system. People like Robin are turning away\nfrom mainstream medicine, turning to medical marijuana dispensaries because those dispensaries\nare giving them what they need. If that's a wake-up call\nto the medical establishment, it's a wake-up call that many\nof my colleagues are either not hearing or not wanting to hear. When I talk to my colleagues,\nphysicians in particular, about medical marijuana, they say, \"Oh, we need more evidence. We need more research into benefits,\nwe need more evidence about risks.\" And you know what? They're right. They're absolutely right. We do need much more evidence\nabout the benefits of medical marijuana. We also need to ask the federal government\nto reschedule marijuana to Schedule II, or to deschedule it entirely\nto make that research possible. We also need more research\ninto medical marijuana's risks. Medical marijuana's risks -- we know a lot about\nthe risks of recreational use, we know next to nothing\nabout the risks of medical marijuana. So we absolutely do need research, but to say that we need research and not that we need\nto make any changes now is to miss the point entirely. People like Robin\naren't seeking out medical marijuana because they think it's a wonder drug, or because they think\nit's entirely risk-free. They seek it out because the context\nin which it's delivered and administered and used, gives them the sort of control\nthey need over their lives. And that's a wake-up call\nwe really need to pay attention to. The good news though is that\nthere are lessons we can learn today from those medical marijuana dispensaries. And those are lessons\nwe really should learn. These are often small,\nmom-and-pop operations run by people with no medical training. And while it's embarrassing to think that many of these clinics\nand dispensaries are providing services and support and meeting patients' needs in ways that billion-dollar\nhealthcare systems aren't -- we should be embarrassed by that -- but we can also learn from that. And there are probably\nthree lessons at least that we can learn\nfrom those small dispensaries. One: we need to find ways\nto give patients more control in small but important ways. How to interact with healthcare providers, when to interact\nwith healthcare providers, how to use medications\nin ways that work for them. In my own practice, I've gotten much more\ncreative and flexible in supporting my patients\nin using drugs safely to manage their symptoms -- with the emphasis on safely. Many of the drugs I prescribe\nare drugs like opioids or benzodiazepines which can be dangerous if overused. But here's the point. They can be dangerous if they're overused, but they can also be ineffective\nif they're not used in a way that's consistent with\nwhat patients want and need. So that flexibility,\nif it's delivered safely, can be extraordinarily valuable\nfor patients and their families. That's number one. Number two: education. Huge opportunities to learn from some of the tricks\nof those medical marijuana dispensaries to provide more education that doesn't require\na lot of physician time necessarily, or any physician time, but opportunities to learn\nabout what medications we're using and why, prognoses, trajectories of illness, and most importantly, opportunities for patients\nto learn from each other. How can we replicate what goes on in those clinic and medical\ndispensary waiting rooms? How patients learn from each other,\nhow people share with each other. And last but not least, putting patients first the way\nthose medical marijuana dispensaries do, making patients feel\nlegitimately like what they want, what they need, is why, as healthcare providers, we're here. Asking patients about their hopes,\ntheir fears, their goals and preferences. As a palliative care provider, I ask all my patients what they're\nhoping for and what they're afraid of. But here's the thing. Patients shouldn't have to wait\nuntil they're chronically seriously ill, often near the end of life, they shouldn't have to wait\nuntil they're seeing a physician like me before somebody asks them, \"What are you hoping for?\" \"What are you afraid of?\" That should be baked into the way\nthat healthcare is delivered. We can do this -- we really can. Medical marijuana dispensaries\nand clinics all across the country are figuring this out. They're figuring this out in ways that larger, more mainstream\nhealth systems are years behind. But we can learn from them, and we have to learn from them. All we have to do is swallow our pride -- put aside the thought for a minute that because we have\nlots of letters after our name, because we're experts, because we're chief medical officers\nof a large healthcare system, we know all there is to know\nabout how to meet patients' needs. We need to swallow our pride. We need to go visit\na few medical marijuana dispensaries. We need to figure out what they're doing. We need to figure out\nwhy so many patients like Robin are leaving our mainstream medical clinics and going to these medical\nmarijuana dispensaries instead. We need to figure out\nwhat their tricks are, what their tools are, and we need to learn from them. If we do, and I think we can,\nand I absolutely think we have to, we can guarantee all of our patients\nwill have a much better experience. Thank you.

strains produce an oil that is a very good antidepressant and tends to energize a person but most of the hemp oil I produce comes from indica strains indica strains tend to relax the person and give them more sleep rest and sleep are part of the healing process place the starting material preferably good bud in a plastic container dampen the bud material in the container with the solvent you are using then crush the bud material after the bud has been crushed add more solvent until the material is completely covered I generally use pure naphtha but 99% isopropyl alcohol also works well as a solvent as do many other substances work and stir the contents to let the THC dissolve into the solvent this process takes two to three minutes drain the solvent from the starting material and put it through a coffee filter the solvent now resembles the color of gasoline due to the presence of the hemp oil in the solvent make sure the area where you are going to boil the solvent off is very well ventilated the idea is to carry the fumes away from the boiling solvent to reduce the danger of an explosion or fire special care must be taken to avoid red-hot elements or a spark of any kind that could ignite the fumes from the solvent I have found that an electric rice cooker boils the solvent off very effectively bring the solve an oil mix in the rice cooker to a boil use a fan to carry the fumes from the solvent away as the solvent boils off continue adding more solvent oil mix until it is gone as the level in the boiling pot comes down for the last time add 8 to 10 drops of water since the boiling point of water is much higher than the boiling point of the solvent used this water that was at it allows the solvent to be released as the oil thickens as the last of the solvent is being released it is a good idea to lift the rice cooker and keep the contents in the cooker moving this helps release any remaining solvent and also protects the oil from too much heat at no time should the temperature of the oil go over 290 degrees Fahrenheit gently pour the oil from the rice cooker into a small metal container put this container with the oil into a dehydrator or put the container on a gentle heating device such as a coffee warmer it may take a few hours to evaporate the water off the oil in the end there should be no bubbling or other tivity on the surface of the oil when the oil is hot it is quite runny but as it cools the oil takes on the consistency of a thick grease generally a pound of good hemp bud will produce about two ounces of high-grade oil ingesting this amount

bodega today I'm gonna be asking a very important question can you and should you Deb RS oh that's right folks today we're gonna be dabbing RS o which stands for Rick Simpson oil now you hear a lot about it being used in cooking or people sometimes use it to make bombs but you you're never really here to our sublingually you know like under the tongue but you never really hear too much about people dabbing it and you know depending on who you ask the the answer could vary like yeah yeah you don't but so in theory we should be able to dab it and it should work but the question is should we so you know what I went ahead I got myself some mag landrace that's from Murano now or brown anorexia gold leaf whoever whatever they're calling themselves this day is mag mile as you know mag landrace is one of my favorite strains and I can't wait to taste it I hope there's gonna be good so wish me luck [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right folks went ahead had my damp and a lot to break down here now as far as being effective you know working it is working very fast you know but that's mag Landry's guys I mean it's it's probably it is my favorite strain but a lot of people's as well because it works but the taste I got to tell you was awful I really kind of regret doing that not only did it taste bad it burned up so fast and it left a really Brown really nasty residue from where it was and you know I don't know if it's from you know that from the ethanol that you know whatever but yeah I got it all dirty and you know now I got to go either hit it with a torch or you got to start scrubbing it it can be a pain in the ass trying to clean that thing but oh god the taste at first it's like whoo and then it's like oh yeah this is this is I shouldn't be doing this so yeah guys if you were ever one if you're ever wondering if they if you could day of RSO is yes you can is it effective yes it is does it is that do you think it's worth it I do not I don't think it's worth it if you like to keep your stuff clean and if you enjoy the taste of your extract please go with something anything else to this and I guarantee it'll be just as good or better of an experience so if you like this video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't by now please subscribe I'd like to thank all my subscribers friends family everybody that's you know making this journey you know doable and last but not least thanks for the view", "pWQ5Fj_LHrg": "okay everyone wants to know how I make the cannabis suppositories so you need organic cocoa butter I get it off Amazon you need organic frankincense oil I add that in because it helps shrink tumors and it's calming and it makes it smell a little nicer your Rick Simpson oil suppository molds I get them off of Amazon as well I ended up buying a thousand of them for a hundred and seventy five dollars because it was way cheaper and more cost effective if you can find any other place to buy them any cheaper that's fabulous and a little syringe cocoa butter melting in my Pyrex on my little cast-iron skillet I like to just melt it this way because I also get to see you know I find that about 75 milliliters like 25 goes into about 10 suppositories because they're about 2 millilitres these might be a little less anyways so you get the point you melt the cocoa butter I'm probably gonna need a little more I'm making these for a dog that has a splenic tumor so bear with me for a second closing I didn't open this one and I only have two hands [Applause] okay so I'm gonna put in enough probably to go up to 125 okay so we just watch it melt I find suppositories are much easier especially for dogs because a the absorption is you know up to 80% rectally and then orally is only about 20% orally of course the dog gets crazy high rectally they just get calm they don't get the psychoactive Ness so they don't go into like their wobbly woozy stupor I'll turn it up a little bit all right so you get the idea I use just to stir it around hmm bear with me bear with me so I've been helping dogs and people for over three years now with a lot of success cannabis oil is absolutely amazing it does wonders arthritis clearly it kills cancer shrinks tumors all sorts of good things so let's wait for that to know I'm going to use five grams of oil and probably make about 40 suppositories you can't put a lot of oil in less because then it doesn't stay solid and you want them to stay solid you don't want it to be go be so while we're waiting for that Here I am hello I'm Christina today's our AFC playoff game Patriots go Patriots I know a lot of you guys hate the Patriots but I'm from Massachusetts we're spoiled alright get the idea and it's a really nice day today it's like a heatwave boil boil boil mmm yeah looks like 125 so the thing is this you can give one a day or two a day three a day you know depends upon the severity of the condition you're treating you can't overdose on this basically you know do the math 5 grams into however many suppositories and you'll figure out how many milligrams are each one I made the oil it's about 900 milligrams per gram of THC it's not a high CBD strain it's a very minimal but it's hard to get not to kill off a CBD when you heat so I recommend getting a CBD oil if you wanted to add on ok it's almost melted right almost almost I'm sure you could probably put it in the microwave but I'm not a fan of microwaves I use it minimally all right so looks like we're all done good thing about Pyrex is it doesn't get hot so I'm gonna do this with one hand now so we're at about seven all right so we'll just squish this all in just like that oops sorry step it down - there we go see how simple face my mom now I just kind of put I don't really count just a little bit like that not too much I can't find any dosing suggestions for frankincense I just you know through my research and looking up for things I found that frankincense was amazing a calming anxiety just the whole calming effect and also it shrinks tumors so who knew all right so that down I use another syringe all right sorry gonna try to do this with one hand no it's not gonna work all right so let's see if I can set this up over here so you can see what I'm doing all right let's see that should work you guys do this there this is my first video all right good all right so stir it up nice and then just suck it up in the syringe and there you go fill the molds sometimes they stick so just get it so it's nice and smooth you don't want it to just like all of a sudden just squirt it out and make a mess I try not to make a mess I like it nice and lubed up good sorry about that all right so they'll not boo see look at that I'm making a mess already right why is this one not doing good you get the idea all right so it's giving me a hard time today it's sticking mmm if you overfill it you can just kind of suck it up a little bit definitely couldn't do this with one hand so you fill them all up and then you can either let them to sit my room temperature to solidify or I stick them in the freezer for a minute they sulfate they get solid pretty quickly and you can store them at room temperature it's cocoa butter so obviously it stays solid and what I do is once I'm ready to feel them open I let them sit in my hand for a minute to kind of just get a little warm because sometimes they break in half I don't know why why I'm making a mess today figures the first time I try to make a video I make a mess normally it's a lot easier the syringes just giving me a hard time but you get the idea right but as you can see it's really easy and simple I make the Rick Simpson oil myself I grow everything everything is organic I grow as medically clean you know all set medically I don't use pesticides anything everything's organic and natural and made lots of love Massachusetts is a medically legal state and also recreationally legal now which is fabulous and I can't wait for the whole country to experience this it's so awful that this is not allowed to treat everybody you might need more see why I am super messy today maybe because I'm just excited to go watch the game all right well as you can see my hands are all sticky now and yucky I'm actually not that bad alright so there you have it I made 40 I'm gonna have to go get a couple more but other than that like I said you just stick them in the freezer for a minute and you're good to go I wouldn't store them in the freezer you can maybe store them in the fridge but like I said what you want to do is hold a hole you know you know rip one off individually just to hold it in your hand to let it let it get a little warm and then open it and then you are ready to give it to your pooch or yourself but I mean I'm making this for a dog anyways that's it you have a fabulous day I hope this was very helpful and let me know if you need any advice thank you much love bye", "qr3zpQxrPD0": "hey good morning everybody its Matt hopefully you all can see me pretty well I wanted to introduce this to you basically what we've done a lot of people have been opening the capsules so we actually are working with a company out of Colorado as well so it is domestically grown hemp I have all the COAS which I'll post shortly this stuff is unreal honestly what I have here my hand is a hundred milligram syringe and we wanted to always you know as we started our mission has been to get the best product for the best price for everybody it's only $19.99 for a hundred milligrams so you can look at the amount that you're getting and the price you're paying you can see that this kind of blows almost everything else away and it's domestically grown hemp just like the flowers I've been posting on there so I want to let you guys know I'm really excited about this I took my first dose a little while ago and it's hard to explain but I kind of had like this overwhelming feeling of calmness it's hard for me to describe but you can definitely tell that it's it's doing something so I just wanted to show everybody how to administer it it comes in a little syringe it is hemp paste it's it's more of an oil but it is a little bit thicker because of the high concentration that it does have when you get it you're gonna have this blacktop all you have to do is turn it it'll come right off now because this is 100 milligrams I do not recommend putting it in your mouth and squirting it all in there that's a lot to take at one time especially if something highly concentrated like this the best thing to do is just squirt a little bit of it out like I did here on my finger you can see it's kind of like a pace so it's not falling off and then rub it in your gum lines just like that all I taste is cannabis right now a hemp that's all I taste in there it's a really really good taste it's not anything like that grassy or dirty taste that people have said sometimes about our old you know the Bluebird oils which we still do carry but this is kind of the future this is what we're going towards and you can see the major differences a lot of the retailers online some of them don't even have what they claim they say they have but there are a couple hundred dollars I mean depending on who you go with we're talking about $19.99 for something that is gonna affect many of you in a positive way so you guys are always asking this family is always asking for new products and you know Kip and I we work as hard as we can to try and get these delivered to you I hope you guys enjoy this and on a final note all of the oils are in and they will be shipping today both the cherry and the orange so I want to let everybody that has existing order that's waiting for them they're going out so you can find this at Anna mother nature calm feel free to PM me or tag me if you have any questions thanks everyone", "keU69cRljt4": "hey yo welcome back it's 4/20 shorty I'd like to do a comparison video this week y'all know that I make the RSO and I usually make it with my white widow and I also make a version with CBD but recently I just tried to make it with isopropyl alcohol instead of Everclear now I'd like to show you the difference the ever clearer that I had been using you can see right here you can see without me even moving it you can see all the gritty stuff right there you can see how it's reddish in color and you can see it doesn't look very few at all it looks kind of dirty but you look over here you look over here at this one and you can see how nice and pure and smooth it looks and look at the bottom it's smooth it's translucent you can see through it it's amber it's beautiful it's just pure and beautiful the one with the other clear you can see that it's got a bunch of gritty stuff in it you definitely can't see through it and it's not thick in the bottom you can see it's not like a bunch of thick stuff in the bottom but it's not it's like a hard rock of gritty lump and it's kind of a true egg I was cooking it and it always seemed like I had this weird he won't be gritty stuff in it and I thought well maybe I'm overcooking it and I don't think so I was doing it the same way I've always done it and it was always tasting that way and I never realized just how much it did until I went you know what I'm gonna try it with the ice bubble I ran out of Everclear and I thought you know what I'm just gonna try it Rick Simpson says it's the way to go and I'll tell you what it broke up the meds better it got out more of the impurities because the coffee filters themselves were just lined with like a mud I mean like really thick like this much in the bottom as opposed to like a thin layer when you did the Everclear it was like a thin layer of contaminants take it out we're with the isopropyl it takes out so much more I mean there was like a big layer of mud like I said it's like it's crazy and you could just you can see the difference you really can and I mean it just tastes different it looks different it's more pure and I think all in all it's in much better product and I make it exactly the same way and I will do another video on that too and you can just see it's just like a weird red you can't see through it it's all dark and gritty it's just you can tell you can just see it it doesn't look as good you can just look at it and go oh I don't think I'd want that I think I'd want that okay so I really I can't say enough about how the isopropyl did a much better job it really did it broke up the read much better it got out all the contaminants and it just really it just really did a great job and when I cook it it's not a bright green it's a darker brown amber color it's almost the same color as here it doesn't even change that much I mean there's a little bit of bright green at the end when I do the last wash but I do two washes on mine which they say that that's really all you need the last one would just take off you know it'd be like something that you would use for saps or something which I actually don't use for salves I use really good stuff ourselves so yeah this is this is amazing you can just see the difference despite letting it sit there you can just see the difference the Everclear is gritty and and not as good and the isopropyl is nice and clear and really just looks smooth so I really would like to I'm glad I got to share this with you and I'd like to show you another video soon of how I make it and show you I make it the same exact way and y'all will get to see there's a big difference I wish al I could share it and y'all could see the big difference then it's just much more pure it seems like it acts faster to cure pain and it really does I mean in its like in ten minutes or so I'm feeling no pain rather than a half hour compared to the effort there so I'm really happy with the results and I hope you all keep tuning and you can keep watching all the comparison videos and all the fun other new videos I'm going to get to do this year so thanks for tuning in and I help you", "weJ37QM2XUc": "yo yo yo what's good everybody bass drop keys your frilly neighborhood negro and in today's video guys we're going to give you an update on the nerd rope video that we did yesterday let's go ahead and get into it let's do it all right guys let's go ahead and get straight into this in my quest to be a better content creator i'm trying to give you all the information i can about a certain topic so what i'm going to do today is we're actually going to do an update video on the nerd rope video that we did yesterday i had some other thoughts and i thought about some different techniques and some things that would make sense for us so what we're going to do in today's video is i'm going to update you guys on a couple things we're going to try a couple different techniques as far as nerve ropes and nerd bites but also what we're doing is i want to show you guys exactly what you're going to do if you're doing it in batches like i'm doing say you did some batches the first day then you're going to come back the next day to do some more batches i want to show you guys exactly what you can expect whenever you're doing that i'm going to start doing this on a lot of the videos there's a lot of videos that i feel that i should have did an update video for so i'm gonna start doing that on the videos going forward because of some of these videos you really need to know what's gonna happen a day after or two days after the effect so what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and get into this video this is going to be an update nerve root video from yesterday here we go all right guys so it's the day after and you can see that our gummy and our coconut oil mixture here has um you know hardened up here inside the squeeze bottle as you can see here the aluminum foil mold that we did is still right here and so this is what i propose that we do because we have so much control with this the squeeze bottle whenever we were doing it we had like amazing control over what we were doing i'm thinking what if we put some nerds in the tray right here and you know do some lines with our bottle here on the nerves there and cover them up and do them that way without the mole so that's what i'm proposing that we do then most people have you know ice cube trays at their house and i was thinking what if we did some nerd bites so that's what we're going to do that's what we're going to do updated version of the nerd ropes i showed you how to do it with the mold thank you to everybody for watching that video that video is doing great already and we're gonna actually see we can do this a different way so let's go ahead and try to do this i'm gonna get the aluminum foil out of here and prepare this let's do it [Music] some more nerds all right guys so you can see what i'm doing i have a bed of nerds right here that's pretty even and so we're going to try out my concept here so the coconut oil and the gummies is really infused here uh well if you're asking me why do i know that a lot of times when it's not infused well all the oil will be sitting on top all of the oil that we will be sitting on top and if you remember we put three tablespoons in here and so the fact that you only see just a little bit sitting right here and the rest of it is a fuse well and that means that we did a great job infusing this but you can see that it's not sticking to the bottle some people were was asking me about that in the comment section it's not sticking to the bottle at all the oil with the gummies really allows it to be malleable so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and put this in the microwave for like 30 seconds and then i'm going to see if i don't know how long it's going to be i'll let you know guys know exactly how long it took me to get it to the right consistency here but the the premise of the bit is put this in the microwave get this to soften up a little bit here and then because we had so much control over when we're doing it do some lines on on the top of this nerd bed if you will and then cover that with gummies to see if we can do some nerve ropes that way not sure exactly how it's going to work but we're going to find out here all right here we go in the microwave all right guys so it was in the microwave for 35 40 seconds and as you can see now we're able to move it a little around so now we have it you know where we needed to be and just like i said as you can see it's not sticking to the bottle you don't worry about anything like that and now we can go ahead and do what we did whenever we made our nerve ropes the first time so let's go ahead and do it i got my glove right here um this right here is actually it's actually not that bad as far as the temperature but just to be safe it's better to be safe than sorry you know what i mean i'm putting the jar here so that way i can you know uh actually squeeze out some of the oil and actually get to the gummy part of it i'll show you what i mean right now here we go let's try to make some ropes right here let's do a little thicker this time there we go do it three times and do it again very nice look at that all right do it three times right there and do it again [Music] go two times three times make a nice rope because remember this is the medicated part right here all right do it again with this squeeze bottle you have a lot of control over this gummy mixture that's what i was really had the impression on when i did this the the first time with the nerve ropes and so now we're making thicker nerve ropes there we go bam stop it right there very nice put some more right here make this one thicker look how much control we got over like i said this was right here was only 40 seconds in the microwave look at that bam okay a little thicker too bam all right so that's good all right so just like before let's go ahead and take some nerds so let's go ahead and cover this up [Music] get another box [Applause] all right so now i believe i got everything covered now so what we're going to do right now is we're going to actually just put this in the refrigerator set it to the side while we do these nerd bites and we'll check them out in just a second here and see if it worked out all right so let me put this in the in the fridge and then what i'll do is we'll go ahead and get the ice tray and we'll go ahead and try to do these nerve bites here we go all right guys so we're going to go ahead and try to do some nerve bites as you can see i have this normal regular household ice tray what we're going to do is we're going to take some oil to make sure that we can get these out of here is i'm going to take some of that uh non-stick coconut oil spray but you can use you know whatever spray you have non-stick spray and we're going to spray these and because i have a couple bucks of these nerds left let's go ahead and spray these put some nerves down in the bottom of a couple of these put some more of our mixture with our coconut oil and our gummy mix put some more of that in there and put some nerds on the top there and then let that sit and see how that works out for us let's try [Music] all right so now that we got it in there let's go ahead and put some nerds in a couple of these all right so we have some nerds in the bottom of this now we're going to put some of our gummy mixture in here let's do it there we go i did another 10 seconds in the microwave and that just made it the right consistency so we just go ahead and do this there it is we still got some more of this gummy mixture left so let's do it some of these all right guys so we got that finished right there what i'm gonna do now is i'm gonna go ahead and take the the ropes that we did on the tray i'm gonna take those out i'm gonna put these in let's go ahead and see how those ropes did and then we'll come back to these as soon as those are finished here we go all right guys so we have our pan now out of the refrigerator it is only in there about 10 minutes or so let's go ahead and do this first one and see how it's going to work i don't know exactly about the time see if all the nerds had a chance to actually collect on our gummy strip or if we need to put it back in there or what have you let's just find out here we go look at that look at that nerd rope i didn't get another piece of parchment so i could put it on there hold on all right so we got a better setup now so this first no rope and as you can see we did them thicker than we did before look at that how easy that was and so if you do them this way you don't even need a mold just put your nerds inside the tray you got complete control over how thick or how wide that you want your nerve ropes with the with the squeeze bottle with the squeeze bottle you have complete control over how wide or how not wide you want your nerve ropes so this right here is a great fast method look at this nerve rope and so look so now we have a bed of nerds ready to go all you have to do is you see we have some more gummies right here remember in that in the first video that we did we only use a cup so this is another cup right here i can go ahead and put those in the measuring cup melt those down take some more oil and make some more nerd ropes so there it is guys that's our proof of concept that if you just lay the nerves in the tray with the squeeze bottle because of all the control that you have with it just make your lines in it cover it up and you're ready to go so now that we know that that works let's go ahead and go to our nerd bites and let's see how they turned out here we go all right guys so i just took the ice tray out of the freezer what i've done is i've taken the knife and i sprayed it with that spray so that it won't stick i want to go ahead and start getting these bites out of here let's see how they look if it worked out here we go [Music] do all right guys so there you have it that is a different way for you to do the nerve ropes as you can see doing it this way you have full control over how big or small you want it how wide or not wide that you want it this is a great way to do it so for everybody that's thinking about you i don't feel like making that mold every time you really can do it just by putting the nerds in the tray putting the gummy mix on top of that put some nerds on the top of that bingo bango is super easy if you want to see the full blog of today's video click the link in the description it's going to take you over to goodies420.com and before we get up out of here guys i do want to do today's subscriber spotlight today's subscriber spotlight goes out to my homie rc420

Tarr here and I'm just doing a quick check-in about how I'm doing with the RSO oil and I hope you can hear me okay it's I live in a yurt and it's raining really hard it's windy so yeah lots of background noise so I just wanted to check in because a couple exciting things one is that I got three plants indica dominant plants from the medical marijuana dispensary that I go to here in Vermont and so they're all indica strains I got a I got like a little flyer on how to grow your own plant so it's really exciting it's something I've been wanting to do for a while I didn't think I would grow it necessarily but I've been wanting for a few months to look for indica dominant strains and so finding their clones so finding them to be able to plant outside is is great it's definitely kicks up the the need to learn more because there's quite a bit to go into growing it so but I picked up three clones and they're all indicas I got a bubba kush I got a Las Vegas triangle Kush and I got nine pound hammer so I they're upstairs right now under the growing lamps so I'm not going to do a video right now on those but I will soon later today I'm gonna put them into new pots so maybe I'll do another video while I'm doing that just so you guys can see and you know I'm learning this is like completely new to me so I'm learning and the other exciting thing that I wanted to share is that I need a new RSO oil yesterday so I have my RSO that I've been doing I just stuck different consumer and again this is not like this it's like a putty because I didn't strain it I didn't strain off the resin as well as I could have I didn't have the coffee filters it was like when I first made it after all of that time and research I didn't have a freaking disposable coffee filters so I made it again yesterday and I had coffee filters so I wanted to show you but this is the old one that I made three weeks ago my very first batch this is made with all indica strains it's um and it's been great but like it's starting to go away it's more than half the size it was and so I'm starting to feel this panic because it's been working so good for me especially at night when I'm sleeping it's like just really really acid ativ really calming and I like it but it's really expensive to make this this one I made this with Shiva skunk and OG Kush 14 grams so I did this is a half ounce of weed with a cup of 99.5 percent isopropyl alcohol that was a hundred and sixty six dollars just for the weed not the rice cooker and alcohol which is you know use that again and again but the weed from my medical marijuana dispensary was a hundred and sixty six dollars to make this this was a half of it Out's I mean Rick Simpson says to to do it for with a pound which is thou like what at least over a thousand so I and that's why I've been struggling because I don't really know how to make it with a small batch because I made this half of an ounce one cup of alcohol and it took like 10 15 minutes to burn off the alcohol in my rice cooker because the rice cookers kind of big not a huge one but it's you know decent size I'd say it's more in the small medium size and so I would love to hear from others who are doing this with us making small batches how do you do it because I don't I can't I'm not gonna spend so much money on the marijuana right now to make this I mean I will but I'd rather grow it which I'm going to so in September when I harvest or whenever it is August September I'll have hopefully these plants will thrive and be great and I you know they were $25 a pop for the clones so I'm imagining I'll get I don't know how much a pound of marijuana is on a bush like I don't know what I'll get from per bush but I know they grow pretty big and you can harvest quite a bit so I'm my aim is to get six plants total I'm going to I have three and I'm going to learn how to clone them like graph them or whatever I don't know even sure what it's called but I'm gonna learn how to cut them and make three more new plants so I have a friend who knows how to do that and she's gonna show me so hopefully they'll do well and I'll have six plants and then I won't have to spend so much money per ounce or per gram because it's so expensive so in my second batch that I made yesterday was with Fatima I used a ton of different kinds of sativa I had Sour Diesel I had dancehall and pineapple Express so I had different like over the years I've just known even over the year over the last two or three years I just especially when I had my medical marijuana card two years ago so I took a little break I got a ton of different like little packets of different sativa strains cuz I didn't understand the whole indica and sativa and I got a bunch of sativas and they didn't work for me so I just have them they were kind of they're dry and didn't look very good but like they're dry you know then I also had some more fresher stuff uh that I got from the dispensary and I added that in so this I used an ounce 28 grams of weed which so that was over $300 to make this definitely using more was better with my rice cooker like it took longer to go down so I felt better about that it got Dee carved properly I'm hoping it got Dee car properly because my last one didn't like I feel like it was in there for like 15 minutes so how does it get Dee carbs properly I didn't do carved it in the oven either time so and so again it's not it's more of an oil than my my first batch which was like more of a putty so it's definitely like I'm in the right direction that this I can't even maybe I could yeah I can't even like put it into a ball like that this is just and I couldn't even I couldn't put it into a syringe had I stopped the boiling process of the bubbling process I could have sucked it into syringes that I have but I didn't by the time I stopped the heater like as it was bubbling just teeny little bubbles and I know you're meant to wait for the bubbles to go away but I know that I also is using some strains that they said the more terpenes Tour Pines and the short a how you call it the more bubbles you get so to that you can't really depend on that all the way but I got these like really tons of teeny little foaming bubbles I think I even took a video and then I put a safety pin into the oil this is how you test if it's done I've heard you put it I put a safety pin in there and then dip some of the oil onto my safety pin and then I lit it with a match and it's meant to if it sparks then it has still has some of the alcohol left in it so you want to keep bubbling it I but I did it I didn't get any spark so I probably could have pulled it sooner and I would have gotten the right consistency so maybe this is more concentrated I don't know I also don't know if it works because I can see it's in the bottom I had no idea what to do I just put it into this glass jar $300 it's like over $300 worth of Medicine right there so I wish I had a better way like I wish I had pulled it sooner so I could have put it into syringes so I could dose properly but he says to do the size of a piece of grain of rice so it's hard to do that because it's super like it's so sticky so anyway I took a dose two and a half hours ago my first dose of the day so this is a sativa so I'm sorry if I'm a little bit all over the place because this is really new to me this is a sativa strain so I'm only going to take this so because my indica strain was almost running low or it's running low I'm wanting to have something that I can take during the day that I don't mind makes me more like awake and active and so I'm gonna I'm just gonna start taking this blend hopefully it will work I'm gonna start taking this blend in the daytime and then switch over to my indica RSO towards the afternoon I mean I'm sure it's better to do it all day the indica for the healing purposes and calming and sleeping but because I had all this sativa strains I just wanted to use them up and I'm sure I did that so I'm gonna go ahead and take that much that looks a lot that I mean I doesn't look like a lot to some of you but if you've taken our so you know that's a lot that's probably about a grain and a half which is around the dosage I'm able to do now a grain and a half so I've only taken this one this is my third time it tastes really gross and the other one doesn't taste gross but I don't taste it like is it I just more swallow it down this one lingers in my mouth longer it's like like resin like plant resin it's really strong so then I was worried wolves out the alcohol but it seems like I burned off all the alcohol so I guess it's just the flavor that it is for real I didn't know cuz the other one didn't it's like it's kind of hard and it just I could swallow it down really quickly this one like sticks to my teeth and the top of my mouth like I I think it's better if I take it with like yesterday I took it with a carrot like I stuck it on the end of the carrot I just ate it the carrot didn't do very good to mask the flavor though I would do something different next thing mr. Lee just like if I were a kid taking this I wouldn't take it so we'll see I took this right so okay so yesterday I made it I got done around 5 p.m. and kind of with my first batch like I was looking my fingers and sticks to my thumb and like it's kind of crapped on my finger so I was eating it that way and I felt like I felt like a um I felt something but I was I don't know I I don't know I hadn't taken any of the other RS so the indica strain I was just making this one so I wanted to be mindful because I knew I would be licking my fingers and the utensils and stuff because you don't want to waste anything right so I was like licking the rubber spatula and I did get a little something definitely I got like a heaviness and it was more in my head it was more behind my eyes than the whole body and but I don't know then I just took my regular RS o indica strain for my for my for the night time to makes me sleep so good and I didn't think that that I didn't want to try this sativa blend at night night even though I took take it at five which is kind of late but alright still slept well not as good as I normally do so definitely I think affected me a little bit I was more like my mind was more like you know whereas with the indica blend I'm just like I'm knocked out and if I wake up to pee I'm like I can't wait to find my bed again so we'll see I took a class I forget yesterday I took it again today about two and a half hours ago I don't feel anything so I'm really hoping it works cuz that was a lot of marijuana I used and it's a lot of work I mean it doesn't take that long but you know I set it up outside and it's just kind of a you don't want to make it so much so I guess that's all I wanted to talk about I would like just to say really quick so I did the coffee filter method for this one instead of just straining it through okay so I I started to do that I started to use the paper coffee filter I got an organic unbleached coffee filter from a neighbor and I also got a bleached one but then I realized as I was using the bleached one that's not really good because it's you know putting chemicals into the oil because the alcohol just strips everything right either option it took forever I mean I was sitting there for like a half hour dripping a quarter cup of the alcohol with the resin through the filter and it was like one teeny drop at a time so I would like to know how to make that process go faster or is it not meant to go faster like if anybody can just tell me that like am I just meant to like I was thinking next time I could prop up the coffee filter and just let it drip in like somehow put it between something so it holds it over a bowl or a pot or a cup and then this let it drip at its own pace and it will probably take a couple days I don't know I don't know it seems like it would evaporate in the air so it doesn't talk about that especially if you're doing a pound of weed with was it two gallons of isopropyl how do you how do you do that through a coffee filter that strains drop by drop so that's my main question if anybody can help me with that great so as I am going to make this again I'll do another indica probably in the next two weeks or so and I'm when I'm really low with that I'll go get some more and just pay for it and then hopefully oh that will apply to do that a couple more times before my bushes my plants are ready and grown so the next video hopefully I'll get my show you guys make plants okay see you later see you next time", "Zesv40R2Q5I": "[Music] whenever you're ready yeah listen look at

a weird day for us it's 90 degrees out there one would think at the end of October but then I have to remember oh no this is Northern California the bad thing though that there is a fire going down around the Sonoma area and PG&E has turned off the electricity because they think that the winds are going to get up to about 30 miles an hour so they've been doing that lately this is the new norm around here as soon as the wind starts blowing PG&E goes oh and off goes the power we have power out here today they have power and I own but right up the road in Jackson no power so the kids are without power the boys without power my granddaughter though they got a generator and so they they've got three generator and so they do have power today but you can't go shopping none of the stores are open I can't even believe how much money this has got to be costing just everybody in general so anyway that's what's going on in Ione today I thought today it would be I would talk a little bit about my routine my routine is that pretty much set in stone I guess if you do something for what a week or so if it starts to become a habit and so this is my routine is becoming a habit I used to start off my morning with a glass of water and lemon juice let's cut a little bit hard on my system I decided not to do that anymore so I've substituted that for aloe vera juice and then so I do the aloe vera juice in the morning and I make a smoothie and the smoothie can feature just about anything as long as there's a banana in there hemp seed chia seed and I love they they just came out it's called oat milk and now try this told me I can make oat milk it's very easy to make all kinds of milks you can make oat milk you can make almond milk but anyway I'm choosing to buy it anyway it's really good so I've been using oat milk and the smoothies then I do my austin GAO morning wake up your energy video routine whatever and that takes about ten minutes and then I do the scoliosis video and the exercises for scoliosis straightening your spine or the muscles strengthening the muscles that are holding your spine up and then I do the walk they've talked about the walk up the hill behind the lomotil home and up around the edge of the park and then back down here and that is a half a month I take my phone with me and it counts your steps and also in in case something would happen and I needed to call it oh God anyway so I do the morning walk and then come back here and I've been you know tics shower but what I've been doing also is the skin brushing that was another little tip I picked up from lilikoi I had read about the skin brushing before and I had done it before but then you know I kind of got out of the habit well she was talking about skin brushing again and I realized well that's right it it drains your lymphatic system it gets your lymphatic system going and so I started doing that now she does the dry brush and she does a circular she does all the circular in the surgery well I had read that you do it in the direction of your heart so I do the circular and then I come up this way in this way and didn't do the bottoms of your feet and up your legs and is your back as far as you can reach so I get the skin brushing done and then shower and dressed and then I'm ready to go run errands I do that if the stores are open if the electricity is on the power is on how to do the stores and then after noon it's you know hang out and then eat and I always make time though always make time and and look forward to doing the meditations the guided meditations now I started doing meditations I can't even count the years how many years ago a long long time ago and then I found lily and Aden and started doing the guided meditations with her which were just really really now she's got the most soothing voice and just very very lovely lady and I enjoyed her guided meditations the reach approach release your wings then I ran into a Ralph smart and he's got the little uplifting videos and that sweet girl from England she's got the uplifting videos and then of course there's Erin dowdy with the racial consciousness videos which are just awesome absolutely awesome and then Steve Murray and Steve Noble is the one that's I look forward to his transmissions and he comes out with a couple of week and I do his I do at least one of his a day she has a nice beautiful transmissions and clearing up so many things I just you have to you have to do them you just have to do them to even appreciate the depth of those meditations and the breadth and the depth and she is just the most humble person and all this is given for free there's no chart she doesn't even have advertisements on his video that's how what a generous soul he is he just gives them out he does do workshops and he sells he has written books but I would say most of his transmissions are just given to you and that to me somebody who's not trying to make any money off of this because believe me ladies and gentlemen and the past how many years have I been on this trail since my early 20s and I've run into a lot of so-called spiritual leaders who are just nothing but about the money and you know you can say that I've helped so many of these religious leaders you know when they start asking you for money and it's not even almost to the point where they're almost demanding it from you then you kind of know that they've gotten away from the spiritual and more to the material and when that happens it's just it's not any good anymore it's not for me I don't I don't like it I don't like it when they're always with the handout and demanding that you pay for the services because sometimes they're not worth it right anyway so I've been doing that this has been this has been quite an interesting year my goodness when I started this when I started this Wow it seems like a million years ago and yet and the other hand it just seems like only yesterday but I have to say - Lee I really do I miss him you know he wanted to move back to Los Angeles to be with his grandkids and I didn't wanna go to do that I don't regret that decision but he was the one that carried me through the first part of this she he went he helped me find the RSO help me track it down help she started buying it for me he would go down to H Street and buy it when I wasn't feeling up to going down there you know I just didn't felt like getting up and getting dressed and going anywhere and he was very very very good about that it's kind of funny I I had said about the quilts I was working on that quilt and I finished I finished that quilt the day before little Evelyn was born and yes that is her name she retained the name of Evelyn and so we I finished at the quilt the day before she was like 2 then she's a healthy bouncing beautiful baby girl and just like that and then remember I was talking about that really nice lady I met at the antique shop when I went back to the antique shop what I didn't say was that the first lady dawn we were talking and I told her that I was a palm reader and so of course the hands came out right and then when I went back in to the shop the other day did say hi to her I met the other lady that I think she owns it and for the life of me I can't do a name anyway she said oh you're the palm reading lady and I go yeah I'm the palm reading lady so I had to read her point too well it turned out that they're having some kind of a Halloween days in Ione tomorrow and Saturday and so guess who's fighting to be palmering from 11:30 to 2:30 at their shop and it's really nice because they've got a little area in the back you can see there's there's the shot and then they've got like windows and a little seating area with a couch and I think there's a table there and so I'll bring a candle and I might bring my notepad they've got Wi-Fi in there so I don't know what kind of music but I don't know if I need all that anyway I don't really need to dress just I don't need all the props I just do it and so I got that going on tomorrow and that should be fun Susanna and Bob came up a couple of weeks ago and had lunch with me Sharon came up and had lunch with me about a week ago and got it was nice seeing Sharon and I'm gonna be going to Lou and I still have a couple things left it need his house that she stored in the garage and so we're gonna go down there and next Tuesday I think we're going down and we're gonna see me this who else I might I might even make it a trip over to Trader Joe's and sprouts who know whose food it just might I kind of miss Trader Joe's and I kind of miss sprouts there's a couple things that are going to get there so let's see that's my routine that's that's the story of my life that's what's going on up here but you know Lou had taken me first through the first part of my healing this year and then coming up here I realized that I had that cognition the other day that this has been kind of like going to remember back in the olden days they had the convalescent homes well this is kind of a what like a convalescent home would be for you just kind of get the fresh air and the good food and the rest and the relaxation and you don't have to do housework or yard work or doing much of anything that you don't really want to do and and so that's what this is it's kind of like my convalescing period I don't think I would have been ready to go into an apartment right away for some reason I think that going from the house to then by myself in an apartment and then you know because it's physically it's taxing putting things away unpacking boxes and doing all about that but that would have been I think a little bit too much so this way this is I get this nice little period in between and I can rest up and get my strength back this is ten months now and I kind of thought about calling UC Davis and dr. Abel Wits or whatever her name was or maybe dr. bold and saying hi guys I'm still around and but then I thought yeah why bother why bother they don't really care they had washed their hands and as soon as they heard that I was going to be doing the THC treatment they washed their hands of Linda remember they sent me back to Native America now and that was another thing I thought there was a Native American mouth up here well that's not the same there's a clinic up here but it's not the same folks and so I'm not changing I will be going down there whenever I need to go down there so I suppose I should I should get an MRI but I'm not in any particular hurry to do that I feel I feel like as long as I feel decent and I'm not like sliding backwards I don't know what do I need to go for isn't that why I went in the first place it's because of the way I was feeling I felt bad so I went to emerge and say well I don't feel like that anymore so I guess I'll get around to it there's no no pressing hurry there's no hurry on anything anymore it just seems like I've got all the time take my time and enjoy life so that's what I'm doing I'm just taking my time enjoying my family and enjoying my friends and a lot of Facebook and Scrabble stall points go play Scrabble my god yes did I say it's been 15 years to say that Scrabble yeah I think it's been like 50 years close to 50 years yeah that Margaret and I have been playing Scrabble and we started off of course back in the olden days when you had to be in the same room to play Scrabble you know the board game on the kitchen table and Peggy says she remembers those days and she remembers thinking that she'd really like to be able to play Scrabble with us too well guess what yes now she plays Scrabble - and you don't even have to be in the same state anymore yeah and good old notepads and Scrabble online Thank You Scrabble online so play Scrabble we have a list we have a good time we just have a good time and so I think that's going to be where I'm going to say goodbye and thank you for watching and I hope that everybody is having a wonderful wonderful day so goodbye", "huQ01vE5VTE": "hello our a so SOS here

that [ __ ] him oh thanks mate stinky stinky on the pinky day you are right", "CO0d6QLyiBQ": "hi my name's amanda mccordick and today i'm going to show you how to make rick simpson oil suppositories i'm going to start with showing you what you kind of need just to collect uh to make them so first you're going to start with like a mid-size to large pyrex dish something that can take the heat well and then you're going to have a smaller glass pyrex dish that you're actually going to use to mix mix a concoction in i also like to have a spatula in a chopstick a teaspoon and a half a teaspoon and a knife so there's lots of different options as far as what you can use for a mold ideally if you can get your hands on them something like this is perfect these are empty plastic one one-time use molds i get them online and they come in two different size 2.3 milliliters and then 1.3 milliliters when i was kind of initially really involved with with pushing back the cancer last april i was doing probably four or five of the smaller ones a day just more concentrated um but now i'm back to work um and i'm doing i'm still doing a full uh course of rick simpson treatment i'm still maintaining that but i'm doing three suppositories a day one in the morning one after work and one in the evening and i'm using the larger one of those just just again because i'm only doing three a day so these are ideal if you can get them um but sometimes you can't they're frequently sold out and i haven't been able to find them anywhere kind of in person or really on any other sites um so we do have backup options um the first and best i think is just empty pill poppers and if you've got cancer or terminal cancer like i was diagnosed with you got lots of pills around and these really worked really quite well and so what i like to do is um first of all i save all them drives my husband crazy um do i always think like i don't know you never know you don't know when you're not gonna be able to get the suppository molds and i just never want to be without them so i saved them all um this is from claston it's a calcium drug that i take in the morning and so i take four of those a day so i always get lots of poppers around so i just clean all of the tin foil off just to make it easier to work with i gotta flick it sometimes a little bit flicking and i just don't want anybody holding off making their rick simpson because i can't find uh supposed stories because they can't find the mold so they're just there really is options back when i first my first round i was so desperate to get it into me that um and there was just no good options for molds um and i hadn't thought of this or this hadn't been recommended to me yet um i used the fingers of latex gloves and it was messy it was hard to use but i was just so desperate to get them into me that that was the only thing i could think of and that's what i used for the first couple of weeks until um stumbled on other options so i like to get it all clean like that and then i take the bigger end of the of the chopstick and just push it in all just so it makes like a nice so that it's got the nice round pill shape again if you're doing if you're using these um you probably don't want to make them as constant or sorry as diluted as what um in the bigger ones because obviously these are quite small um but you can also do two at a time because they're not very big so that's one option the other option that um i tried for a bit and it works it just i comfort wise it wasn't my favorite um these are just empty gelatin capsules you can get them at you know health food stores or most pharmacies and so basically you just use those and you'll scoop it in put the cover on put it in the freezer and freeze it and then when it's time to insert you just put a little bit of vaseline on it or rick simpson oil cream and and then slide it in so those are kind of the options if you can't if you can't find these this is my my favorite but these work too and and who knows what else is out there i guess i should say too um i am an amateur at all of this this is not my regular skill set i'm not a cook i'm i had no understanding how any of this works um and i really there's not there wasn't a lot of information there when i was looking on the line and so i really stumbled through a trial and error um and so this is what works for me i'm not saying it's the only way to do it i'm not even saying it's the best way to do it i just know that for me this worked and i think if i can make it easier for others trying to figure this out i'm happy to do that okay so what i use for so that's what we put in but as far as what goes in the actual suppositories i use organic virgin coconut oil i get it from costco you can get it at walmart and other places like that but as far as the big jars costco is the only place i've ever seen it um quality is really good i've never had any issues with it you can also add in raw shea butter um it's more expensive it's a little bit more firm so sometimes i add it and i like to mix things up so some batches i do for every gram of rick simpson oil i do four grams of coconut oil so a four to one ratio sometimes though i will do a three to one ratio and then add in the fourth ratio of this so three rash uh you know three grams of coconut oil per per every gram of rick simpson oil and then add in one gram of this for every gram so those are your kind of two options for for a base um i also add in and i can never pronounce these words right but i'm i'm not gonna let that limit me uh turmeric turmeric i never say it right um i get this at costco too um so i do um for every so if i have 10 grams of um rick simpson oil i would use four of these um so i guess the easier way to say it would be one pill of these so there's 500 yeah 500 milligrams in each capsule so i would do uh for every 10 for every 4 grams of rick simpson oil oh sorry a coconut oil i would use one of these and that's only really very very recently the this only the most recent batches that i added that in before that i was really just using the rick simpson oil the coconut oil and then leticia and so the reason i add started adding those in was because they they there's research around that out there that shows that they kill cancer stem cells which is where my focus is now um but if you don't have that don't let that stop you latissian is also added in and that my understanding is to help with the uptake it's got other kind of benefits as well but that's the primary purpose as far as my understanding is again this can be a little bit difficult to find if you can find it great throw it in if you can't don't let that stop you and then of course we have to add in our rick simpson oil i am fortunate enough to be able to make my own rick simpson oil good group of friends that have kind of helped me get what i need so i make my myself i realize not everyone can and we keep ours in syringes of uh 10 grams of rick simpson oil usually i would do a batch of kind of 20 probably 20 or 30 grams um but just so it doesn't take long today i'm just going to do 10 and that's easier math so off i've got my teapot boiling here so we're just going to use this as a hot water bath so we're going to put the water in and then we're just going to set a little bowl inside and what i do just to get the rick simpson oil a little more workable is i place it in the water as well just to let it heat up just while i'm measuring out the coconut oil and so using this is 10 so we need 40 um 40 grams of this or 40 milliliters so that is that's one i'm gonna need eight of these so there's two three four five six seven it's already starting to melt and eight now you'll see that i am not a precision expert uh precision measure of anything this is more like how your grandmother used to cook where she kind of just threw a bunch of stuff in um there are people out here who i'm sure would be perfect with dosage that's again not me um and i don't want if that's not you i don't want you to feel like you can't do it because you can't do it perfect um so we've got our we put our stuff in there and immediately starts melting um i'm gonna put the rick simpson oil in now so it's had a second to warm up and so it should push out better oh yeah look how nice that's coming out um it is really sticky and really tarry that's you know so it can be difficult to work with but it's coming out nice there now that it's warmed up i'm just gonna pick the camera up here just so we can see what it looks like so you'll see it's pretty pretty goopy looking and that's exactly how it's supposed to look right now okay so from that we're gonna add in a little teasing so i don't you know i ballpark this i would put four in here for 10 right around there now these again i think i said this already if you see them somewhere get them because they're sometimes hard to find i have looked for just a bottle of it like an essential oil bottle so that i could just use a dropper never found it i dream of the day um so we have to work i have to work with the capsules right now but again so much of this is working with what you can get your hands on right and not not delaying until it's perfect working with what you got so i just that's what i've been using um i just cut them they're easier there's a line on them from when they were manufactured it's easiest if you cut on that line and i should say um i am i am terrible at using a knife um as anyone who knows how to use a knife can tell um so you know i always worry about cutting myself but i was gonna say i haven't happened yet but it absolutely has happened hopefully it doesn't happen today i'll only get one left okay pretty goopy doing this part okay so that's all in there now so i'm um you don't have to add in this um if you don't have it or if you're not comfortable with it it's it's definitely something that i've just started doing um and you know it's so unfortunate that the science is really or the good the good research or mainstream medical is really kind of lagged in this area i would love to be able to just go out and buy a suppository that had everything i needed and the different strains and stuff and and you know hopefully someday it's like that um but it's not yet and so you know with a terminal diagnosis you can't wait you can't wait for that you can't wait the 10 years or the 15 years for all the peer review articles that you'd like to see okay so now i'm trying to get these open and you can tell i'm struggling my hands are all greased up from from the uh oil try again um i should warn you with this stuff um it makes everything and i need everything really orange oh there we go so we got it now um so yeah it makes everything really quite orange um so wear wear black underwear if you're gonna put this in because everything is orange including your fingers my fingers will be dyed for weeks um it's just a permanent i just have orange fingers now you can wear gloves if it really bothered you um i'm not so concerned about it so yeah as i was saying i um just to kind of tell you a little bit about my story while we do this one mix all this in um in december of 2019 i found a lump on the kind of outside of my left breast luckily my one of my close friends is a doctor so i reached out to her right away and she was able to get things kind of going pretty fast for me and um and so initially they had kind of said like it was grade two and you know it certainly um wasn't anything that couldn't be fixed that's what they kept saying it's nothing that couldn't be fixed i'm just gonna take a second here and my skills are a little bit lacking so you can see like what it looks like and i just gently kind of keep agitating and stirring it all in the the rick simpson oil will go to the bottom so you really kind of got to watch that just that it you know has a nice a nice mixture on it and this is just a hot water bath is all this is you just keep just keep stirring that's i know what it if i hadn't put in the turkey mac turmeric whatever however you say that if you hadn't put that in it would have been like an olive green is usually what it looks like so you just kind of let the hot water do its thing and melt everything and just all kind of binds together so that you can't see the different ingredients they all are now just one so back to my story so where were we so in january of 2020 i had a biopsy or yeah i had a biopsy mri and all that they said it was a grade two so it was aggressive but not the most aggressive in uh february i had a mastectomy and after that in late march i had scans a ct scan and a bone scan and after the mastectomy i had done really well and the surgeon had actually kind of said like um they did discover upon um doing a mastectomy that in fact it was more aggressive than they had thought it was a grade three which is the most in the grading of cancers that's the most aggressive rest of kind um so they they told me that it was they kind of said like well we got we got pretty good margins it's more aggressive than we thought but we should be fine you know we should be fine and so i really kind of didn't worry about it i had follow-up ct scans and bone scans in march and then on april 2nd i met with the oncologist to go over those and that's when i learned that it had spread into three areas so into my bones so i have it in my tailbone and uh two ribs and so uh when can when breast cancer has spread into your bones that's considered uh stage four and it's considered terminal and so she she sat my oncologist sat me down and with a lot of kindness to tell me that it was terminal and then i was going to die um they told me initially it'd be three to five years was kind of the was kind of the average um but then she said i remember her saying but you know some people go much much faster and i didn't realize at the time is that when she said some people go much much faster she was thinking of me um i learned out i learned uh later that they thought that i would only live a couple of months because it was just so aggressive and spreading so fast so you know that was a lot to take in i was only 37 i had a beautiful family a really interesting career a thriving business you know i really felt like my life you know was just really beginning and the thoughts of it being over was just kind of really shocking for me um and for my family it was actually much much much harder in my family i'm just going to pause to say when you look at this you want to make sure like this stuff here i can see that it's all stuck on the bottom and that's not what we want and you know i may have to get some more hot water just to uh sometimes the water stuff is pretty hot sometimes the water doesn't get hot enough i've seen people do this on a pot too way where they do it right you know on the stove in a pot that's not really how i've done it but maybe that's a good idea i just kind of turn it and just kind of keep mixing it and you know it is quite thick with with the addition of the term turmeric turmeric i'm gonna say that um yeah so in april you know they're telling me i'm gonna die i'm a classic type a personality and so i really um really couldn't accept that well at first i just thought if i could give myself 10 years you know my my youngest child was nine and i thought you know i could if i could just raise her right like i just you know i thought i could die in peace if i could just raise her and so i talked to my doctors about 10 years i said you know what about 10 years and they were pretty skeptical um pretty skeptical pretty uh pretty pessimistic so my rat oncologist did say you know after some probing that it was highly improbable but maybe possible and so i i kind of grabbed onto that and said okay i just need like faint hope and so that's where i started 10 years was my goal that would bring my daughter to and she'd be ready to go out in the world and um in 10 years seems much more doable than three so i started looking to see what i could do to give my body the best the best chance to live as many good years as i could and the rick simpson oil um you know luckily i had a friend who um had been diagnosed with terminal cancer many years before and uh had he had healed himself in part with the rick simpson oil so he was really great in kind of reaching out and and giving me hope and giving me instruction and my husband who is so much better at all these things than i am he's the cook in the house he figured out how to make the rick simpson oil for me and you know and i think that was a big part of saving my life um but the oral dose is really high um thc and you and you get really high and i had never been one to partake i knew lots of people that didn't have no issue with it but just wasn't for me i'm not someone who likes to be high and so i did the starter dose which was a half half of grain of rice and it made me so high about eight hours um i sat in the chair and couldn't talk and i remember my daughter asked if she could go play outside and i know it was like three minutes of awkward solids before i mustered a yes like and i just thought like i didn't i can't live like this and i didn't know how long i had like there was i had the sense that they were really concerned that i was gonna go downhill downhill fast because they told me like go close your business make your will you know they give me that pep talk um so i didn't know how much time i had and i thought i can't if i've only got you know six months i can't risk being high for a month of it like i don't that's not how i'm spending my time um spending a lot of time reading then and i came across um some mention of it being done through suppository and then another cancer survivor who i was working with had mentioned that he had made some suppositories for pain manager for his mom and so that kind of took off in my brain i thought okay well maybe maybe i can do it that way because i had read that the thc when you take it orally goes through it's processed through your stomach goes through your liver and your liver breaks down the thc and that's what sends a signal to your brain that lets you know you're high so when you do it through suppository it you know it goes into your into your bowel and the heat from your body melts it all and it goes directly melts in and goes directly into your bloodstream bypassing your stomach and your liver and so the thc doesn't get broken down the same way and so you don't you don't experience any high other people have told me that or not other people told me i have seen other mentions of people getting high that way i've never experienced it so so i don't i don't know um but certainly for me um i went and do a full about a gram and a half a day dose um through suppositories and never have never experienced any high um okay so let me have it on here yeah this is looking good you just want to lift it up and make sure that it's not um that it's it's not separated okay so the easiest way to do this is kind of spread these out if you can find not all um not all syringes are created equal um so if you can find a good one or a good brand keep buying them the other ones break a lot i have ordered some glass ones they're not in yet but um i'm kind of looking forward to that so what i do is i go down right on the level so that i can see you know this stuff is expensive and i don't want to waste any of it um and so i just fill them right up there's a line you'll see you fill them to that line and then you just move to the next one that's really just what we do so going back to my story while i do this um where were we so it's april they told me i'm going to die i have a fall of me they're still pretty insistent that i'm gonna die but it was funny she um my oncologist who's a lovely person like i you know she's pretty pessimistic but she's a lovely person um in may when i had met with her um i had asked if they knew if it was in my brain because no one had scanned my brain and she said no and i said you know can we get that done and she said oh why would you want to know and um i thought well why wouldn't i want to know anyway but she agreed and gave me the brain scan and got it arranged quite quickly and thankfully it wasn't in my brain um but they had kind of warned me that it was you know they could see the spots in my bones but that cancer when it spreads kind of like sand it just kind of gets it everywhere and it can be a while before you see where it is so they had told me that um it wouldn't be my bones that killed me it would um it would be that it would explode through me kind of my lungs and my my lungs my brain my or my other organs um and so i was very aware that it wasn't just my bone mets that i needed to treat but that i had to kind of condition my whole body so that um wherever they may be that it wouldn't take root so i started about a week and a half it took me to get everything i needed to make my first doses and so that was middle of april and i've really been on it continuously since then and it's done a lot for me besides just um you know in the beginning it was kind of a lot of it was pain management i was starting by the time i was diagnosed terminal i was i was already having a lot of pain in my bones i thought it was just because i was you know getting older and overweight um but it was the cancer mats and uh so i started you know i started using it in part for that because i figured if nothing else is going to help that and i did that both through the suppository anatomical cream um but by the end of may i had no pain and when i followed up my doctor she said you know you must be sleeping a lot now and i said well no i sleep well at night and she goes no no you must be napping and i said no you know i you know and i'm still working full-time and she was kind of surprised by that and i was hiking a lot she was surprised by that so i knew i really had the sense that it was working um because i wasn't i knew i was supposed to go downhill fast and i wasn't going downhill i was actually um i was i was getting stronger i was getting healthier and i was hiking more and um yeah i knew i'd never had cancer before so i didn't know what that was like but i knew what feeling good felt like and i was feeling better than i had felt in years so i continued on with this and i added in you know i don't want to say it was just the rick simpson oil that kind of cured me um but it was certainly an important part you know i i started being very mindful of how i spoke to myself i started loving myself i started doing reiki a lot of reiki um i did intermediate fasting intermittent fasting i would say it wrong um so i did fasting and then i also did cato for the first three months [Music] and i also i also do mainstream so i do all the mainstream stuff too i'm you know i think that's for each individual to choose what's right for them and for me so far the the mainstream um hasn't had a lot of side effects so why wouldn't i why wouldn't i continue doing it um so yeah you know life continued and we kind of got into kind of just got used to it and got into it and uh and again this is so outside of my wheelhouse i'm not someone who tinkers i'm not really and you know the great thing about that though is um you know when i kind of thought about it when doing these widow videos this is not i know that this is not um it's not slick it's not well produced um i'm an average normal person and if and i think it's good i think the nice thing about this video and how amateurish it is is that it really shows that anybody can do this you know like you can do this um you can make this work you can bumble through it and maybe it will save your life maybe it won't it's not gonna hurt anything and it's it's gonna help you with pain management the other thing it really helps with too i realized is um so i'm on a zolidex which is a shot that i get every three months in my stomach to keep me in menopause because the particular type of cancer that i was diagnosed with fed off estrogen and so they keep me in menopause and i was really worried about how i was going to be in menopause because there's some women in our family who will not be named who went a little crazy in menopause and so i was really worried about that and kind of said to my husband like i'm i'm the easygoing one we can't both be difficult um so but the rick simpson oil has really helped with that as well um and i know that because i ran out um in the summer there was a two-week period when i couldn't i didn't have any and i cried by day three i was just a ball of tears and you know i was snapping at everybody and just really not kind of what i had worried about um you know happening so as it gets lower i usually use something just to kind of kind of keep it on the angle and sometimes i keep it in the hot water too but usually it's fine just to go out see what i mean about good syringes if you can find them let me see if i can no so the other option is using and this is more messy but you can you can use just um you know a half teaspoon now i should say there's if you can get a cup style that's a lot easier to use than the round um and again just go down and and measure it um anyway about going back to my story um so i continued to feel better when i was supposed to be getting sicker i didn't have a lot of side effects from the drugs which was great i did stereotactic radiation on my three spots which which i think probably helped but really made me quite sick and it was a weird sickness it wasn't at the time it was several months later and i actually uh got some lung damage from it which i was able to heal as well with with the help of the cream and the oils um so all that leads me to last november when i got my most recent scans um and i found out in january that um they can't see any cancer in me anymore so they can tell where it was um because there's new bright beautiful white bone there um so they see no signs of cancer in me it should have been everywhere through me should have been dead um and i'm healthier than i've ever been so do they call it remission no do they call it cured no um so what they can't see on scans are cancer stem cells so there very well could be cancer stem cells in me um again think back to that um comparison of sand like when you get back from the beach find sand everywhere those were kind of what cancer stem cells are like they could be anywhere in me and and so that's why the kind of oncologists are convinced that i'll still die die from cancer i'm not particularly worried about it um partly because i've gotten my head around the whole thing the whole part of dying but but more than that they think that because they know the meds that i'm on the mainstream do not kill cancer stem cells they shrink tumors but don't kill the the actual stem cells but that's okay because um the stuff that i all the other stuff i do um a lot of that does have um does have nutrients in it or compounds them that are known to kill those stem cells and so just a quick list of the kind of top ten of ones that they know right now is red grape skin and you can get you can get the extract from that just a just a supplement soybeans broccoli the turmeric turmeric green tea cinnamon cardamom pepper and ginger are kind of i guess that's nine the top nine ones that they kind of have some research on so i i really think of it now as i think of the cancer now as uh as like a diabetes or heart disease just something that i have to manage so i continue to do the rick simpson oil i continue to do daily fasting so i do usually 18 and six now when i first so that means 18 hours i don't eat i eat in a six hour window i used to do in the beginning 23 and one so don't eat for 23 hours eat for one i found that was too hard with all my supplements and pills so anyway now i go between 18 and 6 and 22 and 2 hours somewhere in between depending what's going on in my day and then um once a month when i'm off my eye brand so i do three weeks of vibrance off a week when i'm off my week i do a 48 hour fast which sounds really hard but it it really isn't you just put your mind to it it'll be fine so yeah i just treat it as you know a health condition that i have to manage and watch um and who knows who knows where the research is going to go and there is more and more research but you know when you've got terminal cancer you don't have time for that research so i hope this was really helpful i know it is probably comically amateurish um not my wheelhouse but that's okay and again i just want everyone to know that you can do this if i can bumble through this you can bumble through this and you can probably take it and go beyond my skill set really if i can do it anyone can do it and you know just keep reading out there don't don't take my word for it do your own reading take control and heal yourself thanks okay back on track sorry about that so once you have them filled you just break off where you you're done filling i usually kind of leave one and use your knife because again this stuff is expensive and i kind of make a mess with it but you really want to save as much of it as you can so you cut it off roll it up [Applause] put it in the dish bag and then these go in the freezer and i leave them in the freezer until um until it's time for them to go in my butt we call them butt tails in my house my daughter already said do you remember your butt pill so i'm just to show you how they work here's one ripped off this is empty but just to give you the idea so you pinch the top of it and then this comes open there's two flaps and then you just pull and it comes out make sure you wash your hands really well before you insert it your hands has skin on it so that's a really good barrier but once you push it into your bum it doesn't have that barrier and so you just want to make sure that you know you don't run into any problems there with that so keep them in the freezer until just before you use them and actually when you're holding them when you're carrying them try not to hold them on the actual suppository because they'll get melty and goopy and harder to use hold them on the side like this it took me a ridiculous long time to clue into that um so make sure you do that the other thing i will say um again all this so much trial and error um it would have been funny i should have recorded from the beginning if it wasn't so mortifying um for the first i don't know month six weeks that i did it my butt was so itchy it almost drove me crazy um so the solution i eventually stumble upon is simple but not eloquent um you get one of these i get these at the dollar store they're just cotton pads i like the size of them i get one of these i either put a dab of either vaseline or the reception cream if you have it that's what i use just a little dab of that you put the suppository in and then you put this against your bum hole and that just keeps everything because there's going to be some leakage that keeps all the leakage in this keeps it off your skin and keeps your butt from itching um again if i can save you all that discomfort i i'm happy too so i just wanted to make sure i've gone over everything um oh the other thing is if you can wear black underwear if you can it just it'll make you feel better about everything um and the uptake is better through supposed stories um but i also do supplement both with the creams um topically so that will go down about four inches or through your belly button um and in the other video i do i kind of talk about that but you can behind the belly button is a whole network of uh blood vessels that were there from when you were in the womb and when all your nutrients used to go that way so it's kind of like a defunct um subway just waiting for someone to turn the lights on and power on and get it back going so when you put it in your belly button it will absorb in there and then again gets into your bloodstream um i do still take oral not the rick simpson i just do a tea high quality thc oil and cbd oil i take those orally in the evening and and again that's just as many ways i can give my body to push back i do but besides that don't be hard on yourself it's trial and error it will get easier um it will become very second nature and it can help with a you know besides you know maybe it won't heal your cancer maybe it will but if it doesn't it's still worth doing because it it helps with anxiety it helps with depression for a lot of people um it helps with pain i have no pain well i very quickly dealt with my pain appetite issues mood stabilizer like all those areas have really improved with me since i've started using it and again hopefully someday we can just go to the pharmacy and order um you know highly specialized strains of suppositories to help us we're just not there right now and so we have to do the best we can thank you", "jhVjl5SdlTc": "the billion dollar CBD and RSO oil blunder this is Brian boy reporting for Internet Deputy in this investigative report we are going to expose a multibillion-dollar cannabis and hemp blunder Forbes magazine claims the cannabis and hemp industry is heading towards a 100 billion dollar business if we told you the CBD and canvas oil infrastructure is about to become obsolete would you believe it if this is true you can bet this report is going to get some serious resistance we're talking about companies worldwide who have invested millions into manufacturing equipment for the business of making cannabis and hemp extracts literally 100% of the medical cannabis and hemp industry is creating some form of an extract so what's the blender most viewers watching this video are not aware of the following information that we are going to reveal in this report there are hundreds of CBD and THC oil companies seeking to help people however 100% of these companies who make teachers extracts isolates and concentrates are greatly destroying the healing properties of this amazing natural herb before we proceed with this report we would like to clearly acknowledge that CBD and THC oils have powerful healing properties and the extracted oils have helped thousands of people so if this is true why can this be a blunder it's helping people right but sadly there are seven major blunders that we are going to reveal in this report probably one of the greatest misconceptions about CBD and THC oil is potency the misconception about potency is the number one reason why CBD or THC oils are even made sellers of CBD and THC oils are pushing potency as some kind of medicinal advantage this claim is 100% false stronger or more concentrated oils do not have any benefit compared to a less potent oil so what does high-potency really mean it means it's more concentrated and it takes up less space take a look at this non extracted natural made products called hemp paste this product was made using the whole plant method again this is not an extracted or chemically processed product this one Graham scoop equals 30 milligrams of CBD and this CBD oil here also contains 30 milligrams same potency yet the hemp pace was not chemically processed this extracted oil here actually has less medicinal benefits versus the hep paste which we will explain later in this report for example here are two 500 milligram tablets of vitamin C and here is one 1000 milligram gelcap also of vitamin C both equal one thousand milligrams everybody knows that there is no difference other than having to take two tablets instead of one should you the consumer care if it's 30 percent or 99 percent potency of course not in the CBD THC oil world you will find companies bragging about having 99.9% pure CBD isolates the misconception when we hear the word pure we think it's a good thing but take note the pure means it contains nothing else but CBD no terpenes or other cannabinoids such as CB g cbn or THC are present there's no full spectrum when it's pure CBD to this day there is no evidence that extracts have any medicinal benefits over the non extracted flower or the whole plant in layman's terms there is no reason or medicinal benefit to extract the oil from the hemp and cannabis plant somehow people assume or ignorantly follow the notion that the natural state of the cannabis or hemp flower is useless unless it was extracted into an oil what confirms this misconception is the majority of cannabis strains contain over 27% THC and if you take one gram a bud and cook it properly you will have about 270 milligrams of active THC this is 27 times the amount that the state of Colorado recomm for a safe dosage anyone who says that you should extract cannabis or hemp is smoking way too much of their own brother there are also strains of hemp that contain over 21% CBD ignorantly people are sold on the idea that the stronger the oil the better it works make note the more you concentrate the plan the more you damage the medicine there are seven major blunders that we are going to cover in this investigative report here's blender number one the cannabis extraction process was popularized in 2004 by canadian rick simpson between the phrase RSO or Rick Simpson oil mr. Simpson was the one that came up with the explosive idea of extracting oil from the cannabis plant by using 190 proof alcohol bricks Ibsen's extraction method is to take a pound of marijuana bud and soak it in 190 proof alcohol in a bucket for an hour then straining out the plant bud and throwing the leftover plant matter into the trash leaving what looks like a brownish green tea Rick would then put the alcohol mixture into a pan on a stove on high heat and evaporate all the alcohol out until it looks like this a black thick oil known as RSO this process is extremely flammable and dangerous to make and has caused many fires across the world what's ironic about the alcohol extraction method is that the RSO was meant to save lives and yet the explosions have killed people here's blender number two the entire multi-billion dollar oil industry has since followed the RSO idea of extraction many of the major companies have switched from 190-proof alcohol to butane or co2 extraction are these new extraction methods the future are they safe to eat Troy Shermer a hemp and cannabis researcher contacted 14 different hemp and cannabis lab testing facilities such as analytical 360 in Washington and SC labs in California the main question that Troy asked was how much of the terpenes are lost during butane and co2 extraction the majority of lab testing facilities said that they would not give out that information s/he labs in California mentioned on a phone interview that if they shared such information it would damage their relationship with their clients only two companies answered all the questions and both lab testing companies stated that 99% of the terpenes are destroyed through butane and co2 extractions look at steep hill laboratories email response by the way steep hill laboratories was the most transparent and answering the questions the lab techs said the maximum terpenes destroyed up to 100% but most of the terpenes are lost through butane and co2 extraction co2 extraction is worse than butane construction in this way he claimed he also made a statement about removing butane from the oil as butane leaves a chemical residue and many experts claim that it is toxic and has carcinogens which means that it's cancerous if this were true why would L companies sell a product that has carcinogens to people who are fighting cancer blender number three did you know that the majority of CBD and THC oil companies are adding terpenes from fruits and trees to replace the terpenes that were destroyed by extraction these added terpenes are not natural turbines from the hemp or cannabis plant take this orange and the CBD oil by drop some oil onto this orange am I getting terpenes yes I am they're not the real terpenes from hemp or cannabis what happened to natural did the CBD oil industry follow the footsteps of the pharmaceutical industry it's one hundred percent clear that they did and adding fake terpenes to a natural medicine is deceptive the oil industry will say it's for flavor so why are they really adding terpenes it is clear that the industry has started to recognize how critical the entourage effect is and they're trying to cover the damage done to their products by adding fake turkeys what is the entourage effect we'll cover that in the next segment but first our fake terpene safe even though they come from fruits and trees the internet deputy has found the following news articles study finds that adding terpenes might make extracts toxic our terpenes enriched cannabis concentrates bad for your health adding terpenes to dads might be toxic blunder number four on taraj effect the CBD oil industry has been producing isolated CBD it's a white powder and it currently is a hot selling product if you look at the CBD isolate here it's 99% pure CBD what this means is that there is nothing left but CBD there is no full spectrum no terpenes no CBD aid nothing left but CBD how does this affect the entourage effect what is the entourage effect back in 2001 the British Journal of pharmacology refers to the entourage effect and synergistic relationship of terpenes in the article taming the THC since then there have been hundreds of articles about the entourage effect scientists and researchers have concluded long ago that the entourage effect or synergistic effects of all the terpenes and cannabinoids together is superior over isolating CBD just one cannabinoid type such as CBD will not have an entourage effect entourage or synergistic means things work together or enhance one another or even better yet they create a completely different set of medicinal benefits since pure CBD has no terpenes or other cannabinoids it is impossible to create an entourage effect it is important to understand the entourage effect and how many added medicinal values it does create when you google search cannabis entourage effect you will find some powerful articles on how important the entourage effect is when it comes to the healing properties in hemp and cannabis as you can see there are many articles on the entourage effect in short you will find evidence that the terpenes and all the cannabinoids work together and have a superior medicinal value so the question is why would the CBD oil industry isolate CBD when it prevents entourage effects and why would they destroy 99% of the terpenes blunder number 5 what does decarboxylated the hemp and cannabis plant mean heating the hemp and cannabis will remove the a or carbolic acid from CBD a or THC a this is called decarboxylated or activating the cannabinoids both CBD a and CBD are very medicinal in different ways one is raw and one is cooked the main difference is CBD will pass through the blood-brain barrier and will attach to cb1 receptors in your brain but the CBD a will not CBD a is recently gaining popularity in the news regarding its anti proliferative properties known for preventing bad cell growth as found in cancer it's also anti-inflammatory which greatly reduces seizures and pain in short the uncooked or raw state of the plant has major medicinal benefits the CBD and THC oil company's method is to completely cook or decarboxylate the plant as much as possible so that more milligrams of CBD or THC can be sold this destroys even more terpenes thus damaging the medicine let's look at a famous lab testing company called analytical 360 which does thousands of lab tests on CBD oil products click concentrates then sort them by high CBD and select one look at how dark that is the cbda is under 1% which means this product has been completely cooked to death to where it is basically zero CBD a it has been completely decarboxylated and has been processed several times remember CBD a is anti proliferative and anti inflammatory and because it's uncooked it contains over 18 times more terpenes wonder number 6 there are 118 different kinds of cannabinoids such as CBD and THC and the science is evolving the question is how do the remaining 116 cannabinoids work together what are they and what do they do what happens when we remove or isolate them the race is on to discover what these trace cannabinoids can do for our health let's look at cannabinoid number 17 otherwise known as 17 CA - 5 it is a trace cannabinoid which is difficult to detect under normal lab testing equipment yet researchers are finding that this trace cannabinoid is a precursor for CBD just like how CBD affects THC they work together as you know THC is very beneficial medically but unfortunately it is also hallucinogenic CBD decreases the hallucinogenic effect of THC and this allows you to take a slightly higher percentage of THC without getting high thus creating a superior blend of medicine or full-spectrum medicine when co2 or butane extraction is used cannabinoid number-17 will evaporate and be lost again this is another reason why extraction destroys the entourage effect blunder number 7 caused to produce inferior CBD oil this process you are seeing is the standard method used when making CBD oil this appears high-tech and impressive but it's actually destroying the terpenes and many of the delicate 118 different types of cannabinoids it can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for this processing equipment did you know it is impossible to extract all of the cannabinoid terpenes without damaging the medicine look at the CBD oil the flower was processed one time and the reason it's so nice and clear is because it was processed just once but a lot of the cannabinoids were still left in the plant which was thrown in the trash can CBD oil companies are literally throwing away the leftover plant matter that still contains up to 40% of the cannabinoids these numbers vary depending on the method and how many times you run the plant through the machine now let's look at what's being sold in today's market let's go back to analytical 360 scroll down and click on concentrates and choose any test see how black that is it has been repeatedly processed over and over trying to extract all the cannabinoids out of the plant less than 1% of the terpenes survived through this process and delicate trace cannabinoids are damaged so I buy all of this equipment only to destroy 99% of the terpenes and leave butane residue in the product it triples the cost to the consumer and greatly decreases the medicinal value of the product so what is the solution the solution is don't concentrate the plant Internet deputy found that the hemp pace and cannabis paste methods were the only methods in the world where 100% of the plant was consumed there is ZERO waste as nothing is thrown away the flower and leaves are ground up and cooked with a coconut type oil called MCT oil that hemp paste method preserves the terpenes and the costs produced the jefes is literally three hundred and thirty five times cheaper then the chemically processed oil this will make this amazing natural medicine affordable to the whole world and people who could not afford it before now can but the billion dollar question is will the world learn these seven blunders will you the consumer still buy CBD and THC oils or will you revert back to what is natural thank you and I hope that you enjoyed this investigative report this is Brian Boyd reporting for Internet demeaning",

refugee we made it to Oregon last night and this is our video update after receiving the RSO so why don't we first start with how long has it been since you took your first dose of ours I took about the size of a baby about five hours ago but it wasn't hitting my system fast enough so about three hours ago I took this really cool new thing and it's a suppository they just mix the RSO in with you know some other items and they make a suppository and then it goes into your system almost instantly a it is the best thing of my life um it gives you a half a gram which is a super large dose which is what I think is responsible for my speech um you can still hear every once in a while that I'm not quite perfect but I mean considering where I was I'm feeling pretty good my overall pain is probably it one which is just like saying that maybe like the smallest pain exists um and that's just what the RSO and the RSO suppository for me from Genesis farms okay so you've taken two doses one orally and one through a suppository or correct one I put it on my lip you just put it under your gums or you can just eat it like an edible put it on some bread the other one is the suppository which of course I know it seems a little off-putting but trust me when you're sick there are way worse things than that you don't even know and you feel better almost immediately um and are you feeling like hi no I don't feel hi I'm good why not well when you needs a suppository it doesn't process through your liver so you don't get high so it's a great way it's brilliant actually to be able to get all of those cannabinoids super super super fast it's the exactly what you need for like I want what I think of it would work the best for its like a child with epilepsy that neat you need to get the medicine in them right away but they don't need to be high it's it's brilliant it is really cutting-edge medicine okay and uh so now what's your plan now my plan is to take a bunch more medicine and go to sleep for hopefully a long time and try to heal because healing and sleeping is healing and I'll give you some more updates but I know that I'll continue to get better as long as I've got this medicine so thank you", "vu1RKWQtN-M": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video that's been highly requested and I'm sorry it was taking so long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]", "tqVYVUX82dk": "mobix labs is a fabulous radio frequency semiconductor company focused on developing the building blocks necessary for simplifying the design of next generation 5g wireless products with me is the ceo fabian battaglia to explain um 5g and how you fit into kind of this new mobile tech world that is really right in front of us so you're focused on 5g millimeter wave wireless market am i saying am i getting all that right okay and then explain what that means sure well good morning jane um 5g i guess we need some definitions you know 5g is we know it today and you see it on your mobile device and we obviously we see it advertised quite a bit that's really only incrementally better than 4g lte that we've experienced already in the millimeter wave space it's a much higher frequency so to give you an idea sub 6 gig is what's popular today for 5g in millimeter wave space we're talking about frequencies in the order of 24 to 44 gig much faster so now i have a new iphone after i kept my other one for years and years and years and it's a 5g enabled iphone would i work with your company or are you in a different area yeah you you would our devices would be applicable for a mobile device like your your iphone but we're targeting specifically the infrastructure market and the infrastructure market enables enables you to transmit and receive data at those higher frequencies and that's where we play okay so you're kind of more the infrastructure kind of rather than what because consumers will be able to operate things faster and see a smoother process because of you right we'll enable that yes so and we talked about it a little bit could you go into depth how would this impact the average consumer well 5g and in the millimeter wave space will be very pervasive as far as an impact to humanity and everything that we do from the way we learn the way we communicate telemedicine [Music] all the things that we do today will improve and though there will also be more applications that will be enabled as we're able to transmit data faster and and use cases and applications we can't even think of today if you think back when we went 1g 2g 3g and all the advances we made in those generations 5g is taking us to the next level and then beyond now if somebody would have told me we'd have self-driving cars you know it would have been like what how does that work but that's part of what you're doing in smart cities and kind of that part of the future that we read about exactly exactly so those those are well self-driving cars autonomous vehicles is an interesting use case now an urban environments it's going to be really challenging um to to make it fully autonomous but what's going to be required is more data faster data more throughput and so what 5g brings is the ability to make that a reality now since you brought up data explain how mobx fits into the whole data universe okay so if you think of a radio in in the way we transmit information wirelessly it's electromagnetic wave and you have radios and these radios have both processors and they have to be able to excuse me they have to be able to convert these electromagnetic waves into something that a microprocessor can understand and vice versa for transmit and receive so what we do is we we are companion device to that that allows these electromagnetic waves to be received and transmitted in a way that they can be done reliably and at these higher frequencies which is the higher you go in frequency it becomes much more challenging to be able to process these signals so our processors are very capable right they're very very powerful they're very fast the limiting feature in many of these applications is going to be what's outside the processor to convert these signals in a way that they can be transmitted and received so that's where we sit in an outside of the processor or companion device to the process so you enable the data but don't store it or use any data for your own purposes no no so there's there's no memory element or memory component to our solution we simply enable that process okay now you just uh recently secured a 10 million dollar round of funding so tell me about that and what will you use that for sure yeah now we're very excited at how well our message was received to the investors that we were able to secure so primarily i mean at the core we are a innovation company so we we um focus very heavily on the r d part of it uh we innovate so a majority of that is going to go into r and d and now as we're starting to transition to we'll have some announcements here shortly on product introductions then we're also going to be adding the resources that can sit with our customers and help them solve their solutions with our solutions so we'll have to answer your question it'll be a combination of r d and that r d will go to bringing what we have already architected into production and also to develop next generation solutions but then adding the resources that would sit with customers that would um they're called field applications engineers in our industry and those are the people and the resources that work directly with customers okay now what do you see uh for mobix labs in the future listing on a stock exchange overseas i mean what's your what are your goals well um right now again we're focused on innovation um we will uh we have when when we get to the point where we need that additional capitalization we have all options on the table we haven't eliminated any option including a potential ipo but right now again we we're gonna deploy the uh the resources and in r d and bringing the message to the customer supporting our customers but a potential ipo down the road is a possibility okay now before we close i just want your thoughts on like how we'll live and we talked a little bit about autonomous cars and smart cities i mean where do you see this going as a society and how will my children live in say 200 years well that that's an interesting question you know how your children will will live i mean could you have imagined uh what we have today even just 20 years ago in the way we worked and the way we lived and entertained and so i i i think the future is going to be really exciting uh in in the way that um these higher speeds and this new technology is is coming to um being real things like telemedicine and ar in vr i just recently spoke to a friend that's working with the children's hospitals that are working with burn victims and you talk about the vr ar applications that they're using so that these burn victims are are stretching and that that type of application i think is going to be fantastic i think the way we communicate here in the covid area era that we're in right now where well the way you and i are communicating you know via zoom or whatever it might be think of holographic type applications so not only would that be in the work environment but even in the entertainment space imagine inserting yourself in the middle of a football game right so i i think that i think that uh your children they're they're gonna be the beneficiaries of this great technology that's being developed now but i think it will impact every aspects of our lives like we're talking about the way you live the way uh way you communicate uh the way you learn uh the way we take care of ourselves both medically and emotionally i think that there will all be it'll be a positive in all of those areas yeah okay absolutely fascinating thank you so much baby and for coming and talking to us about mobxlabs and please come and update us as you release the product from other things [Music] you", "MTFg9vaL0Lg": "hey everyone this is 4/20 sugar and I wanted to show you something a little different today I have a lot of client paying with what are the illnesses I have and I take a thing called hash oil or RSO Rick Simpson oil and it comes in a almost solid form and I try to keep it with a refrigerator so it will stay harder so I can scoop it on to a nut or something so I can take it like a pill obviously I have my knucks I can't really show you and I put some switch I got to make them it has to get sticky again it's me it gets stuck to me a lot but and then put it on the night I take a bite of the end of the night and just swallow that like a pill with my three and then when I go on my walk in a little bit I will feel a lot less pain I jump try to take any pills for pain I try to use only medicinal marijuana products or cannabis and cannabis extracts or that kind of thing holistic type of medicine so by I try not to take any even advils or each other and so I just want to show you the before effects and I will feel after when I go on my walk I will take another video and let y'all know okay thank you and have a peaceful thing", "3msoAj5S6ts": "oh hi I'm just catching up on my Einstein here you know I read that if you take CBD it increases your IQ but I think it must be a scam because I don't understand a word in this book hi I'm Greg welcome to happy talk and today I want to talk about syringes and how to use them these syringes that we carry come in one gram 1 gram syringes and which is a thousand milligrams of hemp and that's pure hemp extract there's no carrier oils there's no MCT there's no other oils in it and other additives just pure hemp and we carry two kinds one is has 17% CBD one is 25 percent so 17 percent of a thousand milligrams this one has 170 milligrams this is the gold 25% formula so that means it has 250 milligrams per each syringe these syringes are marked by 1/10 of a gram and that's generally a dose 1/10 you might want to take half of one tenth or one twentieth of a gram in the morning another one twenty the night or just you know one 1/10 once a day and these are really easy to use all you have to do is take off the cap at the end and then push off your dose easiest thing is just put it on your finger and then put it between your gums and cheek or you can also put it off in a spoon push it down and spoon that is so they push out your dose put it between your cheeks and gums and that's it now the gold formula tastes like normal hemp wood like you expect it to taste and the green formula 7 the 17% definitely has more it has more plant materials so it's definitely a stronger taste but both are work excellent and excellent way to get your daily CBD and now if you'll excuse me I got some Einstein to study you", "0bL6c8tYSoA": "I thought today would be a good day to do this video because today it's exactly three weeks since I did my last dose of Rick Simpson oil I got that 60th gram down three weeks ago today and the following morning I woke up and I wasn't clear headed actually Friday morning was probably the worst that I felt during the whole time was that Friday morning and so I think that was a really good indication that 60 grams was absolutely my limit so I was glad that that's what the protocol called for cuz I don't think I could have done 61 honestly I don't think I could have it done the first few weeks that I was doing it the first month or so I was still able to drive and I'd have my periods where I was you know getting kind of sleepy in the after no and there was you know sleeping good at night and that kind of gradually changed I started feeling much more sensitive I really couldn't drive anymore towards the end driving would have been impossible it really would have I think the worst part was the ultra super sensitivity to stimuli and that was a hard one that was really a hard one and that's why I said I really think coming out of this I understand what it feels like to be autistic you're just overloaded with stimuli visual tactile aural it's it just it's overwhelming it is just overwhelming you feel so so sensitive to everything and it was easy to have a meltdown it was really easy to have a meltdown so I definitely needed quiet times and I needed a lot of peace yeah there you know I couldn't take discord a lot of the things that were coming over the television set were extremely upsetting Jimmy and they still are but but I'm at least able to not have the huge outburst when I hear them which helps another thing was appetite right away I started noticing that I was not hungry very often but because I I have low blood sugar I started off with low blood sugar it was important that I get something down in the morning so I started off with a lemon juice on the water and drank that every morning and then I would make myself a smoothie and make sure I had a banana and all fruit in hemp protein powder and etc etc to get everything going and just getting that down getting the smoothies down was enough it was enough for me the protocol said that you will lose about 35 pounds and when I went into the doctor's office the other day actually I've lost 31 pounds and she said that I started off the last time I was at my doctor I weighed them and it was 178 a little chunky there and when I went in the other day I weighed 147 and she's not actually a doctor she's my physician's assistant down at Sacramento Native American Health and that's where I've gone for years and that's who I was referred back to by dr. L with's eagle was over in the oncology department at UC Davis you kind of notice behind me I seem to have lost all my pictures and my backdrop we are moving we are moving and it's been pretty painless so far I said at one point - that last move in - here into this house I think I made this statement of that I would rather die than move again well now that we're in the fourth dimension making statements like that carries a lot of weight oh I think maybe I needed to revise that again I don't exactly want to die just because I have to move actually I'm relieved to be moving now the house is too big the yard is too big and although we love it dearly it's too much work for elderly people to keep up so we are really hoping that this big house attracts a really nice family because that's what it is it's a family house so I don't feel bad about moving in fact I'm rather relieved to tell you the truth I didn't really want to do another summer here last summer about killed me just about killed me between the smoke and trying to keep the watering down it was too much it was really too much so I don't feel bad about moving at all and it's been pretty painless like I said Luke found a company that does all the packing and moving for you so I try to stay out of the way but there are decisions to be made so I am consulted regularly but it hasn't been too bad it hasn't been too bad and of course me finishing up this program it all kind of coincided so it's worked out pretty good it's so pretty out here I thought I'd come out here and do a little clipper to it it's actually like 98 degrees believe it or not but it doesn't feel like it thermometer on the porch and the deck says it's to eight degrees so for somebody who was going to be was told that they were going to be dead within the year I'm feeling pretty darn good and we are now almost 2 August and so that would be the eighth month it's according to dr. Elissa bone dr. Boles one of the on Colleges at UC Davis that told me that if I didn't do anything I would last about a year we're getting on towards that year and for somebody who should have been really bad off about now I'm feeling surprisingly great I don't consider myself particularly brave for doing this I really don't truthfully the thought of doing chemo scared me worse than actually having pancreatic cancer I know that sounds crazy but it's true the thought of doing chemo absolutely terrified me and it's like I would do anything rather than have to go through that so if I was going to do anything the THC the Rick Simpson oil that definitely that was that was the no-brainer for me but I didn't do it out of particularly being brave about it or or particularly just doing it to defy the doctors or anything I just did it because I was scared to death of chemo and I had the feeling that if I did it myself that it was going to be okay that I would live through the whole thing which is kind of strange because pancreatic cancer is considered one of the more deadly ones and also the one that is rising where other cancers are going down although I don't know if I believe that or not one of the more difficult things coming through this was as I finished up the program like for the first week after the program I had absolutely no appetite whatsoever it was like forcing food down was forcing food down I just couldn't stand the thought of food and I had to really really really make myself eat which benefits that's buddy for somebody who's been battling her weight her whole life okay here it is folks so that was the worst part but by the second week I was getting my appetite back everything was smelling better to me tasting better to me and I still though I am still on the pancreatic cancer diet I'm still not having the wheat or the sugar or the alcohol I'm not doing rice I'm not doing potatoes and so that's been a challenge to find good nourishing food within those guidelines and that's that one of the harder things is is stuffing in enough calories to keep going here but I guess all the other calories from desserts and bread are just empty calories anyway so I'm actually eating the way I guess I'm supposed to be eating I'm not losing any more weight I'm holding steady at 147 so that is very encouraging to me right there I'm driving again I I drove Lou and I to Rite Aid yesterday and he said I did real good but today I offered to drive Neeta to the grocery store to Raley's and I got to thinking I don't know if I really want to do that she's pretty fragile and she has a hard time getting in and out of my car and I wasn't feeling too confident so Lou stepped up and said that he'd drive the elderly ladies today so we did we went to Raley's today and we coordinated pretty good the three of us but she was hit and run last week and so she's been without a vehicle and then with me not driving and it so it's we're kind of checking are you renting out of anything are you renting out of anything but so today she she said she was ready to do a storeroom because she still doesn't have her car back and so anyway I think tomorrow the next day I'll try driving again I don't feel unconfident about my driving it was mostly just having Neeta in the car and knowing that she has a hard time getting in and out of my car and besides I just kind of wanted Lou along because he's he's like you know the big strong man and he'll take care of us is something so I have absolutely none of the symptoms that I had when this all started I don't I'm not waking up with any kind of nausea I don't have any pain I'm not done let's see I don't know about the allergies she's I go a stupid sprouts honest to god we went over to sprouts the other day I needed flaxseed and I needed hemp seeds so Lou found me he was wandering the aisles looking for the organic hemp seed and I was doing something with the organic flaxseed so I get home and I'm looking at the flaxseed package as I'm going to put some in my smoothie and I see that it's been packaged in the facility that also does wheat soy peanuts and fish okay well I'm super allergic to shellfish and I stay away from fish in general because I don't know what's touching what on conveyer belts so I'm thinking oh that's great it's called organic and yet it's done in this plant so then I'm put that aside I'm taking that back so I open up the flaxseed and I actually put it like a tablespoon in to my smoothie and then I read on the back of that made in a facility with wheat peanuts soy and shellfish not just fish shellfish so I got that I tried to take it back this movie I'm thinking I don't even want to try I don't even don't even what - so I got most of it out and I took a little taste and I got that kind of neat feeling so then the you know the allergy pills you put under here so I did the allergy pills but honest-to-goodness you really have to read your labels I mean you really have even if it's labeled organic a shellfish thank you well another perk is that a perk is that I get a whole new wardrobe out of this this I'm wearing a blouse from and the olden days and it's kind of like a nightgown it's very large a lot of my clothes are you know kind of like tents jeans I need some jeans my gosh all my jeans I'm giving my jeans to Peggy she doesn't know this yet she'll know this when I send her this video to edit but I'm giving her my jeans because right now my jeans look absolutely ridiculous and if you just kind of go like this you can just pull them right down so I'm gonna get some new clothes and you know that might be a good way to end this video with me thinking about getting some new clothes I have gotten some stuff I have I - it's so good anyway I kind of think I'll stay at this weight for a while so I get to get some new clothes and on that happy note I think I will end this and so until next time I will say goodbye goodbye and thank you for watching", "PSRxXxxGAOg": "good morning everyone is canna Bob and I just wanted to say that dose 10 will be today and I wanted to keep on thanking you guys for following me I've developed so many followers

information soon", "vU59yesq0jw": "okay so we had some technical difficulties with the last couple of videos or glass videos and we don't know what the videos went they just went poof buh-bye so I have some notes up here on the on the wall we did start our so on the 24th of September and holy [ __ ] where did my [ __ ] might go yeah I was out for a good 12 hours first time I just slept that good in that in a very very very long time I did the second dose about 7:00 p.m. on the 25th woke up one time to go the bathroom but I'll tell you what the growing effects lasted all day today so do keep that in mind when you're doing these treatments and say you're going to be groggy and tired for the first couple of days before you really get used to what your body is is it's getting used to I mean it's you you're putting some pretty serious stuff in your system and Wow yeah you get behind you pretty it [ __ ] you up I'm taking so this I just got out of the freezer it's the easiest way to gather it up Madhu's I'm gonna stick money my scraper in here sometimes you can do it out there sometimes you can pull the silicone out of the plastic and that's easier sometimes you just pull it out okay so for those of you that have never seen what a gram of RSO looks like this is one gram of RS oh now this is guerrilla bomb RS oh it is a an indica hybrid it's a 28 percent THC its parents were Gorilla Glue I can speak number four and THC bomb which is an indica hybrid as well bottoms up and then it's been hard as well so then that's really all you do is you swallow it down and you're good go I'll believe that numb up my mouth that I've been having a problem with my 2/3 [Applause] so now I'm going to set up tomorrow's dose so you it's just a little easier to give your spoon heat [Music] so this is my one gram for tomorrow so all I'm gonna do is take this knock over my bomb right and you wake up pick this back in here now I'm gonna put this back in the refrigerator for tomorrow it's that simple you can also take it and put it in like your tea your hot tea at night and drink it or during the day but I", "ThKEublnjtI": "[Music] hmm [Music] so [Music] [Laughter] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] do [Music] hmm [Music] so [Music] you", "zPgsTMoAuWo": "sorry about that cut off again yes as I was saying I would have to use my right arm and I would have to use my left arm instead with my right arm because it would just get stuck or shake so with the are so I took my dose yesterday and I'm finding that I'm using my right arm subcon subconsciously without even I would use I would have to force myself to use my right arm but now I'm using my right arm and it's it's subconscious is like it's it's definitely positive whatever whatever is going on and I want to share that with you guys so thank you guys for following love you guys for following love you guys for listening and taking this journey with me take care", "BQgkVTCGKAg": "[Music] oh man got a full house alright sorry guys what's up sausage gravy biscuit glad grower forgot my ashtray got burned down with you guys make it some vape cards this morning testing them on yep being down at the dispensary cuz they ain't making them clean yet like uncle Harley so here's what I've been doing I made up my little necks I put my live rosin I decarboxylated it and my decarboxylate er see this now it's not rapid led it's ardent this is my D cardi carved the rosin and then I winterized it for a second that didn't really pull anything off so I just then I warmed it back up and cut it with this is what I cut it with little yellow bus honey liquidize oh come on these gaskets man they need oiled right off the get sometimes yeah these things are a pain and I'll ask so just use a little residual [ __ ] left over and oil the gaskets with it like that there's always a little stuck on the tip you gotta get one of these little blunt tip needles once you suck it up in your syringe this syringe was full they got a squirt in slow the D carbs the color it makes it dark I don't give a [ __ ] this cuz I know these pens don't get up to know 436 degrees my nicotine pen don't get up that high so I don't think you're really getting in those other pens I don't think you're really flashing that [ __ ] off it's not D carbon even says it's THC a you're not getting at all let's put it that way you're gonna get all of it miss it's gonna feel stronger even though the THC contents probably lower I'm guessing this morning 50 60 % maybe 70 I only cut it a third and use half well it's like a half half of what's there like I had 8 grams of live rosin and I used 4 milliliters of little yellow bus honey liquidizer there we go clean vape cartridge was all ready to hit that's shocking I didn't think they'd do that the librarians real thick and sticky you'd never even be able to get it in here right unless you like heated it up and then put it in scold him hot and then then did it but then it wouldn't burn it wouldn't even drain down anything so you have to like make liquidize it so that's an emulsifier it's flour terpenes right you can actually buy straight cannabis terpenes but they are unbelievably expensive you ain't gonna buy now 120 milliliters of it for you know 100 some dollars it's gonna be [ __ ] the one Scott has it's goddamn it [ __ ] gasket there you get like three drops for 20 bucks literally the actual cannabis terpenes that their wildly expensive I could see why you know your yields are just probably all the guy got off one freakin plan if you watch that in dokas channel at all Howie he always tries to show you how to make concentrates with a coffeepot and he they make excellent CBD products too by the way but they're I think they're in Europe sorry I gotta pay attention one doing I forgot what I'm saying that's how good that glue pen is I'm not a big favor either UK but you know anymore even though it's all legal and stuff here there's still a huge stigma so people love the stealth of the vape pen they're like man that could be at a family function I could literally walk outside for two seconds nobody knows I did [ __ ] and I could put up with their [ __ ] for another two hours yeah I'm almost out of juice I think that's about it I just might fill up this one I got here about last a little bit it's getting thick that's not good trick is go slow so yeah once you get your harvest alive rise and then after I harvested out the decarboxylate er I I warm it up in the microwave for 30 seconds inside this thing and then you then I measure out this little yellow bus honey liquidizer in the pen right and I like if first you got to make sure you you know your weight so my weight was like seven point nine right at eight so I use just under four milliliters of the little yellow bus honey liquidiser it come out almost perfect it was a little bit thick but I just didn't want to add any more so what's happening aap it's having to Jane joke grows that do a little work this morning getting these vape cards ready before I headed to the post office got packages going out today maybe these are gonna be better I don't know if you got any of these or not sausage these are definitely gonna be Wow way better it was taking me five polls to really feel it now I'm feeling that wanting to just like it's a yeah dee carbonate makes a huge difference wow that feels like it's twice as strong I love that glue it tastes just like gorilla glue to using this yeah I used to no flavor original orig sup j420 you came for 20 I know I said something to you already buddy and shout you out with a mess aap glad you still up in here I found your big bud see that I popped and then I hid my panty dropper with it so we collaborated on the string you didn't even know it what do you want to call the big panty dropper there's granny panties and then we got panty dropper we could have big-girl panties you know ladies they put your big-girl panties on here's what I done so far today these are all complete liquid gold so it looks like we don't make [ __ ] well once people taste my weed in there and they always oh man how much do some of that bud these are clean Jane no lead right because we don't use shitty coils no uh no vitamin E no coconut oil no butane harvested [ __ ] weed not washed with nothing no propane no MXZ 12 12 X or whatever it is MZ 12 X all we use is little yellow bus honey live liquidizer and live rosin I don't know if you guys have a pricey live rosin carts out but a real live rosin cart is not cheap a piece of email me the PayPal me the shipping I'll send you it to you something I say I send you something for your giveaway too I'll send you one of my earlier prototypes the one right before this fall harvest man I just put that grill glue into flour this morning nice she's gonna be nice so here's how we make our s oh I'll just do a quick tutorial and I'll do a whole other video when I actually make it so you got to get you one of these from Amazon you can get them anywhere between 40 and a hundred bucks and I'll tell you the price difference why I got what I got this is a counter top distiller okay see it plugs up the top part plugs into the back and then the back part plugs into the wall right it's got this digital temperature readout setting things this is a this is really handy I mean you can boil it off outside but it gets dangerous when you do that [ __ ] this is highly flammable liquid I mean you can light it on fire it's been this is what they the s alcohol is no joke this I have to pick up in Kentucky because they don't sell it high enough proof here see that that means it's 95% pure alcohol so what we do first is out pour two bottles into this right - fresh bottles pour it straight in and then I'll run it through and what that does is that flashes that most of that 5% or that yeah that 5% of water off because you don't want no water in your RSO is if you to get it evaporated off you got to get it to 212 degrees and we know that you lose your thtve at 2:15 so you don't want to do that and your THC delta-9 so then here's some alcohol that's come off the RSO already see it comes back I use this because that shit's not cheap that bottle is 50 bucks are you doing a gallon at a time you know you just flashed it otherwise if you don't have one of these you just flashed it off into the atmosphere and you're gonna get about 10 15 milliliters IRS oh maybe yeah so these are the setup fits together and then you're gonna make your distillate pour it in here set your temperature to 78 to 79 degrees centigrade okay that's where alcohol boils off I don't know what the Fahrenheit equivalent is because nobody uses that where they make these I guess so but they do list you know the alcohol flash off what these are made for is there wine distiller to turn wine into brandy right so or to clean your water up what's everybody saying my chest not scrolling anymore we got more than 14-inch at how's what tastes frosty the hybrid are the vape cartridge this one tastes just like real glue number four no [ __ ] I was like hell yeah to come from live rosin this shit's good it tastes like the live rosin it's real smooth this little tiny thing I'd give one of these kind of volt that's what I've been using or use you want to use our kind of vape cars head our airflow is the same as just about everybody else Platinum vape and all them you need a battery with let me see see how it's got these little notches for air flow if you don't have that you'll never get air I mean it's all it'll seal itself right up shut because the whole see it the airflow holes right there my joints off the power all right it's back to the IRS oh alright so this is what when I say we'll put it in the still this is the still and it's nice because it's safe it can sit around your counter time you don't have to worry about blowing up your house we have known some people here in Michigan their kids were making a shatter or whatever and they blew the burn their parents house aunt killed their parents we don't want that [ __ ] to happen here's the digital readout when you start out you hit set 79 degrees and then it'll fire up on its own but we don't want to do that because there's nothing in it and it catches all the alcohol this nice little thing I think mine was like a hundred bucks your you want the one where you can adjust the temperature so I'm come in there just set to distill water and they get too hot and you cook your RSO you're not getting that that stuff to the right consistency at the very end that's what separates the the good from the okay and it's a long process and the way I do it I do it the way I do it so that so that it also D carbs in because it's an oral medication you want it to hit right now this doesn't get quite hot enough to be carbon okay you need to get it up to 200 degrees so so what I do is I get to this big old pickle jar we got you still see I didn't want this alcohol had particulate in it and I didn't want to filter it out so I'll just run wash my next batch of weed in it right so because I don't want to run it through that I just got it all cleaned out so on I grind up my weed first and I just run some [ __ ] all right here's what I do and take the weed normal that way stick in the food processor stems it off cuz it's all got medicine on it right we're not smoking it we don't care how harsh it is pack this [ __ ] nice and full you candy stem it if you want it'll blow through the processor easier but it really doesn't matter you don't have to chop it up if you good I was really grinding the [ __ ] out of it yesterday cuz I was harvesting beans at the same time this isn't seedy outdoor bud this is this is just foxtail bud [Music] [Music] and do our pickle jar got some alcohol in there yeah you're gonna want to fill it up to where it's almost it's completely saturating the cannabis right it's almost got not enough weed in it right now man where's Mook at you just want to see this oh crap I don't think I put 21 plus up first I even put all the trim and [ __ ] back in the same bag with this looks like that's gonna be hash or honest low [ __ ] floods or foxtails out so bad guys the first time grower and I think he he was worried about Ripper put a security light on them what do you think happened to him they look humongous they're foxtail all out and they're frosty is all get-out fright you know smoke your brains out but I can't do nothing with it smoke it it's getting man all right so I need material for assault worse than I need bud or smoke that's kind of blood we use Ferrari so we don't use moldy bud Japan get away with it y'all you know you just give them dead mold spores and all that sick just it just doesn't seem a that : it besides what if one's for doesn't [ __ ] die and all sudden it's gonna put off thousands and millions more so I don't think they can Hamilton quite frankly I've had this discussion with my mom and she's the smartest person I know see you later Jane thanks for stopping in it wouldn't surprise me if they did that's for sure I mean all it takes is for it to stay on an air bubble and they are microscopic so they may be able to live through the they may be able to live through the alcohol bath but they're not gonna live through the decarboxylation process of mine that kills everything everything gets dead at 165 degrees and we go over that so so just in case anything did that I didn't see or you know even survived the bud wash survived this alcohol wash it's not clear surviving my deep car process but I still will not use moldy cannabis it's just the risk outweighs the reward that's why you gotta look at don't ever look at oh I'm losing this I'm losing that you know you might lose something more important like your ability to breathe will see the [ __ ] that fell on the desk normally I fill this jar fill it full and then I'll tell you how to make it even a nice like pretty color once you get this fluid filtered out of here right if you stick that jar a full liquid in the sunshine for a few hours five six hours it will take the green color out and they'll make it a nice golden color via Charlie Jackson there's let's keep this in the smaller jars push it out of your way should sleep that passion there Jackson where'd you put grandpa's we'll do that all right so then you gotta get your pretty black hair tie that your daughter leaves laying around everywhere because she's a slob yesterday first some of the rice strainer that's right first I strain it with the rice screener because this you have to be careful unless you'd like having one of those special cone funnels we want to squeeze the alcohol out of the material if we can that way if anything spills you're not 100% after we're gonna do the race for you some guys stop here you know they don't mind a little plant matter in their RS soul but it's not just for us so I start people you know a little cleaner look in frankly I think the more [ __ ] you leave it the better that works for you but I don't like it either tastes nasty we should God you look up in the house I'll leave it up for you brother I told my girlfriend want to conserve water and stop showering you so much she told me I I don't think you have a showering problem I think you have a digging up corpses all groan oh my god it's horrible they're gonna give a little squeeze over it's just a little squeeze then we'll throw this in the trash and they'll be back to add the rest this is how we Satan on the alcohol squeeze that [ __ ] out of there oh this one fits way nicer and it's a tighter screen I like that I got an invention for this too I just come up with it yesterday Scott's gonna help we work on the prototype one thing I miss while working at GM in have it shop no more clean this bowl out there so then I like to filter eyes down a little bit more so next I grab me a coffee filter rubber band I gotta be careful with this we in a recovering alcoholic this alcohol that's so strong you really should wear rubber gloves you can literally get drunk from the [ __ ] soaking into your skin so cuz I'm hardly wants to stay on the wagon and I don't want my life to fall into shreds I'm not gonna get drunk on blue-eyes Moses today got my rubber band I got my coffee filter come on maybe I don't have my coffee filter right because I don't have on my coffee music put the coffee saucer over the jar what I just do with my rubber band I just had at the back of the tape and see what the [ __ ] I did with it Oh see I need smokes weed alright ready guys so then this is a long process cuz this [ __ ] takes forever to drain no that ain't gonna work I'm gonna fall oh my goodness sakes well because this has so much alcohol in it disinfect the st. erst okay all right I was going to leave this propped up in the corner on the desk you have to take my word for it drinking but it goes really slow there see it running down in there it's gonna take a while I had a mail this morning I had a mail from mr. green body but he told me he runs rings I like running rigs and you can see how healthy his [ __ ] is you can see the difference is it's not a big one at first but I could tell over the overall health of the plant like how well they they handle [ __ ] like right now we're doing a breeding project with some Brazil Amazonia it's supposed to be the most mold resistant strain there is I mean it fights off mold in the Amazon those kind of wet conditions cassoulet and and it's supposed to be highly pest resistant I can say it's probably the one plant in my grow area that I haven't seen any spider mite damage on whatsoever so in our p.m. that we've had like a spot here and there there's all come from the spider mite damage so it didn't get in OPM but it really hasn't been exposed to any yeah it only happens when your leaves get really damaged nice that's cool Hamilton I gotta make sure that chats still scrolling it hasn't won usually when I get more than four 14 people in there it wants to stop so so back to regs and Femmes I think just the overall health of the plant they just seemed to I don't know maybe because it's not scientifically propagated I guess but even with like even with good solid back breeding and I was listening to Vader talk about this they kept asking Vader well I don't you have feminized see why don't you have feminized seed and this he may have him now this is right before he started ocean grown or right when he started it and he said I can't get it better than ten percent female seeds and until I can get I mean ten percent Hermes or you know our males he said until I can get it better than that I don't want to say they're feminized well I mean that's what everybody else is calling from a nice seed so even at that there's a 10% chance right you can still get a male right so that means the math should be 1 out of 10 so if you're getting 2 or 3 males out of 10 the chances are you got you you might not know it but you've got red pollen from somewhere if you're in an area where somebody's grown within literally if you're outside growing if you're within two miles of somebody with a male plant outside there's a height there is a probability that your plant could get pollinated they can go up to 2 miles in the air that's another reason our area is surrounded by trees and overgrowth and [ __ ] try to filter that [ __ ] out I'm excited for that Sour Diesel means soil life we're talking about that Sour Diesel last night what would get a good run on average that shit's [ __ ] just [ __ ] because it was farm-sauce it ran yeah got pregnant I'm gonna try to run a sense of million see what happens so then after this shit's all done we put it up in our still of course with this still this big you're gonna want to make dual you know a larger quantity at a time even if you just got us save it well some guys do is they'll take their product from here from the jar and then cap it and stick it in the freezer and what that does there's all the fats and lipids that are in that mix well glob you late just like on spaghetti or chili you know you see if you leave it sit out the sauce you'll get that grease I'll come coagulate on top so then they'll filter it again and what happens and they do it through a vacuum process because it has to be quick before the fats melt back again right so then they filter it again cold filter it and then that's how you pull the fats out but once you do that boy it's really hard to work with I mean you got a harvest at all is liquid and then hope it doesn't get too hard in the syringe so I stopped I stopped winterizing the RSO for that reason it was really really strong I mean stupid strong I didn't take a single pain pill for this seven fusions I had my back my mom my mom helps her with that bad breeding stuff cuz before I started I was like nah I don't I don't understand this is Mendelian charm yeah so what that's I mean the probability I'm a math guy and it just everything's a guess you know what I mean it's like you got a mom and a dad you're gonna get brothers and sisters now you're not identical to your brothers and sisters in any way shape or form so you have to take the the biggest baddest brother or sister and sister right in this case and then you got to try to then even have to isolate her genetics so how do you do that so then you got to find a male with similar structure I've all these beans you pop and then you cross them right and then you do this five more times so breeding males males very difficult bought there's way to skip a step and this is why feminized seeds became so popular besides the fact that you have a high probability right 90% chance of getting a female say well it's actually seventy-eight percent chance you know 22 percent 28% chance 72 percent chance I'll be female the rest are gonna be Hermes er or males and that was a study if you're into Korean farming at all this Korean guy did a study where he did 300 beans and that's what the numbers he came up with and he did it like more than once so he said that's the you know that was the probability so so it'd mean breeding is never an exact science right it never but if I would say if you're unsure whether or not things were I check all my beans anyway because you don't know I mean you could get powned from outside blow in the window and hit your plant and you get some beans that came from somebody else's mail who knows just keep checking your sacks it's not that difficult you guys behave c'mon I had a feeling one of them mr. greenbags was gonna be a boy the way that [ __ ] was ahead and I was like come on girl but I did pop pop too because the regs in the math you know the math doesn't always come out one time I popped all my pain wrappers a ridge right first time I popped them I got eight nails out of ten eight I was like well [ __ ] man and then one died cuz I mean it was just it was one of them weird fee tones you know the first f1 something once in a while you get you get something incredibly stellar out of f1 your chances of getting something just ridiculously whole new great strain is really high but you also have that that chance that you're gonna get the really weird one you know the stunt did you know the mass always the same right it's got to equal out that's what the yin and yang is all about Santa and mrs. Mook he yeah he's uh why don't have any of his new stuff but I have his like his uh his ice applesauce and that last batch he ran but I told him to wait because I want I still haven't put his library together I got a whole library for him but I still gotta finish just putting it together I just finished harvesting all the seeds and sausage helped me get that done last week by prompting this [Music] I got more stuff coming off yeah I just thought yesterday I hit a hit my panty dropper with glass big blood that I've feminized pollen that I harvested this summer so I'm going to get a few beans from that and then I'm gonna feminized that clone you know what I mean great now I have oh my god I lost count last time at like 67 strain different strains and beans and I just popped should I pop another six this week I think all right you know scared Roby me too I want to make sure he'd get onto YouTube it's gonna be staggered of course because there's no way I'm gonna be able to flowering out 24 they're not gonna be it already at the same time the only getting on his grow off though email me or whatever you need to do you ain't got pay power whatever all right guys I am going to hit the head get me something to eat take a break and I'll be back at it later if I do something different if I harvest something else or if I do another step on this oh let me show you my last step okay once you start cooking this in this still up here right get it all cooked off and I still puts the alcohol in the is a clean jar when you open it up when this kicks off that the temperature I got it set at it'll be real liquidy normally you guys will keep running keep running it and then harvest it out of here but this thing's so big and it's hard to get up in the syringe when it's real thin it gets real stinky real easy so so what I do is I leave it the alcohol in it so it's easy to make handle and then I bring it to the oven I'll put it on bake 200 until it comes up to temp and then I cut the oven off and this is a D car process as well as the finishing process you see it bubbling right now that's alcohol coming out of it see how little is left and that was from a gallon of liquid this is why you don't see a lot of our sou needs a ton of product to make it to be able to harvest it in any kind of quantity but that's it guys I am Harley grower I'm a mission County misfit architected tank and a bearded bud brother and I'm out of here", "SvBdei47kfc": "okay so here is the band lux e 800 this is a 4g and 5g outdoor cpe made by the company bandridge we are going to do the unboxing see what comes inside the box and later we're going to do an installation of it so this black box here is the connection for the power over ethernet and the lan side and we also have the power plug we have the power cord also inside the box we have a bag with all the screws needed to fix the back plate on the unit and inside the bag we also have a transparent cap which covers the place where the sim card and the leds are placed so you can look at the signal level through the clear plastic and this black one is the weatherproof adapter that you use over the ethernet cable so that water and dust doesn't go into the box and here is the unit very sturdy plastic material with a metallic back it has a arrow pointing up which is the right position for the installation it also has the screws to install the bar and there's a ground screw on the bottom the ethernet connection on the right hand side and you can see the leds inside this connector as well as the sim slot to place your carrier sim card those leds will tell you the uh intensity of the signal of your carrier and this is the metallic bracket that you're going to place on the back of the unit with the screws in this position this is how it's going to be installed which we're going to show immediately after this so we will proceed with the installation of the unit you have to install it in a tube in the highest place of the property uh it could be a tube with a one to four inch diameter any uh sturdy pole or two will will work even the ones used the arms used for satellite tvs so i like to be dishes it has to be well installed tighten up the screws correctly ground connection very important especially if you're in a region where there's a lot of lightning you want to have the ground installation very well done again install it in the highest place of your property or your residence in order to get the best line of sight to the nearest or most powerful cell site there are maps that give you location of where the cells are so here we have the transparent cap to protect the leds that's where the leds will tell you what the power level of the signal is it's also so going to show you if there's a 4g or a 5g connection the status of ethernet power and also that the unit is powered so this is the back bracket and the screw very long screws that you need to place on the back in this position here is the unit already installed and mounted on the on the pole make sure that you tighten really well these screws that you place the washers so here's the unit already installed in the pole now we are ready to install the sim card and also connect the cable with the weatherproof connector so let's assemble the weatherproof cap for the connector so we make sure that you're using an outdoor cable especially if it's going to be across a roof it has to be a uv-resistant cable if it's going to go underground it has to be a cable that's suitable for burring in this example we're just going to use a regular ethernet cable and this is the weatherproofing connector or cap that we use it's composed of several parts this is the bottom cap this is the part that screws on the unit on the back of the unit and there's a piece here that has this little like crowny type of plastic around the rubber piece and this rubber piece is going to separate in two pieces that go around the ethernet cable to tighten it up and then when we put this like zigzag figure uh in the same position as that small plastic piece that covers the rubber those pieces are going to start closing on top of the rubber and tightening the cable so that no water or dust comes in so the way you install it is first you put the cap second this little plastic covering you separate the rubber into the two pieces put them around the cable then you insert that plastic a crowny thing around the rubber really well placed and now we put the other the part the screws on the unit making sure that the uh little zigzag shapes are aligned with the plastic covering you see okay right there and then now i'm gonna start screwing the cap you're gonna listen the plastic cracking that's how it closes and it pressures the rubber on top of the cable so now the cable is very tight no water is going to come in can barely move we're going to tighten it later when we connect it to the unit and this is how we protect the ethernet connection on the back of the unit to be ip67 so we have our weatherproof adapter placed on the cable we're going to connect the ethernet cable on the back side of the unit everything is tightened up really well we screw this to the back so we make sure that no water goes in and we've already installed the sim card on the other slot we have the cable ready we're going to be able to see the level of the signal in the leds and we are going to connect the other side of the cable to our power over ethernet unit so we connect this cable directly to the poe now we have this black ethernet cable connected to a computer into the lan port and once we plug this into the outlet the unit will power up and we can start uh doing all the configurations on the portal so once we are connected to the computer and the unit's powered up we're going to enter 192.168.151 in any browser the portal website is going to show up the username and the password are administrator by default and here you have the configuration portal for the unit see that my sim card right now is not activated so it's showing no service once it gets activated it's going to show the type of service be it 5g or lte right there it's showing no service network operator whatever network you uh operator you're using it's going to show that the name is going to show there or the i identifier we have also on the right hand side we have the ip address we have the subnet mask and right now obviously as we don't have servers we don't have a one ip or a one subnet we can open the mobile network to check the status you have the uplink and downlink information right there we have a advanced configurations we have also cell selection right here we can start and stop any connection rescan the mobile network we can also go into the frequency setting and say let's say we want just lte first connection or lte only or 5g we can do a scan mode in full band and as you can see on the bottom we have all the lte and the 5g bands all of them selected but you can choose just one and just just one of them connected we also have a port management where you can do port forwarding for trigger it's very standard for any type of router you have all the account management to change or update your your password and your username you have the device settings you also have a section for time settings in case you need to change the time zone which you obviously will do and connect any time server information there you have a restore or for default settings and you also have software and firmware updates uh remote management settings to enable or disable remote management and right here you see the leds are indicating on the top part the power then you have green for the status of the same yellow for the ethernet and the blue four power you", "ipnWHpsbFJ0": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with token Tim 420 this the Florida Medical Marijuana review for Florida medical marijuana patients or those over the age of 18 you guys haven't subscribed yet make sure you hit that button up in the corner alright I know it's a little bit after 4 or 7 10 it's like 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning now and 4 or 5 dabs of the lemon og and that girl of glue super scum kind of dip in for a couple hours guys alright this video is going to show you some bad dabs put it that way if your dabs doing this stop to having that grab you've got some of the Turk nectar the purple sherbert from rise and I will say this is I've had this for a while I got this at the grand opening in Pinellas Park back in April there over three hours round-trip for me they said I could bring it back just haven't made it back up there yet they also I believe discontinued their turf nectar and now they're doing a Terps app they had half grams for 45 and a full gram for 75 so the math doesn't make sense but I will warn you it's distillate it's in a syringe you can take it under oral it's distillate they're trying to put a funky spin on it but it's distillate with some turps added back into it basically all right you can see that stuff it's pretty dark kind of funky smelling a little dad out of here real real runny oh I didn't have it any camera sorry guys you see it's real runny and it's kind of it's not clear by a long shot because you can see through there all right focus on that and we're gonna take a regular lighter I haven't got my finger you guys see that snap crackling and popping now it's not supposed to do that and you can even see out there it's like a blackish green when I wipe it off and it has a funky smell they said if it ever snaps crackles and pops that usually there's some leftover residue in there I don't mess anything it's leftover butanes this stuff's been in a garage for three months now so it's definitely got over 90 degrees you think if there was any butane it with a vaporized off at that temperatures out here I'm not sure I don't know I'm not an expert but if you shatter crumble whatever your wax your token I'll never does that stop smoking it I know that's a given all right guys that'll be it for this quick video I'm gonna try to put up another one real quick guys like I said a bunch of unplanned it just worked like stood in line at Trulia for an hour like everybody else so that took a lot of my day away plus it's an hour drive they're an hour drive back so that was three hours out of my day for some crumble so I said guys if you haven't subscribed subscribe hopefully your token on something good or dabbing on something good I'll be back in a minute to dab on something with you", "kMbKGpsatB0": "[Music] Dameon oh here at Mobile World Congress Barcelona this week we've heard a lot about 5g it really looks like the whole ecosystem is coalescing as operators moved to commercializing these networks at scale I'm curious to learn from you how air span is approaching 5g so this week we made a lot of 5g announcements we are launched our air 5g open architecture vrn platform which supports millimeter wave and sub 6 gigahertz with massive MIMO so we're providing macro performance high-power 70 DBM multiple splits split to split six split 7 and we're providing an open interface and I'm opening ecosystem so that operators can choose what software to put it in into their network and be our software it could be a third parties but we're trying to disrupt the way the economics of networks get deployed and that's something we have a you know in the last two years have really succeeded at doing which is transforming the economics of network deployments and you know you mentioned 5g relay this is a really important piece of the equation here so what's the approach in that regardless so five g 5g relay is the continuation of our great success with solutions like magic box so we're 5g back relay back haul will allow operators to densify their network with 5g connections there's a long runway still on 4G there's a lot of talk in terms of the the ecosystem coalescing but there's going to be a time frame where operators can start deploying 5g backhaul and with 4G access and start to take advantage of the large ecosystem of 4G devices that can benefit from a large pipe and low latency and improve the overall user experience so the you know we talked about how we transform the network economics of how cells get deployed that's a great application because you're moving boxes into the network via FedEx instead of via truck roll and so you know it's it's integrating the the backhaul solving the zoning the power these are these are the the key concepts that need to be addressed in order for an operator to truly scale and we've done that really well with magic box we have world leaders and strand mounted strand mounted base stations tens of thousands of units deployed last year and compared to traditional outdoor infrastructure that is three to four times faster than anything comparable so it sounds like you give a lot of flexibility to your operator customers with your portfolio yes absolutely so you know we we cover everything from small cell to macro various zoning form factors as I mentioned strand mount we have pole mounted base stations we have flexible gear on where the brand the ran unit is is distributed it can be a split of that distributed and centralized so we are offering the full gambit of a 5g network densification provider well Jamie I know I appreciate you catching us up on what air span is doing to serve the operator needs as they scale out 5g thank you you", "P3oeWmKZ16s": "my name is ELISA Francia I'm the owner of copycat showroom downtown Palm Springs and my husband and I owned the property here and my husband was afflicted with Parkinson's about five years ago he found out that he had it and he was in denial for good two years and medicated himself with alcohol and would laugh about that you know alcohol is the only thing that makes him feel good but after a while you can't drink like that so anyway we had found out about medical marijuana in California we lived in Las Vegas at that time and when I realized that it was legal in the state of California I gave him some unbeknownst to himself and within 45 minutes after eating a pancake with marijuana on it he stopped shaking and I walked over to his ottoman and sat down in front of him and I said how do you feel and he just put his hands out and said look look I'm not shaking and he had a smile on his face he felt great he did not move from that chair for six hours so that was my lightbulb moment I knew that then I was on to something that was going to relieve his pain and suffering because it's horrible to have Parkinson's disease and not have any relief and I feel that this is something that helped so many people in so many ways with pain and suffering and to take some of the medication the expensive pharmaceutical drugs are destroying people's lives not really helping them either they can't afford the pharmaceutical drugs or it's damaging their kidneys or damaging their bodies in some way so I'm behind this cause a hundred percent 110 percent and anything that I can do I will do and I urge anybody that is interested in learning more about the true effects of medical marijuana not what the government wants you to know is to join in on this you can't put people in jail for just trying to find some relief with what ails them so there you haven't land this could have seemed I did see you weren't good have you seen a lot of lately yeah that's cool I mean I like it when you look back in 2012 how would you characterize your year well I mean personally it was a terrific year it was it was kind of like yeah I embarked on some journeys and I and I and I I was optimistic enough to like take on some things that I might not have been used previous getting back on screen yeah that's I mean that's the thing about it about being optimistic enough to to take on some new things and I just I just did the last few years I've done some episodes a good wife and I did then Curb Your Enthusiasm and I'm just seeing a new play I'm gonna have to found a way to make drugs work for me a little bit better and and I just didn't buy but those experiences and I just thought why am I not doing what I do why am I not doing the thing that is giving me the most success in the most pleasure outside of my family was the moment you go on screen in this character and playing a guy with Parkinson's like that's that's a statement in out of itself that's a different reality for for television it's bigger than just a guy and a TV show well yeah but it was cool about that it was cool about the the the the the reaction that people have to that with me whether it's on the show is this character is just essentially a disabled character or handicap carrier having to put it somewhat differently situated yeah that's that's that's that's cool and that's new but for me that that that's the part of the character I don't have to think about I mean that's that's I don't have to I don't have to play that so so it's easy for me you have a real sense of humor about you know Parkinson's in the way you presented publicly the Curb Your Enthusiasm stuff was unbelievable you know oh thanks what the hell did you shake that up on purpose Parkinson's when Larry called me up and I don't know Larry that well I met him a few times what do you called me up and asked me if I'd do it and pitch the concept to me and I said this great because the way they work on that show is they there's an idea there's a there's a series of points you want to get to in the scene but how you get there is up to you yeah it's all ad-lib was all improv and and it was just great for me because I don't get chance to do that much and and and it just worked that great well he did it in the humorous way in the way that Rush Limbaugh really attacked you yeah about that again I don't control how people respond to it so so I just let that go however people react is how they react is how they zone their own thing it's a bad time it's their if they react like if people go how are you you okay that's their fear right you don't have to protect me you don't have to step in for me in and say don't you know what this guy's dealing with you know what just everybody chill yeah and with rush it's different though no rebel rush I mean remember that he's dealing with a really small base he's not dealing this big and that was the part that was mistake the Republicans made was they thought this guy representative their constituency and he doesn't he's a he's a fanatic yeah and he's a showman and he's just he didn't care about me or he didn't care about stem cells he didn't care about Parkinson's he cared about how would he flame up his base and what what he's saying so there think about fighting him is you can't fight him because who you trying to win over and anybody reasonable and responsible gets that you're right yeah so they go in a public arena and fight them if they trying to win over people that already are on your side so you just kind of go oh well yeah let him make noise in his own echo chamber I'll read you a quote this is from you at the Senate appropriation subcommittee hearing this is in DC and 99 if you said in my 40s I can expect challenges most people wouldn't face until their 70s and 80s if ever but with your help if we all do everything we can to eradicate this disease when I'm in my 50s I'll be dancing at my children's weddings yeah I mean I feel that way in the sense that um that I feel that a lot of the things that we're doing the foundation air pay off and I feel like there's there's there's there's stuff that's happening outside of us that's also interesting stuff with with we're feeling away State to live longer to look better my symptoms is moving around as I am right now I mean this is nothing this is I found ways to control of what really gave me a hard time three or four years ago dyskinesia is that were really that rocking if you look at some interviews I did they were really in the political ads I did it would I had a much different situation that I have now which one of the reasons I feel good about going back to work I can sit in a chair and I can have a conversation I couldn't do that five years ago if you think about how much when you were first not when you're first diagnosed but when you first started to take on this this concept of foundation how much how much was Parkinson's in the public space how much was it a part of fun right it wasn't in the public space very much at all because it was it was it was considered a situation that that affected the elderly and didn't affect younger people so when I kind of brought it out there that affected younger people not that that made it any more worthy it just made it it just changed it in people's minds and and so that was a big thing and and when I when I went public with that I had some real misgivings I didn't know whether that something I really wanted to do and then once I did the genie was out of the bottle and and and I had this feeling of kind of desperation like oh my god what did I do and and it was in the post and all the papers and all the the cable news networks and I was there running me in slow motion like it was tragic figure and you know you're in slow motion either dead or under indictment and and and and I really worried about it but I went out of line and I went to some purposes chat rooms and I saw the reaction of people and I first time I realized I was part of a community and I kind of went wow this is it was there was a lady who talked about going to a store and the guy always looked at her funny when she went in the store and then finally this one day she was she was kind of shaking and fumbling with her wallet he said what's the matter with you and she said I had Parkinson's nice no like michael fox' yeah and I went oh wow that's really that's really heavy that's really like a thing you just don't feel alone anymore you don't feel alone anymore and for me I felt a real sense I felt a sense of opportunity you know people want to hear I say what are you doing the foundation there anything close and they want to hear yet we found this pine nut that if you squeeze the oil out is cure well it doesn't work that way so we and we're trying to find that we're very close to a defining a biomarker we've got a big research project going on which is a way to find an indicator a common indicator in all Parkinson's patients that it will tip us off before symptoms are evident because by the time symptoms are evident by the time my pinkie twitched 80% of the dopamine producing cells in my brain were already dead right so if we can find a way early on that we can find a marker then we can then we can identify along the way the progression of the disease and we can treat it earlier and we can get in there earlier and if we can find a drug that halts progression and eliminate symptoms that may not be in it in the pure sense of cure but but it's as good as it cures did you have to change the way you approached being optimistic over the years yeah I mean I'll always just basically optimistic person when I was a kid but I mean it's it's really it's a richer thing now and it's and it's informed by by by the difficult times it's not important by a kind of a sense of a wide open future in front of me and I can't wait to get into it yeah it's more of a pass behind me that it's difficult challenging but has because of that true it has made me optimistic how'd you get there um I just had some more I had some struggles I mean III I was diagnosed and and ramdom I was diagnosed I mean my son was born my father died within a year and so I just when I kind of got wow how badly what my dad was yeah he in relation to the fact that I was about to raise a son I lost him and so that was really the true me off and then I was diagnosed very shortly after and and then I realized that my diagnosis that one of the ways I was self treating it by drinking warm and so I realize I had to not do that anymore and that was a challenge and and all that stuff and I mean that put pressure on my marriage and all that stuff was just to come through that and to compute that with it stronger marriage than ever in a sobriety that was really lasting and an understanding of how much I love my dad and how important he was to me in his absence which is unfortunate but but real strong appreciation for him and in a new respect for him and again my marriage it strengthened my merits because I realized she wasn't going anywhere when was diagnosed and that's your first fear yeah for sure am I gonna become a burden on my family and am I get and the fact that you want to have more children and now I have I have three more kids after that after my diagnosis and and they're great and I wouldn't I can't imagine one for that family you know as we go through the the new year 2013 now what do you what are you looking forward to is there a moment that you're hanging on well there's a couple things I mean like I said my my daughters are gonna start thinking a finished job high school next it's June and then going to going to college and that's an amazing thing that's I mean there's a like I said we were babies it went when I when I started out on this journey and and um and I'm gonna start the show and and and do this new show and that's gonna be big you know this every year is it is cool it's an opportunity it's amazing before we wrap up a rapid-fire anthropology questions your way what is one food that's your favorite gross food why Roberts gross but I like circus peanuts this was was kind of fake corn no base the marshmallow we like five of them in they become a rock that you think you'll never pass you hope you never pass what's the weirdest thing if I never said to you Michael Keaton I love you yeah hoody is somebody that you have to make peace with I don't have to make peace with I have to make peace with with I think with I have to understand people that have fear and ignorance I mean just generally not I'm not a person but but just people that that that whose first instinct is to is to is to find fault them to enter in to cast blame and and I just have to realize that that's fear and in and wherever I come across it at first the temptation to say to write them off but but instead to kind of say how can i how can I just work around that and hopefully bring them along so great to see it's great to see you man your Twitter if you want to join Team Fox and I recommend you do we've got it on our website go to strombel comm for all the details there stick around we'll be right back hello my name is Mike Paulus and the purpose of this video is to make viewers aware of Taylor French's condition with Parkinson's disease and what can happen when this condition changes dramatically with the intake of a nutritional extract in the first portion of this video his caretaker Janet assists him into the car this process can take as long as five minutes he has limited use of his legs and arms therefore making him totally dependent on Janet to get in and out of the car go to the bathroom go to bed eat and so on under normal circumstances it is also very difficult for him to speak when Taylor was living with me 18 months ago he was able to drive he was able to walk around take care of himself so you can see that the Parkinson's has certainly deteriorated its body in his system something else is is that you can see in a response to a question that I give him it takes a while for him to really sort of gather his senses and it may take up to two minutes to respond [Music] yes seeing is believing this is the same tailor that we've all seen in the wheelchair every day every week the difference is for the last 10 days Taylor has been taking a therapeutic dose of a vegetable extract and after 15 minutes since his last dose Taylor is standing walking moving on his own on this particular occasion it is for 45 minutes but if he is on this for an extended period of time he will regain his abilities through the miraculous nature of its neurogenic properties we've created this video to show how important this treatment is for a Parkinson's patient to actually give them back a normal life as you can see in this case it certainly is making a big change never say never speak with your mouth full obviously the extract has also increased his sense of humor and/or I see restored his sense of humor is never lost for most of us raising our arms is no big deal for Taylor it requires a lot of help on this day he effort Lee brings him up twittering his fingers in the air could you imagine how much difference this could make if he has his capability for 24 hours every day not just for once in nine months for 45 minutes so after Janet asked Taylor hey Taylor do you want to go for a walk he turns around heads towards the front of the house and this part is a miracle as he confidently ambles towards the gate usually he can run in a forward falling position but not walk he also needs someone to catch him at his destination not this time [Music] hereafter eyeballing his Buick and being determined a bit of a ham when a camera is going Taylor now decides he's man enough to drive the car especially after being fed by Janet can he do this remember he's not walked on his own or driven in months confidence is now getting the best of him and he will try sure enough under zone power he makes all the moves that are easy for the rest of us but impossible for him [Music] as you can see when we say under your own power that means a lot for someone to make all the moves of getting into a car themselves starting it up positioning the steering wheel closing the door rolling up the window all these requires a lot of concentration and effort for someone who normally needs to be helped into a car incredible miracle [Music] pulling it out we're hoping at the paying attention here and not crashing into anything but you can see totally in control [Music] unbelievable there he goes and we suspect he'll return you", "6qeWIbkwOuY": "welcome to episode 43 of the gt on 5g it's the latest insight scoop on everything 5g we cover six topics in about 15 minutes and it's brought to you by more insights and strategy i'm will townsend and joining me again this week is fellow analyst angel sag so let's get started with my first topic today i participated in a nokia capital markets day it started at 7 am my time so i needed lots of coffee but um but it was great to tune in their ceo spoke to a number of things and they had the heads of each of their business units speak to a number of topics as well you know from my perspective i thought uh pekka their ceo did a great job in articulating their strengths and fixed wireless access optical private wireless and open ran i also liked what he focused on with respect to aligning customer and partner to focus on best of breed solutions versus end to end so historically nokia's focused on soup to nuts and honestly that's not the way a lot of operators purchase infrastructure they typically leverage multiple vendors and suppliers for not only continuity of supply but also from a cost perspective so i think this is a you know it's it's a it's a divergent strategy for them but under his leadership i think it's the right thing to do and then you know finally i like the way that he summarized his strategic plan which was reset accelerate and scale and you know it's it's no secret that the company did announce a pretty major reduction in force um i was contacted by matt kemko from sdx central this week uh to get my insight on that and really um it's it's it's just a natural progression given where the company needs to retrench and invest in things that they're very strong in such as private networking and openran so and there was also an announcement that came out today between 18 t and nokia on c cban so i thought i might toss it to you angela you take our listeners and viewers through that yeah so nokia signed a deal with att it's a five-year deal for nokia to supply supply equipment to att specifically for fi for the use in the c-band spectrum um and it will be used utilizing nokia's massive mimo antenna solutions their macro remote radio heads and their next generation air scale baseband equipment so it's a good deal for nokia because i think they've needed to get big wins like this so i think for att it's going to be going up be a big opportunity to scale out its c-band network and it's banned and i think they're not going to be the only ones i have a feeling we're going to see a lot more c-band deployments using nokia so we'll see we'll see what happens in the long term but things may start to change for nokia when it comes to the big big three in the us yeah no i agree and um what's the timing on on att's deployment there i believe the first phase will start happening in the latter part part of 2021 okay as the spectrum becomes available i believe at t got 40 megahertz out of the 100 that was a in the a block uh and ryzen got the 60 hertz of that so 18t we'll start rolling out 40 megahertz at the end of this year so they do have a reason to be announcing this deal now in anticipation of a spectrum being available at the end of the year yeah no i agree um well att is off to the races there so let's move to your first topic this week and you want to talk about some new uh mid-price point um samsung phones yeah so this week samsung had uh yet another unboxed event this event was much more targeted on the mid-range and low end of its devices as opposed to the s-series flagship phones so everyone's familiar with the you know the s21 the note 20 those top-end you know fairly expensive phones but they also have very popular mid-range which is the mid-range device a series uh they've actually came out with these a series devices last year and kind of really built on a very comprehensive 5g offering this year they're kind of refreshing those a series devices with the new a52 and new a72 but they're also introducing the a525g which is a very affordable about 400 5g phone with you know triple cameras and all the normal expected high tier device capabilities and it's using uh qualcomm snapdragon processors rather than uh no than using this samsung exynos chip so it's an interesting um announcement and i think it'll help samsung grow in the mid tier which is where a lot of its competitors have been succeeding yeah and obviously these are 5g enabled phones and this is just a proof point to something that we've talked about quite often on our podcast that um qualcomm is developing a whole line of chipsets and modems that are going to support that entry level that mid-range and that high-end range right yeah and also what's interesting is not all of these phones are 5g so the regular a52 is 4d and the regular a72 is 4g so not all these devices are 5g however they do have the potential to have 5g models down the road which i believe they will and they have all the specs and features you would expect from a top-end phone it's just they don't have the top-end soc they don't have and they don't all have have 5g interesting cool well let's move to my second topic this week i want to talk about airspan networks um they have a pretty interesting history so they've been around for about 20 years they were focused on that wimax standard if you recall that anshul and um when that you know when the basically the room cleared on on wimax they pivoted to developing lte um small cell solutions and the rest is history and um and so this week there were a couple of announcements one um yeah i don't know if you follow the stock market and these special acquisition um special purpose acquisition specs right so um there's a spac um ironically uh with the initials mba it's not not professional basketball it's new beginnings acquisition corporation and so the news uh was around the fact that spack and airspan are going to merge and they're going to create a new ticker symbol for the combined company called mimo kind of like that pretty clever and what it's going to do it's going to allow the the new entity to tap into almost 170 million dollars in funding so that they can develop um you know 5g solutions i mean airspan has been again very focused on small cell they partnered with sprint to develop their magic box before the t-mobile merger airspan also acquired mimosa networks that provide six wireless access solutions for wisps and the company also has a line of cbrs certified solutions as well to support private networking so from my perspective this provides you know equity to the company they don't have to go through a traditional ipo process which is one of the benefits of a spac and it again it gives them this revenue that they can invest in 5g so i think that puts a lot of momentum you know behind the company they're already well positioned you know the other announcement this week was an announcement around openran with rakitan surprise and and so airspan is going to supply um basically virtualized hardware software and blueprint infrastructure blueprints to help extend the capabilities of rakhitan's um open rand deployment and so you know from my perspective the company has lots of different you know opportunities to really go expand into and uh i think airspan is a company you want to keep your eyes on any thoughts no i think it's interesting i i think mimo is an interesting ticker for them yeah and i'm going you know public vs back and merging with another entity makes sense uh we'll see if it's kind of the trend right now but uh yeah i i don't really have that much to add on this topic specifically all right cool well let's move to your second topic this week and you want to talk about huawei and 5g royalties yes so earlier this week huawei had an ipr event where they kind of said that they are going to start charging a lot of device makers for the most part uh royalties on their uh their patents uh similar to what ericsson and nokia and qualcomm already do and it makes sense in the sense that huawei is one of the leading companies in the world when it comes to developing new 5g technologies and it makes total sense that they would have a lot of patents in their portfolio related to 5g devices because they want are developing both the network and the devices and there's probably a lot of things in there that they are they're the creators of uh so i think that them going after these 3 000 5g patents that they have and whatever the number is for the standard essential patents which are called seps once they start asking for licensing fees i have a feeling they're going to be some lawsuits involved because that's just normal how it happens um and some negotiations that will occur so we probably won't hear of huawei's intent to sue any of its non-paying royalty holders until you know let's say next year once they've already had some you know negotiations in place and whatever negotiations have fallen apart you know i've seen a lot of these patent you know negotiations and disputes in the past so we'll see what happens in terms of who decides to who decides the license and who decides not to and who you know wants to fight huawei but always said that they were gonna put a two point two point two dollar fifty cent cap on the licensing fees that they're going to charge for these patents so they're not going to be very expensive and i expect that this may potentially raise the price of devices somewhat because no one's been paying these yet uh but i think it will be interesting to see how device makers approach this yeah well you know i you know i can't fault wildlife for doing this um they invest an incredible amount of their annual revenue back in r d i think over the last their last fiscal year it was close to 20 billion us dollars and you know on a base of 100 billion in gross revenue so they're certainly up there you know with the biggest technology companies in the world and yeah and like you mentioned they're one of the most prolific patent filers not that patent counting is any indication of innovation from my perspective but you're right they contribute quite a bit to 5g they contribute quite a bit in the open source community as well some might argue the depth of that but um certainly you know it's it's no surprise to to see this news coming and to your point it'll be interesting to see how this really sort of affects the bill of materials moving forward but we'll keep an eye on it and we'll report back as things develop but let's move to my third topic and for the week and i want to talk about um a low and mid-band spectrum auction that occurred in the united kingdom so uh and it was interesting the amount of money that was raised 1.4 billion pounds now i know translated to dollars um that gets you into the the three billion you know dollar range but i i was struck thinking that you know we just exited the c band auction that raised 82 plus billion um maybe the uk is being a lot more practical and not trying to fill the government coffers what do you think um i think that they probably have a better relationship with the operators and they've probably had a discussion about what's fair and i think that they have probably had this discussion where the operators said you can charge us what you want but if you charge us too much we won't be able to roll out 5g fast enough so i think i think they had a much more agreeable stance in terms of this auction that said it seems like there was only 200 megahertz of um spectrum being auctioned is that right it was about 200 i believe so yeah yeah so there wasn't that much spectrum being auctioned off uh especially since some of it was in the 3.6 gigahertz band um but in general it seemed like uh it was a lot of low band and mid band which is going to be necessary for good 5g coverage yeah um i i just think that a lot of these operators have spectrum and they want to obviously fill whatever gaps they have and they all kind of just agreed probably that they're not going to run up an 81 billion dollar bill make it crazy yeah now there's also news this week you and i were talking before we got started today on um some mid-band assets that are tied to the global harmonization standard right so you want to give us an overview of that yeah so in october the fcc is expected to roll out another spectrum auction they just completed one and we're going to have another one in october and that one in october is going to be targeted at the 3.45 to 3.55 and of spectrum which is a big deal because that is essentially in the 3.5 gigahertz harmonized global 5g band so we can hopefully have devices in the world that will be able to work globally at 3.5 gigahertz everywhere in the world obviously there's not going to be the same amount of spectrum in every place you're not going to have you know necessarily the same speeds everywhere but the idea of having 3.5 gigahertz as a globally harmonized 5g band is a big deal because it just allows people to travel around the world and have have their devices work on other networks without needing to have every band in the universe supported yeah no i agree you know it's you know it's it's going to make you know that that experience that running experience that much better especially for folks like you and i that once we put code hopefully in the rearview mirror by mid-year we'll be back on flights to europe and asia and all over the place so cool um so let's roll to your third topic this week and i know you've been doing a lot of writing on forbes and you've published two in a series of the state of 5g so would love to hear you know some highlights from from those first two articles you've written on forbes yeah so it's a very long article there's literally no way i'm going to be able to summarize it but but i will say the highlights it originally started as a six thousand word article and it became two three thousand word articles yeah basically part one which was already published last week covers the state of 5g networks modems and rf and then part 2 which published this week covers devices standards and what to expect in 2021 and beyond so i kind of cover mostly a u.s centric view um but there is a little bit of global views on that no one person can can fully comprehend the entire global 5g um landscape it's just not happening um so especially not in a one two parter um so the way i look at it is i kind of look at where we are today what that means for devices what kind of what is the state of standards and you know what is the six-month delay going to mean for the industry um and what are the operators plans for rolling out spectrum and devices and what to expect and i kind of have really gone in and found the most up-to-date information from every operator every device maker all the latest devices the samsung a series did not make it the announcement was after publication couldn't squeeze it but you have it here go check it out it's on forbes it's a two-parter um and i highly recommend you read it it's it's a good one i spent quite a lot of time on it so i hope you guys enjoy it yeah yeah i i scanned through it it was you know quite comprehensive it's a great job um you know and for our listeners and viewers it's quite easy if you just google um forbes more insights and strategy you'll find our landing page you'll find um a lot of things that i've written on 5g as well as these two articles that angela is speaking to as well so hey buddy another great podcast why don't you take us home absolutely we hope our viewers and

you think they sell high-end clothes and high-dose cannabis sunday school is their boutique fashion smokeware brand based in new york smokeware as in high fashion apparel and accessories to wear when you're smoking weed sunday flower is their cannabis brand that sells cannabis flowers without harmful chemicals her and her best friend since elementary school started out in south korea then both immigrated to the u.s where they discovered marijuana at boarding school creating their longtime love affair with cannabis into a career with a collection of clothing which has been featured at new york fashion week barney's and even recognition from celebrities like john legend and lil nas x their cannabis flower sells at some of the biggest california dispensaries including ease and apticarium and sells the slowest burning but slimmish joint please welcome my very special guest mia park yay thank you so much for the introduction phil i'm so excited to be on the platform and just chatting with you about anything that we're both particularly interested in very excited to have you here it's my honor welcome to the show uh before we get started and dive into things where were you when you found out you made the ford's list um i was actually at a cafe and it was raining in new york um you know those this like blizzard type of rain um and it was really cold with a friend of mine having actually breakfast because i actually do really love meeting people for breakfast right before work and i um read the news or my i think my co-founder they actually sent the newsletter to me because i'm type of person who gets way too nervous so i try to actually like wipe it out from my brain and when i heard the news i was with my friends um at like 8 a.m so that was really really exciting um i remember calling my parents finally telling them um like how excited this was they must have been very proud of you because it was just legalized in in south korea right they did legalize the medical but um it's so still demonized as well as you know the government regulation on any sort of cannabis possession and they even wrote it like i've read this pretty intensely because you know i was just interested on the legality side of cannabis in korea and essentially even the thought of consuming or doing a business in korea could potentially throw you into jail so they're really really harsh um where they draw the line um for especially weed and but i do think it's a small victory that we are trying to legalize cbd as well as hemp so um yeah yeah definitely exciting moment one step closer yeah exactly well that it's great that you're also you're based in new york but you're also a pretty well known in the california area as well that's where you sell most of your cannabis correct that's right 100 of our cannabis um is being sold in california um we are special because as a fashion brand we did start out here in new york and it was really grass root like we were just making things for our friends essentially who wanted to get high and put their joints on their cab so one of our signature like caps have basically a joint pocket on the side and like all our t-shirts and hoodies come with those like hidden very like stealthy joints pockets um so that's why we definitely feel very grounded in new york but um obviously the second phase where which made sunday school what it is right now started 100 in california so we feel also very local in california and honestly really really blessed to have connected with amazing partner especially in the cannabis side um i don't think we could have started with so much success um if it weren't the mentors in california like just guiding us every step of the way i love that you created into a lifestyle brand too where you incorporate the weed smoking culture into the clothing so it's not an afterthought it's like well i could just hold it right here on my on my sleeve or i could have a pocket on my hat for the joint for example and i love that you launched on 420 how perfect is that exactly i mean i think the there's we i hear the word lifestyle so often but at the end of the day we just wanted to create a brand or just like you know something that parallels the lifestyle of a lot of our friends and us which is that we smoke weed but we're also excellent students excellent chefs excellent i don't know employees so that being said we call them class of honor rollers we like being funny with we jokes like if we weren't being funny would we jokes what like why are we doing this so um yeah we call them on a rollers or rather you know like um like responsible smokers so um these functional stoners really do make up a lot of our community as well as you know a lot of social initiatives that we also try to take on it changes the dogmatic narrative that you are just this lazy pot smoking you know couch surfing individual no you can actually be very successful and smart and also enjoy cannabis and it seems like that's becoming more and more popular so congrats on disrupting the narrative take us back to the very beginning mia where you're from where you grew up in the path that ultimately led you to where you are now making it to the forbes list absolutely i mean i grew up in seoul korea until for the entirety of my life until middle school and you know i came here to america to a boarding school for the hopes of higher education i i must say my parents sent me i didn't really have too much of a choice but they didn't know what type of higher education i was i'd be getting at this point um but let that alone um and i love that you require a 4.2 gpa or higher exactly absolutely that was what i was getting at my boarding school um so i was definitely a very a model student until obviously um for one thing one thanksgiving a friend of mine invited me and another like four other international students to her house and essentially like i smoked my first joint at a friend's house during thanksgiving during like during my junior year and i was just giggly and just having so much fun um and was so mesmerized by the whole communal aspect of smoking as well um it kind of creates your clan like who i smoke with and that was my first experience so it was pretty like it was very like smooth and just like you know like very um pleasant um so we come back from thanksgiving um snuck a small small joint back to our really strict dorm room and essentially in like maybe within like a week or two where we pulled it out and said hey maybe we should smoke this joint at a dorm um little did we know we were such noobs um we have heard our like other you know students in the dorm room like basically smoking but obviously they're smoking with like huge vaporizers doing their like the extra stuff to like let this stuff like smoke and the smell out but then we were just like five girls like we didn't know anything so we actually got caught smoking weed like literally five seconds after we did it and we basically got kicked out and this was my junior year which um for my korean parents is the most essential like it's the most critical year of your entire life um to get into a good college and getting kicked out from that like very prestigious but also like one strike policy dorm like boarding school was it just it was a little bit traumatic and um but one funny story that came out of it was that all five of us were just like so the dorm parents knocked on our door door and were smoking and like we had a half-burned roach in in our hands so we're like what do we do with the roach and i've watched way too many csi at that point so i was like i'm gonna get rid of the evidence so i actually ended up swallowing the joints um so the dorm parent never found the joint however like it took some time honestly for me to reacquaint myself with the whole world of cannabis because after that experience um whether i've known it or not i think i was a little bit traumatized um especially not that you know like i definitely got back on track you know in terms of the education itself but i think with a lot of people who might um echo this like if you've had any sort of bad trip or bad experience getting too high or getting too thirsty like for with smoking cannabis like you may try to stay away from it and that's what we try to you know in terms of the product rnd portion we have these mini mini joints that are basically meticulously rolled to get you that perfect pleasant high without making you feel paranoid um and it did come a long way for us to make those joints um as well as this new special product that we will be launching early next year within the cannabis space um all of that consideration like of my experience as well as my co-founders experience melts into like the narratives as well as the product themselves and i think what speaks to a lot of our customers is just that oh this is a product that i exactly needed to support you know a certain lifestyle or just fits right into my daily rhythm so we're always so happy on both clothing side and also the cannabis side whenever we hear the feedback that hey this is the product i've been looking for in the market um i think that's a way for us to really bring innovation as like a little tiny fabric of this huge two industries i love that you take a scientific educated approach to breaking down cannabis and how you're gonna best serve your consumers because i'm sure there's a lot of people out there that maybe have wanted to try it and had their a bad first experience and so they shy away from it now because maybe they did have a bad you know high or they got too high and they got paranoid and like oh this isn't for me but once you study it scientifically enough and you've worked with it experimented with it enough you now know what is the proper dosage what is the type of flower that maybe works best for your biochemistry than somebody else which is the reason i i'm so glad johns hopkins is now the first academic institution studying psychedelics on a large academic scientific scale it's so important because now we're going to know the things that we didn't know before it's not going to be like some guy on the couch trying to figure this out it's going to be taking a very methodical approach to saying hey this is the experience you want here's the micrograms of the dosage that you should take and this is the type of drug that maybe you should consume to give you that experience rather than playing a guessing game which i know my first experience with marijuana was the same it was a guessing game you don't really know what you don't know and you have like your buddy or your older brother telling you what's right or wrong and they're just saying it with conviction as if they know and they have no idea yeah absolutely i mean the whole psychedelic area i mean honestly this podcast today is so interesting because we're just talking about drugs at the end of the day um but the psychedelic area is so interesting absolutely and i think um for both cannabis and psychedelics one it's natural like it's nothing synthetic and two um and on top of all those medical and you know health benefits i think there's definitely benefit mentally and psychologically that it it um because i've i've also seen a lot of or read a lot of studies about psychedelics particularly that it enables somebody with deep depression to break away from it um which that they were never able to do with synthetic drugs or like you know only psychotherapy so it's it's really interesting and i think for weed as well although it's a little bit um more research but obviously there's much more like a longer way to go um i do really believe in the power of it enabling our creativity and that's really how um they and i started um sunday school because we're both um like basically we were working at big corporations we were consultants um and had no background of design so we would smoke weed on the weekend just to sketch things out and that's really where we were able to draw this interesting intersection between korean heritage as well as cannabis i'm sure you'll see but our clothing always incorporates some sort of korean or asian inspiration behind and i think it's very critical for a brand to continue to be authentic um by drawing you know our personal experience and just melting it down authentically and it really does speak to our you know audience as well as our you know like fans yeah you're incorporating a little piece of your own authenticity and and um your your family so your family speaking of your family you went from you know getting kicked out of boarding school which i'm sure they weren't too happy about so you turned your pain though into a gift that you're now serving others with so when you started to become successful how did your family feel about that because i'm sure that blew their minds so the funny story the reason why forbes 30 under 30 was special for me was because that was the only way i could actually come out of my like i've never told them about sunday school for two years um and they thought i was still working at the consulting agency so i actually presented them the forbes 30 under 30 article first and like hey like this is what i've been doing um so for them you know they still live in korea um it's hard to break from the you know such rampant media like attacks on cannabis as well as obviously just like the whole society's like mold about like cannabis and deeming it to be the devil's lettuce um however they are i mean parents are gonna be always parents so they're really excited and they're just like big fans of sunday school at this point um they can't really try out our california products but they really love the fashion portion and tried to rap us as much as they could without flagging the government essentially if you can uh please your korean parents i'm sure you're going to be able to please and and persuade anybody else that this is a good thing mia what do you think was the single most important personal attribute that you got to where you are today the thing that's been emphasizing a lot lately to me is really simple knowing what you like and it's a tough sentence if i were to ask somebody um you know it can be as simple as what which restaurant do you want to go tonight um and a lot of times i think we are lost in either analysis paralysis which we call to be oh i'm thinking way too like too complicated for certain choices and not being able to make a decision or um actually not knowing what you want to do or actually not knowing what you like and i think being true and just like giving a lot of thoughts about what do i like because that's also like part of a lot of the design process um and which is where i'm drawing this experience from like at the end of the day like there's like million ways that we can interpret a theme um to put it into the garment and come up with a design but it's the only north star or the only thing that guides you through that process is trusting yourself on what you like and what you don't like um so also navigating through the emotions in life and obviously we're still really young in our career is just listening to my own inner instinct hey do i like this choice do i not like this like the whole word like is little fake and i'm simplifying things but it's essentially like whether i think this is a good decision or not in a very simple form um so i think that uh the force of knowing what you like um is something that i continue to ask myself hey i need to you know hone my skill almost to know what i like and what i don't like to continue to like you know chase that north star um or it does gets you know i don't want to be looking back you know after 10 years or even two years of doing something and realize oh i never liked my experience i never like liked this product that i created so i think that conviction almost um it's something that would propel a lot of people um moving forward without feeling exhausted um and feeling continuously motivated i love that and then flipping on the flip side what do you think knowing what you know now what is the biggest lesson you learned during your journey that maybe you had wish you had learned from sooner every time when we make either even business relationship or personal relationship do the business based on the person obviously i think we're all smart enough that you know like say a company comes up with a proposal to manufacture your goods and like we're all gonna do due diligence on certain things about the company but at the end of the day it's really the person who runs it or a group of team who you know spearheads the project and what i've learned is that of course like you know we have this like a list of diligence that every time we try to start something new or go in about like like create a new set of joints um then we would always you know look into the companies itself but what i learned for a sustainable entrepreneurship or business is that you always have to actually do diligent the person who's very spearheading the like you know the operation and you know making sure that this person is going to be my sustainable partner so that being said like you can tell that i've been burned by certain companies who came across like with a lot of great check marks um but ultimately it wasn't the right person that to do business with and i wish i had known this earlier because um i think i would and we are now like putting a lot of emphasis on like meeting the right people um not just like you know the companies or the service that offers um and i think in that way we could actually minimize a lot of the mistakes that we had um made in the beginning of the journey of this entrepreneurship so like you're saying when you go to partner with a company make sure you know the who the people are what they stand for behind that company not just the brand exactly exactly and you are doing something similar where you try to uphold strong values can you tell us a little bit about more about your values and what you do with your farmers and etc yeah absolutely um i mean as uh for who we are like we're a minority brand uh we are immigrants um we are somewhat you know like we're all part of those um so that being said on the fashion side we actually make everything in korea so that we could you know somehow contribute to the economy and also take advantage of amazing like korean like factories as well as like sewing expertise um so that's one part of the business on the other side of the cannabis business we partner with every single step of the way of you know sourcing and manufacturing we partner with um you know fully equity as well as minority uh manufacturers distributors as well as like flower farms so that has been something actually very recent that we were able to implement the entire supply chain to be like that and we're really really proud of for instance our manufacturer sf roots um sphere headed by morris kelly is actually one of the very first bay area equity brand so equity brand in northern california means that um you know it's a uh for people who've been disenfranchised and unjustly um you know marginalized because of cannabis the city or the municipality grants those particular people much easier licensing deal or certain benefits if you were to start a cannabis company so sf roots is actually the first or definitely one of the first equity brand in san francisco and i mean they will also really think joints would hatch but that being said they partnering up with them honestly gives us a whole new angle because even just having conversation with morris gives me many ideas like you know how this industry in cannabis although it's new and you know there are a lot of innovative moments um could honestly improve in its diversity and for us like it's it's a different narrative of how we've been disenfranchised as asian american versus like black americans latin americans um so just also hearing those different shades of you know you know experiences within cannabis is so important for us so we also don't lose the grasp of reality and just think that we are the minor like you know marginalized population and yeah there is so much we could do within cannabis to increase diversity we need to just legalize it across the country and and pretty much get everybody out i'll be the first in life to vote hopefully soon um thinking about your hustle and getting to where you are now what's something scrappy you did in the beginning stages to start the company that maybe you couldn't have revealed in the very beginning when you were first starting out but you're willing to share now i mean we're scrappy still so and we are not afraid to tell you that we're scrappy to get a better deal and that's the truth to be honest we're still a team of you know like less than 10 people full-time i mean we do work with a lot of freelancers but at the same time i don't think it's about the volume or having a nice office but it's about just creating something i rather create i rather spend more money on the cotton quality than you know having a nice like water cooler in the office so a few stories i mean i can tell you many many stories how we've been always scrappy but the very first time we um started selling our like caps and um like our signature joint pocket holder hoodies um one of the big breakthrough really came when we got a call from barney's um rip but that was uh three four years ago when we actually had just started as like a side like you know side passion project and actually this girl reached out to us and like hey like i'm really i really like your concepts can you come like show your clothing to us so we were and it was not thinking back it's it's like you know like showing them and like having a clinic um but we had no idea back then so essentially we like wrapped in our like you know those like immigrants immigrants like big like check-in luggage so in those we dumped every clothes like didn't even separate for each collection or season dumped every single thing that we made until then like maybe like 20 pieces literally took the subway in new york with that luggage like took it to that fancy like fifth avenue barney's meeting didn't even bring our own hangers we didn't know that we had to bring our own hangers and the clothings were all wrinkled um so we were like starting to hang up the clothes and the buyers would be asking so like what season or like what's the theme of this um you know like your current drop and we have no idea we're just like oh we're just a korean smoker and fortunately i think the honesty actually got us into barney so they were almost the first um you know like luxury stock is that we were able to on board with but um that being said you know getting the call from like instagram dm taking the subway with the big luggage it's just like like it's a definitely memorable moment for us scrappy hustle we landed barney's from my instagram vm definitely that's awesome what's your most popular product that you sell um our honestly our t-shirts with the side sleeve joint pocket has been obviously the most popular within the fashion side um anything that also really has distinctive korean design so we had launched as like a limited kind of pre-order only um which means it's like actually korean temple um pattern on in like on the ceiling of the temples that means like infinity as well as well being all over the fleece and that really sold very well so anything that has like that authenticity um with a little bit of you know tons of weed um i think it sells really well in the fashion obviously on our cannabis side our mini joints that are like you said the slowest burning but the slim is in the market itself cleaned um you know they sell really well because it's it's something that they and i have spent so many time you know making it perfect and we're we're continuously always on the run to making it better and better so on that stands are you know sativa variety we call it eureka tiny but mighty joints so those sell really well across all our stock is in california i love it thanks for sharing and i know the audience is going to love to check those out we're going to transition now into something i like to call the under 30 seconds round another there's a pun for you uh are you ready i'm still ready okay mia what is the book you've gifted more often than any other book and why oh god it's called knife or nightball it's a very depressive but comical suicidal books um and it actually gets you to think very optimistically about life that was a really weird answer but um yeah it's it's it's a satirically comical book that i like gifting to my friends to look optimistically about life thinking the ways that you can kill yourself but yeah what's one of the best investments and one of the worst investments you've ever made and why um my best investment i say my sister i definitely wiped her you know like like clean cleaned and bathed her and now she's an amazing person to be and i know that i will have her lifelong support um the worst investment is uh probably a true uh a birds of paradise tree that i basically um couldn't water for three months and died pretty recently so never buy expensive trees that you can't really take care of i think there's a lot of people that could empathize with buying plants that didn't end up working out what is the most impactful thing you do in your morning routine and the most impactful thing you do in your evening routine um morning routine actually uh we have this with day we start with our like tea ceremony so we drink green tea every morning which really helps clarify your goals of the day as well as you know subduing the noise um nightly routine i must say smoking joints i don't do it every night but um on friday nights smoking that like indica join is so amazing just you know wrapping up the whole week um very smoothly do you have a particular place or ritual you have when it comes to your smoking habits i love smoking at my house because i think you just have to be in a you know you know like in the the right surrounding so um i love having people over and like you know smoking together um and that's always been my go-to when it's like dinner party or whatnot like we start with a smoking ceremony and then we go into like eating food love it pretend you won the peter thiel fellowship and you're gonna get money to start a business instead of go to school what's the very first thing you do to start your new business um i would give calls to my mentors um like i said finding the right people is always the most important thing whether i need to start a team or finding a manufacturer or whatever it is my mentors i know for sure would give me the right advice to start anything great one and last question what's something you never knew you needed a google calendar honestly i've used it before before the sunday school and it's inseparable part of my life um so definitely yes i think a lot of people would agree with that as well mia thank you so much for being here today what's next for you what's the next big goal milestone or bucket list item you want to achieve um there are definitely several but i think the one and foremost that we've been pushing for the last two months is the whole equity portion on the canvas side um i think having that transition into like a full supply chain of you know minority and equity partners um now we really want to give it a voice um by having more like more vocalizing a little bit better about like the fact that you know this is what we stand for on the cannabis side as well um i think on the fashion side we've been doing really well um with that message um overall we believe that the cannabis industry could use a little bit more diversity in colors so that would be one of the biggest goal for 2021 and you have a new holiday korean jesus collection that you wanted to share and an asian flavored inspired cannabis gummies you're right um our holiday collection which is coming up in two weeks um is again drawn by um our asian korean experience so we're actually reinterpreting all the biblical like stories about like adam and eve uh virgin mary and drawing into actually traditional korean characters so that's gonna be really beautiful um and in about two months by lunar new year next year we have a couple of really exciting asian flavored infused gummies that we're launching in california so just to preview with you guys we've never said anything to anybody but it'll be use the white tea lychee dragon fruit um you know like matcha coconut milk so everything that we love like that and that we grew up so i think it's gonna be an amazing lunar new year with us sneak preview audience don't tell anyone shh and mia where do listeners go to connect with you directly

terrorist may seem cool and composed on the outside his involuntary response will give him away in addition live friendly soldiers can be found in dangerous areas without risking personnel for recon our system works by generating low-energy millimeter waves they are able to penetrate through many common materials including clothing and masonry and efficiently reflect off optically rough surfaces and yet they provide a high degree of sensitivity to minut displacements as the wave reflects from the target its phase is shifted proportionally to the movement of the target the phase can be extracted and the displacement of the target can be demodulated when the system is aimed of a human's chest we can see the chest movement there are components of chest motion due to heartbeats breathing and gross movement using signal processing we eliminate noise and motions due to gross movement and analyze only those due to heartbeats and breathing since the antenna has to be well aimed at the subjects chest we employ cameras to identify and track the subject and a pan-tilt base to move the whole assembly for constant aiming a color camera locks onto the subjects face learns a hue histogram of the face and performs mean shift tracking at the same time a depth camera segments the image based on the depth of the target so that only pixels at the right depth are considered for processing the millimeter wave system itself can be seen here first and most importantly is the millimeter wave sensor and antenna assembly which is what gathers the in-phase and quadrature components of the signal and returns it to the computer for processing this unique low-power all solid-state millimeter wave sensor itself can be battery-operated then there are the cameras which perform the real-time detection and tracking of a human subject and returned the data to the pan and tilt base which is what moves the entire assembly and follows the subject as he moves around and maintains the aim at his in the following demonstration the screen is split into three parts in the top left is the system assembly which shall be moving to follow the subject in the top right is the subject as seen by the color tracking camera where the Oval entrechteten scale of his head and the purple circle is the location the antenna is aiming in the bottom half is the measure of displacement as it is being calculated by the computer in real time the red circles represent calculated heartbeats also on the graph are the locations of heartbeats obtained from an ECG that was gathered simultaneously shown in green this is a ground truth used for verification and was not used at all in the algorithm the sensor starts off aimed at the subjects chest while he is seated the subject holds his breath for a while in order to demonstrate that individual heartbeats are visible as the subject stands up the system follows his movement and maintains good aim now the subject demonstrates the fidelity of the system during lateral motion here the subject demonstrates the accuracy of the system during large gross movement the subjects backward movement is larger than that due to heartbeat and respiration as is evidenced by the scale of displacement on the bottom of the screen even with such large movements the system continues to process the data with good accuracy the system works on various body types such as males and females with larger and smaller frames and Bill's although our system is currently intended for homeland at national security applications this novel technology

"GaehhHBPc1s": "[Music] you [Music] I would like to introduce our next speaker Joe has from H come he will be presenting on 5g QuickStart okay guys that's a real gold you just heard it from Ned head to bid Bell head in 20 minutes I've been working on this stuff since I first bought the guide to the telephone network back in 1973 so it's taken me a little more than 20 minutes but hopefully we'll get at least can clear some of the confusion we want to cover the most overhyped protocol in history as a near as I can tell I know you all have your favourite candidates for that but I think this one takes the cake and our goal here is to give you enough knowledge to be believable so you have the basics of answering any question somebody says like about 5g and you also know where to look for for the hard answers and the hard questions because some of the answers are buried pretty deep even today the new internet explosion we got into this of the two of us are consultants we identified a trend about 18 months ago that that the internet was just going to explode 400 gigabit links are coming out I'm sure a bunch of them already been rolled out we'll hear about it and presentations the five T rollout is just not going to be stopped it can coexist with other networks and you can make a lot of money by quote replanting your old 3G networks of 5g this thing is going gangbusters also there's another major expansion and unlicensed radio that nobody ever hears about because 5 G's steals all the show sig Fox is planning to sell dollar trackers and they have a billion customers and some of you are already working on selling lower on know that from talking to you and just in from the last session there were a lot of talks on vector routing so I mean this stuff it's a confluence of a lot of trends the internet is not gonna look the same next year and you need to know a lot about 5g maybe not a lot that you need to protect yourself with some knowledge one of the things that's real important is to know what 5g isn't my little illustration shows that looks a lot like 4G doesn't it and yes it does well you can say it's LTE with an extra channel and this icon is 5ge it's not really 5g I saw this icon the first time about a year ago it is they exactly what it says LTE with an extra channel trick with 5g is you can have all the channels you're willing to buy my mo multiple in multiple output is touted as a great 5g feature but it's been around a while too now what is coming out is coordinated multiple channels so I can split one data stream across multiple radiantly she can't do that today C ran I first saw C ran 10 years ago so it's a key component of 5g and if you read any 5gb paper it says that 5g needs is introducing see gran no it didn't it was introduced in a test with Chinese telecom and TT and a bunch of other people about 10 years ago now here's the one you always hear 5g is needed for self-driving cars no self-driving cars been running on LTE for at least 18 months maybe two or three years they even got trucks running on LTE so no you don't need it what you do need it for is vehicle to vehicle communication so when the guy turns left in front of you his car can tell your car to put on the brakes 5g isn't necessary for the expansion of IOT you hear a lot about this but a lot of these run on cheaper unlicensed protocols it's just flat too expensive to buy all of everything you need for five T and then by 5g and then by license and buy all of the equipment you need when you can do that a whole lot simpler with some other protocol but there are still applications for unlicensed 5g nets at 6.2 gigahertz so there is such a thing as unlicensed 5g so for and what in short there are a bunch of little exceptions in in the 5g world that are out there that kind of make it sound good sometimes but a lot of the features have already been around that's the bottom line of this slide so when somebody tells you that you have to have it maybe you don't the basics or 500 5g sites are being set up every month I think that number is already up to a thousand we put these slides together about four or five months ago and it is true that not even providers know where they all are they claim to and they have lists but I don't think they do what we can do is show you some ways to find the ones in your area or if you're sent out to do a marketing study it's an easy way to do it I'm gonna go find out where the sites are because a lot of these are currently fixed sites Houston was set up about 18 months ago in a Spring Branch I think district with 5g fixed downtown San Jose was wired up last summer with 5g fixed from point to point so there's a lot of it that's in fixed sites and that competes with broadband it competes with almost everything now no one also knows how the communities are going to react to 5g somebody just asked me does 5g cause coronavirus no I don't think so but you can hear every other rumor you want to hear you know the cows don't give milk there's witches that sit on top of the tower you name it that's out there and some communities don't want it and there are some things that are concerns one of the early complaints with 5g phones in Chicago was that they got noticeably hot in other words people have to set the phone down on a long phone call and also there's not much equipment about when we about six months ago we were trying to find equipment only thing I could find was a 5g hotspot I couldn't even find a phone phone was advanced delivery you could order it but you couldn't get it so so take check it out look for sites you don't ask the guy at the desk at the Verizon shop or whatever about it you'll get some funny answers sometimes but they're also answers that you that you can use to understand what's really going on in the world and fine-toothed acronym city I know you think that the nanog organization is accurate in organization but it really is acronym city one ge amps maybe had ten acronyms you could learn them all pretty simple to understand and you go up and up and up 3G you really start to got rolling least twenty five algorithms but 5g has all the above because you kind of got to know what the old ones are to relate them to the new ones and it also has a bunch more for cloud services and virtualization I honestly believe the bottom bullet is correct that there are more 5g organizations and all of other mobile groups but together and in any acronym a beginning with 5g has a chance of being a new organization that's very possible but some organizations that begin with 3G still deal with 5g we'll talk about that later here's a couple more you see this in every nano presentation network function virtualization that's probably been around at least seven or eight years it's not exclusively mobile but you do need it if you build a virtualized radio network like you've built with the 5g network because you can't have fiscal instances of a lot of these devices and you don't want to what you're one of the big economics of using these cloud type radio networks is you get in buy one or a lot of reliability and if you don't have that network function virtualization you can't get that chap's you haven't heard yet its unified user in control plane what happens is there's something called polar codes that allow some signals to be much more reliable than others even though they're on the same channel so I now can put a very reliable control signal on the same channel as a not so reliable voice channel so to speak they're not really channels but I can mix them up you couldn't do that before the SS dynamic spectrum sharing it allows an operator to share spectrum between 5g LTE I mean 4G LTE and v 2 it's very common this isn't the same as sharing of radar spectrum with Wi-Fi and the sea and the citizens band radio band DSS is commonly used and you're going to hear about it and people are going to say they've got a 5g network will have a 5g condensed score and they'll find that the Ericsson 5g convinced core is more than happy to run 4G LTE you're also going to say the radio is totally changed and it has new radio it's a more flexible control protocol it allows a wider bandwidth for radio but it also allows a user to use multiple channels in a st. Rupa channels and that group of channels gets switched so I no longer have to have individual channel switching it's a big deal all of the new radio bands have a R in them so you can find them in the end but they are different realize that an OFDM 4G OFDM OFDM is 5 GB which is multiple instances of those little chunks of spectrum quick comparison this is a grossly oversimplified chart just hinted at one thing down here between 40 and 5g how 5g lasts multiple channels to be switch and also how n R is used for 5g you can compare them differently and here's the big deal about this chart different features from into each generation of service may exist in other generations for example 3G release did include note B which is more or less what LTE is but yet its 3G so you'll see these things that are kind of mixed up and another thing to realize is everything the first two up there are just straight old circuit switched 3t is a mix kinda because there are some versions and features in 3G than aren't an LTE and 5tn are are all digital when you get a radio signal it's a digital signal and it gives you a lot more flexibility now the other thing to note and this was something that was a misconception of mine is that the frequencies really aren't independent of technology everybody's gonna hype 5g well we're gonna run it 5,000 gigahertz and you can run one foot but you'll get buying binding data demos no that's an exaggeration but they hiked the high frequencies and they never talked about it t-mobile just set up a huge 5g network all across the country and they used to 600 megahertz band that they'd gotten access to because the government gave it to so it's not automatic you can run 5g anywhere a lot of us kind of ride in the old 3G bands as people replant their networks and we're going to talk a little bit more about this on later free cuts more because yeah this is the next slide right we are going to talk more about it there's two major sets of figures these four 5g one of them is down below seven gigahertz the other ones way up there twenty four gigahertz but guess what ATP runs a 5g network and lot so they gets at 15 gigahertz that's a fixed Network if you want to see one of their towers it's right in the parking lot of the Embassy Suites so you know they're it's out there and it's not all conform if you look at internationally bands are all over the place except most of them are at 3.5 gigahertz now the bands are kind of funny I've been around so long and I remember s band and L bands specified by the I Triple E but they're a little bit different when you get into the bands on cell phones and and in our bands are often called SS band our s band 5g but the I Triple E specifies is a 2.4 2 to 4 gigahertz so look it up don't even try it remember the ones that you work with all the time but don't be embarrassed to go back and look them up they're all in with Expedia there's lists all over the Internet do not hesitate to look them up save you a lot of heartache in the and there's several other in our bands in both s pan and L band like I said there's some that are called at but there's some that aren't called at and they're right there in the middle of the I Triple E designations so if it sounds confusing it is was it made to be that way I hope not but that's the way it's turned out right now is a great time to get on board or 5g because the press is covering it very very well everything is being published and much of it is indexed so you can find it I mean even by rain but I went online and told everybody what their network looks like and who they bought it from how it's gonna run how they what they're gonna do with it in the future and there's a company that publishes this they are expensive tell the geography if you haven't heard about them they're good guys they really know what they're doing they present it nanog as well you'll see them about every two years showing up and they have a blog and the stuff that we need to know is all in their blog they'll tell you that such and such is just stuff wasn't set up a network like this and follow um right now you can follow this stuff and learn about it a bit at a time just get on a mailing list or two and they'll explain them now my personal experience has been that once the rush is over and everything set up this information gets very hard to come by if somebody walks up in said you know a year from now and said what is Bahrain doing for cellular telephony here whatever our what is it you're doing for smartphones it's gonna be hard to find out they're not gonna want to tell anybody because they're so terrified somebody and listen to it so are the people that sold it to them don't want anyone knowing that that's their customer so now it's a chance to get on board with it your spot your cell phone if your mailing lists you learn a lot new radio is a 5-2 component we talked a little about the frequencies it's the replacement for LTE and the UMTS universal mobile telecommunications on where it has a 5g convinced core and it can run LTE on the out on using the LTE core so I can put new radio on top of an LTE core for transition and all but two networks run this way today one of them is t-mobile and the other one is Korean Telecom and even it neither one of them is that large like we said earlier the the bands are shown with an in and and then they have a different structure so what we're saying is be aware that they can use the LTE convinced core and Ericsson sells out a lot they don't have to use the 5g core but a few people do and you know it's going to be more later on because you don't get some of the benefits if you're on the LTE core alright why the virtualization this is a lot of different ones when I see random we is takes a baseband unit and pulls it back to a central location so now I've kind of got a virtualized basement it makes for a lot of things to be much less expensive also gives you some more impulse in by one reliability now a virtual radio access network does not have the cell towers tied to specific areas so if like a freeway if there's a big traffic jam on the freeway I can share that traffic from that traffic jam across two or three towers rather than having being forced into the tower that's closest to the cars that are stopped now here's one that's tricky open radio access network this is a free-for-all now there's two definitions of it one is that any antenna B can be used with any cell or phone so I can take this antenna and it can be a part of this other network and nobody's the wiser nobody cares it also can be used for open source radio network software that stuff's out there if you're really into this and when a program it now is not a bad time to start because you can get onboard very early on with open source software that's going to drive a lot of this stuff there's a drawing of the last slide basically you can see the old system where there were dedicated front hall of inhale we split up some of the functionality and allowed to be virtualized now all of a sudden multiple towers fit the news that the common centralized units so I no longer have to have everything on this one big baseband unit and it's out in the field and some I'm gonna have to pay somebody a lot of money to set up because I got to pay power on that thing too and it may be hard to get to and I'm gonna have to run a special power line to it so there's a lot of lot of advantages of Syria my mo massive in massive al this is a little bit interesting concept too because it when it's in the same time it's a little more complicated than you at first thing you just think oh okay I've got four antennas I'm gonna set up four different communications not so much for antennas I'm going to have signals that are being received maybe by four antennas or an antenna array that's directive that I can have these virtual channels spatial basis for virtual spatial channels on my antenna and one of those little tricks these guys play is a use multi path to develop multiple channels as shown here if - I don't I don't know how many of you have run microwave are on microwave links or anything but you know the planes are terrible for microwave because out there you get multipath to beat the band but it's multipath if it kills you because they're just slightly out of sequence well what happens here is you use multiple paths that bounces off a building so the two paths between the two antennas are appreciably different so you can actually see them as different paths in your radio control software and you can assign them even maybe two different antennas so I know that if I use this antenna well I'll say different antennas different configurations are different drive vectors of the antenna array I can bounce this thing off a mountain and it's going to have an appreciably different face than the one that I'm sending direct so this is an interesting concept and right now you got phones with two antennas on it up and down but you're gonna see some maybe a third eye there's a little bit of confusion on my part is how far that's gonna go I've taken 100 - I'm apart it's been a little time on it and it's you and it's not clear totally to me yet and I'll tell you what I don't know later on we're gonna put in a email for John and I and you can send us any question you want I found out you can even send us a dead phone if you want to I found out that while we're working on this the more questions we get from people the better we understand it and the more helpful we are more on my motors a couple antennas one at the left is the Qualcomm test antenna planar array of 256 elements and these things can be multiplexed over a neighborhood so I can have two of them bunches of them and they point at different houses depending on who's got traffic and you can also gang them together so that I can focus the energy on that traffic channel not only can I are my resources virtualized but the intendant's can be ganged up and down at the bottom this is not obvious so I can define polarization as well as a being formed by the multiple arrays so the so I'm going to have horizontal and vertical polarization and that's two channels so I'll buy and also there 18 teams is to buy two antennas in San Francisco and this is a little bit like getting to press but and I got it in you could have gotten some free service for a month or two you might still ask him about it the Disney Network I mentioned earlier also uses two by two antennas there are little small things look like gosh cookie tin Maps now this is something we spend a lot of time on the best map of all of the installations is it up there at the link at okhla and if they're kept up based on license data sale data and also just going around and asking as near as I can tell I have yet to find a map that's a hundred percent complete or and accurate and sometimes they don't really say who's the guy running it might be a tower that's leased out so it might lease the lease are rather than the lessee but they're out there if you want to find a tower there's plenty of maps the countries have them to Ireland here's one of Ireland and Dublin they were one of the very early 5g test sites and bless their hearts they even went out and set up a map let you know where they all are this is the dockyards Dublin dockyards and you can zoom in on these and they'll tell you where it is what frequency it's on and ever there's other sources the tower data everybody has a license list the FCC does if you're in the US and there's and and there's a good here live fire also has an article about licenses and where to find stuff they may again not have it well exactly what you're looking for on-site tools okay one of the things if you're in this business I would encourage you to get yourself an SDR it's a great learning tool and you can get one that goes up to six gigahertz relatively inexpensively militantly your wife sites above ten gigahertz it's gonna you gotta get a mixer and it's not an easy thing to put together it's gonna cost you around eight hundred thousand dollars by the time you're all done might be something you want to do particularly if you're really into it you're a student or maybe you get your school to pay for it it also is a good microwave learning site after you get your mixer working with your receiver troubleshooting the tower site might be a lot easier for you now the best utility for all these things is the qualcomm rocket utility you can maybe get it from Qualcomm they don't like to give it away but they will and it's been around for a while and you have to have a jailbroken Android phone and it'll see what the phone is seeing in mobile concrete conversations it won't tell you necessarily what the antenna is doing or what the some of the core software on the back end of all this stuff is doing but it will tell you what the phone thinks it's seeing in terms of service you know be there for error correction right there rates all kinds of things it's a good tool like try asking around if you have somebody in Qualcomm - and what about phones right now almost everything's hotspot and fixed endpoints and not on and not all of them work on more on more than one or two five gigabit frequencies but most of these guys the phones anyway you can see aren't today or at least a couple of months ago want to put this slide together we're very expensive they're about a thousand dollars and some of them would support up to five or six frequency bands just because you did there weren't that many 5g towers out there and you didn't know where you're gonna land 5g is not international I mentioned that 3.5 gigahertz frequencies are kinda standard they're not really used in the u.s. they're used there a lot of other places but not everywhere have a chart of these things that I use there's one in Wikipedia that's out of date but still a good place to start and they're all over the board and all of these countries and every country has at least three or four or five key frequency bands so your phone is going to come up with more radio so more I don't know what they're going to do about the antennas because broadband antennas don't have very high gain but anyway you want to lose the phone here it is here's a list of device this guy maintains this or at least he was you can also just do a search and you'll find them if you do a search on eBay you'll find about a hundred phones that only one or two of them will do 5g real 5g phone forensics this is an area that I had never heard of and I put it in here just because we discovered it when we were putting these slides together and there's so much hacking into phones these days that and there's what's a toolset I know the tool sets for Windows and Linux so those kinds of things but there exists for phones too and cellebrite has a really good paper I've referenced it down there if you're interested in phone forensics or seeing what's on your phone you can get a little bit of stuff from cellebrite at least they can tell you what's happening now IOT sensor information is a big deal and it isn't clear yet how people are going to troubleshoot IOT other than having somebody dig into it and say this is this thing or whatever so but anyway you can if you're interested in phone forensics looked up cell right give you a good start on things and then you can play around with some of it yourself I personally think my iPhone has been hacked no sim installed that's a good if you ever get that message there's a good chance that there's somebody who's gotten into the thing somehow if you have problems with your Apple ID and steer clear of my wife loved naughty piggies well they were very naughty piggies indeed troubleshooting fiber connections this is a tool it's called a time time domain reflectometer if you're doing this and you're not trying to do any troubleshooting of the fiber itself and you're gonna have to do some of that to get into the phone side or the Bell inside of the business and now something I've never heard of called an IO ALM or Interactive optical TDR what it does is read the fiber characteristics so you don't have to set all the parameter it's they aren't cheap regular TDR is dirt cheap I think you get one for about fifty dollars now so do that and if you're having to do this on a regular basis as part of your job and you don't have an IO LM don't find somebody and say hey this is what we need it does make it according to what I've read about these things that cuts the troubleshooting time down by an order of magnitude mobile phone-based utilities now some people have gone out and written some mobile phone-based utilities some of them are nothing much they just go out and read what's in settings non-support 5g iPhone net analyzer RF analyzer is the one I show there I think and it has what it does is real simple it will show you well who thinks you're connected to what kind of power you got and then rather than measure all the other towers it has a database that it has created sort of like the Atlas database for BGP of where this reception is good and bad from different vendors they collect the data off with some of their utilities and then they put it on a map and it's not bad in the theirs and what's gonna happen with five tiers any of this is going to work well it says here probably not just yeah what happens is the classes for settlement and foe change though these things aren't going to support 5g for a while but if you're in this business and you're trying to learn more about phones you need to look at some of these things they gives you some good insight and load them up on your machine now family had any problems with any I'm breaking into my phone you have to run location services to have them work right which is too bad but anyway they work if you run those services Network issues with 5g okay you guys probably been waiting for this well this is a very short because there's just not that much information out there yeah high throughput low latency and best buffering you can possibly get on your routers that face it and the other thing is happening I don't know what you guys have seen this yet that Nvidia introduced a new edge chip that allows you to have a lot more information right on the edge of the network so the what you're going to see is more and more big globs of information coming from these little chips as they refresh their cache and they go I have to look stuff up and then a lot less of the small queries that you see today and low latency applications written for 5g may not work on a 4G network there may be a race condition or it may not be able to one I mentioned earlier like the car to car communication that's not gonna work right on the 540 Network but nobody would expect it to now here's the thing if you're a nurse if you're a programmer you know somebody who is all the objects are different like I said in the radios different programmer has to identify that and the objects like want to just mentioned on the a draw Android phone are different for 5g and 40 because the parameters are different now why are we doing this well the answer is somebody's going to start asking you questions about 5g and I thought it only fair to throw in a couple interview questions and some hints about how to prepare for this because I get answering to ask questions about 5g and I like to ask and like the answer I also like to ask them but in order to get good answers you have to ask good questions so cuts both ways so here's one trick question does v GPB replace 3gpp in developing 5g standards this is the five 3gpp is the standards from any of this developed everything since GSM as well No so it would be logical at five GPP would replace it nope but they hung with 3gpp they just kept right on going to 4G and 5g now millimeter waves you can get an almost as many answers this question is you want to but this is what I thought was a definitive answer but you guys and don't do anything except work on cell phones and so are the 5 g and 6 g bands considered millimeter wave bands no they're already in use 8 g is usually thought of as a no later right but the traditional millimeter wave band is RF above 10 gigahertz and so 5 g 5 and 6 gigahertz bands are not millimeter waves now if you're talking to uh salesman in a store I think guarantee you they're probably super millimeter waves but they aren't technically no reader wipes you got to give above 10 gigahertz by the way that's the same break point we saw earlier F R 1 and F R 2 the low end and then everything about 24 gigahertz that also falls that way and then there's a somebody already has a list of interview questions on 5g and there it is I've given you a link to it and if you want to learn a lot more about this I'm pointed to really good directions the I Triple E has at least 15 education pieces on it there's a link to it and the other guys that really do a good job is probably a company you may not have heard of called rodent shorts and they're German company and they do everything RF and they have some outstanding papers so if you get interested check out row - warts and check out the I Triple E well that's about it for now I want to we're going to drop off here thanks a lot for listening I hope we've provided some good information we hope we provided a little more clarity like I said this is a very unclear field and I honestly think some people are trying to muddy the water even more so thanks a lot and this is it you can send us emails if you got more question so we're going to take some questions now okay we have a few little demos here it's kind of hard to demo here and you know for zoom but this is a little directional antenna cost 15 dollars this runs at 850 to 950 guess what the band that a lot of the US cellphones are on so you can use this thing this is back one RF put them together you can see the phones coming and going on this thing you can measure the where they are and you can also get a good a feel for the power all this little tool is not accurate for giving you an accurate measure on power measurements and the software that you normally I use a lot I put on a Linux machine Anna there it is this is GPR gqr X and it acts like a spectrum analyzer I'm running this off a $20 little dongle here and you can get these things anywhere uber tooth one is a lot like yes I took me about an hour and a half to put this together so if you're interested in RF your interesting thoughts this is easy the setup with the equinox the total of I think about $400 counting that the radio the computer and the antenna this one here PC was free and the thing cost $20 don't be scared of it it's easy to do well that's all I've got thanks a lot for watching go Elizabeth thanks a lot for that Joe that was really interesting there are a couple of questions that have come into the queue the first question is why five six or five G for enterprise deployments if you have a mobile device that has to have handoffs you go with a 5g otherwise you go with the Wi-Fi it's kind of tricky to get good mobile handoffs with Wi-Fi that's why Disneyland I think chose 5g is they have all those moving floats and all kinds of stuff laying like that so move around and they'll that they'll have a continuous session with Wi-Fi you got cut up repeater or some a bunch of other stuff next thanks a lot Joe the next question is what in your opinion is a killer app for 5g I would say selling something to a venture capitalist would be the number one killer app because somebody would probably buy it right now but gaming is up there they're wiring all the stadiums and you have to believe that's for on-premises betting or something so you have super low latency it could also be for something like you see for advertising auctions where you need lay low latency in a limited space or something like that just think low latency that makes sense thank you the next question is is there an expectation that 5g takes over the entire footprint that 4G is servicing now would you imagine that they'll run as parallel networks serving different purposes they'll probably run as parallel networks for a long time just because you don't need some of the features of 5g and a lot of places and it's expensive and so why do it and there are only two standalone networks now I think I answered this in another question too but once in Korea ones t-mobile and that means it's pure 5g and it runs without any fortunately that working runs to 5g convinced core okay thank you the next question is that the person says I'd like to know more about private 5g networks can I have one that gateways to the public telephone telephony net or the Internet but I have one that is completely private can I use one to ship non IP data around between two stations or can I create ad hoc networks between vehicles the last one which is I didn't answer earlier which is if you ship a private non IP data around you have to encapsulate it the traffic quantifying to you network the RF is IP so you're gonna have to do some kind of thing there you don't have the case where I can set up a dedicated link like I do at 10:00 and 2g just put anything I want down it no can't do that but as far as private networks our little group of two here believes we've been forecasting the private networks are a really big deal now for four years and there is one in existence AT&T sells the first-responders network that's really kind of not a private network but I think they'll give you your own dial plan and then a few other things but when you hit virtualization in 5g do you have one anywhere and there is one there's and in private networks are already around there's a guy who comes to Nanog or at least used to it runs the Burning Man phone network and that's a private network it has a gateway to the BTS so I am to the under cellular system he buys a link from somebody and operates is a virtual mobile operator via Moe so you have kind of private networks as veamos now but true Private Networks you're gonna have to wait till you get oh man and virtualization inside you okay thank you the next question is which emailing list to do you keep up with to keep up on 5g progress now which of the email lists would you recommend if you're doing it internationally you can't get away without either at least following tell a Geography Bee they're really nice guys and their blog will post almost everything if you're really into it and it's and you're having to be internationally you gotta subscribe to them and they're not cheap and if you have to set up towers and bid for bandwidth there's a million people you can deal with and you'll find them they make lists to towers they can tell you where to get the space everything now if you're like guys for we spend more time on figuring out what's going on then then trying to figure out which pieces spectrum we're gonna put a bid on then our CR Wireless is very good there's another lot of guys named fierce Wireless and they're both they're also really good and if you look around you'll probably find a few more and rohde & schwarz has and the I Triple E has a really good blog on 5g as well and they have like 12 classes on 5g and so does rohde & schwarz so if you you can educate yourself to the point of being a real expert and be ahead of some of the guys that are out there hanging off the side of a tower that makes a lot of sense thank you the next question is is the u.s. really that far behind the rest of the world with 5g enough so why I don't think they are we just don't have as much a need for it though you see a lot more of at the point for example Morocco has been has every phone in the country on 5g and it's been that way now for two years because they have the money there's only 3500 phones in the whole country so you know so are we behind them because we're not a hundred percent though and some people have to use it like China because they have too many have a very high density environments they need high bandwidth and low frequency I mean at high frequencies so as far as the technology goes some people do build better and this is another question saw answered here Huawei builds really good radios guys they really do and there's something that I don't know why they do that but they do that was the next question of is how a well ahead of the US on deployment and research and development yeah radios well it sounds like we're actually out of time right now so I'm going to thank you very much for coming to talk with us today and for answering questions it was really great to hear from you thank you and this ends this portion of the meeting [Music]", "11y1z9n3Kgs": "alright hey you guys just checking in gonna give you an update if you haven't been here with me before I just started this channel a few days ago to try to share with some of you real results and things that are going on with me as I'm taking RSO and many other THC products on a daily basis long story short I've been having symptoms for two years morning sickness I told him I felt like there was something in my abdomen that was two years later confirmed in a diet or a exploratory ultrasound the fiber we got nodules and cysts on through my thyroid I've had pain radiating up in my brain I need to have my I had a bad head injury in 2012 two years ago and ended up in the hospital with dizzy spells I was told that I had an unruptured brain aneurysm actually they waited eight months to tell me that so I went back for a second MRI so I haven't had one of those for about a year now we're gonna look at those again at that time the doctor that I was seeing said that the new MRI showed the pain aneurysm wasn't there anymore but there was this big white spot in the middle of my MRI question that I don't know I don't trust it he had these doctors to be honest with you so two months ago and an exploratory ultrasound we found all these nodules we found this growth and they thought it was in my uterus when a gynecologist is not my uterus don't know where it is so I being jacked around by all these doctors truly came out with artists oh and I'm glad they did because 25 days ago when I started this I couldn't drive my car and my complexion was gray and I was having trouble getting out of the bed I own three businesses so I'm not a lazy person I'm usually a million miles an hour I'm a workaholic night owl I work till three or four o'clock in the morning because it's quiet I can get a lot done I wake up at ten eleven I go all day it took about two months after they initially told me I had these nodules that ultrasound I've been looking for answers for a while for me to be pretty much flat on my back and it took RSO less than two weeks to get me back on my feet again and now after 25 days I think it's 25 days I believe I started this I looked back to that it was January 15th or 16th like a different person now you know I'm still having my moments but I want to share with you some of what's going on and then we'll have some real results next week I do have an ultrasound scheduled for Monday this will be the first ultrasound that I've had since January 7th I believe it was when I got my ultrasound results back and so all the nodules and insists and everything at least we have some answers I don't think they have all the answers on my brain and they don't know what's going on here yet but takes them forever and you're my husband and I have the best insurance man can buy we have insurance through his work which is fabulous insurance we have TRICARE from where he's retired veteran and we have Aflac guess what none of that craps taking care of me right now in fact they don't know what the hell is going on but what I do know is that this stuff that truly came out with RSO has been known to shrink tumors it has been known to kill cancer I honestly believe that I have possibly a chance that there's some of that going on so anyway trying to get a head start I've been doing about 750 milligrams bar so today I'm doing an entire syringe at this point it took me a couple weeks to work up to that and I'm acclimating to it pretty well I'm not you know dead tired it takes me I'm about to wake up in the morning and of course I still have symptoms from my sickness but there was a lot less than what they were Q wheats to go my complexion is is coming back I have these little band-aids on my neck that I've been putting the RSO 1 here and you know just just kind of near the affected areas using the harness oh using Delta a delta 9-1-2-1 that's a distillate that helps me with nausea an appetite I've I've lost about 20 pounds before I started the RSO and as you can see I'm not very big anyway I'm back into my size ones and zeros that I haven't seen for about four or five years by the way out of 49 years old and I look a lot older than I did just five years ago anyway but so what we're taking Delta 89 a house with no knowledge of tincture oil which you know it helps to cure cancer shrink tumors all kind of stuff this is a THC CBD one to one I put it in the back of my throat I put it in my mouth I use that several times a day and then I used the topical cream hybrid for topical relief was to get this comfort around my neck so and besides that I have flour which right now in the state of Florida we can only vape I have sativa have happened to have super Silver Haze that helps get me woke up in the morning kind of acclimate so the day after being in order so super all night and then I have 9 pound human that I use when it's time for me to go to bed two kinds of Juarez so we got the hybrid and we got the end of cup I mean using the hybrid during the day the end of goodnight for obvious reasons so anyway what do I feel well you know it's kind of weird but if you ever have to take this stuff away to know that you're gonna actually it well at least I feel this stuff working which is kind of weird and it's hard to explain when I say that I feel it working but I actually do feel in doing something in my neck and listen and I say it's this because I've been dealing with this for a couple of years now and now I'm having sensations that I haven't had and it's only since I started using this and I have to say that what I'm feeling might be this tough shrinking these nodules that or I don't know what it's doing but I'm telling you it's a different kind of feeling I feel like this tight pressure in the areas where I had affected it I'm also getting like a different kind of pressure in my head and I can only imagine that you know if something in your body dies that you would feel it whether it's a good cell or a bad cell cancer so I don't know I don't have all the answers yet that's why I'm doing this channel I'd love to hear from somebody else out there that's doing this I can tell you that I've had some pain associated with the aura so doing it's doing I wonder if you feel that too you know people prank cancer survivors who abused or so you did you feel it going away did you feel it like squeezing that's kind of the sensation I get in my head and in my neck and then where I put these bandages and smeared in my esophagus now I had an endoscopy done about a year ago and the only thing that that the doctor there was able to tell me was that I had Barrett's esophagus and I guess from probably years of drinking espresso and any chili and things like that but I'm really curious as to what's happened because I'm not having the trouble swallowing that I was just in the last couple of weeks by the way the the two-week period of Ora so I started to notice a significant improvement and a 21-day point it was just like whoa I mean it was it was like exponential it was almost crazy my vision was improving drive it again get my motivation back actually felt like living you know I was - coming - laying in the bed and knowing that I might not be around much longer so that's kind of frightening but that's really that's where I was so that's why it's really important for me to share this with you because I know I really believe that this product these products but in particular this product at this point I'm pretty sure has saved my life and I'm gonna get the results and everything so that I can tell you with 100% certainty what it has done for me but I can tell you what I feel and at this point I really just want to get on the top of my house and scream you know to everybody out there I was on this dead and I felt like anything like that before I'm pretty tough person I was in a wheelchair in my 20s and I had almost 20 I don't know 20 some doctors neurologists included Terri Schiavo you remember her her doctor dr. hemisphere told me I would never walk again remember that yeah I had some pretty serious doctors I'm up and walking up on the bar I own a smoke shop now and have three businesses I've ridden horses driven trucks and trailers and you know my own trucks and trailers all over the country after I recovered and that was that was me going to doctors getting the answers I needed in then doing what I knew I needed to do not what traditional medicine said and I've lived a great life when I was told that I could not do that so anyway I have to tell you this too and this is a true story I don't know if dr. Hammes Laura will ever see this video but he was Terri Schiavo's doctors the neurologist that told me that by the time I was 30 I would be a vegetable business because of a nerve injury that I had my leg and I ended up finding the doctor that knew how to fix it and it was a long hard process but I'm not a quitter and certainly don't give up and out and I wanted to live I had a young child but anyway gosh 15 years went by after I got better I guess and I was running my karaoke bar cigar bar out on Madeira Beach and dr. ham is Farah walked up to my bar of course he didn't remember me but I knew him instantly the very second I saw him I mean this was very traumatic time in my life and that's when he said he looked at me and I asked he ordered a beverage of course and the bars run in the park and I just stopped and I looked at him and I said I know who you are and he kind of went like this and I told him he remembered my maiden name back then and I told him I said I am and I told him my name and I said you told me that by the time I was 30 I would never walk again and he looked at me and he turned his head kind of sideways and man actually started to just shed tears but anyway I guess I told you that just because you know that was something that I took my life and my my health into my own hands and I went out and I found the doctors that would work with me and that really would take care of me and I'm glad I did that because my life might have been a lot different if I hadn't and I'm gonna do the same thing year I told that thyroid doctor today that were scheduling me Monday for biopsies and possible surgery and I'm like you guys haven't even met me yet so first of all I don't need a 3-hour appointment on Monday because there's no way to know anybody's doing a biopsy on me on Monday and I ever beaten this but I'm in the middle of treating it that's not gonna happen I'm taking my health in the man's and I'll tell the doctors what they can and can't do how many use them for test results I'm going to use the hell are very insurance because I have it but I'm not taking traditional routes of medication whatever might be wrong here so anyway I'm here to share with you I bump input from others you know I'm looking for answers to I'd like to know if the things that I'm feeling or normal you know am i healing I think I am I like to to hear from some some of you guys out there maybe who've done this before and I hope that my sharing helps so anyway I'm functioning pretty good on about a thousand milligrams of THC a day so in like traditional medications I guess you you kind of acclimate to it you and I've worked my way up to now it started at about 500 milligrams a day up to a thousand over the last few weeks and it's just it's been amazing what it's done so highly recommend not listening to everything your traditional doctors say I have more than one story about that so anyway the life-changing ones too because believe me when your doctor goes home tonight he's not thinking about what the hell's wrong with you at home of your house and he's probably not gonna show up because they appear believers so anyway you know you got to be in charge of this I hope this helps you guys and we'll see you in the morning thank you", "dLxL-5UqXTg": "hi I'm dr. Marty Ross in this video I talk about marijuana and CBD and I describe the differences between these two chemicals I also talked about the conditions that they can treat I describe the various ways that you can take them vaping for instance is different than using them as an edible and finally I describe whether CBD is a useful Lyme disease antibiotic treatment is supported by purchases you make through Marty Ross MD supplements this is from sherry hi sherry I see what are your thoughts about CBD oil and treating Lyme does it help pain fatigue any other benefits to using it so sherry there's actually as many of you know before moving here to Austin Texas I lived in Washington State which is where I practice until the end of 2018 treating Lyme disease and Washington State is a state that allows marijuana for a number reason the first of all there's a recreational marijuana law and also there is a medical marijuana law we've had one of the original medical marijuana laws in the country so I'm pretty well I have a lot of knowledge of working with marijuana and CBD the thing I will tell you about medical marijuana and CBD is we really don't have a lot of research and reason for that is the federal government has blocked effective research but based upon research that's been done in people with multiple sclerosis for seizure disorders people with HIV and AIDS the number of other illnesses - there's some things that we can kind of learn about medical marijuana and CBD and I'll talk about those here in just a minute okay alright so first of all what what is the difference between marijuana and CBD let's talk about that first okay so CBD is a chemical that is found in cannabis plants and THC also is a chemical found in cannabis plants okay now something is technically called marijuana if it has more than 0.3% THC the chemical called THC okay alright no THC is what gives you that marijuana okay that's what people are doing when they're smoking marijuana that's that's the chemical that gives you the high CVD on the other hand does not give the high okay now they both interact with something which is called the endocannabinoid system that's a mouthful so basically we have our own marijuana chemical system in our body our bodies naturally make marijuana like chemicals and as part of something called the endocannabinoid system alright and there's two there's a two major chemical receptors THC that you get in marijuana binds to the cv1 receptor I believe and then CBD actually doesn't bind to either one of those receptors alright so what it does CBD helps to block reactions in the body that break down our own natural marijuana chemicals okay one of those is something called an addendum IDE and there's another one called a 2 AG those that tend to be the two major chemicals that we make that regulate our an endocannabinoid system all right so when we're talking about marijuana we have to realize that CBD is not equivalent to THC alright because they act differently THC binds to the decieving on receptors and the CBD itself doesn't bind either one of those receptors but rather it helps elevate the natural body's marijuana chemicals if you will then interact with those receptors alright all right so seat so there's this that's one point okay secondly THC is what tends to give you the high okay it does the mind-altering more mind-altering than what CBD does alright it tends to be more sedating as well - okay so when we're talking about one of the things that you can use THC and CBD for asleep alright but to be honest with you what's gonna work better for sleep is something that has higher amounts of THC relative to CBD all right now in Washington state you could go into one of these Medical dispensaries and tell them I want to mix that has 70% THC and 30% CBD you can actually do it that way I'm not sure if the dispensaries in Colorado work that way but basically if you're wanting something stronger err on for steep err on the side of THC okay right now one of the problems with THC that I have to warn you about is it can lead to depression in some people and it can sometimes cause more psychiatric problems all right now is my lane up there's the potential of that on the other hand both THC and CBD can help with depression and anxiety they both can alright both can help with pain both regulate pain in different ways but both they're quite effective against pain both can help limit seizures both can help make it so that if you have a lot of salivation problems we're making too much spit like people get with Lou Gehrig's disease ALS they both can limit that as well too okay so and they can help you deal with nausea as well - all right so there's a variety of benefits of the two one is that they might help manage anxiety depression the other is they both can help manage sleep to a degree although THC is stronger both can help manage pain to various degrees and both can help with seizure disorders or may help with seizure disorders I should say okay and both can help with just general body pain those are the big reasons that I look at using either THC or CBD alright then the little nuance differences if you happen to be able to get CBD and it doesn't work for pain sometimes THC works better something that's richer in TAC may work better okay CBD is more accessible these days though because it's legal the federal government has has there is well it appears to be legal at this point other the Trump administration has been making some remarks about it but at this point CBD is technically legal together and therefore it is much more accessible THC stuff medical marijuana that is rich in THC is harder you have to be in a state that allows you to have medical marijuana's basically unfortunately I think it was up around 23 or 24 states in the country now that allow that okay all right there's several ways you can take these chemicals to alright and how you take it affects how it's going to work on you all right so if you have an edible if you are a person that likes to eat marijuana cookies for instance alright or CBD oil mixed in food that's gonna slow down its absorption and so the effect of taking it may hit about two hours later after you take it but it will last longer can last I think up to seven or eight hours okay alright another way but then that makes it really hard to regulate what your doses alright so another way to do it is to either smoke or to vaporize it those as you're breathing the chemicals in get absorbed quickly into the bloodstream and if you take it that way usually within 30 seconds to two minutes you have a pretty good idea of what the level of that is gonna be okay so you can get vaporizer oils you can get Veit you can take it in by vaporizer and smoke it okay alright there are some people that advocate using CBD and any even marijuana to treat a lime a lot of that there's been some preliminary work looking at that by a physician up in Canada called Ernie Murakami and doctor Murakami Elsevier had some petri dish experiments that tried to see could CBD be useful basically and those experiments did show some killing good killing effect of lime in the lab however what I will tell you is what goes on in a petri dish does not always mean it's gonna work that way in a living person and in this situation having worked with medical marijuana in Washington state I don't think that I would call CBD and marijuana the best lime germ killer I think it's more effective as something we use to treat various conditions that can occur in Lyme disease okay", "fbcpgZRn7zA": "we've got some oil to make and this is gonna be part of the selection there we've got some really good strange brother Perry bone tangerine dream super Silver Haze any of this stuff is going to be amazing [Music] lovely thank you injury on all of the grinding up and as you can see we have lots and lots and lots of lovely ground of weed and it smells delicious so what we need to do now not this Bastille need to add the solvent in this cases isopropyl alcohol which is 99.999% pure alcohol a little bit of water and with the right purging there's no reason to to worry this is perfectly safe so here we have I think it's 500 grams of cannabis smokers you probably want to look away right now and what we'll do all you're doing now is we're just going to recover and of course this is completely this is very very very dangerous if you're smoke please don't smoke around when you're doing this the vapor from alcohol is highly volatile and should you be daft enough to smoke around it whilst it's all the vapors in the air you'll very likely to cause an explosion and do yourself a lot of damage if not worse kill yourself so we are getting now I know it's not quite a lot and it is quite a lot of alcohol but we're trying to create enough liquid in there to extract as much of the cannabinoids as we can this is as you know this is a lot of different types of bugs in this one so we're hoping for a very very very good oil now again it's volatile so please don't use your bare hands with this and make sure that your gloves are suitable for using with alcohol we're going to give this a good thing I think it's probably about another half a liter to be sure so you probably put in for navarre liters and that's plenty we don't want us to suffocate the cannabis so we're going to just keep stirring this for a few more minutes and then we're gonna leave it for 15 minutes right all soaked so times up it's now ready to start filtering out Toby hundred 20 micron bag stop pouring this in now now I'll do the first pot quickly and then get it going then I'll carry on afterwards so you can actually see what we're doing trying to get out of less of the plant matter as possible as you can see they didn't wanna look now all of this is pure all the alcohol now with extracted order the THC the CBD all the other cannabinoids that you expect so we'll just leave that just for moment we'll come back to that and I'll carry on doing this now with this as you can see it's all well cleaned and filtered out what we're going to do now is we're going to hide it probably want to put in there anyway so that's perfect now we'll make sure that this us out with the wait a minute but big blue Peter here we can do it in a minute right so it's all clipped it on make sure that the fans running to try and blow the vapor away because alcohol vapor is quite heavy it goes on and we're on and that literally is the start perfect slowly reducing ugly I'm still got my lots going there but well we'll get back to it and show you at the end about the podium you can see now is now ready another couple more minutes and then this will go straight into the video and you'll be able to see how it looks so as you can see now the oil has completely reduced down and what's left is this let you concealed up properly but this is fika well it's getting there it's a little bit more purging to go but that's how it is and it won't take long now so this will very gently after everything a little piece I'll sit in here and to a bowl of water I'll do I'll stop to gently heat the water up and slowly this will reduce more and you can kind of gauge where the line is now I'll see you in a minute Wayne nicely those little bubbles are caused by the alcohol leaving the liquid hopefully in a few more hours these bubbles would have reduced down and we'll carry on well as you can see now I mean there's virtually nothing left so what we're gonna do now is as there's still more alcohol in there I'm gonna add three mils of water and what this is going to do is that to try and draw up the last and again you carry on until there are no bubbles left right guys so we've purged as you can see now no bubbles it's now very very thick so what we're going to do now starts region I'm using a two three male 1 here buttburn enough it's a two mil 1 and 10 mils I'm just gonna show you this one dunk fast so you understand how quickly how easy it is to do so this is how it goes doodles it's that simple well guys as you can see we are finally finished of all of that we've many that's just over half a kilo of canvas I think it's about 540 grams into in that batch that has given us eighty seven grams of theta so I hope this video has hoped I know it's been quite not when it's been over a couple of days so thank you for your patience as you can see it's not something that you can do very very quickly it takes a lot of time and effort and I hope that you'll manage to do the same", "OLhPzGau4Xk": "hey youtube how you doing this is tech extremist welcome to in the tech news today we do have quite a few things to talk about so let's go ahead and get started all right the first thing is going to be this twitter exchange between mr mike panel from lightreading.com and ronan dunn all right or running ron and dune uh from verizon so that's the ceo of verizon uh verizon official officials no longer hint that grand deals in millimeter wave build out plans the financial analyst at sanford c bernstein and co called it a staggering whiff uh the lie of millimeter wave is dead i agree with the financial analyst at new street research all right so it's very true what the ceo of verizon responded all right now we're going by by what the carrier is saying that much is true so of course they can always change plans or they can be misleading us but the truth is that they did hand that millimeter wave bill that was going to continue and they also provided the biggest proof of them all when they announced that they were going to spend 10 billion dollars on c band they didn't say they were gonna take that you know take it away from the existing capital expenditures they were going to or they are going to add that on top of what they were already had you know expected or had planned to spend so they went and added 10 billion dollars over three years which now there's been a clarification on twitter as well uh tech live channel asked the question to mr doon uh it's not gonna be you know 10 billion divided over three years it's gonna be 10 billion spend it as fast as you can within those three years so if you spend it all in one year then that's that so verizon is not limiting how much they're gonna be able to build out you're over here or you're every year they're gonna go ahead and just let the you know flood gates open so a lot of people kind of missed that part because even i when i read the transcript for that uh they were saying that we're going to put 50 of traffic at least over in traffic uh on the millimeter wave network which is huge think about a city like phoenix los angeles uh new york uh new york city uh you know chicago you're gonna put fifty percent of that traffic on millimeter wave that is huge that means your build outs are gonna be massive considering the propagation characteristics of millimeter wave of course there is expected to be technological improvements uh with the with the uh uh frequency but it's not gonna be you know multi-mile uh propagation you know indoor penetrating kind of thing so i think what what's going to happen is as the deployed and shopping centers and malls and downtown areas that is where people spend most of their time or at least when things are normal that is where people usually gather and i think that's how they get that 50 percent number not that they're actually gonna cover 50 of the city right off the bat although i i still i still i'm hearing uh of course this could be completely wrong and it's only coming from one source that millimeter wave the eventual goal which is long term not it's not going to be next year the year after that or even the year after that is slowly put it on every uh you know macro tower that's what i've heard i could be wrong that person that is telling me this could be wrong but that is what i'm hearing all right and this is a pretty reliable source he's uh he's been right pretty much throughout you know but anyway so there you go i'll put a link to the exchange there so you can see it for yourself mr dano defending his company uh you know like all companies do all right all ceos do um there's a lot of detractors out there that don't know uh like this guy right here talking about how you know it's 50 percent duh duh whatever hey you know what if it was t-mobile like i told them there uh making that claim you'd be jumping up and down for joy so you have to put things into perspective um i would love for t-mobile to say we're going to put 50 percent of urban traffic on you know millimeter wave whether it's just outdoor traffic 50 percent of outdoor traffic is still traffic that clogs the the uh the uh you know you know the cell phone towers and if you put 50 of outdoor traffic on that that means that the other bands get freed up that's the part that people miss when they're talking about millimeter wave it's not so much how it performs itself it's also how much traffic it offloads off the other uh you know bands i think think of somewhere like uh los angeles venice beach beach where they do have millimeter wave when you have people connected to that millimeter wave that means that many less people connected to the uh the uh you know the cell phone uh the regular bands think of times square right you put a few nodes there you're gonna offload all that traffic and the rest of the bands are gonna be free to you know reach indoors and whatnot so there's a lot more to it than just saying millimeter wave on its own you also have to think of the dynamics the relationship between the bands and how one band offloading the others can affect the traffic on the other bands all right but anyway moving on surprise surprise ars technica.com att lies about california net neutrality uh excuse me net neutrality law claiming it abandons free data att is angry that it must stop charging hbo max rivals for data cap exemptions att lied about california's net neutrality law yesterday when it claimed that law requires att to stop providing free data to mobile customers in reality the california law allows att to continue zero rating hbo max its own video service as long as it exempts all competing video services from data caps think binge on that's why that was legal during the obama administration without charging the other video providers but instead of zero rating all video without collecting payments from its competitors in the online video business att decided it would rather not exempt anything at all i'm not gonna go into the details of the article but this is bs from a t and they also didn't do anything for you okay they also didn't do anything for you they also didn't say well we're gonna increase the deep pride limit uh for unlimited data customers they also didn't say well we're going to give you more shared data because of this i know this is going to we know that this is going to cause you to run through your data quicker so guess what we're going to add uh you know more data to your shared plan whatever it may be they didn't do it which is just seems so stinky so personally i called and cited the att blog that you know that talks about this let me see if the link is on here yep okay so i cited this specific article gave them the link and whatnot uh and i got out of the 18t tv contract so there's not going to be an etf for me because i cancelled so something that you guys should consider basically what you do is call and tell them hey this is what's happening they're not gonna outright believe you because they don't even know about it the uh you know the retention team whatever they're called so just tell them go to this website it is a company website and they'll go through it and then they'll agree because they really have no argument there it's very clear that they're violating their own terms of service because that's not what you agreed to when you got into 18t tv now personally i'm still debating on whether to keep it because there's a lot of uh um i've been testing all the services and i'll have videos coming up soon t-vision well not all of them but several t-visions sling blue plus orange and then you know at t tv so i have a video that's going to compare them at least through my eyes of course i'm not an extensive reviewer so you're going to get what i see and what i care about the way i use them in my car and everything so stay tuned for that video uh i'm gonna be making it this weekend but i'll definitely be telling you which one i think is the best and hint it does involve att unfortunately so you're gonna see what the shortcomings are of the other two you know providers but anyway moving on all right pcmag.com uh interesting article here i recommend it go read it t-mobile has just one year the race to 5g is more is more marathon than a sprint i can't read today and t-mobile is currently and then the website moves on me uh winning but verizon is coming in hot to drop c-ban on 46 metro areas by next march can the underdog maintain its lead will the oneplus 9 help all right so resin has been excuse me uh t-mobile has been kicking booty i mean there is really no other way to look at it they have been coming in hot and they have been i use their own term uh and they've been winning so far the 5g races t-mobile's to lose they are definitely ahead i do anticipate that's going to change all right i do i do think that verizon is going to take the lead eventually because they're continuing with millimeter wave you saw their 50 percent of urban traffic expected by a certain time frame next few years and then when they come in with c-band they're coming in with 10 billion dollars so this is the biggest you know negative for t-mobile i don't care what you say oh they already have the infrastructure so does verizon verizon has a ton of towers uh and they have a ton of small cells and they have the ability to deploy a ton of small cells they already have you know a ton of small cells planned for the next several years more than anybody and you can read the crown cord uh articles to see that that is not a lie it's just uh it's just the money if there's one thing that t-mobile needs to change is how much money they are spending and then they need to up their back hall on a lot of sites um you know i've been getting messages from people telling me that they're they do notice the teemo lag uh when they are browsing and stuff that i reported in one of my videos uh we're basically t-mobile you'll be having even 700 megabits per second and all of a sudden it'll just lag it'll just hang up and for no reason we don't even know what's the point i run a speed test and it's giving me 700 megabits per second but you're still lagging so that's something that t-mobile needs to address i suspect it has to do uh or maybe so maybe it has so maybe i'll sh i should rephrase that maybe it has to do with the quality of the hardware they're using or it could be the backhaul that's probably the most likely thing the backhoe because it from what i understand they're using really good equipment um and it's happening with ericsson panels here which are top of the line right so okay that is something to consider with t-mobile there's a lot of uh factors there i think they just need to up their capital expenditures cutting capex which is what they're planning to do keep that in mind this article does not mention that um is is not really helpful to your calls especially when you're trying to win the 5g race all right moving on to the next article all right this is huge all right so like i said just to go along i'm not going to read the full article here lightreading.com t-mobile counts more than 10 million 5g customers just to put emphasis on what i was saying in the last article t-mobile is the leader right now they this is their race to lose they have every opportunity to continue that lead and even expand it just up your money t-mobile all right so that's kind of why why i wanted to show you this article i'll link all the articles that we're reading right now in the description area um again it is just something that they need to do they need to up their money they need to pay more they need to have more you can't do this on the cheap it doesn't work all right no company thanks sprint thanks sprint no company that has thought about doing it on the cheap has really succeeded all right the best example we have of course is print it doesn't work all right but anyway another fiercewireless.com article all right this is huge uh again not gonna read the whole thing south bank launches millimeter wave service in japan using qualcomm tech right so to me what this proves here is the importance of millimeter wave think of a you know city like tokyo where the population density is very high los angeles new york city chicago uh you know these cities uh even miami beach the you know the downtown area of miami um uh you know you know what is it called uh that uh area in miami beach a boulevard those areas that are very congested in miami i think on international drive in orlando where there's a lot of people you put millimeter wave there it's just going to be killer think theme parks like disneyland disney world when things get back to normal um you know high population high density areas uh are gonna really benefit from this enough and even eventually rural areas with you know internet offerings repeaters to your house they did talk okay they did talk during that investor meeting this is another thing that got missed during that investor meeting that i think is going to make millimeter wave more useful they did talk about repeaters all right finding uh technology or using repeaters that extend that range of that millimeter wave because if you you're using a thousand megahertz of spectrum and you're repeating it several spots that's going to be fine it's not going to really clog that you know band uh by repeating it because that's one of the reasons why they don't usually do that because if you repeat one band too much it kind of starts losing its capacity so a thousand megahertz uh is going to be ideal for repeating and then of course considering the propagation characteristics of that spectrum but anyway moving on excuse me got a little itch over here fiercewireless.com verizon starts verifying calls with other carriers using stir shaken alright this is something that t-mobile and verizon excuse me t-mobile and att have already been doing for a while and guess what it doesn't work all right because i still get spam calls like crazy on you know on uh on a t specifically 18 t uh like oh my goodness i get spam calls on t-mobile and i seem to get the least amount on my verizon phones uh but my goodness att i get them like every uh you know every hour so what i did is i set my phone my s21 ultra on att to only accept contact only cause that's a good workaround if you don't have a lot of people that call you or you don't have important calls coming through but of course my s21 ultra is a secondary phone so that's even more doable for me so that's something you have to keep in mind another solution could be to call them and bug them about changing your number uh sometimes they you simply get a number that's already been used uh by somebody that you know was popular you know who knows you know maybe maybe the the the the drug dealer that lived across the street had your phone number and and that's why you're getting all those calls so you don't really know so but anyway moving on to the next article all right so this is important fiercewirelessagain.com coming through those guys uh make a lot of good articles i report a lot of good news check them out fiercewireless.com boost mobile told to stop ad claims for 4g lte unlimited data and streaming all right boost mobile has been told to stop advertising messages that say it offers unlimited data as well as sdn hd streaming for its 4g lte plans the national advertising division made the recommendations after a challenge by a t finding boosts unlimited claims couldn't be verified because of throttling after reaching monthly data limits for fixed you know or fixed by new disclosures uh boost not owned by dish network will stop the unlimited streaming related advertising but plans to appeal nad's ruling on unlimited data so there you go if you have boost mobile you probably haven't been getting what you think you were getting so that is something to consider when signing up to boost mobile um personally i hope that a dish puts this brand to good use uh makes it more of a disrupter like uh mr aderton uh used to run it kind of where he used to be the uh the disrupter in the industry so here's hoping that that's what you know dish decides to do with boost mobile because it's still a recognizable brand you still rec when you see that little icon that little uh you know um uh you know logo that they have you instantly know it's boost mobile so it's a recognizable brand i hope that uses it just like i was hoping that somebody would use the sprint brand i mean as much as people thought they hated sprint there is no denying that when you saw that you know yellow and black in that logo you knew it was sprint you knew who it was so i was kind of hoping that t-mobile would would have kept it as a prepaid brand right i i still feel that that it would have been a good decision make it a sub brand you know you got metro and then you got sprint prepaid or you know or or the alternative right sprint uh uh you know the alternative post paid plans whatever i was hoping that they were going to use it but maybe they were thinking that was going to create confusion because they were splitting the network so maybe that's what it was but um you know they still had a lot of customers they still had over 50 million boost mobile still has a good amount of customers so here's hoping that you know this does good work and puts them to good use uh at one point in my life i used boost mobile and it used to work great considering what you were paying for at the time you know considering how limited cell phone technology was when this was new but anyway i really appreciate y'all watching hit like subscribe comment make sure you hit that ring notification bell you all have a good one you", "wB9vpJulP_4": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] mainly good quality bugs box elated you're gonna want to pre-heat your oven to 290 degrees and you're gonna want to decarboxylate you know all your bud used you know shape or trim I mean you can add Keith into the mixture doesn't matter Ruth is looking on as much trichomes as possible you know good quality trichomes so you want to pre-heat the oven up to 90 and we're gonna put this in for one hour and if you do it on lower heat if you do that like 282 75 you can cook it on lower heat you're gonna have to add more time so I can so I can do that for like an hour and a half but I've always done on 290 and the person has showed me how to do it and I've always had really good medicine come out of it so this is de LOI and if I keep doing it but you can mess with your times and all that stuff if you want but I'm just showing you the way I do it so I'm gonna put this in for an hour and I will be back alright after you've let your uh we the decarboxylase and turn your oven and stuff off look you're charged with alcohol I recommend doing this with a Everclear if you can get it it's about 20 bucks for a good sized bottle like around like 23 I know some place it's not a legal so you can use ISO isopropyl alcohol rubbing alcohol but make sure you use ninety one percent or higher and if you use less than ninety one percent like if you get like the 74 percent or whatever the other one like this day sell like a couple of was a fifty percent you're gonna have to put it in the freezer and then though you know to get those water to separate from it to get the outcomes they're just bested by the ninety one percent or really the bug like the food grade alcohol it's available in your area and after I put the alcohol in here when I close them up I like to shake the [ __ ] out of them is it just to get the stuff mix it on I'm gonna put this in the freezer for 24 hours and you know every few hours or so I'll pull the jars up shake them up put them back in there and when this stuff comes out alcohol it should be like like really really dark brown almost like a black looking color when we're done before we cook it off and that'll be the next stage so that's right now oh yeah by the way make sure that you change out your jars or let these jars cool down you know think you don't want to be throwing hot glass in the freezer shattered see you guys filter your extraction I use the coffee filters the natural brown don't use the white ones because they have a bleach on and you don't want to introduce any of these chemicals into your medicine so you just let it kind of sit in there for all the jars we had when the cloth that we have the actual plant material tied up down below squeeze it up that big bowl over there and 1/4 than everyone utilized as you don't utilize every drop of it that you can to get the most yield and most out of your medicine as possible so I'll come back after we get this process done when we get to the final stage of actually cooking off the alcohol and show it's plain aptio and we'll get into that that's an example of how the extracted alcohol should look a dark really dark brown after it's all filtered and stuff it should be a really dark brown color the darker it is the more yield you're gonna get out of that extraction so that's what you're looking for we're looking for that dark color like that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] first off the seams are gonna be probably sick and second of all you know wants to use building up because then it's a huge explosion hazard so be very very careful [Applause] honestly if I had my own counsel and I probably in my backyard clicking this off upside back way that's honestly the best would be and the rear an apartment it's about a second best thing I'll be back when we get down near the bubbles little tiny bubbles that's the last process early you just wait to see that no more of its boiling off and stop seeing the bubbles and although that's don't be like a nice smooth clear surface which I'll show you when it's finally said look how low that temperatures see I'm saying and by the time it's done he'll be just like barely on from that low part you just keep lowering of temperature man as you go I'm looking for the bubbles all right to keep coming to boil it off but you're slowing it down keep the lower temperature when it's done and tastes it all you're gonna taste rate hash a straight love the straight hash matters all you're gonna taste you taste the alcohol it means you boil it off how much to go directly [Music] this right here I knew with this row all this makes me t oh that's how they all make the hatchling here remember all that oil we have left in that pot right there today you know later I went ahead and took some of this uh like yeah Maharajah chai boba boba dong and Samurai sorry mate long tea or some stuff we've got a team on some fancy expensive tea but it's booked involved this [ __ ] [ __ ] smells so [ __ ] me like straight up like I'm like cinnamon and [ __ ] masa and spices awesome let me put some a couple of cinnamon sticks in there this is the first pass you could get the most oil in it but this is all cannabis oil infused medicated teeth and there's the second pass which is can tell by the colors and Cortis down being strong but this would be good for relax and have some good this one you know get cuff of that one there we'll definitely set you up medicate you just like if you took a glob of the actual oil say that's what I do do I don't waste any of the concentrated oil I make I made tea boil it awful done you know the last amount that's left in the pan utilized everything you know that's how the world comes over doing just a shiny that's I don't make a will", "LN5SXL3g_ew": "yeah welcome back 6 for 20 Shorty and I want to get to say that video both oil to make I make the Phoenix tears and I make it with shaman and make it look less it look like this so the nice good-looking but you know no struggling to remember anything just good buzz and I put four ounces in this nice big jar and I take this down I actually have some stuff set up soon as video can be a little bit easier to do is I take this nice long vowel and push it up for about four minutes and then I let it rest for a bit and I come out here and i put my paint shiner on it and I take my jar classes over that time the dress fitting in I have my right of your hair handy and I take it now Junior and I had actually over the four ounces I put a bottle and almost probably about cheezers of the other bargaining but it's just enough to cover it with I mashed it up and that's kind of what you want is for it to those of soak in it and put a little bit and then I come out the way could it be this change a lot of people just strain it to year and that's it so that's what it soon as a pain trainer and 3b the coffee filter and I feel the SEC does a better job and this kind of has a careful and gate and there we go and you'll see what's in the bottom is the remnants of the last stuff that I did and it's the same exact strain so I left it in the bottom it was the last little bit of residue of the Phoenix tears I did before but it was also with the shaman so I thought okay I can just leave that and i have my cover i'm going to put it back on because that takes a little bit of time to soak through and into so i'll have to come back in a few minutes and put more in but its chain through and the more you put through there's longer it takes because just a bunch of sentiment and will fall in on the bottom some people take what's in the coffee filter and smoke it and whatever I am I just kind of snow the way I overweight though if it has any medicinal value or a stoner value or whatever gets you higher anything but I just I could not worry about it and just feel it the oil so i'll probably be coming back out and pouring more in without taking a video then we'll have my camera person but i will be coming back out when i turn it on and i'll show you about what looks like and then i will keep the videos gotten this i go to deposit okay so thanks for tuning in and i hope this set of videos is going to be helpful and hopefully i have a peaceful night", "5ndyQLqo3Y4": "what's happening party people we're here and I want to beep so odd as it sounds sounds weird coming out of my mouth usually it's I want to dad I want a bong hit one babe all of our faith cartridges are like dunzo check this out they're like it looks like there's something inside but there's nothing inside these I mean I could probably get like little baby hits but they're done I've been sucking on them dry bro like all of them we are out so the revival vape actually comes with empty hive cartridges you guys can see here and you just pop it open take this little thingy off and you can just pour your concentrates in there man simple as that so we're gonna take this syringe of beta my cream and we're gonna make a little vape syringe or vape cartridge with the syringe this is from nectar stick interesting people we see them at all the events they're always there pitching their stuff they sell these full grams in this container for $40 at the events it's probably gonna run you 50 or 60 out of dispensary but this one specifically normally they have like kind of ap flavors like strawberry cough and mango passion this and whatever I asked the guy what do you have for pain and it gave me this it's a ante what does it say pain relief sedative now actually that's upside down sorry guys now I actually hit these people up on Instagram because I was at the event you know I didn't necessarily get the proper explanation of the product you know it wasn't really the kind of place that you sit and you [ __ ] talk science and chemistry about cannabis and [ __ ] but I instagrammed them when I was like hey man I bought your Batum mersin I did I call it Mike Green earlier sorry mersin I bought your beta Mersin and I was curious I mean is this made with cannabis does this contain THC or CBD you know give me some give me some info about this all I have is the package and the package isn't too descriptive either zero PPM's solvent free ultra refined nothing doesn't tell you like percentages doesn't tell you anything so I'm curious like is this a pure I guess I should have explained it if you guys don't know with what beta mercian is I check it out on wiki because that's basically how I learned what it is it beta mercian is basically a component in cannabis it's like a terpenoid it's one of the things that are a part of the we'd like THC CBD CBN THC a all of those get you high and then there are actually compounds that give you flavor like limonene citrus scene or something lemons this is the citrus one hash machine there are a couple of different flavor compounds and these compounds are found in everything I could find citrus or limonene in limes I can find that in oranges I can extract it from those you know and it's also found in cannabis that's why some weed smells like oranges some weed smells like smoke it's are like smoke because you've spoken it some weed smells like like dirt and like earth you know like it literally has the same chemicals they're in those other things so this is one of those chemicals and if you smoke this chemical by itself or not smoke it but you know consume it it's supposed to make you feel relaxed sedative it's supposed to make you sleepy it's supposed to be a good anti and Kalama tori it's it's got a bunch of qualities you can read them all on the on the wiki so I got this and I was like man this should be excellent for medicating and then I had a realization where I was like isn't this the same [ __ ] that they have in mangoes that everybody says gets you higher if you smoke it or if you consume it so if I'm smoking like a really low grade weed or even if I just want to get higher supposedly if I eat a mango it's high in the Mersin and that is what gives me like a bigger high so I was like man this would be excellent for a cush Buster's or something where I'm like [ __ ] eating mangoes I'm literally gonna go to a scientist have him extract the Mersin give it to me straight up and I'll test it for you guys and I'll be like I'm gonna smoke a gram of this shitty weed and then take a hit of the mercy and and see if it helps then I'm gonna take a hit of the top shelf with the Mersin and see if that improves the hit as well and then do like control test like this is awesome so we're just gonna stick this in here like a mad scientist and just fill it up I want to I use it up I use half of this I want to leave some for dabbing but or just see if it even works let's just use less let's see if it even works you don't want to put all of your nugs in one basket you know what I'm saying I lost a little stopper there's like a little shirt oh there it is it's so tiny put the stopper in I guess I think I went the other way whoops got it all weedy so cool we do that and we're good to go let's try it out I've been smoking it I took it home you guys and I was like let's get [ __ ] up like we went to the event and it was like a marijuana edible sesh and if you guys watched the the podcast if you guys haven't seen it it's the podcast from the weekend of like May 14th May 15th like that and we talked about how we got trapped in the elevator we almost died going to like a weed event and if I get to the weed event and I don't even get to smoke that much or like get that high so I came home and I was like man I'm gonna take a huge hit and I literally smoked like a fifth of it at once and it was a immense hit it was super clean super flavorful particularly for the size usually you take a huge dab of something and it's really rough like it just it kills your lungs it's like it leaves you wheezing but it was super clean and a him Ian waves bro it was like at first like you kind of you feel a little bit after the initial hit but it doesn't like hit you and then like a couple minutes later you start you feel like almost like a wave hit you and like you feel like more buzzing more like higher and more relaxed and then like five minutes later boom like another wave a couple minutes later like another wave and eventually like after 15-20 minutes I was like oh gone I was just like laying in the couch like dunzo really nice I mean I smoked the point point to grammar but let's try it out I'll see how if it works cross your fingers for me I hate wasting weed drum roll please nothing I have to take the thingy out these thingies have the thingy the cartridges have the little stopper so I don't necessarily have to take the stopper out and it's hot I can feel it at the base it's just not it's not doing anything I'm glad I didn't put more one more time get in there get in there I think it's just so thick that it's having a hard time vaping it we're getting there we're getting there has a really good flavor to it it tastes it tastes very similar to the pickled monkey cartridges that we received I think they're using like a similar solvent free filler pretty sure now it's ripping brah brah it's ripping oh yeah it's pretty good it's pretty good I cannot tell you guys if it has THC or not in it I I can't offer the life let me tell you I would like to tell you that it doesn't and that I am smoking a pure beta Mersin and that this is simply the the effect of that because it almost feels a little different from a high when I take a big hit of this and I take a big hit of weed the high sit separately from each other if you know what I'm saying like one of them I like I know is like weed and on the other once it's like distantly in the back affectingly me very differently I don't know I wish they would get back to me on Instagram yo I hate when companies are like secretive about their process and like the products that they're giving you I'm literally [ __ ] smoking this and putting it in my lungs how about you [ __ ] tell me what's in this bro like people who make food have to literally list ingredients legally and that people who have these [ __ ] smokeable products don't even have to [ __ ] lab test it or anything it's crazy it was like a graphic the other day going around a mean and it was a I don't know the character name he's like a famous like character actor he has a curly hair he's like blonde and it's like um you have you notice you ever noticed how there's no more powdery mildew anymore ever since everybody to learn how to make concentrates and it was like like that [ __ ] like man you never know what you're putting into your lungs anymore you know like they could just take any weed they want run it and it just looks golden and good you know and unless it actually gets tested by a lab or something I'm not gonna know if it's safe or not to smoke so I hate when companies are like [ __ ] shady about [ __ ] like [ __ ] tell me bro like what the [ __ ] like I'm gonna go steal your process and whatever like as if there are like 10 other companies do right now how about you just be honest with your consumer base and let them know what they're literally smoking bro what strain is in this what am i even smoking is this even weed these are my questions I think they're fair I don't know but it's pretty far I ask these questions I semi complain but also smoke it also smoking I purposely did this one just so that I know I knew that I wouldn't necessarily waste the weed as much because I feel like big cartridges are more efficient than like dabbing like when you dab you just some of it burns away maybe it's too high temp of a dab like you're literally electronically controlling the temperature with the vaporizer so I feel like it's more efficient and what was my point with that right I wanted a lot of smoke because I'm actually doing a product shoot over there and I'm actually doing shots where like there's products all laid out and then I blow smoke and like smoke comes into the frame and like you know [ __ ] high production [ __ ] and it's actually been really hard to make like volumous smoke I literally that's why I have the illa Delft over here I was gonna pack a bomb hit for the shoot because I've tried vaping I've tried using is it here I tried using the dryer vape and I even tried taking a DAB and unless I took like a huge dab I couldn't get a significant volume of smoke so like look impressive enough on the screen so I have to pack some flowers bro into the old illy and start ripping I thought this would be it but it makes clouds but now I mean look at the size difference I mean if this made clouds this big I'd be scared like what is in this what witchcraft did they like make this with some make it do that but still pretty fire I'm gonna go get the weed pack up a bowl and I'll see you guys next time on the daily grind thank you guys for joining me and let me know what you guys are smoking on in the comments man you guys rocking a vape pen vape cartridge have you ever refilled one of these before do you make your own eliquid I think a couple of followers have mentioned in the past that they do their own like pg/vg mix or some [ __ ] like let me know in the comments I am really new to the whole vaping world so I am very curious to hear what people's personal preferences are particularly after they've had a consistent career token it up contouring on the vape level you know what I'm saying I'll see you guys next time stay regularly", "by-LOfhutBI": "hey guys happy medical Monday you were coming out to you live from green house wellness we got the dynamic duo the originals that you haven't even know what to call you here cuz you do so many things I'm gonna call you the creative director I let all but really you do so many things for us here and obviously I'm the medical director here at green house and we have gotten so many requests and so much information asked of us about RSO so we thought we would go ahead and hit that again especially because we thanks to our friends at grassroots that kind we have actually a nice supply our so so we're going to talk about that a little bit so it's good to have you good to see a happy happy money it's not raining which is first honestly I hope everyone's staying safe by the way all of our Howard County friends yeah that was a little scary there's a nice little lake in my backyard and I got a lot of the roads were closed exactly just a little shout out we are actually donating 10% of our sales of all of our yes this week until Sunday excess accessories there's the word for it so anything you need leave those grinders papers we have it all and we're gonna donate 10% of all the sales to Ellicott City rebuild yeah yeah so that's good so shout out to all you guys we know you've been through so much yes alright so now on to arm stuff so what is our so who was Rick Simpson that's what it's named for Rick Simpson oil Rick Simpson was an individual who I think back in the late 90s in Canada that's where he's from had suffered from some medical issues and he researched this on his own and found the natural healing properties of canvas so he developed it himself he's grooves on plants and concentrated that down and he actually had had some skin cancer it was a create it was like basil salt on his arm and he made our so Rick Simpson oil and placed it on his skin lesions and they evaporated and they gone so then he made it a purpose to train other people how to make their own and help them out and the government shut him down and all this nonsense but it has certainly stood the test of time and a lot of patience a lot of our own patients have been using Rick Simpson oil to treat a myriad of diseases so we're gonna talk a little bit about that because we get a lot of questions can I use this recreational ink anyways this for my diabetes can I use this for cancer so traditionally has been a cancer treatment or treatment for really bad medical problems and when we first started out having our so we were really reluctant to kind of share it with anybody except for our sickest patients with cancer but happily the supply is increasing sierra yeah and so we're able to have this conversation a little bit differently now so yes if you are fighting cancer Rick Simpson oil is great okay if you have major medical problems such as autoimmune disorders MS if you have epilepsy it's good for autism it's good for diabetes it's good for all kinds of things but respect it it isn't gas ratably strong so to our recreational users or to those who say can anybody buy RSO I say to you we have had a number of patients who I would consider to be super users would you say yeah super users who were really put down by this medicine they took too much and they were just sort of asleep think about it that's what it's designed for I think it's for treating people who are really ill you're you heal when you sleep young so the medicine is designed to put you down yep so keep that in mind I don't mind that respected I love that respected because a little does a lot yeah so these come in a around a little tube and each tube is one gram and when you start taking this you can take it a couple of different ways I'm a big fan of taking things orally I think that's the most ancient way of taking medicine it makes sense we have receptors and our body is designed for it and so I think that you should take just maybe a tenth of a syringe and put it on a cracker or sometimes people you've been put it on a banana and they swallow it down at bedtime and that the effects will then work all night long and you'll wake up in the morning hopefully not feeling too much of a head high I think we might have a question dr. Apgar we do have a question we have a question about the quantity of dosage an individual said the last life feed we recommended a cc or a milliliter for a new patient and he doesn't feel that's recommended in the cannabis industry can you expound on well the classic is a full gram or a full ml a day that's the classic recommendation that you'll see written in a lot of different articles and a lot of anecdotal reports and so what people will do is they'll kind of use 30 days to get their dosage up and get used to the Madison and then they'll put themselves on 60 days than a treatment that is the full gram or you know one I'm al syringe a day and personally I think that that's overkill especially after we talked to the makers of this and Matt said there's no way anybody's ever gonna be able to take a full syringe a day so my personal thought after researching this as much as I have is you get as much in you as you can but I don't know that you're gonna get much more than say a quarter or a half of this in a day so when somebody wants a dose and I respect that and I know that you would love for me to tell you take two aspirin every eight hours I'd love to be able to do that but as we know that cannabis does not work that way exact our bodies are so complicated our endocannabinoid systems are so different our sensitivity to the medicine is so different and our disease states are so different it's as individualized medicine so there is no dosage that I can tell any one person to take a day what I will do is consult with the patients and talk to them about how they're doing and obviously our wellness consultants are so good at this at talking to the patient's but it's how much can you tolerate a day certainly no more than this and quite honestly I don't think anybody would ever be able to take a full gram a day I do like the 90 days worth of treatment you know to get a decent amount in your system for 90 days I think there's enough anecdotal reports that that's effective and then as far as maintenance then you just go down to a little bit a day just to maintain I don't know that we can cure cancer guys I would never go out there and say that listen there this is a miracle cure for everything I just don't know that that's fair but what I can say is that if we supplement our bodies and we help create balance in our bodies and we have this medicine in our in our bodies we can help ourselves fight it off every day which is what in a healthy body we do every day doctor we'd have another question from Josh mm-hmm he believes that starting dough should not be recommended to be high like we're recommending I think there might be a miscommunication because I don't think I'm recommending that we start high I feel like I've said it a million times respect the medicine go very very very slow so I don't know how else I can say that but this is incredibly strong I would never recommend that anybody starts out on a high dose there's no way that you would be able to do it in fact in the reports it's that you would take a green of rice sized amount on a cracker at bedtime so there's also patients that will do this with suppositories and I think that that's fine supposedly there's less psycho activity that way and I'm not going to quibble with how you want to take the medicine I've always said I just think it's important that you get it in your body right it's personal it's the way you want to yeah yes exactly and if it's giving you too much psycho activity to take it orally then make a suppository and also I think you have to be aware of where your disease is like if you're treating a stomach problem when you're treating a colon a problem versus a skin problem I mean truly you can mix this with cocoa butter or any other carrier and use it topically just like Rick Simpson did it's really a very healing formulation and we're tickled that we have it and we have it in sufficient quantities and we've been assured we're going to continue to have the sufficient cleansing for you guys so that makes us happy so another question I know I've been getting hounded with which is why we're doing this yeah again is that patients are getting so smart and I'm so tickled that you guys are doing your education and you're watching these videos and you're doing your reading with that we love that yeah but patients have asked us what about CBD and I love that what about CBD we would love to have CBD added to our so but we don't have plants that are grown in sufficient quantities to then be able to make the concentrated oil from those things have are so in order to have CV DNR so at this point in time that said we do have CVD available in tinctures and it's really a trivial matter to take pictures by mouth there's no cycle activity with that you're not gonna feel a head high from that at all so you take this and then you also take your team shares with CBD and then you're getting the best benefits of all of it the other thing you can do is you can get vapes that have high CBD and you can be because honestly like I said I don't care how you get the medicine into your system you can eat it you can smoke it you can beep it you can put it on topically it's all helpful to help disease states yes so I know that we have another patient testimonial we did we have a toss a little bit working could you tell us a little bit about that we have somebody that we're filming who has she openly came to me and said I was a skeptic who has fibromyalgia treats chronic pain and we're gonna be filming her soon and hearing her story she said that she has one strain and specific that has changed her life that has given her physical strength she says she feels and helped her symptoms in terms of like pain and discomfort and then we have another patient who was treating his diabetes with cannabis I think also he was he got himself off of many Potter's entirely like a hundred percent off his narcotics and also lost 100 pounds are you kidding me so insane yeah don't press it off Assad dies oh no not aspiring it off everything yeah so we have some pretty cool right in our face patient testimonials and patient experiences that we're seeing directly with our own eyes and you guys it's just life-changing we're so grateful to be a part of it and to be able to bring you this really good medicine okay so what else about RSO do you think that patients are interested in the ration that I have gotten is that we know that they say that there is an indica and a sativa right way that they're right and again guys there is no such thing as indica sativa okay THC is a very very potent molecule and a little does a lot and so when you get a lot into your system I mean the psychoactivity is ridiculous when THC is combined with other cannabinoids and with terpenes it changes the effect on your body and it's hard to predict sometimes so I talked to Matt the one who made this actually and I kissed him big time on this because one of these is from a strain called Khaleesi and one of these is from a strain called dead cherries and I looked at the terpene profiles and quite honestly they're really not that different he swears up and down there'll be no difference between these things my big cloud showing these two strains and then like this one here by nature's heritage by our friends at kind they didn't even necessarily write down the strain I mean it's probably a combination of a bunch of different strains we have all of the terpene information right here so I don't necessarily know that we care about an indica or sativa that's not necessarily fair if you get too much THC in your system you may not sleep well okay that is a known side effect out of THC so that's why we want to be really cautious with that's my point I wanted you to wrap around it because it goes back to start low yeah go slow very small dosage and respect medicine and respect the medicine yeah we have talked to a couple of people who are more than a couple who didn't necessarily respect the medicine and paid a price it doesn't go well yeah I mean you'll be okay but it'll be fine but and then I last a long time it's not comfortable right sorry that's right thing let's pretend you do get too much are so guys like a pretend you do ingest too much you didn't necessarily respect the medicine there are some things you can do to help the anxiety or the discomfort that you might feel number one is drink tons of water so hydration is huge number two obviously sea cannabidiol is a molecule that kind of disrupts THC off of the cb1 receptors so if you had tea CBD tinctures around the house or you had a CVD heavy vape cartridge or something like that you could easily do that and then there's things that you have in your kitchen at any one time lemon limonene so fresh lemon and what am I thinking black pepper is another one that you can use that is another sort of treatment that everybody has around the house and then you know what it is it's tincture of time you just have to wait it out and understand that it's all going to be okay you are gonna get rid of stay calm yeah quiet be in a safe place yes everyone will be behind exactly great questions about strains so what else do you think that we need to talk about as far as our so goes we heard any other big questions those are the biggest questions okay and I know price happily we're selling this for $60 which is amazing such a great and we're so grateful to the makers to the producers the growers oh my gosh but a huge gift that is to Maryland that we're making this in a way of providing it any way that it's affordable exactly I love it dr. Akbar we do that / - what are the providers or who makes this can you so right now we have grass roots that is making these two different versions of it its Khaleesi and Daenerys and then we have kind therapeutics nature's heritage and they are providing us also with RSL so we have two different growers and processors that were now you're hearing yeah hopefully more to come yeah we like competition thanks so much for all of your questions you guys yeah we really really should talk to you yeah and we will see you at next month's see you next Monday guys I bite", "2eGDX3Wg-Ko": "so apparently this

guys I used to weigh about 180 590 pounds I was really blocky and then all of a sudden I started losing weight Oh what's happening here you know and I was getting afraid of it and as weight was coming down I hit around 160 170 and then 165 and then I hit it 160 and all of a sudden I stopped losing weight just like the oil knows this is what you should weigh did properly right back to a healthy weight if you look at me you see every stomach muscle there's no fat on me it just really brought me back to a state of very good health the medical aspects of this plan they vary from strain to strange I mean practically all the heavy indica strains that are very sedated but what I've seen with them practically all of them could kick your cancer but you would get strange some strains are better for lowering ocular pressure for people that have glaucoma or controlling blood sugar for diabetics they all vary and I mean this is what we have to determine in the future which strains are the best I tell people to take doses three times a day like early in the morning mid-afternoon in about an hour before they go to bed so when you take that doses when you're beginning when you take that dose in the morning about an hour later the oils tell", "UNsCTHC7N3I": "[Music] what's going on guys it's your boy Tubbs here and welcome back to my channel I've enjoyed the video make sure you

people don't really know all of this but THC is the cancer killer and this is what you got to remember now CB in you know in hormone driven cancers such as breast cancer CBD can have some good benefits there's no question but in most of the cancers I've seen you know lung cancer bowel cancer whatever brain cancer the higher is a THC level the better and I've always said you know the higher of this extract will get you the more chance you have to keep be healed and I've seen this over and over you know treating terminal cancer patients you know it's as I said you know they for breast cancers and things like that a certain amount of CBD could be beneficial but for God's sakes you've got to have the THC too you know it's it's a lot like dr. Michelin said you know it's the entourage effect of all these different cannabinoids working together but you see today they're trying to separate them you know CBD or CBN and all these different cannabinoids there's well over a hundred of them you know the drug industry would like to separate everyone and say well this is good for that and this is good for something else it's a bunch of nonsense take the damn extract and I mean it might make you high in the beginning I won't deny that but getting high never hurt no one and the thing is what once you become accustomed to an extract you become immune to it that's how I get people up usually within a month up to a vote of gram every 24 hours but if you get up to that dosage and if you get a different extract from a different strain and you take that same dosage you're going to get as high as a kite but again nobody ever died from cannabis I mean the CBD has a very positive effect on epilepsy but what we found in so many cases you know by taking CBD it definitely reduced the number of seizures but in so many cases they still continued to have the seizures and I know good I've had reports from a good number of people that added some THC to it no more seizures the same thing with autism they thought that CBD might be good for autistic children but actually they found it have a detrimental effect but THC does not you know all of these cannabinoids are important and so is CBD but like I said never underestimate you know the you know the THC is definitely needed any extract it doesn't contains THC I don't even can I don't even consider to be you know hemp extract", "9Ly4BQ8slHM": "What up everyone, welcome to the cancer spartan podcast my name is Jose Galicia and today I want to talk a little bit about Rick Simpson oil ok so let's just get right into that people keep talking about the benefits of using medical marihuana to heal cancer\n and after doing a very small research\n if you are into natural cures and natural healings then you inevitably will come across Rick Simpson's oil\n or RSO and it's anti cancer properties with are many\n well anyways, so today I want to talk about who is this guy? who is Rick Simpson\n also what is his oil? what is RSO? what are the potential benefits of using this oil? and are there any side effects? or any risks that you should be concerned about? so we're going to be talking about that today so to tell you a little bit about my story\n my personal story with RSO many years ago I heard the rumor that the marijuana plant cured cancer it was a thing almost diabolical if you will I am from Guatemala, born and raised and marijuana down there is commonly associated with other hard drugs because it's also dealt by drug cartels and drug dealers so.. and to be more specific is commonly associated with cocaine is not very nice, but anyways so marijuana did not have a very very good reputation down there\n and as more and more friends and family around me started getting diagnosed with cancer\n I also kept repeating my findings to them but they just didn't believe me I was like look marijuana cures cancer but any of my findings were not very well received so anyways, years later\n when I was diagnosed with cancer this time I was secretly excited because I was going to be able to prove to myself and to my friends that marijuana actually cures cancer\n the only problem I had is where the heck can I find it? so I started documenting the best that I could my journey through cancer using mostly social media and more specifically Instagram and Facebook I started by mentioning what I was doing daily to heal my cancer my food, juicing, some natural supplements my meditations, the black salve and one of this days a lady in California contacted me and said she had cancer and it was in stage 4 she felt very compassionate for me and sent me a big supply of RSO I immediately started consuming it and felt a big change\n in my health and recovery but the question still remained in my head what exactly is RSO? working in Canada he was working in a hospital boiler room covering the asbestos of the hospital pipes with aerosol glue so you can imagine this poor guy was working for long periods of time in constant exposure\n to toxic fumes\n he started having health problems and that lead to some lumps in the skin that were actually an advanced form of skin cancer\n having successfully treated other health symptoms with marijuana in the past he took the decision to make a concentrated oil from the marijuana plant and apply it with a bandage to the cancerous spots in his body\n and leave it covered for a few days what happens is that after only 4 days the cancerous lumps in his skin had disappeared and Simpson became a true believer in the powers of medical marijuana and so did I doctors refused to recognize the influence of marijuana in Rick Simpson's recovery but this didn't matter to him for he started planting marijuana plants in his own property to make more oil when the plants were ready, he then proceeded to make lots and lots of his medical oil and started helping cancer patients in his hometown for free and more and more cancer patients started mysteriously getting healthy again Rick Simpson has helped thousands of people for free but not without multiple setbacks such as getting arrested by the Canadian police and also getting the plants in his property confiscated multiple times but he continued in his mission to help people and now we are all benefiting from his efforts God bless you Rick ok but what is this oil? what is RSO? ok, the marijuana plant is truly a gift from God guys it has a lot of medical benefits for the body as well as the mind regardless of the strain it has two main components THC and CBD THC is the stuff that gets you high and you feel the effects when you smoke it or if you consume edibles infused with cannabis on the other hand CBD does not get you high but CBD is the main reason behind all the cancer survivors whom dared to brake the law so we can say that RSO is CBD oil according to Simpsons recommendations\n a good CBD oil should be made with the indica strain from marijuana this is because indica is loaded with calming effects and this helps with chronic pains associated with cancer are there other benefits associated with RSO? yes, yes indeed RSO is probably the most common alternative to cancer treatments and sadly the most illegal but it doesn't end here it has also been used to treat successfully asthma, multiple sclerosis, anxiety, depression inflammation, arthritis, insomnia, high blood pressure, epilepsy as well as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s disease and even eating disorders.\n ok so all of this sounds very very good but what's the key? what's the trick? are there any side effects? are there any risks involved in this? just like any new medicine or drug out there in the market using this product also comes with some cons Some studies show that when you use marijuana you can experience some red eyes, depression, low blood pressure, paranoia, irritability, and impaired memory for a few minutes then these side effects go away but the benefits stay.\n ok that being said, sadly the legalization of marijuana in the United States is something that is happening little by little, but it is happening and everyday more and more dispensaries are popping up all over the place and in states like California they are becoming very common. So if you have access to a doctor that can prescribe you a marijuana card and you\u2019re around a dispensary then you\u2019re all set But if you don\u2019t then simply find the instructions on Rick Simpson\u2019s website how you can make your own RSO and be cancer free Actually you can become any harsh disease free I\u2019ve even seen parents that are willing to break the law give this medication to their kids to save them from epilepsy attacks and guess what?

I'll post a video every few days\nand keep updated on the progress at this point I definitely recommend it to\nanybody who can try it", "lxrhXWVQT_g": "what's going on guys my name's rich can see and I am a 6-time cancer survivor and founder of 5-time foundation and today we're going to talk about a really hot topic cannabis oil and dosing aka I don't like using this term nobody should use it he was the founding father yes but it's not called Rick Simpson oil it is called eco full extract cannabis oil and before we start this is gonna be a video about dosing because there's a whole misconception about it but first I would like to give a shout out to a very special woman who was almost like a mentor and she is my mentor Robin Swan Firebird touch therapy I love you very much and thank you for changing my life for the better so we're dumped we're gonna jump right into dosing okay and there's a misconception and it's you know it's 60 grams in 90 days or a gram a day and you know what I'm sure it works yes it does work but you're gonna you're gonna you're not gonna function Dara Daley okay I don't care if you smoked for 20 years if you wait 100 brownies you're not functioning okay it's tough and this is just a more effective way to have your body saturate in it okay I look really time with the white t-shirt and the chain but let's get into it okay well we like to call it what she started was a thing called micro dosing and this is a really great way to start and this is the way to do it and it allows your body to saturate in this and and it really absorbs it and you're still able to function throughout the day and do your thing okay if you're taking a gram a day you're gonna be tripping balls somewhere in a bush or they're gonna just be sleeping a lot like you know mommy likes her valium like one it always you know you don't want to do that okay my crack jokes in this video once in a while they might not be appropriate but I hope you still share it so I had this little card here that they made I kind of memorized it but if I look down at it you know don't frown upon I still know what I'm talking about okay so like it says here you know first of all I want to say make sure you know you're getting there there are people out there who mean well and they want to make this oil and they're making they're freaking backyard okay good stuff ain't cheap and cheap stuff ain't good remember that know what you're getting you want that golden color you know that golden tint to it you want to you know if you can get the lab certificate you know that'd be great tells you the percentages you want that eighty percent mark it's it's gonna work okay um and like they said you know you want to work up to 150 to 300 milligrams a day you could do the math you know five grams syringe obviously if there's 800 gram 800 milligrams in here per you know the deal will get into a to another time that'll be another video okay so this is called micro dosing okay and instead of starting instead of starting in the morning we're gonna start at night and we're gonna work our way backwards and we'll get into that so pretty much it's gonna it's called micro dosing I know if I said that already we're gonna you're gonna unscrew this top you're gonna take a toothpick you're gonna slide that just a tip just a tip like in high school you take the tip the cannabis oil eat it whatever your bedtime is an hour before bed I'll take it 10 p.m. by 11:00 I'm feeling nice it goes off you're good to go do this for two three days if you feel like it didn't affect you then you could skip the two to three day thing you're gonna go for hours prior which would be if you took it at 10:00 p.m. it would be 6 p.m. so now after that third day take that toothpick again do it at 6 p.m. then again I 10:00 p.m. go to bed guess what do that for 3 days another 3 days you're gonna jump another 4 hours prior that would be 2 p.m. I had to look down I'm bad at math ok so you're gonna start at 2 p.m. with the toothpick 6 p.m. with the toothpick 10 p.m. with the toothpick your fourth dose for fourth dose will be at 10:00 a.m. okay after another 3 days your body should be getting accustomed to that toothpick dose and guess what you can either decide to continue this way start it backwards or the scheduled start at 10:00 a.m. and work your way down to 10 p.m. and see how you feel and increase the dose every week you know I think I go I just go just go with it you know if you feel like oh I really didn't feel that drop at 6:00 p.m. take a little bit bigger drop at 2:00 p.m. but remember you can always eat more you can never eat less okay so be cautious what you're dosing cuz this stuff is strong okay and it is you shouldn't have any crazy side effects except rip balls and you know if you get really that hot you can end up like panicking I don't know or sleeping too long forget the picky kiddo from school I don't know whatever you got going on with yourself okay but this is called micro dosing okay it's 2019 no disrespect to the founding father and all this stuff that's 60 grams and 90 days is just a whole new thing you know and and don't forget this is the this is the basic way of taking it there's other ways to use cannabis oil dabbing it smoking it guess what for lung cancer yeah people vape this stuff and it's healthy for you okay and for cancers like I've seen like in the lower back or like cervical : you know prostate suppositories okay look into this stuff do your research me and Robin are gonna go on Facebook live and do our own videos and we're gonna get deeper into this stuff but this was on my head and there's a lot of you know you know they people don't know they're not educated on it you know and this stuff is medicine and it helps people and it helped me and I'm excited about taking it this way because the other way I could not do I was getting too high I couldn't function throughout the day I got fat it's not a bad thing some people need to gain weight and eat I'm back on track now ready to go so I hope this was an interesting video and I hope this helped you and I hope you guys can share this I will also

familiar with it it's the whole plant it's the cannabinoids and the medicine from the entire plant which makes it much more effective for all kinds of issues so if you haven't done your research look it up CBDs and then whole plant Rick Simpson oil is pretty awesome if you like to partake but it's very strong so the first night I did the rice sized amount and I woke up in the middle of the night and I was just like bathe and bliss and golden light now stretching and all of a sudden it turned into like a mini ayahuasca forgiveness ceremony with myself I was forgiving all people in my life forgiving them and forgiving me and forgiving them for giving me my boob was connected to the cosmos I was releasing energy and any fears or resentments or pain or shame or anything was just released into the universe I there was a fire like a Sun and my heart just burning through anything that was out of alignment so I'm like yeah this is good I said doubled my dose the next night and the next night it was all about forgiving myself and forgiving myself and even apologizing to myself for ways that I haven't honored myself or I made decisions out of fear and created any kind of resentful relationships or and you know this is this is work I've been doing a long time I've been doing forgiveness work for a long time and consciously I have no issues with anybody but clearly there's some deep-rooted stuff like just you know guilt around being a bad mom or like resenting her father for not providing you know it's like these things I chose him so I have no one to blame but anyway that felt like it led to like a domino effect of more choices made from stress so I'm just healing all those relationships and healing myself and forgiving myself and forgiving myself forgiving myself pretty epic then the next light like oh I can't wait to go to bed ha ha ha so I do even more and I get this like full-on I think my receptors are on but I got this full-on DMT experience with the perpetual motion vibration energy going through my body I'm like dancing and stretching and vibrating and puttering my feet and just like shaking out everything it felt so good then I proceeded to be totally stoned the whole next day like indica haze but I proceeded with the treatment the next night and then the same next day just like all day burnt and so that made me feel like a patient that made me feel lethargic and like a dork and just like I was a little concerned I was like I don't want to feel like this I didn't feel like anything was wrong with me before it's bad enough that I announced to the world that I have this issue I don't really want to be labeled by it or perceived myself as sick I don't feel sick but now I'm freaking burnt so luckily I did some dancing and cut back a little bit on the nightly plan and I feel totally good again totally clear sharp I think I was just going through some healing days because I'm detoxing in other ways we'll talk about that later but detoxifying and stimulating the immune system are crucial things to be doing in my situation so I just wanted to give you an update on the Rick Simpson oil we're so blessed to be on this earth it has a plant that has so many uses including healing diseases and epilepsy and skin problems and also we can make paper and teepees and clothes and canvas and fuel and plastics and we're really blessed if we could just get our heads out of our arses and use all these amazing resources that the earth has all the medicine that we need so we're super grateful and I'm so grateful because it could be worse I can still dance I can still talk I am so so so blessed so never forget how blessed you are and sending you so much love I'm sending you so much love through this video okay I hope you can feel it if nobody loves you annalisa loves you okay we got this hang in there we're all healing something alright ciao for now peace", "KdvTDn-z24U": "just like you're not done their age okay

insights and strategy i'm will townsend and joining me again this week is fellow analyst angel sag so let's get started with my first topic today i participated in a nokia capital markets day it started at 7 am my time so i needed lots of coffee but um but it was great to tune in their ceo spoke to a number of things and they had the heads of each of their business units speak to a number of topics as well you know from my perspective i thought uh pekka their ceo did a great job in articulating their strengths and fixed wireless access optical private wireless and open ran i also liked what he focused on with respect to aligning customer and partner to focus on best of breed solutions versus end to end so historically nokia's focused on soup to nuts and honestly that's not the way a lot of operators purchase infrastructure they typically leverage multiple vendors and suppliers for not only continuity of supply but also from a cost perspective so i think this is a you know it's it's a it's a divergent strategy for them but under his leadership i think it's the right thing to do and then you know finally i like the way that he summarized his strategic plan which was reset accelerate and scale and you know it's it's no secret that the company did announce a pretty major reduction in force um i was contacted by matt kemko from sdx central this week uh to get my insight on that and really um it's it's it's just a natural progression given where the company needs to retrench and invest in things that they're very strong in such as private networking and openran so and there was also an announcement that came out today between 18 t and nokia on c cban so i thought i might toss it to you angela you take our listeners and viewers through that yeah so nokia signed a deal with att it's a five-year deal for nokia to supply supply equipment to att specifically for fi for the use in the c-band spectrum um and it will be used utilizing nokia's massive mimo antenna solutions their macro remote radio heads and their next generation air scale baseband equipment so it's a good deal for nokia because i think they've needed to get big wins like this so i think for att it's going to be going up be a big opportunity to scale out its c-band network and it's banned and i think they're not going to be the only ones i have a feeling we're going to see a lot more c-band deployments using nokia so we'll see we'll see what happens in the long term but things may start to change for nokia when it comes to the big big three in the us yeah no i agree and um what's the timing on on att's deployment there i believe the first phase will start happening in the latter part part of 2021 okay as the spectrum becomes available i believe at t got 40 megahertz out of the 100 that was a in the a block uh and ryzen got the 60 hertz of that so 18t we'll start rolling out 40 megahertz at the end of this year so they do have a reason to be announcing this deal now in anticipation of a spectrum being available at the end of the year yeah no i agree um well att is off to the races there so let's move to your first topic this week and you want to talk about some new uh mid-price point um samsung phones yeah so this week samsung had uh yet another unboxed event this event was much more targeted on the mid-range and low end of its devices as opposed to the s-series flagship phones so everyone's familiar with the you know the s21 the note 20 those top-end you know fairly expensive phones but they also have very popular mid-range which is the mid-range device a series uh they've actually came out with these a series devices last year and kind of really built on a very comprehensive 5g offering this year they're kind of refreshing those a series devices with the new a52 and new a72 but they're also introducing the a525g which is a very affordable about 400 5g phone with you know triple cameras and all the normal expected high tier device capabilities and it's using uh qualcomm snapdragon processors rather than uh no than using this samsung exynos chip so it's an interesting um announcement and i think it'll help samsung grow in the mid tier which is where a lot of its competitors have been succeeding yeah and obviously these are 5g enabled phones and this is just a proof point to something that we've talked about quite often on our podcast that um qualcomm is developing a whole line of chipsets and modems that are going to support that entry level that mid-range and that high-end range right yeah and also what's interesting is not all of these phones are 5g so the regular a52 is 4d and the regular a72 is 4g so not all these devices are 5g however they do have the potential to have 5g models down the road which i believe they will and they have all the specs and features you would expect from a top-end phone it's just they don't have the top-end soc they don't have and they don't all have have 5g interesting cool well let's move to my second topic this week i want to talk about airspan networks um they have a pretty interesting history so they've been around for about 20 years they were focused on that wimax standard if you recall that anshul and um when that you know when the basically the room cleared on on wimax they pivoted to developing lte um small cell solutions and the rest is history and um and so this week there were a couple of announcements one um yeah i don't know if you follow the stock market and these special acquisition um special purpose acquisition specs right so um there's a spac um ironically uh with the initials mba it's not not professional basketball it's new beginnings acquisition corporation and so the news uh was around the fact that spack and airspan are going to merge and they're going to create a new ticker symbol for the combined company called mimo kind of like that pretty clever and what it's going to do it's going to allow the the new entity to tap into almost 170 million dollars in funding so that they can develop um you know 5g solutions i mean airspan has been again very focused on small cell they partnered with sprint to develop their magic box before the t-mobile merger airspan also acquired mimosa networks that provide six wireless access solutions for wisps and the company also has a line of cbrs certified solutions as well to support private networking so from my perspective this provides you know equity to the company they don't have to go through a traditional ipo process which is one of the benefits of a spac and it again it gives them this revenue that they can invest in 5g so i think that puts a lot of momentum you know behind the company they're already well positioned you know the other announcement this week was an announcement around openran with rakitan surprise and and so airspan is going to supply um basically virtualized hardware software and blueprint infrastructure blueprints to help extend the capabilities of rakhitan's um open rand deployment and so you know from my perspective the company has lots of different you know opportunities to really go expand into and uh i think airspan is a company you want to keep your eyes on any thoughts no i think it's interesting i i think mimo is an interesting ticker for them yeah and i'm going you know public vs back and merging with another entity makes sense uh we'll see if it's kind of the trend right now but uh yeah i i don't really have that much to add on this topic specifically all right cool well let's move to your second topic this week and you want to talk about huawei and 5g royalties yes so earlier this week huawei had an ipr event where they kind of said that they are going to start charging a lot of device makers for the most part uh royalties on their uh their patents uh similar to what ericsson and nokia and qualcomm already do and it makes sense in the sense that huawei is one of the leading companies in the world when it comes to developing new 5g technologies and it makes total sense that they would have a lot of patents in their portfolio related to 5g devices because they want are developing both the network and the devices and there's probably a lot of things in there that they are they're the creators of uh so i think that them going after these 3 000 5g patents that they have and whatever the number is for the standard essential patents which are called seps once they start asking for licensing fees i have a feeling they're going to be some lawsuits involved because that's just normal how it happens um and some negotiations that will occur so we probably won't hear of huawei's intent to sue any of its non-paying royalty holders until you know let's say next year once they've already had some you know negotiations in place and whatever negotiations have fallen apart you know i've seen a lot of these patent you know negotiations and disputes in the past so we'll see what happens in terms of who decides to who decides the license and who decides not to and who you know wants to fight huawei but always said that they were gonna put a two point two point two dollar fifty cent cap on the licensing fees that they're going to charge for these patents so they're not going to be very expensive and i expect that this may potentially raise the price of devices somewhat because no one's been paying these yet uh but i think it will be interesting to see how device makers approach this yeah well you know i you know i can't fault wildlife for doing this um they invest an incredible amount of their annual revenue back in r d i think over the last their last fiscal year it was close to 20 billion us dollars and you know on a base of 100 billion in gross revenue so they're certainly up there you know with the biggest technology companies in the world and yeah and like you mentioned they're one of the most prolific patent filers not that patent counting is any indication of innovation from my perspective but you're right they contribute quite a bit to 5g they contribute quite a bit in the open source community as well some might argue the depth of that but um certainly you know it's it's no surprise to to see this news coming and to your point it'll be interesting to see how this really sort of affects the bill of materials moving forward but we'll keep an eye on it and we'll report back as things develop but let's move to my third topic and for the week and i want to talk about um a low and mid-band spectrum auction that occurred in the united kingdom so uh and it was interesting the amount of money that was raised 1.4 billion pounds now i know translated to dollars um that gets you into the the three billion you know dollar range but i i was struck thinking that you know we just exited the c band auction that raised 82 plus billion um maybe the uk is being a lot more practical and not trying to fill the government coffers what do you think um i think that they probably have a better relationship with the operators and they've probably had a discussion about what's fair and i think that they have probably had this discussion where the operators said you can charge us what you want but if you charge us too much we won't be able to roll out 5g fast enough so i think i think they had a much more agreeable stance in terms of this auction that said it seems like there was only 200 megahertz of um spectrum being auctioned is that right it was about 200 i believe so yeah yeah so there wasn't that much spectrum being auctioned off uh especially since some of it was in the 3.6 gigahertz band um but in general it seemed like uh it was a lot of low band and mid band which is going to be necessary for good 5g coverage yeah um i i just think that a lot of these operators have spectrum and they want to obviously fill whatever gaps they have and they all kind of just agreed probably that they're not going to run up an 81 billion dollar bill make it crazy yeah now there's also news this week you and i were talking before we got started today on um some mid-band assets that are tied to the global harmonization standard right so you want to give us an overview of that yeah so in october the fcc is expected to roll out another spectrum auction they just completed one and we're going to have another one in october and that one in october is going to be targeted at the 3.45 to 3.55 and of spectrum which is a big deal because that is essentially in the 3.5 gigahertz harmonized global 5g band so we can hopefully have devices in the world that will be able to work globally at 3.5 gigahertz everywhere in the world obviously there's not going to be the same amount of spectrum in every place you're not going to have you know necessarily the same speeds everywhere but the idea of having 3.5 gigahertz as a globally harmonized 5g band is a big deal because it just allows people to travel around the world and have have their devices work on other networks without needing to have every band in the universe supported yeah no i agree you know it's you know it's it's going to make you know that that experience that running experience that much better especially for folks like you and i that once we put code hopefully in the rearview mirror by mid-year we'll be back on flights to europe and asia and all over the place so cool um so let's roll to your third topic this week and i know you've been doing a lot of writing on forbes and you've published two in a series of the state of 5g so would love to hear you know some highlights from from those first two articles you've written on forbes yeah so it's a very long article there's literally no way i'm going to be able to summarize it but but i will say the highlights it originally started as a six thousand word article and it became two three thousand word articles yeah basically part one which was already published last week covers the state of 5g networks modems and rf and then part 2 which published this week covers devices standards and what to expect in 2021 and beyond so i kind of cover mostly a u.s centric view um but there is a little bit of global views on that no one person can can fully comprehend the entire global 5g um landscape it's just not happening um so especially not in a one two parter um so the way i look at it is i kind of look at where we are today what that means for devices what kind of what is the state of standards and you know what is the six-month delay going to mean for the industry um and what are the operators plans for rolling out spectrum and devices and what to expect and i kind of have really gone in and found the most up-to-date information from every operator every device maker all the latest devices the samsung a series did not make it the announcement was after publication couldn't squeeze it but you have it here go check it out it's on forbes it's a two-parter um and i highly recommend you read it it's it's a good one i spent quite a lot of time on it so i hope you guys enjoy it yeah yeah i i scanned through it it was you know quite comprehensive it's a great job um you know and for our listeners and viewers it's quite easy if you just google um forbes more insights and strategy you'll find our landing page you'll find um a lot of things that i've written on 5g as well as these two articles that angela is speaking to as well so hey buddy another great podcast why don't you take us home absolutely we hope our viewers and listeners found this week's topics interesting if anyone out there would like to reach out to us and provide a special or specific topic about 5g would like for us to cover on the podcast please reach out to us on social media will is at willtown tech and i'm at onshore sag we hope you have a great weekend and please tune again next week", "Zfgnzd1rVt8": "let's focus our discussion first on marijuana I'm good feels like nasty subway station we're like

rick simpson we will have our talk in english but i will try to translate everything into German as well so hello and welcome to Germany Rick Simpson really nice to meet you we had yesterday our first meeting which was for me really special but a really warm welcome so I have to say like I told you before I didn't know your name before I did some research a few minutes and found out like I got the picture like you were like The Godfather of Mariana and health if you want to call it like this but can you introduce yourself to the people who don't you not your name like what is your story or how did you came to all of this what's your background how do you get off well first off my name is Rick Simpson and I'm from Nova Scotia Canada and back in 1972 I watched my cousin die a horrible death from cancer you know he was 25 years old and I just couldn't believe what I was seeing but but at that time cancer was rare you know it was very rare at was what what in the 70s in the seventies in 1972 when he died like he I was about 23 years old myself and he was the first man our first person I ever knew that had cancer and he's also the first person I ever knew who died from it so it was quite rare at that time but things have gotten much worse since and of course but it was about three or four years later I was leaving work this day it was around 1975 and the report came on our local radio station and of course the announcer was at and laughing like a fool but he stated that a study in the u.s. had determined the THC the active ingredient in the marijuana or I prefer to call it cannabis marijuana is just a slang term but th-the THC in the cannabis plant was killing cancer cells and but it was put to me in such a way that it was like a joke yeah it's like a full yeah so it's stuck in my brain but I worked in the medical system myself as an engineer but in 1997 I suffered a severe head injury and this left me with what they call post concussion syndrome and then of course they started and I have this ringing in my head 24 hours a day very high-pitched balance issues my blood pressure was crazy they couldn't do a thing you know for me I went to the medical system they gave me all of these different prescriptions they made me nothing but worse but about a year after I was injured I was watching an episode of the nature of things with dr. David Suzuki and on this it was called reefer madness 2 and it showed all these patients with many different conditions smoking cannabis okay when was this on the timing scale this was nineteen seventeen seventy eight the fall of 1978 and when I watched this I mean I had smoked cannabis before but I never looked at it like a medicine so I went out and I got some cannabis and when I smoked it sure enough it worked better than anything the doctors were giving me and in Canada we had what they called a marijuana access program and so I when I went to the doctor's afterwards I asked them for prescriptions you know so I could you know illegally use the plant and but every doctor said the same thing you know it's bad for the lungs it's still under study and all this nonsense you know I mean a plant that's been used in medicine for five thousand years is still under studies its against so well I smoked a little bit of cannabis along with the medications but the cannabis did help me more but still I couldn't get a prescription and then in 1999 the effect of these chemicals and pills they were giving me we were making me suicidal and like depression and all you feel like you're in a hopeless state you know 24 hours a day noise you can't sleep you know you're really exhausted all the time it was just horrible so I was getting very desperate so I just the state popped into my head as well what would happen if you washed you know the trichomes or the resins that on the bud material if you wash that resin off with a good solvent and then filtered you know the mix and then boil to solve it off what would you have so like the basic the basic out of it like the core ingredients of its everybody anybody that used cannabis they know you could you can see the crystal on the bud material often it'll looked like almost like frost yeah you know stick straight out and that really that's what gets you high but that's also what gets you healed because the cannabinoids are in these resins all these wonderful healing cannabinoids so just just for my understanding because I'm not so into this topic like from a scientific point of view and that gets lot lots of people aren't as well what are the ingredients of let's say basically we have to plant there are I think two ingredients in it or what is it made of or what are the two substances are well we don't even know the right number a good friend of mine dr. Amir Anoosh he did a study here and I mean Lemire is one of the top experts in the world he works directly with Michelin right there at Hebrew University in Jerusalem okay he isolated a hundred and eight different cannabinoids and he said there's still more so we have no idea home we don't even know how many cannabinoids that plant consume to globe everywhere different types of ingredients or cabinets well you know the strains vary in their cannabinoid levels from strain to strain but the main ones people concentrate on are like THC CBD as are cbn CBG and it goes on and on and on but but the you know all of the all of the studies which were done by people like by like people in like Lemire Anoosh and what's the spanish researcher in madrid guzman and there's several other ones but they've all done their research with THC and they've achieved amazing results you know using that cannabinoid now there's a lot of attention being paid right now to CBD now CBD does have its medical benefits but I would suggest that anybody that's suffering from cancer you had better take an oil that has a high THC content so if you could to describe it in for a point a few CBT has what effect or THC has what effect like like I heard like one one has to be like you you you feel a little bit not drunk but you know in a state and the other one it's like expanding your consciousness how do you describe it for yourself well now you're talking about the different strains I mean there's there's three there's three different varieties there's sativas indicas and then there's ruderalis but that's more like an industrial Russian ditch weed that's really what it is but it's the indie cuz I always work with now when you smoke a good indica it makes you want to go lay down and relax and then when you make an extract from a good indica like the concentrate is a very is really a very powerful it's you know it's very very sedated and that's very important for the healing process but these other strains out there the sativas and you see a lot of sativas grown here in europe because they grow tall and they want those long fibers in the old days they made everything with cannabis and so there was a lot of sativas grown but a sativa like you make an extract or even smoke a sativa the bud material it's energizing and that's the last thing in the world you do not want a cancer patient energized you know if somebody's dying with terminal cancer you want them laying and sleeping so they can start or the healing process starts better if it's like more in a slower state or comma States or why don't you want to like give him energy for the healing process it started way around well we're talking about people that are at death's door you know I mean sleep and rest is part of the healing process and that's what the strong indica extracts promote but now a sativa extract would be fine to treat skin conditions skin cancers maybe third-degree burns that type of thing sativa would be just fine but for ingesting the name of the game is the indica extracts and if you want to make the best extracts see I used to grow many different indica strains and I used to mix you see all cannabis is not created equal you know some strains well luckily for us most indicas there seem to be effective in the treatment of cancer very effective and harmless but you know other strains are better for pain relief than some or some are better for lowering ocular pressure for glaucoma patients or lowering blood sugar for diabetics do you have any hints for people who can't to get more into this topic like which strain is would you recommend for what I can't recommend strange because this whole seed industry there's no stability yeah you have it's all this mixed under oh yeah I mean you don't know you you send to five different seed companies and buy say a strain called Northern Lights when you but when you get those see whenever a very famous stream okay but if you bought that same strain from five different seed companies when you grew it you'd find your growing five different types of cannabis see this is a problem right now well at least I don't have to the patents on it well you know I could tell people is just to simply go out and look for a strong indica varieties like there's there's many of them out there like LA Confidential that's around twenty five percent THC any of the pure indica strains and they will make a good extract but I always got the best results by you know where I was growing all of these different strains I would make the extracts from each different strain and then I would mix them and this literally created a cure oh okay you know did you test it on yourself so we can come back to it to your story your chest told you and you'd start to extract the stuff and what did you do like what was the first experience did you test yourself or meant that the oil would be a much more medicinal way to use the plant when I asked him about it so I am at home and I I produce the extract but I have to be honest I mean this was a concentrate and I knew it would be sedated but where these doctors were so reluctant to go in that direction I really thought that you know this stuff could be dangerous so I'm ashamed to say it but it literally literally it sat there for almost three more years before I used it it was in 2008 2001 my doctor called me to his office he said there's nothing more we can do for you you're on your own and I mean what the illness it did you have I didn't get this before I had post-concussion syndrome from that head injury in 90 and you know and I never found any relief in the medical system a headache right now it my head rings 24 hours a day it doesn't stop but anyway the just keep on talking ya know so you tested it for the first time you extracted it and you sleep out there for three years but when I am well when the doctor said there was nothing more they could do and I asked him again for prescription so I could use this I can't plant legally but no wouldn't give it to me so I went home and I started taking the extract but when that when the medical system cut me loose the effect of those pills and chemicals they had been giving me they they messed up my thinking processes so badly that I could hardly even remember my own name this is the effect they have it's awful but I went home and I started ingesting small doses of these extracts and in the evening and over a period of the next within a month I worked it up to the point I was taking like a quarter of a gram or maybe even as much as a third of a gram at night before I went to bed and this stuff was just knocking me up I mean like a baby and this is something I hadn't been able to do for five years what you felt how did you feel like well it was very refreshing well I mean it brought my blood pressure under control my arthritis and my knees disappeared I started losing weight because you know it was shocking because it's scary in the beginning because they couldn't imagine that an extract from a plant could make you lose weight but this does if you're overweight it brings you back to your healthy weight so it was doing all these things you know and it's the people around me they all seen it you know and it was truly amazing but in late 2002 I went back to the doctor because I had these three areas of skin cancer I had one close to my eye right here on the side of my nose and I had one of my left cheek and I had one of my chest so when the doctor looked at to me he said well this looks like skin cancer but he said we'll do the one next to your eye first because of the proximity to the eye and he said we'll do the other two at a later date so I went to the hospital they operated in a boat I don't know four or five days later I was looking at this and him where they had operated with a magnified mirror and of course it was infected you know that's pre standard in hospitals yeah and but it was rate at that moment that study I'd heard like thirty years before popped back into my mind you know THC the active ingredient and I was thinking well you know i eating this extract you know it's full of THC so if that was true then why do I have these open lesions and of course I'd had them since the 1990s and I mean I still had faith in the medical system up to that point you know and I thought really if there were if there really was a cure for cancer for God's sakes the government that wasn't ago they'd be using it that that all people are telling us the same thing like when we talked about that for example it's like yeah if they would have a cure for one big issue they would all release it because they want to help well some would but they can't because there is this this line of government or industry or whatever more like a line of corruption is preventing us from using this but anyway yeah I you know I I really felt that you know if there was any truth in this that they would have been using the THC and you know because they always said we want to cure for cancer we want preventive medicine you know and what a pack of lies that is but anyway I almost I hate to say but I almost didn't try it but I thought well I had the extract right there so I went down and I put a little just a drop on the skin cancer here in my cheek and the same in my chest I put a bandage on each one now the only thing I noticed when I put it on like when you have skin cancer it feels like there's like like you have wood splinters and yeah in the affected area and it's usually puffed up and bleeding a little more and so this you know all of these places were doing the same thing so I put put the you know the extract on these two that was the only the only thing I noticed was that that splinter feeling immediately went away but there was no other sensation that anything was happening so I left the bandages in place for four days and when I went down to the bathroom to remove them I was just shocked because when I peeled this one off it was just pink skin all healed and the same thing with one of my chest so I started telling friends and neighbors you know that I think that just cured my cancer and of course everybody just laughed at me you know they thought I was insane you know cannabis curing cancer do you know don't be ridiculous so anyway about seven weeks later the one that they had surgically removed by my eye it came roaring right back I watched it developed as the splinter in the face feeling bleeding and puffed up a little and so I put a drop of oil on that and put a bandage on now that's what thirteen and a half years ago I've never had to retreat these areas so I went down to my doctor's office a few days later to get a copy of my pathology report because they had taken a sample when they did the operation get the cross-check yeah and it was right there you know basal cell carcinoma so I told the secretary this was a the doctor's wife who was the secretary I told her I said I'd like to come back in the evening and discuss something I've been working on with the doctor and she said well what's this about and I said well that cancer they had removed by my eye I said it came right back so I healed it and the other two areas using what I what I called hemp oil and the reason I call it hemp oil because this is what farmers always called this plant him you know these are these hemp seed companies they get kind of mad at me because they're you know they they sell hemp oil but it really should their miss labeling their product it should say hemp seed oil because that's really what it is you know the him the oil that I make is the extract or the essential oil right from the plant itself from the seat from the from the land from the plant from the finished plan was sure plants but anyway she soon as I said hemp oil there's women she went ballistic she would you know she wouldn't read it like this you know the doctor will not go there and the doctor will not supply this and it was just like you know mentation like why not I she was screaming at me literally screaming at me and there was a in the waiting room I was at standing in a waiting room and there was about five or six other patients there waiting to see the doctor you know and I just thought these people they're crazy so I could own a vehicle and I was on the way home and I got thinking about and I said well if I was a small-town doctor and one of my patients had cured themselves with an extract cured themselves a cancer yeah I'd want to know about it well how can you know the doctor wouldn't they didn't want to discuss it with me at all none no I didn't find one let's say other doctor no no no the doctors are scared to death of this it's because in reality we all have access to these extracts most of these doctors are going to be out of work and they know it that's the scary part for them but afterwards you know I started supplying the extracts to people with skin conditions you know severe burns psoriasis skin cancers anything of that nature and then I started passing it out to people for internal use you know I thought well if it cures cancer on the outside what would it do on the inside and I'd been eating the extract then for quite some time and I knew it was harmless and totally non addictive so I started passing it out to people in the return of the results was just beyond belief I mean it was healing everything we used it on it was like COPD arthritis cancer diabetes you know a system by eating it just eating the extraction but you're gonna you know I mean this is a very powerful substance and if you go to my website Phoenix tears CA all the information is out there just it the whole information from your website but it's all the information is there anybody can go there and find out how to produce these extracts properly you know make you it makes people self-sufficient again you know put your faith in yourself because what the medical system supplies is not going to work you know in those cases I mean look at chemotherapy and radiation does to people and they use chemo not just for cancer they use chemotherapy for many different treatments for different diseases so as far as I'm concerned the whole medical system is just based on us just based on insanity but after that I mean I went to all the rice in 2003 I sent two great big huge folders with all this information trying to get the information out to to go to the right people you know I went to all the political parties in Canada I went to two federal ministers of health I went to say like I didn't reply I'm not a reply not one chance to I by saying look from human to human this is the results help me know the second minister of health allowed Asajj when I sent him Canada in Canada at that time and what was it six months later he sends me an email back telling me that I'm breaking the law you know I'm carrying people with terminal cancer and I'm breaking the law well thank you mr. Health Minister what a pack of thieves these people are unbelievable but I mean I did everything right I contacted all the right people we went to the Canadian Cancer Society we even took this to the United Nations nobody would do a thing because they're all corrupt what do mean I need nations that took it like I have no idea what distant unite I know but the new United States but you wrote a letter there or try to contact this woman's there Stephen Lewis was representative at that time for the United Nations in Canada we contacted Steve for health they never even got a reply nice people maybe he didn't read it I know Carol what are you ready you'll hear later in my lecture today what I think of the United Nations and all of that we will have this lecture by the way on video as well because we're gonna record it and - it'll be a second video so everyone can see your lecture as well thank you very much so so to get a little bit of us to summarize think things up so now should have said you you extract it on your own you tested it on your own and you helped other people you got tremendous results but in a positive way I was giving me oil way for nothing I wasn't charging people and in 2004 we put up the feench - you see a website and read on our website we told the whole world how they can heal themselves but look you're not selling it because it's not illegal to sell it so you you're trying to tell people how to you produce their own oil right that that's one thing we talked about it yesterday and you can remember like I got many many emails when I heard your name like can you ask him very key to all where to get to all people have to understand that they don't date they have to understand that you can't just sell because there are restrictions and this is the legal stuff we have to deal with but people have to go into their self-awareness to you to take your time get your ass off the chair and try and do this stuff on your own no it's a natural right you know we as human beings we have a natural right to use plants to heal ourselves you know we're the only ones that can say what medicine we actually take for our health you know but you know but like these people you know the allopathic approach to healing which like I said is to me is insane because from what I see it's not about healing they want you to just keep coming back here's another prescription it goes on and on and on you know but this is a medicine that anyone can grow in their backyard and in you know process it themselves because in reality once you make this medicine you realize that it's really not much harder than making a cup of coffee you know anybody can do this and this is the future I mean the healing powers of these cannabinoids that we've seen they are they're going to change the face of medicine forever medicine is going to become a whole different animal than it is now and people will start getting healed you're going back to the natural stuff like earth gave us to work with yeah it's not only like like this plant I was last year it was one month in Peru and you asked a retreat and met a really good lovely shaman and we did a tour through the jungle and it was like he went through I only see green stuff like plants and he said yeah this is for blood pressure cancer bah bah bah blah but does anyone have any pain or mosquito red stuff on his arms I'm like yeah it's it's it's hurting a little bit and he's cutting the tree it's called dragon blood I think and he carried he took it took the blood it was pure blood like red blood he took it instantly the pain was gone instantly I'm like why are they not using it anakata yeah sure they can't use it because there would be no illness yeah it's completely gone oh this is amazing thing with these extracts like they're natural they're natural antibiotic their natural anesthetic they kill pain - it's just amazing and the effects like I had I burnt myself very badly here at this hand third-degree burns I mean 3/4 of my hand just melted it was awful in and when okay pictures days later my girlfriend the time she told me she you know Ricky got to go see a doctor so I couldn't see the doctor and when I walked in I put my hand out and he looked at me and he said when did you do this and I said well four or five days ago oh my god man there's nothing I can do with that you got there degree burns so he just took some gauze and he wrapped it up around my hand he didn't put nothing on it so I got up and I was on under the influence of all MDM pharmaceuticals at the time and so I went home and I'm stubborn anyway so I went down and I had some other materials so I started and I did it again and of course I got the whole bandage just soaked in oil solvent mix and after about three or four days it got so ugly the the bandage I just took it and threw it away but the strange thing was you know like I said I was under the influence of the pharmaceuticals but seven days later that doctor told me to come back seven days later so I went back seven days later and when I put my hand out his eyes got his big as like to saucers it was just like what did you do seven days ago you had third-degree burns and he said all the surge of days pink skin I mean the hair follicles grew back no scarring whatsoever and I mean I was so stupid at the time you know from the effects of these cameras pills that I just got up and said well I guess I'm a good healer and I walked out well maybe that's the through it was years later before I finally clued in you know what I see me all these other things that did for me you know and then I remember that burn and you know why don't I have scars it this is the ultimate medicine for basically anything because we all have an endocannabinoid system and we have a brain in the brain right where we are releasing the components of the plant in our brains like DMT we have different types of components we release it on our own so it's a body produced stuff well on our bodies actually produce cannabinoids themselves we have natural cannabinoids when does it produce it like do we know it or do you have any suggestion why when is there that when is it pumping or won't when it is releasing just this stuff are you sure the timing during the days probably happens at night because a lot of this goes on and you know late at night when you're sleeping like Mother's Milk you know if a pregnant woman mother's milk is full of cannabinoids you know that that almost 80% of the of the of the women nowadays I heard us a study from from someone who is working with in the hospital said they don't still what is called in English when they breast breast feeding your kids like 80 percent because yet they don't think it's relevant it's like it's very relevant it's like the irrelevant it's like why do you have well I mean you know they did a study back Melanie dree her she did a study back in the 1980s to find out where the healthiest babies on earth were born and finally she found that the healthiest babies on this planet are born to mothers in Jamaica who used cannabis a great deal now these are the healthiest babies on the planet and she did a follow-up study 20 years later and there's most of them are still doing great but you know I mean if these if the use of cannabis does not affect the baby in the developmental stages in the womb and in fact these are the healthiest babies on the planet you know why wouldn't this met it why wouldn't this plant be good for medicinal use for people of all age groups including children you know a lot of people say that people are children shouldn't be exposed to this this is nonsense I mean look what the medical systems are doing to them look at the toxins and poisons you know give your child some real medicine medicine they even better yet that you produced yourself you know there's your answer become self-sufficient stop relying on others because these people are lying to you and all they want to do is make a huge profit but I think that that's more of a lifestyle this is self sufficient self getting into the various to do your choices and do your thing and not relying on yeah I have cancer someone other has to help me it's not working like this you you're the trigger you are the creator of your own reality you have to do this stuff that's right like it's in every aspect and it's it's so frustrating it's not frustrating but it's a so for me it's more and more cleaner when I see people they are just whining over their terror situation and have have some some feeling for me and I'm so bad situation but I don't that they don't have the guts to just do it this is what I mean actually what is it the fellow sent me an email here a while ago and he cured themselves with the oil and he said I decided that it would be better for me to be illegally alive okay you know I mean yeah let's hope but you know these extracts it's hard to believe because we've always been told you know like cannabis is dangerous it's a drug it's this is nonsense that's all propaganda is nothing more than a pack of lies I've studied this plant for well over a decade many of my friends very well-educated people have studied this and the top experts in the world are all saying the same thing yes for me the ultimate medicine for me right now it looks like at least from Austria at this perspective in Europe like some governments are switching like like like the whole in English too they are going back from arts it's it's a bad stroke they're more like tell me something how did they make it illegal in the first place the United States it's all of this nonsense started basically in the US and all these other countries a they made it illegal they just follow the lead of the United States these countries didn't do a study because if they had they've never would have been able to find a problem with cannabis we grew this plant for thousands of years no regulations no laws against it why do you think they're legalizing it like in Washington other states because they are trying to hide checks that if they say ok let's release it so the government can have the big pot and control it why do they legalize government's are trying to do but I mean what governments have to do they have to admit that a criminal act was committed here this plant should never have been outlawed they didn't no one has the right I mean who has the right to stand in front of you and tell you that you cannot grow a medicinal plant to heal yourself now who is this person and why do these governments go along with this nonsense I mean they're all they're they're all a bunch of criminals in suits as far as I'm concerned you know they're not representing the people and what people hate today I don't think so I mean we've all we've always been controlled one way or another the big money you know like people think governments run the world that's nonsense the people who run the world are named Rothschild Rockefeller those are there in gates and people like that those are the people that are really the show and the government's are all in their back pockets at least you can it's so when you talk to people like yesterday Rochelle Rockefeller I don't even give them a name but there is a direction whatever it is whoever is we don't know that the real people behind it will never know the names but there is some some wave or there is some direction who definitely make plans or open up plans plans and and restriction and and governments try to control it it's the same with like other plants with ayahuasca like that they try to cut it off in Peru thousands of people to Emma straight because it's like a nature that's a cultural nature there and the government said ok it's ok for you but the UN is trying to cut it out down there as well so if and I was there in Peru and I'm talking with the shaman like if everyone would just once just once have one retreat just once yeah this this whole world would be different yes they would see themselves differently and others differently and have more you know what I mean well I mean I just couldn't imagine the levels of corruption that I encountered I mean as I said I was giving the the medication away and to or 2005 I was raided in charged cultivation trafficking and possessive possession well I mean I had to cultivate the plants to make the medicine and of course I had to possess the plants to make the medicine and under if you look in a dictionary it says trafficking is the exchange of goods for monetary gain well I wasn't gaining anything you know but I went into the court system I went through a charter challenge because under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in Canada we all as Canadians are supposed to have the right to life but I found that that was untold untrue the only time you have the right to life is when you do what they do you know you can't use an extract from a plant to save your life even if it is for the ozone and safe is medication that's against the law you know this is what's wrong with our world you know the whole planet is being run by psychopaths and idiots and it's really for people to take back you know take back their natural rights and to create our own destiny because I mean they've messed this planet up to no end you know Fukushima Gulf oil spill you know toxic industries everywhere killing the planet and at the same time it's killing us because our immune systems are being compromised more and more every day by these toxins that surround us and when that happens our bodies are not producing the natural cannabinoids or then it can't produce a number of cannabinoids need it and that's when diseases like cancer and things like that you know rear their ugly heads but if you take these cannabinoids they fit right into the same receptors that our natural cannabinoids fit into do you still do you still think that there must be like in the healing process of cancer there must be up psychological or component or does this come by using the cannabinoids you know what I mean like well I mean I've talked to a lot of these people like New Age thinkers you know to the power of positive thinking and they're so convinced that you know if you think positively is going to make a big difference but when they used to come to me I used to look at them and say well tell me something do you think a dog has the power of positive thinking you because I treat dogs all the time with cancer and they get cured do you think a dog has that power and then they look at you because they don't know that they have the power to think negative I think using it in a good state you know even the people I treated I used to tell them you know change your diets and all you give them all this advice most of these people like three months later they would come back they were cured but I would ask them did you change your diet did you do anything do you get your body's pH up they didn't do a thing you know maybe one in 50 would actually do something but they all still healed them so you don't have to believe in it just the healing process will know what it's kind of automatic Wow wow that's very interesting so all of your experiences or you wrote how many books no well I have two books out now this this is the first one which is called Rick Simpson start is this one do you have one book in in German translated as well yes thank you we're planning to have this translated into German right away - but the second book or nature or Phoenix tears Rick Simpson oil nature's answer for cancer that's been translated into German okay so this is like your background story how you came to it and what would you describe the books like in what is it what is what part of you is there well it's basically you know what I mean it's kind of my life story but but mostly it's about the medicine and and you know what the system put me through I mean I'm just an ordinary man there's nothing special about me and really all I I consider myself to be the messenger I'm not a miracle worker the oil the extracts do that I'm just here to tell the world but I mean the way they used me in Canada it was just beyond belief you know the legal system you know I mean I went through a supreme supreme court at nova scotia trial over this i didn't have the money i had to represent myself i brought six I brought ten doctor ten patients in there to testify two of these patients have been cured with terminal cancer two with terminal cancer wouldn't let them understand I had six doctors they're the one that lots of speak up but knows why what's the reason you're not allowed to have a medical argument what the whole court is regarding in medical arguments that's Canada the land of their free yeah I think it would be like in Austria Germany like this as well like that there's that well the whole thing you know it's like you said they wouldn't let the doctors understand they wouldn't let the patients understand I had a box full of scientific evidence they wouldn't let me introduce that I destroyed you know when they put these police officers on the stand I destroyed them because you know I would see a year before that I was ever raided I went to the local newspapers they did full-page articles about me you know the whole thing picture of me and everything and you know in here year over a year later that's when the police come and raid me you know like I mean I wasn't hiding this and I told the police I went right to the police themselves and give them Oh evidence and told them that local politicians should be charged with criminal negligence causing death because they wouldn't do anything I even asked the police for whatever they confiscated if you have good bud for God's sakes give it to me and I can make more medicine for the people you know and three months later the same the same detachment comes and raids me so that just ate the same guy there's many people in the detachment but I mean I went the only person in the end the only person that could testify my behalf was me and I spent about two hours on the stand and I didn't think that there was a hope in hell that anybody could convict me of anything because there was people on that jury that I had treated some of their family members for nothing and healed them and they didn't speak up well no I mean they were on the jury they were supposed to determine if I was guilty or innocent so anyway we we gave our closing arguments three hours later we were called back to the courthouse the juries had reached a verdict I come in and I sat down in the courtroom and the prosecutor from the Justice Department this Monika McQueen she was the one who had done all the talking during my charter challenge and during the Supreme Court case but her sidekick Doug Shatford the crown prosecutor he was always right with her but when I come into the courtroom that day no Shatford and I'm sitting there and yeah and a few minutes later in Shatford finally come in and sat down and then the jury come in and I got a you know and I stood up and it was guilty guilty guilty and I looked at the jury and I said guilty of what saving lives is that a crime in Canada and then the judge he went oh you know mr. Simpson you can't take this personally in all this nonsense and I turned on the judge and I said listen pal you better lock me up right now because the minute I get out of here I'm gonna start I'm gonna continue distributing those damn extracts he never said a word to me you know and then finally when after you know and what was the next day one of the people had been the audience they came to my home and they she had this lady I know this lady quite well and she told me she said I seen Doug Shatford exit the jury room just about a minute before the jury came in with a verdict he tampered with the damn jury and the man's quite famous for the because he did the same thing about two years later in another case involving the oil you know no way that you can like to prevent these I say okay look we had evidence we took it to the judge but they they just swept it under the rug but yet you know but when at my sentencing about 35 or 40 supporters were there you know they were mad and then the court knew it so they put us through metal detectors and all this first time I ever seen it in Amherst courthouse but anyway when I when I stood up the judge said openly he said under different circumstances mr. Simpson would be winning awards for his work and then he said it's at consensus which one what I am meaning by that people so what do you know it was just idiotic and then he said in my 34 years in the legal system I've never seen a case like this he said there was no criminal intent you see money wasn't even mentioned during my court case because there was no money involved and so and then the same judge who wouldn't let the patients on the stand and wouldn't let the scientific evidence being introduced he turned right around he said the scientific evidence does exist to back up everything mr. Simpson is saying and he also has all this large body of evidence with the patients they gave me a two thousand dollar fine and a gun restriction I wasn't even put on probation you know and the gun reason the only reason I got the gun restrictions not that I was you know during those raids yeah the RCMP were waving guns around but I wasn't you know there was no guns in my home so but when you're convicted of trafficking that comes with an automatic 10-year gun restriction you know I truly sick of me and you know after that I wanted to leave Canada but the patients kept coming so for about two years they left me alone and then in November 2009 I was at the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam giving a lecture and they made me freedom fighter of the year that year too but about two days before they gave the gave me that award I got a call from my son in Canada that the police had come in they were saying that they found restricted weapons yeah I mean there was a child spelling your home well now they kicked the door in they said they found restricted weapons whoops we found something and boom traps video and they found 70 pounds of cannabis now but somebody in my position get on an airplane and fly to Amsterdam for a week and leave 70 pounds of pot laying around his house not likely you know so I knew that they were trying to I'll see I was getting so much support the I think the government thought well if you know if we put the RCMP in there and bring these false charges that'll keep him out of the country and it did but I you know I stayed in Europe but I kept I started going from country to country telling the whole damn world the truth about what went on and now with the books and everything out there and now so much out there now on the Internet my god just go on YouTube there's hundreds of thousands of people you know testifying to what this and they're even what I I'm not 100 cent sure but I think they're now they legalize marijuana on a medicine what's the name when I talk to subscribe it to you in to cure or to help cancer patients a little bit whatever type of whatever they give them to smoke or oil I have no idea but it looks for me and like the attracted systems a little bit changing slightly but I'm not sure if this is a good way because like the ones who is controlling a system it's not anybody's I mean I got some joint quartet that trying to you like like yeah we have one seat this is you can buy weed or THC everywhere on the store but you have no idea what is inside who made it what is it in a synthetic varieties of points to and those those are dangerous but you know again it goes back to these government's they do they do not have the right to regulate this in any way and there's no reason that any one of us should have to go to a see a doctor to get a prescription you know to grow and use this plant as far as I'm concerned that's ridiculous you know this is our own natural right this plant the extracts the plant itself totally non-addictive no danger whatsoever no one has ever died from the effects of cancer in 5000 years of documented use no one has ever died now what other medicine can you say that I mean look at there's thousands of people every year across the planet that die from aspirin for God's sakes now we got the safest medicine on the planet it comes from nature but we're not allowed to use it because it's going to cut into the merchants of those rich you know rich people who own the pharmaceutical industry and practically everything else you know at the moment well they control the media they control the government for how long I think all of these much longer I hope I really think that this whole system that they're trying to to to hold us down or to control the people I think on all on all spheres it's breaking and shaking and people are trying to like they're asking that they're asking questions and good questions and people are yeah like esoteric they're waking up but they are they're getting aware of the things and they're just asking hey if you're telling this story like it's not a holistic story you can check it for yourself and you can talk to people who got cute like okay this guy is right so what so that's logical so it will break in the end when problem right now is they're not listening to the top experts in the world you know doctor who knows dr. Mann and me dr. Hornby I mean these people I mean these are the top scientists in this field but nobody it's like nobody's listening you know and it's such a shame because everywhere I go I see people suffering and dying needlessly if they had this yaktrax they could heal themselves after the same in my area like I think everyone knows at least in the first area or in the second one a friend of a friend you know the new prognosis are like in 20 years or ten years every fifth or sixth sky or human will have cancer like what the hell it's well well they're saying that one and two right now are going to end up with a disease but that number is going up every day you know I mean it's because we're living in a toxic world but this plant can detoxify our world we can practically everything we use in our day to day lives can be produced from cannabis in an earth friendly way and this is what we got to start doing you know even our fuel we can put an end to starvation this business about energy crisis what a pile of nonsense that is I mean I used to do this with people when they come to the house I used to take a spoon and put a lit bit of gasoline in it and light it on fire you know on the old black soot and everything coming off it and then I would take a little bit of alcohol and put the alcohol in there burn it and this beautiful blue flame you know no snow smoke no no pollution and you know and I used to say to people I said now what should we be burning in our cars you know alcohol obviously and the beauty of the cannabis now they had these new enzyme processes out and they say that you can produce as much as eighteen hundred gallons of ethanol off of one acre now one acre is a very small piece it's less than half a hectare for 1,800 gallons that would make us all in it you know you plan an acre of him your energy independent you've got enough fuel to run your car heat your home do whatever you want and it's not polluting the environment by plant we always set here like it was here a bit right before we came here or yeah it was put here for us to use as far as I'm concerned I mean and but it's so useful in so many different ways the building material the hempcrete you know it's just endless what you can do with this plant and it detoxifies the soil it's planted in you know we can detoxify the planet and we can give like future generations you know we can give them a future that you know that to look forward to but if we don't start and do something right now the earth is going to it's becoming so toxic you know more and more every day that you know in the end our children have nothing to look forward to except suffering and death and this is something we can prevent and it's up to us to do this yeah we have to get in charge again for the first time ever because it's always in a passive seat and just waiting and doing what you have to do like your own potential like in your New York god-given powers to to help other cents yourself well I mean that's really what it's all about and you know like I mean we've been led around by the nose all through history by the rich and powerful and you know any and the worst of it is you know like we've sat and watched you know these governments and P of these rich types do things that made no sense to us or whatsoever very harmful things to the planet but yet you know we don't unite and do anything about it why is that you know I'm so thing they become so complacent you know and apathy sets in but I mean it really is it's this is our world and we're the ones that have protect it and if people who are wealthy are ruining this planet then we have to put a stop to it and we have to do it now I think I think we will it's a lucious okay just gonna sign five five we have five more minutes I just have a few more question I hope we got all the topics just um let me just see what do you think is your purpose here like what is your why did you came here it's a lot I'm a little bit more of a spiritual question but what do you think why are you here what's your purpose did you find out yet or what do you think well as I said I'm really I'm just the messenger I feel it's my duty to the medicine man you know well I mean this oils these extracts safe they saved my life and I feel that it's basically my duty to tell everyone on this planet how they can do the same so that's really the cause I've been fighting for you know again our natural right to use this plant especially for medicinal purposes so the next question would be what is your purpose in life so it's it's the same you just well right now I'm looking I'm hoping to get involved in a big project that's I believe it will happen happen in a very near future now and I want to perfect this medicine to its highest levels I'd like to start supplying the public with seeds at a very cheap cost seeds that they know they can grow and trust you know that that's important because know if you if people are buying their wheat from somewhere then they never know whether it's come from you don't know what it is it like what mix crossing what was it sprayed with and there's so many variables it really is better just to grow your own you know I mean there will be companies that will supply it you know to people on a grand scale you know those who can't grow their own or whatever but yeah that's the only place I see any need for government regulation because anybody's supplying it to the public on a big scale then you know quality control and standards have to be maintained yeah sure beyond that I don't see any need for regulations and you know and like I said if you want to go out in your backyard and grow a hundred plants or a thousand plants I don't care it's gonna harm anyone and in Slovenia a lot of people are saying you know we should follow the you know the direction Colorado was taken well people better remember one thing it was the United States of America that led us into this mess in the first place now you really want to follow the advice of the US again you decide yeah you decide about it look at what's going on in Slovenia as far as I know right now in Slovenia the the government there are going to allow everyone to grow their own you're not trafficking they're not gonna bother but it's I think that's it's tricky because people will stop thinking about where it come from or for which organization or company or whatever I think that's the way they are trying to tinder us again in the next stage well they're using words out there you know no we're going to legalize or we're going to decriminalize and these are words that come with a lot of regulations it's a bunch of nonsense what we need right now we all have to stand as one and demand that governments worldwide repeal these laws these laws are all based on deceptions and lies anyway they're not ruling laws they belong in a trash can set the cannabis plant free and we set ourselves free I think that there must be some regulations like if you use the oil if you drink it or smoke it you're not allowed to drive a car totally for example like I mean I drove a big motorcycle for years and nothing will tell you any faster than a motorcycle if you're impaired what happens with alcohol and pharmaceuticals these substances impair your motor skills these extracts and cannabis they don't impair your motor skills once you're used to cannabis you can safely drive your car I did it for tens of thousands of miles on that motorcycle never had a problem you know it and actually I have one I've seen it actually makes people drive more carefully yeah and more sensibly but I would say if the government will say okay there are some restriction if you're in the public okay but not for healing at home at home I can do whatever I want sure and that's that's a problem I have so regarding that the time limit we have right now because you have to be on the stage soon if you would have let let's if you would have the opportunity to right now speak to to the camera or to the people like if if tomorrow the whole world would be able to watch your message your video what do you want to what is your what do you want to get out like well I mean the main message I'm sending to people everywhere is truthfully I mean you have the right to heal yourself and no one has the right to prevent this and you know if you go to my website Phoenix tears CA you know all the information is there we in 2000 and 2008 we brought out run from the Cure that documentary has been viewed by hundreds of millions now and the instructions for producing the extra healing into your own hands grow the plant you need produce your own extracts and heal yourself you have that right and this is what I want to see people everywhere you know that people have to come to realize this it is a natural right and you know let's put an end to all the suffering needless suffering and dying because this is ridiculous what's going on people are not being healed at present you know they put you on painkillers or other medications and then they just keep putting more pills into you that doesn't heal you so you know it's time that we got some common sense again and as far as I'm concerned you know really the cannabis plant offers us a future and not just our health but in all ways so we would have to be first class fools not to put it to good use thank you thank you very much Rick it was really a pleasure talking to you think yeah good internet but me and the usual information connect the dots big picture [Music]", "0y2idRaHGqQ":

air", "F8eNzzjhZMk": "and one of the interesting stories is Manuel Guzman and his research team in Spain were looking at brain cell metabolism and they knew that you know THC had been found to work with receptors in the brain so they were curious how THC affected brain cell metabolism the studies they were doing we're done with brain cancer cells because they reproduce really quickly and you can have a line of cells to study without having to keep buying normal cells you have your own dedicated line reproducing really quickly and it's much cheaper than buying them and you can get basically the same data so when they started trying to research THC with brain cancer cells they couldn't do the research because all the brain cancer cells died off and they what's this about they tried again brain cancer cells died off complete death so he said wait wait wait wait they went to the literature they found the study from 75 so that gave them a clue that their you know what they were seeing was valid and they redirected their study away from brain cell metabolism into cancer brain cell cancer and how cannabinoids affect it and they found that THC and synthetic cannabinoids have the ability to change the signaling at a genetic level so that the cancer cells change their biochemistry instead of making pro-survival chemicals within the cancer cell the genetics are flipped so that they start making chemicals that are hostile to their survival and then they die off another thing that the cannabinoids do is to impede the ability of tumor cells to produce blood vessels in order to eat because they divide rapidly they need a lot of nourishment that's why cancer patients waste they these tumors tap into the host and suck the blood they're vampires they drink you know tap into the blood system and draw off nutrients THC inhibits the ability of the cancer tumor cells to a compound necessary for producing these blood vessels this inhibits their ability to thrive and to spread and whence they spread to get a doc and to survive as a metastasis so they were really amazed by this and continued their research and other at once they published other researchers started looking at it they found similar activity for breast cancer cells for colon cancer cells for head and neck cancer cells bile duct cancer cells pancreatic cancer cells so many different lines of cancer cells all responded to THC or synthetic cannabinoids that activate these receptors you", "_Zpli7sWZW4": "I was diagnosed I wasn't sure of my diagnosis I was in and out of hospital and on several occasions they thought I had and also different things and I was in for quite a long time when they realized I had something too weak something to eat I had a line 53-man Africa came out here and it was TPA not to be fed through liquid and I had a operation to remove the ovary because they realized so a CT scan that I had ovarian cancer but that's all I thought I had so I went home went back the next week for the operation I went in and they removed the ovary they've prepared me for a stoma and they didn't biopsy so and they didn't know if I'd need it his directive wasn't know where it was at this point at its worst how bad was it I had six weeks to live without treatment and it had gone it was all secondary what this is it was in my small bowel which was inoperable incurable I had three big tumors in there the whole of mustn that was speckled in spots of cancer it was what were you told and basically it was not purple it wasn't curable chemo might buy me time hopefully they'd be able to get me eating before I died oh my gosh my left I went back up to the ward I just wanted to get out of the hospital I went to the pool with my friends my best friend Annette and we'd all just sat outside the red line in my pajamas I had a PICC line in my arm here at this point which then she got sepsis with my first lot of chemo oh gosh and then I carried on one friend that friends had researched the oil from Rick Simpson so this is this is Rick Simpson he he claimed that his skin cancer was cured by by taking this can he was a founder of it that realized that he actually cures cancer and it's the THC that eats the cancer and I won't me I don't know why they won't legalize it here we can see the high yes so that people are far worse drunk aunt they really if people are going out drinking they're in more trouble than they are because this makes you really relaxed chilled sleep however the first time you tried it I was Giga me yes not aggressive it's never made me like if you can have a drink people are aggressive they fight and but this has never made me feel aggressive tired laughing eagerly and if you drink with it it's not good anniversary of anything how do you take it and I take it in a little capsule I bought these online I squirt it in there and I'll just clear I don't like the taste of it and this is it this is the oil so that's about five mils that's not five minutes that's sorry five mils is there okay three mils yeah and you normally buy it in am i right five 5 ml syringe okay yeah and that is 250 pounds yes and how long would that last you probably about between five six months I do take a bit more now because in August but I've got sepsis in this line I had taken out I decided then I wasn't going to have because I was on chemo three days a week every two weeks that touched him alone and I just I'd had enough at that point and I just went I don't want this anymore and I hit the oil every night and I was playing with it cuz I didn't want to take it I didn't like the feeling I just and I didn't know if it would really work out a bit sketchy shot to be honest well my next scan then when I only had one lot of chemo yeah and then I had a scan and the results were absolutely astounding it's all gone in my pelvis ovary stomach small bowel the tumors have gone there's a little bit left in my gastric stomach there are a number of occasions we've interviewed people on the sofa here how come at this stage we know so little about its curative effects essentially because the government hasn't allowed people to take it and use it for these purposes as far as cancer is concerned as around 20 to 25 years of evidence from tissue studies animal studies and anecdotal reports like Joyce here quite remarkable if quite very profound effects and you know up to up to the level of cures in some cases but there is but there's no been know controlled clinical trials no double-blind treating with kind of video will be cheaper than the vast amounts of money that are used for chemo oh yeah wise that's part of the reason well if your can if you've got to mind for conspiracy theories and you know people accuse Big Pharma of being quite opposed to cannabis legalization because it would potentially eat into their profits but in in terms of cancer what the animals and the tissue studies have shown is that it causes the cancer cells to commit suicide it's a process that's known scientifically as apoptosis which basically called programmed cell death and it also prevents or reduces the level of the blood supply to tumor tissues so it attends to sort of shrivel them at one or one level and then sort knock them out completely at the other how important can I just say though it doesn't work for all cancers yeah and it doesn't work for all individuals so one cancer in different individuals might have different effects and different people have got different susceptibilities to to kind of how important is this THC because we've got a home office spokesman said that a CBD product which contains any trace of the psychoactive compounds that are found in cannabis such as THC therefore unlawful to possess and to supply I mean you're breaking the law how essential in the product is the THC it there are different obviously different for different medical conditions the cannabinoid balance is is change so for epilepsy for instance CBD is the compound that you really after because it's anticonvulsant and it's also that is actually legal THC is the one that has the effects on things like multiple sclerosis on the illness or cancer on very it's a very saw the conditions and pain relief particularly and that's the one that's illegal because it gets people high and the government regards people getting high as a very serious side effect whereas the individuals that take it some people regard it as an adverse effect somebody some people regardless it's a beneficial with joy I mean we as we've just discussed say you are breaking the law do you worry about getting in trouble with the police at all it's my life when your backs against the wall and you get told you've got six weeks deliver you'll try anything yeah and I've never touched a drug in my life but you know and will you continue to use it I will you", "Yd3zaoaN1eM": "you're about to witness a video of an elderly lady who no longer recognizes her living room nor even her own son you don't know [Music] this lady is not just getting old her memories are being erased by a disease that's causing her brain to physically wither away and die Alzheimer's disease within a normal healthy brain there are cells that pass messages from one area to another when grandparents speak about the good old days it is thanks to these cells connecting their memory hub with their centers of speech if you look closely you'll see that the message must pass across a small space between each cell in Alzheimer's patients this space becomes clogged by an abnormal structure and communication comes to a halt furthermore the long thin part of the cell that the message passes across is destroyed from within due to a change in an important protein this causes the cell to shrivel and die leaving behind what scientists call and neurofibrillary tangles the tangle in conjunction with the blocks that prevent a cellular communication are the two features that define alzheimers disease there are currently no effective treatments for Alzheimer's though there's one promising frontier cannabis chemicals in cannabis including THC and now at the frontier of Alzheimer's research because they have potential to reduce and prevent the formation of our Simas plaques if plaque formation can be slowed or halted as recent studies suggest and if patients can be diagnosed early enough then the potential exists to prevent debilitating and lethal forms of Alzheimer's you cannabidiol another cannabis chemical has been found effective in improving symptoms in mouse models of Alzheimer's a recent Australian study concluded that the mouse model findings could easily be followed up in clinical trials since CBD is well tolerated by humans despite the promising research however the news is not all good in July 2015 a series of media articles reported that cannabis had been proven ineffective in treating Alzheimer's disease the only problem with the headlines is that they were not true the study they were referring to was commissioned to determine the safety of THC pills for persons with dementia as well as other technical data the conclusion reached was that the pills were safe and that further human studies with higher doses were warranted thankfully not everyone is fooled by the headlines you were pacing back and forth not believing this was your house and you had to get out of here [Music] [Music]", "bcvDc9hRcws": "[Music] friends of mine that I buy my weed from and various things still told me about Eddie and I got on the internet and I researched him I found him I messaged him I met him and he started taking care of me with his RSO which you know you put this stuff in a capsule you take it and you go to sleep you sleep like a rock it's amazing everything I research made me understand that if I didn't change my diet and try to find something that was going to help me eliminate all the pain that I was in that I wouldn't be here much longer because it became too unbearable to just get up and go to our job in that process my doctors told me that there was pain clinic and there was go see a counselor or employee assistant counseling that talked about all of this was going on and just one medication after the next and one day I looked up and I like 17 different medications and I just wanted to do something different my first experience with helping somebody other than myself was my mother she was diagnosed with cancer in October of 2016 I actually had told her instead of taking sleeping pills and things like that I was offering her smoke weed because that was what I needed to do but when she was diagnosed with cancer I was kind of at a loss I knew that from experience of watching other people going through cancer that chemotherapy was destructive and very very sad and harsh and but when she was diagnosed we didn't know exactly the extent of it and then a couple weeks later found out that she was problem she was terminal by then already they gave her like three and a half months to live I had basically decided within me that I didn't want her to go through with the treatments but if that's what she wanted to try to do as far as what Western I was telling her fine but I was asking her to try cannabis as well and then she was but how how much what do I take and I said I don't know I basically didn't know I just went out to a dispensary and was like hey my mom's dying and I come here every week five times a week to buy my own weed smoke you guys have anything that my mom could take that would help her live or at least like feel better and they couldn't answer anything nobody knew anything well we have this and we have that and this is $90 and this is $150 I'm like is $150 stuff stronger better make her better faster no well we don't know um how much do I give to her I'm not sure and then CBD was the cure-all to that was the other thing you just need to give her lots of CBD and I'm like well how much what form you know do I rub it on her body do I put it in her mouth like what exactly do I do and it was it was scary cuz they were willing to take my money but they weren't willing to tell me what to do with this thing they were giving me for my money they do believe in some of the studies they say that smoking a joint when he gets into medicinal aspects you're getting anywhere between 12 to 16 percent cannabinoid absorption the endocannabinoid system is complementary to cannabis which is why I got named as partially and a cannabinoid system cannabis in and of itself is hundreds and hundreds of different chemicals that we are now starting to pick apart and take a look at on a much deeper level so you're smoking a joint some of the best weed there is and you're still even though you're a hundred percent stoned and 100 percent medicated or high you're only getting up to 16 percent of cannabinoid absorption in your body that's trying to kill cancer that's not gonna do anything when people take up to a thousand milligrams of concentrated oil to battle the cancers so that's smoking it then there's topicals topicals come in there also and you get anywhere from they believe a sixteen to twenty four percent absorption with topicals edibles they believe you get a forty to fifty two percent absorption rectally he get from 86 to 91 percent absorption but when you get into posit or EES you can't just make it like you make ganja butter you have to use a refined oil which has to be broken down in certain ways this is a full plant extract meaning that we cut the whole plant down we soak the whole plant in a solvent and whatever is made whatever's left after we remove the solvent is the pure product we keep it at certain volatile heat levels so it doesn't burn off certain properties and that's what the entourage effect is nowadays with all the legalization going on the vape carts that's called distillate and so this lid is actually a step after you make the NH Oro so the full plant oil extraction oils and is in a solvent and then you take that solvent and what I do is I just remove the solvent and what I have left is my product what other people do is once you remove the solvent they take this product they put it into a machine they call it a mantle they heat that up with vacuum pressure steam and cool and cold air and they collect what's called distillate and that's an isolation of THC you are now burning off all the entourage components everything is gone now and all you're removing is the THC and so that's what everybody's using in the vent cartridges and stuff which I believe is generic hi I've had no medical benefits of anybody feeling any better with them unless they're having headaches needed a quick quick appetite boost or a recreational setting where they just want to smoke something real quick and move on but when it came to all-around healing you have to internally eat it it's do you have to ingest it and I've stayed away from making edibles and stuff because a lot of it had sugars and preservatives and those are the things that were preservatives were preserving the cancers and all the anomalies and the sugars were just feeding the cancers and the anomalies and so I just figured instead of me making edibles I should create a pure concentrate oil that should be take a very very tiny amount it goes a long way so instead of you having to have medicated brownies or a medicated cookie I am now medicated whatever I eat is medicated now I can have Medicaid lasagna I could have medicated burritos I can have medicated tortilla chips I can have medicated salsa because I am medicated so I am the standard I don't need all these other outside anomaly's messing with me especially you have diabetic patients or people that are on harsh strict diets they just need to take a pure form of the oil and I feel like that's the best way to do it instead of using all these extra stuff that just cause you know food allergy problems or you know I have people that are making the oil now and putting all kinds of essential oils in it and no it just needs to be the oil just stick to the plan it comes to their face like their designers again and the plan has been healing for thousands of years without our effort it's gonna be here on this earth for thousands of years after we're gone I've been using this medicine for years because I was addicted to opiates after I broke my back and they told me I had stomach cancer and so I went after all these things myself because I didn't believe in their lies I didn't believe in the tools that they're gonna show me that I watched so many people lose their hair lose their teeth get their throats burnt out they call it they call it a burning and chemo and radiation when they actually zapped the wrong part and you get these burn blisters and I've helped people with Agent Orange issues - aids dementia ulcerative colitis Crohn's disease that list can go on forever at the end of the day it's poor diet negative efforts and negative community around people and once you give them positive good night's rest and you get rid of all those ailments they wake up the next day to eat better they want to do things and have fun with their life I had to go do my own research I thought people in my my surrounding there's a group on Facebook called I love San Bernadino and I live in the city of San Pertino and I was like well why not reach out to the community and see if there's people within my community that can help me or know somebody who might be able to help me and that's exactly what I did I said my mom's really ill I have all these things that they gave me at the dispensary and I don't know what to do with them can somebody send me an angel who can just say this is how much you give them or this is how much she shouldn't take or don't give her that you know somebody just gave me some information and a gentleman by the name of Robert Porter he was like I know somebody he doesn't live here right now but he I'm gonna contact him he's in town and I'm gonna talk to him about what's going on in your situation and he might be able to help you and I was like thank you anything's better than nothing within a few days he said he had spoken to Eddie and he said that I told him about your mom and he gave me some medicine you're gonna give it in on the back of this package it says how to administer it to your mom and I was just like what wait what okay um crazy okay cool you know and I was excited because like I was like I got an answer it's not the answer but it's an answer and I might be able to help her within 15 minutes of administering the medicine to my mom she was um she was happy and my one and a half year old niece was able to interact with her and it didn't make my mom sad or paint in pain because she was just it complete she was like and then she pulled me aside and it was like cannabis is what's gonna cure people amethyst don't forget that because she could feel it she told me when you give me I was giving her dilaudid on every four hours and then I was giving her a fentanyl patch and I was giving her so many so many medications and I put those things on her and I watched her go from chill to just watch her feel like she's like scared the mom are you okay no I feel not okay III don't want to die I don't want to die I'm like mom you're not gonna die I'm just making you feel out of paint no that's not what I feel though I feel out of pain but I feel like I'm dying and she said with cannabis it brought life back into her and so for me that right there was all I needed to know like I knew my mom wasn't going to live but I knew that she had life in her before she died so she was she was better than if she was on opiates and so that was probably the best healing for us as a family because she didn't want to leave us in turmoil and hurt in having a void and she wasn't when she left we were all there with her and she she we knew she went well because she was in a state of mind where we knew she was okay", "z4gFzetrh6I": "give me a second okay so this is day three and day two I got aides to the program again and I got really really really stoned off it the end of the day the end of the day I'll just watch but other than that a few little groggy next day really grow you next day but back I'm back on the horse yeah but a third of a gram into me already you know finish off this gram by the end of the day so I'll let you know on day four how I'm doing", "ZT-6cYWh9Z4": "can you [ __ ] see that by Braco we haven't even started cooking it the [ __ ] dude we haven't even started yet you're already drooling all over the place like there's a loop this house there I am another great episode of bambor TV [Music] hey guys Dave here from Bama TV once again with my good friend house we are doing a special today I get another one of those things that I haven't heard quite a lot about this is called honey oil and this is a little bit different it's derived from the recipe for Rick Simpson oil I think it's called and my boy house is gonna explain everything we need to know about Rick Simpson oil and about honey oil that we're gonna be making for you guys today so what do we need to know brother okay today we are gonna make ourselves some rib Rick Simpson oil or honey oil because we're gonna change up the recipe a little bit we're not going to State - true - Rick Simpsons recipe Rick Simpson is a cannabis pioneer from out in California and he derived a system of adding isopropyl alcohol the 99.9% to trim and up one bud and some shake and ground up weed and he cooked it all down so the alcohol all evaporated so nothing happened what he was left with was a thick gooey black crude oil substance that was very potent and it's more on the CBD spectrum than it is on the THC spectrum me it is great for aches and pains antidepressant anti-anxiety you can use this in cooking you can put it in your tea and let it melt down what's your personal favorite way to take this uh the honey oil the honey oil I just freeze it a little bit on an ice cube on the end of a butter knife and just pop the little disc in my mouth and let it dissolve on my tongue or under my tongue takes about 10-15 minutes Rick Simpsons recipe calls for is two grams of flour or trim you're going to use one ounce of isopropyl a 99.9% alcohol if you're going to do this indoors you need to do it near a window make sure you have plenty of ventilation this is very very dangerous stuff if you're going to use the isopropyl alcohol should they do it outside that would be recommended that you did it outside because of the fuel in a close-knit area what I have here is I have the 3 quart crock pot and I have a tincture solution just like when I make the green dragon obviously this isn't green I put 1 ounce 28 grams of flour and trim into the jaw I covet it 100-proof vodka instead of the isopropyl alcohol my preference this is what the difference is between honey oil and RSO Rick Simpson oil first time I made this evaporated too fast on me and I lost almost half of what I had so I'm gonna do it those slow process and just use hunter proof vodka now I have crock pot on high nice and hot I'm gonna pop this right in there nice and slow again this is very flammable the fumes so don't any open flame don't do this over a gas stove don't come smoking cigarettes next to it will come leaning over here with your bong in me like I check this I don't want to rip something bang you want to blow yourself up go cook meth we're going to continually stir this for about 4 hours we're going to come in and we're going to scrape off the sides and we're gonna let it all the evaporate down for about 4 hours you might want to check with your wife before you use the crock pot because I did not and I ruin the crock pot so now this is my crock pot so I can make IRA so that means she gets another crock pot which means I lose money it's super sticky it's easy it just takes time again very flammable very dangerous make sure you in good ventilation don't smoke me Erik don't be dumb just let it do its thing and now we're going to let this puppy sit for a little while and we'll be back and check out its process it's 21 minutes now we're gonna go check out this IRS oh come on which they can walk and go over this way no no no and as you can see in here we have a little bit of separation here it's only 20 minutes and there you go some evaporation is happening so what you do is you want to go around and scrape the ring kinda like cleaning your toilet ball and remember this is Bud said by donkeys KITT don't get your ice coffees you culotte is stoners run on Duncan absolutely and you give her a little stir and that's about it this is what you do about every 10-15 minutes come over check it and you'll see again when we come back hopefully they'll be a little bit more evaporation we're gonna leave a line here I'm gonna try to anyways so you can see reading that dot there we'll come back in about 10-15 minutes and we'll see what happens and we're back again it's been another 20 minutes so as you can see it's doing its thing it's evaporating it's becoming a little bit more cloudy now so it's doing what it's supposed to do it's breaking down so we're gonna give scrapes scrape as much as you can again this stuff is extremely sticky sticks to everything first time I made this got yelled at because I had the spatula stuck to the counter I had measuring cups like the collar I was ill-prepared actually it's it looks just like molasses yeah when it's done like I said I didn't keep an eye on it that well and I had it bumping too hot with the grain alcohol when I made it so I lost almost half of what I was trying to cook down this time being a little bit more ginger with it we're getting really close guys coming up on a a little bit of a science project it's all coming together as you can see it's getting dhaka about another 10 15 minutes we've been saying that for about two hours now all right here we go this is the last couple steps for the IRS Oh getting ready gonna put it in the syringes and let it sit let it thicken up a little bit more out of a whole quart jar we're gonna end up probably what about milliliters of RSO usable RSO but it's gonna be very strong very good medicine so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to tip and I'm going to fill might be a little bit more liquidy than what our wrestle is but since we're using vodka instead of the the isopropyl the alcohol may have it four five milliliter doses is actually twenty milliliters of honey oil or the modified version of Rick Simpson oil you can do a couple drops you can do one good squeeze but that's about it that's how that goes as always be safe and love each other thank you much and thank you for another great episode of Bama TV", "2aegxybCxY4": "hi Kenna lovely here doing a video today for everyone on YouTube and my blog again on RSO oil there's been a lot of talk out there about Rick Simpson oil and I wanted to have a conversation about it Rick Simpson is a man from Canada who discovered that concentrated amounts of cannabis oil could cure his cancer he also helped the whole bunch of other patients cure their cancer so basically it's cannabis bud that's cooked down through different forms of solvents and from that point it's cooked down I like to use a food grade alcohol base this is made by North Star genetics they also have new RSO caps that I've got samples of to try but their alcohol based food grade and I believe that that's the safest for our body I know that our bodies can absorb alcohol and when it's condensed down and extracted such residual amounts of alcohol or left that I'm not worried about it in consuming RSO oil if you've been reading about RSO oil you know that the program for cancer is 60 to 90 grams that you're supposed to eat 60 to 90 grams in as quick of a time as you humanly can do and please if anybody tells you you cannot get high or you don't get high that is not true you do get high um I recommend if you're using RSO oil for cancer treatment that you get and um please get one that's been lab tested please don't give anybody your money and hope that they're going to go make it for you please don't buy it off the internet please don't think CBD oil off the internet is Rick Simpson oil please learn that there is a difference or you're going to be wasting precious this time and valuable money so I live in California I'm best blessed to be a medical marijuana patient and have access to a dispensary so I get to go there just like a regular pharmacy and pick up the concentrated cannabis oil or RSL oil as one would need um my oil comes from North Star genetics as I talked about they make a high THC oil in a 1 gram syringe and a CBD to THC RSO oil which kind of gives you the best of both worlds I really believe in sort of a one-to-one ratio for if you're fighting cancer now RSO oil is used for a lot more than cancer juice for chronic pain it's used for inflammation it's used for seizures its use for nausea it's just more concentrated than if you were to smoke the cannabis flower so you eat like a half a grain to a grain size of rice back to the cancer treatment if you are using RSO oil i know rick simpson believes in starting with 1/2 a grain to a grain size of rice at night that's a good way to start you'll sleep it off and get a great night's sleep and maybe not feel the high as much but i've learned that cancer cells grow every eight to ten hours and so i recommend and have been doing this for five or six years now and have been really recommending to patients that they eat their oil even in smaller increments every four to six hours if possible and so one way to do it is just to put a little on your finger and to eat it some people like to put it in a little piece of bread and then swallow it and now large stargenetics has come out with prefilled capsules for you so you all you have to do is swallow it and each capsule comes with 45 milligrams of THC 25 milligrams of CBD which is just great point six grams of CBN a little bit of CBG and some CB c CB see there's a lot of great stuff in this it looks like the cap is about half full I would you know if you are starting a program this is something that I would probably if you are cannabis user go ahead and take one expect you're going to feel it or if you don't want to you could also pull it apart and just take a little bit out these were given to me as a sample and I'm going to be sampling them soon but I I really really want to emphasize Rick Simpson oil is fantastic I personally use it for my eye issues I know I don't have glasses on I have contacts on but I'm really really nearsighted I have glaucoma that's caused from being so nearsighted it's not cause from eye pressure so it's affecting my optic nerves I also have extremely thin retinas and have problems with my eyes in the fact that they're saying I could go blind 20 years younger than I should but ironically I have the most healthiest oxygenated thin retinas that my retina specialists have seen I think it's all the cannabis and cannabis oil I consume if you have any questions please hit me up on my blog please write on YouTube I'm at canna lovey on IG you know me here at wwk a critic blog spot.com but I am passionate about our soil North Star genetics I give them a 5 thumbs up if I had 5 thumbs they're fantastic their products are great their stuff is sold at Sonoma patient group in Santa Rosa California if you are a Sonoma County or a California resident give us a call check us out and learn all you can about RSO oil please be a good consumer please don't just buy something online thinking it is what they say it is do your research ask questions ask people in the cannabis community call dispensaries even to ask them what to buy but educate yourself and I highly recommend noir stargenetics have a great day", "rd52f4T_PlY": "this is what RSO looks like when you get it in a syringe it's full of black oil this is what it looks like when it comes in CVD form for me anyway this is from indigenous bloom and what I do is I take my Rick Simpson oil put it into caps and I ingest okay so the Rick Simpson oil that I use to kill cancer it made me sleep for the first two months I gotta say it really knocked me on my butt so you need to have someone with you when you start taking this and you start doubling the dose you're going from a half a grain of rice to one grain of rice to two grains of rice to four to eight to sixteen so you see how it starts to become quite a bit when you go from eight to sixteen you're looking at double eights right so - that's a lot of oil to take in just someone who's not used to it in your body but that's the protocol double it every four days if you're dealing with cancers that have let's say you've got a cancer that the doctor says there's no hope for you you want to get 60 grams in under 90 days I did 60 grams in 90 days that's the protocol 60 grams in 90 days one of these syringes is a gram or one milliliter okay so I'm taking one of these a day while I'm on chemo and well almost one a day I'm actually taking three-quarters of it because I film my own Suren or my own pills with it and then I ingest them and so when I ingest my pills I wait eight hours and then I take another pill and then by putting them in these capsules I don't have to taste the yucky black-tar taste that comes with it also really peppery taste it's like putting pepper on your tongue it's very strong and so the pill is the best way and I'd say after by about C I started it December 30th and by March I was more active again I wasn't sleeping as much I started to eat a little bit more and by mid-april all the cancer was undetectable and happiest day of our lives because you know going into chemo is like I said it's very scary especially for me and I don't know you but it scares the hell out of me and I'm on my last month now and I'm still cancer-free I have no more multiple myeloma you can do the same so grateful so grateful for what God put on this earth it's gonna help you it's can I help me and many others are gonna go through this [ __ ] if you have to go through chemo and throw up and get sick be so scared you don't know what's coming next this is the best thing for you I'm gonna take this the rest of my life because there's no cure for my cancer there's a cure for you you", "-zuJsgr78R8": "every one so it's the eve well nearly midnight probably one of my most important scans in eight years because this is the scan where we know what my future is obviously my first brain tumor eight years ago we then thought we had five years clear we did not those mistakes made and I've actually been progressing that entire time but as you know eventually I stabilized it like I did last year and then since then it's been progressing now when I came off my RSO to go away for a couple of months abroad and I lost my tolerance and also I've completed the 90 days of the Rick Simpson oil protocol so I my dogs are making noises my little babies and when I came off it no longer stable progression like I said on my previous videos with the panic you as well we cleared the brain tumor so quickly that the dead brain tumor cells got eaten by the original tumor or while the second - moment going by the active cancer and it became active again so what we're hoping for now is a good result in the morning now they told me I could never stop this cancer without chemotherapy and even then it's not a long-term solution it always comes back 17 years is the average of our survival rate with combining them both but it always comes back and then and you do it again and again and it destroys you destroys your body your immunity everything your spirit everything so I don't ever want to go there no matter how hard this gets and so we changed to be care oncology they repurposed drugs and I'm back on my hours so I'm building up to a gram a day now I'm only on about a quarter of a gram because it's making me very high but sorry my throat I keep getting fog in my throat oh I'm unable to talk fogs are not part of the protocol it's just very worried about tomorrow and so I just want to share how I'm feeling and what happening because so many people get so worried and anxious by scans and I just want to happy here to tell you that's very normal I don't sleep til 5:00 a.m. that's why I've got these big old dark circles under my eyes I don't sleep a lot that's fine my appetites fine excuse me sorry but I just wanted to share you guys just my worries for tomorrow because of the covet my scans have been delayed two months and this can go one of two ways this can be by delaying my scans for two nearly three months it's given time for this care oncology we purpose drugs and our so to start working again and I'm absolutely praying I've not just cut off the metabolic pathways which are feeding the cancer but I've also started to shrink it in the kill phase so she knows I'm gonna pick it on video so we need to enter the kill phase which is what the IRA so comes in so the Met form and the repurposed drugs they cut off the the sugars and stuff entering the brain the proteins it's cutting off fats cutting off every metabolic pathway to stop this and I realize yesterday you know I'm 37 this year I think I get confused I think so and I've lived with this brain tumor for eight years and I fived I've done things I would never dream of I've achieved things I never dreamed of my cancer was not a curse to me it is for so many but for me it was a blessing because it enabled me to live the life of my dreams and do things I never fought because I was on borrowed time I didn't have 1890 years like someone else you know I had to do my dreams no today because if not had been taken from me and once it didn't matter what I was dying did it really matter if I didn't become this covergirl or getting this film or that film did it matter no because I would have been dead Oh unable to know who I am if I had the radiotherapy I would have know my own name however due to the protocol I chose the cannabis oil I have five I have lived the life of my dreams and if you all got taken away there would be no regrets however I still have a few more dreams left and I want to achieve them which is why I'm praying so hard that this is working but I feel good I feel well even though I don't sleep for my anxiety you know I feel good I won nearly every day I feel good I'm healthy but I've had worse there's been a couple of moments over the last year or two where there was no hope and I lost my faith and I signed those wretched chemo letters twice saying to mom if I'm not stable if I'm no longer winning I will take it for her because she wants me around for a long time and even if it's not the life I choose I could never be that person that stops fighting for my mum because she's my rock and she's my world and she has fought harder than me every step of the way last year we honest-to-god thought I was gonna die I had ambulances most days we think it was purge in the cancer just before I became stable I was on the floor shaking flowing up once I felt blood because it just tore my throat puking so much they took me to a me and I was in a hospital for three days unable to drink unable to eat and they want to put the sickness box into my arm which carry around in a bag and I said no way we're putting this little box on my body that's gonna inject me with an anti sickness all day every day to the point it's not addressing the cause we don't know why I'm sick and I will never ever get that out of my body because when do you know you'd no longer need it and the doctors didn't understand me so I said no and I went home and I tried a milkshake and I spat it out I sicked it all over my mother and I smashed the glass on the floor and so many times my mum had to clean up after my anger and frustration I punched through a wall I broke my hand in four places out of frustration that I could not eat and on my Facebook memories yesterday I'd celebrated by three chicken nuggets I know I shouldn't be in them but that's all in a week my way it was 60kg within a month I was 40 kg I did not eat and then it got to the point I could not drink I stopped waiting at 40 kg I was a skeleton the pictures would shock you and before I was gonna die and my mum cried and she begged and she screamed in my face I had to eat and I just couldn't and then I stopped drinking you know I would throw up every drink I had it would just spill out of my mouth I was throwing up bile and I had ambulances most days and there was nothing anyone could do for me and we think it was just all the cancer purging from all the things I did the cannabis the hoxsey and so on the clinic from Mexico i poisoned my body in order to get well to stabilize myself to get healthy which is exactly what chemo is but I used natural alternatives my hair fell out I could sit on my hair you know and my skin was rash all over and I was so sick but I got better I eat so much these days you know so much fear today I add a barbecued I don't really eat me I normally have vegan alternatives and I ate for about five people for Part II and I weigh 56 kg again I'm healthy I'm fit I'm strong I'm building muscle you know I got better just when we thought that I was gonna die we got better and then we stabilized and it was probably the best day of my life and then even before that the year before the doctors gave me one month to live if I didn't start radiotherapy and chemotherapy one month and I'm here two years on so whatever happens tomorrow with my results we know I've had worse those two instances a month to live there's no way they could tell me I've got a month to live now I feel so good not well not a portion of the former carry my fitness my health my energy I feel healthy and I probably feel better than a lot of my friends you don't have cancer and don't have the ailments I have due to the fact they have bad diets so I was snotty know what a train wreck and I'm so thankful to everyone who supports me whose fundraise to saved my life and I really really pray that the world who was watching me looking to me for Faith Hope and all these people that want to see me fighting and surviving this because it means hope for them and their families I really pray that I've got good news for you tomorrow I might not update you right away because me and my mom we need to process this whatever happens we need to attack this we need to have our next stage of planning we need to think what do I do next whether it's good or bad but I will not lose my faith I will not lose my hope I will not touch those wretched pharmaceutical drugs you know I will stay on this path for the rest of my life no matter how long that is and so I just want to say to you thank you am I scared for tomorrow I'm past scared what's done is done I can't do any more other than just keep fighting every day to take all these medicines look at all these boxes of medicines just keep taking them no matter how sick they sometimes make me and hopefully just keep five and hopefully I've got some good news for you so I'll keep you updated sorry for the tears and it's not a new year the folks in here and I'll forget about you I really feel hand on heart I am meeting this I really feel I don't have anyone spiritual spiritual they into numerology and stuff I'm seeing every sign that I've shrunk this and we've got a phone appointment because you can't even go in oncology because of the kind of it and I just so badly want to hold this radio reported my hand and see what the radiographers have said I don't want to see my brain on that screen I want to see this tumor and I cannot unless was breaking me so in less than 12 hours I will have my results good or bad and if they're bad I just have to hold on to that but I've been in a worse position twice and I've held on and I've got better and I thrived and I wanted to share that message to all of you as well that maybe if you're worried about results it's not the worst we've had it's not the worst you're gonna have so thank you all and I've been advising lots of people in brain tumors today do share my YouTube channel on your social media of anyone who you feel might benefit from learning about cannabis oil and repurposed drugs panic you and everything like that because I saw some on social media today saying THC doesn't help cancer and I don't want to argue with these fools this sheep you know but I just want to hold my hands up and say I am here alive fiving because of cannabis oil I am pain-free I have no no no pain when I broke my hand like I said a minute ago my friends all said that's gonna happen the cannabis wears off and I said cannabis never wears off I'm completely pain-free migraines have gone I never spell to open my eyes each day for pain and just even jogging now I could barely walk for each step was agony I mean the counselors three-quarters of my brain with the swelling edema and cancerous tumor and I haven't had migraines in a year but one single headache you know it's a miracle cannabis oil has saved my life it's given me a quality of life and I really really employ everyone to add it into their diet healthy or not had I not known my cannibal my concert grand back for those five years and wasn't using cannabis order to prevent err I've been the ground now so please do place your belief in that even if your belief is not in yourself or in me and we're gonna show the world that this works so in 12 hours I will know my safe please please if you say a little prayer for me and everyone else fighting this it'll mean the world and I pray that we can all beat this deadly disease and I'm sending everyone fighting with so much love so much strength and so much courage and thank you for the kind words you say about me that I'm a warrior and and how much I'm helping the world thank you because I get a lot of abuse for what I do I guess not bucket I get a lot of abuse for looking so well when I'm a dying girl so I just want to say that that's proof that cannabis also works because I do not look like a cancer patient and I am so blessed for that because I've not had chemo cancer patients don't look sick chemo makes you look sick chemo makes you sick and I'm not saying don't touch chemo it's everyone's personal personal decision and choice to make I just haven't researched it would not and having some friends on it of how many thousands of you have said to me on my page private messages on here don't touch it I would not but many people have rived on chemo and for that I congratulate you and I am so happy that you are well but please do look at your natural alternatives to undo the side effects of chemo and also to improve your immunity and your health for not just this current virus but for protect you to protect you from cancer in the future so those are my little musings thank you for coming to my TED talk I'm joking and I hope I can update you all tomorrow depending on what what's happened and how I can tell you and one thing I don't ever want to tell you all is that I've failed because so many of you watching me and so many of you won the hope well I'm giving you and I cannot fail you so goodnight god bless and sending love and courage to you all goodbye stay safe in these current times everyone and you'll see me again soon", "ICSsCVtQ2gg": "all right doctor a from North Side ghetto STL Ferguson Missouri what people who don't know nothing is at is at look the role of cannabinoid receptors and renal diseases this is pubmed.gov if you're not familiar with it it is where scientists post the results and the government can hide it from you so what I want you to know is this site is important because you can find a lot of death now we know the endocannabinoid system is important so we're gonna see what they found our results we gather data regarding the current states of knowledge of the cannabinoid system in normal renal physiology and in various experimental whatever that word is especially diabetes we also received data obtained and models of diabetes and obesity as well as non meta metabolic models of renal fibrosis when cb1 that's the navin oi receptor blockers and cb2 agonist were used we also found very few data are available so far regarding to cellular pathways and filed downstream of the cannabinoid receptors in the development of renal fibrosis but we do know that the cannabinoids run on those receptors and that the cannabinoids that are pure heal overall we found that the cannabinoid receptors are a promising target in the development of renal disease and fibrosis particularly in chronic kidney disease and diabetes moving right along same site to give you some more insight the role of cannabinoids signaling and acute and chronic kidney disease I'm gonna skip down so that you can grab some information you can find these pages on your own and read for yourself but please understand that a lot of times they're trying to create synthetic drugs to duplicate the drugs and naturally I mean the the elements that naturally run on the cannabinoids a human body and these synthetic drugs are toxic and have always been dangerous and they have can't duplicate what the Creator has created for the maintenance of the human body so read right here where you will see the newly established role of the endocannabinoid system in the kidney might have therapeutic relevance as former college seal from a colleague to Co modulation of the endocannabinoid system see using drugs or modulated has rental productive effects in experimental animals raising hopes for a future potential applications and humans but it would make more sense that are using synthetic to just use the damn natural element and heal yourself there's been another report cases of acute kidney injury associated with the use of synthetic cannabinoids that appear to have higher potency and rate of toxicity than natural cannabis important this is an array it's just something I would like to mention here now I've never been a big fan of CBD I know most people don't really know all of this but THC is the cancer killer and this is what you got to remember now CB in you know in hormones driven cancers such as breast cancer CBD can have some good benefits there's no question but in most of the cancers I've seen you know one cancer bowel cancer whatever brain cancer the higher the THC level the better and I've always said so these people trying to force to the Siebels down your throat and CBD is a buzzword don't fall for the trick but check this out from Rick you know it's it's a lot like dr. Michelin said you know it's the entourage effect of all these different cannabinoids working together but you see today they're trying to separate them you know CBD tea or CBN and all these different cannabinoids there's well over a hundred of them you know the drug industry would like to separate everyone and saying well this is good for that and this is good for something else it's a bunch of nonsense take the damn extract and I mean it might make you high in the beginning I won't deny that but getting high never hurt no one and uh the thing is what once you become accustomed to an extract you become immune to it that's how I get people up usually within a month up to a lota gram every 24 hours but if you get up to that dosage and if you get a different extract from a different strain and you take that same dosage you're gonna get as high as kite but again nobody ever died forget about all these cannabinoids are important and so is CBD but like I said never underestimate you know the you know the THC is definitely needed any extract it doesn't contain THC I don't even I don't even consider to be you know hip extract you heard it from Rick himself hey talk to you in a minute listen this is it it's the same for all major diseases you needed about sixty grams it costs but you gotta have that there's no way around it listen to Rick listen to Rick listen to Rick so we all have to find our own levels and comfort zones when people are taking the oil to treat serious disease or just to reset their bodies back to a healthy state I suggest to them that they ingest 60 grams of high-grade oil as quickly as possible for the average person it usually takes about 90 days to adjust this amount of oil but I have seen people I've seen people in just 60 grams in 30 days and cure their terminal in a month now we have seen this and more than once this is very potent so you start off with little tiny doses if I'm half the size of a grain of dry rice just little tiny doses three to four times a day and then after about four days increase your dose and as time goes on you about every four days just keep increasing the object would be like for them to ingest about 60 grams of this high-grade oil as quickly as they can now in most cases usually within third of their three months they can take it but I've had patients take the whole treatment and in like a month people with terminal cancer is cured in a month California right now I'm in three states all the time and it's people I find them all the time they're being healed at being healthy helping their family members it's different things going on in this lady here this video was called him works kicks kidney disease he had great results that are tested back you can find that by searching but listen once you say stop producing urine over six months ago she starts to realize wait the CBD oil there might be something to it that might be what's working for him so all in all he's doing phenomenal on his journey function has increased more he's it's not gonna return back to full kidney function but his kidneys have improved they're still working and this time a year and a half ago he was in kidney failure his kidneys were operating at 3% he was producing zero urine and he was he was having their called T is mini-strokes because of it because he had fluid overload and his blood pressure was about 260 over I think was 130 and I was extremely high and dangerous it was throwing him and having mini strokes maybe if you're angry get off my life he was throwing him into you know many strokes he had high blood pressure high cholesterol his ocular levels were through we're here at red blood cell pop red blood cells vessels popping daily and he was just an overall bad state he went into a diabetic coma for about 32 hours and when he woke up they were like who has end-stage kidney failure your kidneys are not operating and then today his doctor tells us that he has improved kidney function he should have not been producing urine at this state and he is still producing two full liters of urine a day which is normal for an adult male his age so I mean this is just my boy I had to come on and share it with you I really hope whoever is playing angry faces it's an accident anyways I really would hop on and share this information with you because it was truly amazing to hear this and you know I'm the firmament firm cannabis activists I've seen what it can do for me for my family but I longed for it and my answer for almost my entire family I've seen what it can do and so to get this news today just really really was exciting for us thank you for watching I had to share it with you"}
