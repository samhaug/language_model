{"Qqm0eS5nKmw": "okay so in my current attempt to worry less and experiment more I'm coming out of a sixteen and a half hour fast into this is a candy bar with a hundred milligrams of THC see how it is okay so when you finally wrestle with the childproof packaging which is also micro proof you get this it's a pretty little gold bar it's pretty being that this is the first carbs I've had in a few days it's actually really good you actually don't get a hint about cannabis flavor and who raped you oh no how far hundred milligrams are gonna take me cuz I believe I have a pretty high dollar okay so it has been one hour since I had my candy bar and while I wouldn't say that I feel high I I feel good there's definitely an edge gone a little bit of a body low I'm very uh positive okay now it has been to two hours since I ate my candy bar and now yeah I'm high I'm very tingly and they calm my body weighs a lot it turns out that 100 milligrams just write him out for me okay it has now been three hours since I ate my candy bar now I'm feeling just absolutely fantastic you'll notice the we're on the road because we've had to go buy 20 cheeseburgers I love you okay so 100 milligram bar we're probably five six hours now when I lost count awesome I really think I could even help my dosage coolest thing about all this is just the availability of something like this it was $25 at the dispensary the fact that something like that exists at the dispensary that you can go to the store and buy weed is just a mind-boggling world I'm glad we live in it until next time", "vAd2MnnDEn4": "hey guys welcome back to our channel if you're new here I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "FI73gfwO1Lk": "[Music] another video today is gonna be a very different type of video as I've never done one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment subscribe if you're new and yeah we'll see you guys in the next video B so guys", "qfdpEsrfu84": "[Music] give me a w w give me an e e give me an e e give me an A hey give me a t t give me an S s what does that spell wait sweet sweets hello everyone welcome to we it's the marijuana review show or we hope you guys make sense of your in dispensary classic classic review today we are taking a look at an edible and a brand I already know that I love quite a bit that is we are taking a look at our freshly legal review of Kiva Kiva their new 100 milligram a THC ginger dark chocolate bar with a hundred milligrams of CBD as well as you guys probably know if you tuned in often I'm not much of a CBD guy um but I am a THC guy so this one's a little bit more expensive than the standard Kiva because of the addition of the THC everything that cost me 25 bucks at night dispensary in Long Beach plus taxes so it's quite expensive but I hope it's going to taste as good as all other Eva products are and even most importantly I hope it's going to be as potent as Kiva has been now you can see the crazy packaging and has to go through this Kim in a sealed bag with a childproof seal and then this itself is in a childproof bag sealed and you always have to figure out how to open these and I can never figure out how to open them because I am NOT a smart person it's some point so we're gonna try to figure this out together you do this and that and then you pull away and then you say [ __ ] it and you get scissors that's how that's actually how it works you try what it says on the back and then used to get scissors and then surprise surprise on the inside is the exact same thing with all the pertinent information on it as well it's got lab tested results nutrition information all the good good stuff you want to see on it and that great Kiva minimalist card word packaging I really like their packaging design I'm outside of this unnecessary bag it's minimalist its well-designed and it does the job so I'm excited about this I like ginger like chocolate I'd loved every kiba flavor I've ever had and they've all got me a very very high so let's see if the tradition continues and here we go can't really smell anything just yet each piece contains five milligrams of THC so I guess this is gonna be twenty little squares or rectangles in there and there we are there are our 20 rectangles with some little design on it and oh it smells a lot like ginger that is a heavy ginger scent let's give it a taste it's like a symphony in my mouth and the conductor is weed it's good guys don't know matter that's what much else to tell you um except if you don't like ginger you are not gonna like this because this is heavy on the ginger flavor I happen to be pretty a fan ginger so I enjoyed this the chocolate itself is great quality there is a slight cannabis taste to it nothing overpowering nothing that's gonna make you throw up but if you hate the taste of cannabis maybe avoid but for me please punch mmm okay well I've been in there sixteen rectangles to get through but don't worry I'll finish off all of these and then once I finish off the last one I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling okay it'll probably be closer to three because I'm on my way to go see bad times at the El Royale is that the name the new Drew Goddard movie the guy did cabin in the woods excited about that so I'll cut you guys after the movie and I'll let you know how this kiba there are a lot of pieces of packaging here key the ginger dark chocolate bar is hitting thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you in just a bit and welcome back to weeds it has been about two hours 45 minutes and change since I last seen you guys and I come back to you surprisingly conflicted about the kiva ginger dark chocolate bar if you will look at my eyes they will tell you I am quite high and I do feel very relaxed very at ease very peaceful however I don't want to say I feel high per se I feel just sort of more easygoing and more relaxed and I might be confusing this I might this might just be a total placebo a factor I've sort of gotten into my own head and the confirmation bias type thing um I have heard however that's for some people CBD counter affects the psychoactive properties of THC and this can make you feel the CBD sort of effects and you know the more relaxing effects of THC as well but not this sort of more whoa man kind of high aspects and I think that might be what happened to me here ah for some people that's gonna be great that is going to be a jackpot that's gonna be exactly what they want for me it's not what I was looking for I was really hoping for more of a the classic head-high experience especially seeing the movie I just got out of Drew Goddard bad times at Hotel at the El Royale something like that I can't remember all those nouns so I was hoping to be really high for that movie because Drew Goddard likes to spend some crazy yarns and said I was just really chilled out and and you know I was a little disappointed unfortunately this is not gonna be the Kiva for me however I am NOT gonna give it a disapproval or I'm not gonna give it the thumbs down because I think for this a certain customer one who perforce prefers the more gist chilled out relaxed style of weed might really love this for me however it's just not exactly what I was looking for not what I was hoping for but that is not Kiva's fault I I knew that that was a possibility going in so just wanted to give you guys that heads-up that the CBD seems to be pretty effective in here so if you love CBD and THC maybe give this one a shot if you are like me and like the sort of Moorhead high this sort of more psychedelic sort of side of I wanna you'll want to stick with the traditional Kiva's which I have no problem recommending wholeheartedly so this one is a little bit mixed for me unfortunately but again that is not not an endorsement or not telling you to avoid it so I'm going to before I bounce here though guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something that I do not have mixed feelings over and that is another Drew Goddard movie because I did have some similarly mixed feelings to this key lebar about bad times at hotel Royale something elroy out whatever the name of the movie is but his second movie I think cabin in the woods from 2012 is a fantastic movie I'm sure you've probably seen it and I'm sure somebody if you haven't has spoiled it for you but if not check it out it is an utter utter riot one of the most inventive movies and years just an absolute blast love that movie two thumbs up for Drew Goddard cabin in the woods one thumb up one kind of half cocked for the hotel Royale and about the sort of same for that keepa bar I think that sort of sums it all up I'm still pretty high just not the same high I wanted to be and that's gonna do it for real this time thank you so much for watching weeds guys and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "iwMgD51_zEk": "first off I just want to give a little disclaimer saying that I do not condone the use of any legal or illegal mind-altering substances the contents of this video are created purely for education it's inevitable that there will be people who consume these substances therefore it is extremely important to educate people on the effects and how to properly use them so edible pot is a lot different than smoking it it's more potent it's processed in the body differently and the effects lasts longer the difference with edibles is that the active ingredient the chemical that gets you high THC is processed in the liver before the user experiences any effects the original THC from the edible is converted in the liver into a more potent metabolite 11 hydroxy THC it's estimated that this compound is about four to five times more psycho active than normal THC and because the edible has to go through a portion of the digestive process before effects can be felt it can take 30 minutes - as long as two hours before a user feels any effects because of this people who don't feel any effects after an hour so might want to reduce only to have the entire thing hit them like a train all at once an hour later so my advice just wait it out it may take a while but it will come on and unlike smoking cannabis in which the effects last about two hours and gradually drop off after a quick climax right after inhalation edible pot takes its time before it reaches its peak in effect and this peak lasts longer typically the effects of edibles lasts four to eight hours when it comes to the effects there are certainly similarities between smokeable and edible weed but there are some properties that appear to only occur strictly on edibles there are two main reasons someone would want to consume an edible the first is for medical benefits such as aiding symptom relief of stress or anxiety or to help one sleep and the second is simply just for recreational purposes just to have a high and have a time aside from these two reasons there are actually a few people in the psychedelic community who use edibles and very high doses in a similar way to what one would use LSD or magic mushrooms for but we'll touch on that aspect at the end of the video so now we are going to get into what you can expect to feel from the different doses of weed edibles but firstly it's important to know that tolerance is everything tolerance plays a huge role in your experience and if you're an everyday pot smoker you'll likely have to take a much larger dose of an edible that someone who has no tolerance to THC in order to feel the same effect so take the following effects of doses I give with a grain of salt as this is just generally what you can expect to feel when you take this particular dose so first off we have the micro dose and this ranges anywhere from one milligram to about 2.5 milligrams of THC it's unlikely you'll experience any active effects from this dose but it is possible for people who are hypersensitive to the effects of THC this dose is more just for purposes such as mild relief of pain stress anxiety etc people who Micro's THC edibles might also report increased creativity and focus the effects of this dose are pretty passive you likely won't feel any different fundamentally this can be somewhat compared to people who micro doze LSD and magic mushrooms who do so for similar purposes next we have the low dose which ranges from two point five milligrams to about 15 milligrams and the two ends of the spectrum can be very different especially for people with low tolerance to th see someone consuming the edible for medicinal purposes will experience stronger symptom relief and this dose can also be used for people who have trouble sleeping you may begin to feel a sense of euphoria and that classic high feeling where coordination is slightly impaired and overall perception is altered but if this dose the high is unlikely to be overwhelming and because of this this may be a good dose to try for a first-timer in my own experience there isn't a significant difference between this dose and edible in your average smoking weed high the medium dose ranges from 15 to 30 milligrams someone with a decent THC tolerance still may not be feeling heavy effects here but for many vistas can make them pretty high it's at those dose that people may start to feel negative effects such as anxiety and paranoia you might ask if people use weed for relief of anxiety stress then how could this dose bring on anxiety and stress well THC has biphasic effects which means the substance can have opposite effects in different doses anxiety can be reduced in lower doses but can actually be stronger in higher doses so if you're taking edibles for symptom relief it is important to be aware of these biphasic effects the drug in half coordination and perception will likely be altered at this dose that agree to which it is altered will likely depend on your tolerance some people might start to get the classic red eyes from being high maybe some people experience close eye visuals for me personally I tend to have a close eye visual on low to medium dose weed that looks kind of like this let me know if you have experienced the same type of visual in the comments the high dose ranges from 30 to 50 milligrams this dose will likely bring a significant high even to someone with tolerance and for someone with low tolerance this can bring an extreme high their coordination will definitely be impaired somewhat you might feel a strong euphoria maybe you'll feel very laughy some people's mouths get very dry and get cottonmouth this is due to THC mimicking a naturally occurring chemical called an and amide which binds to cannabinoid receptors in our saliva glands which causes saliva production to decrease you might also get the classic munchies and just want to absolutely binge eat it's important to remember that the effects of THC impacts everyone differently so no two people's high will be exactly the same and you likely will only experience some of the effects I listed not all the very high dose ranges from 50 to 100 milligrams I would say it's more likely than not that you will probably experience some negative effects at this dose but the high may become so intense you may feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed people often experience a rapid heart rate panic nausea in headaches at this dose so definitely don't venture into this realm if you don't know what you're doing for someone with an extremely high tolerance this dose might not be too heavy but for the average person this will likely be overwhelming there are still medicinal benefits at this dose but is only used for people who really need it as this dose is sometimes using cancer patients to boost appetite and is also used for people with certain inflammatory disorders personally any dose at this range or above just completely puts me on my ass the come-up is nice for me as I feel very laughy energetic and social but once the effects really start peaking I honestly begin to struggle to stay awake and wish to do nothing else but to find a cozy place to lie down and fall asleep this may have been due to the strain though as THC isn't the only psychoactive chemical we it's just the most prominent CBD is the chemical that aids with sleep and this chemical also plays a role in the overall effects of the weed and the amount of CBD in the strain will most definitely impact your experience and finally the extremely high dose is going to be anything above 100 milligrams I've heard of some edibles having 250 milligrams some having 500 and even some containing as much as a thousand milligrams obviously the effects will get significantly higher as those increases a 100 milligram edible might not be incredibly strong for someone with a very high tolerance but certainly 500 milligrams is going to put anybody on their ass be very careful of consuming edibles this powerful as there will certainly be negative effects due to the intensity it's in these very high doses that have experienced visuals reminiscent of a psychedelic trip on say LSD the visual might be something kind of like this and speaking of psychedelics there's many people who report having psychedelic like trips from high doses of weed edibles the world-famous Joe Rogan likes to discuss edible pot as along the same lines as psychedelics such as LSD psilocybin mushrooms and DMT saying that edible pot can take you down the rabbit hole there's a comment I found from someone on reddit that I thought described as similarity of the psychedelic feeling on high-dose edibles perfectly not long ago I did a hundred milligrams of THC edibles and had zero tolerance on my couch my eyes closed and no music it was awesome and the peak was over three hours I swam through the psychedelic mind a tunnel with many doors and behind each door was a memory of mine I went through them and had Total Recall I could recall past memories memories of being born my first laugh before thinking and the experience that my first thought as an infant the pure thrill of thinking now the effects of THC in the brain is nowhere close to resembling that of a psychedelic classical psychedelics interact directly with the 5-htt to a receptor in the brain and cannabis does not do this from doing research it seems to be that weed edibles tend to resemble psychedelics more often for people who have already had experiences with psychedelics in the past it's likely more often that this psychedelic feeling is also associated with strains with higher THC levels and lower CBD levels as CBDs antipsychotic effects will likely lessen the psychedelic effect but if you find yourself feeling like you're in the middle of an intense psychedelic trip I'll say what I've always said before let the experience consume you surrender to the substance let your mind flow freely and try not to attach yourself to these thoughts just simply observe don't make any attachments so that's about it for this video hopefully you have a better idea on what you can expect to feel by the different doses of weed edibles if you're new start low THC affects everyone slightly differently so see how you react to the substance stay safe consume responsibly and you'll be fine if you seek to support my work on a deeper level consider joining the patreon I run a book club on there where we read one book a month

sarah b and welcome back to the haze today we're going to be doing another edible review we will be talking about los angeles's own la familia chocolate the mint flavor to be exact [Music] now la familia is a la based edible company that specializes in mexican style candies and drinks the packaging my goodness tell me how gorgeous this box it came in is now the first time i tried la familia was around three years ago and the packaging was very different i think they've done two rebranding since so it comes in this small box and i really like all the details on it the the name you can see on the side in the back here you'll get all their kind of like calories ingredients and all their disclaimers i love the little detail on this part on the bottom where it says there's no taste like home i love that so basically when you get the packaging you open it up bamboozled there will be a statement from the creator which i really like and then up here you'll get a little diagram of your candy bar and i'll show you how every little stick of the chocolate is 10 milligrams which is super cool now inside that packaging you will find this little bag and this bag contains your candy bar now again i love the color i love the whole theme but i do have some bones to pick with this part of the packaging because it doesn't work it doesn't work basically like this your candy bar goes across um right here it shows where you're supposed to put your fingers and your post a pinch and when you pinch the plastic as opposed to kind of flour open and you're supposed to be able to peel it back and grab your candy bar but since the candy bar is so big where you pinch the candy bar is still there so you can never get it tight enough to where this opens up i was trying for like 30 minutes trying to get it to where it would open and i was never successful at some point i just gave up and i took my scissors and cut it open so that's that's the problem so whoever is in charge of that maybe kind of rethink this i don't know something needs to change inside of that you will find your chocolate bar now i love that they have their name on it as well i thought that was super super cool and it does have a little wheat leaf on the side here so in case a parent finds this and it's like can i give this to my kid do not give this to your child now if you're someone who's into micro dosing or taking less at a time the size of this candy bar is a real benefit because if this is 10 milligrams then of course this will be five and then this will be 2.5 so there you go that's a really nice part of this product because it leaves it open for you to be able to dose yourself how much you need so let's talk about the flavor and the smell so if you're concerned about cannabis smell or taste you definitely don't get it at all on these edibles not one bit the mint flavor is very tasty very strong and it's mixed with a dark chocolate which i loved and it gives it a really familiar taste very similar to you would say like an andes mint or anything like that it's just a really tasty chocolate so if you like dark chocolate and you like mint the combination on these two is to die for you you won't be making a bad decision i'm telling you it's just a really great tasting chocolate you can't go wrong with it you can tell the quality when you try it as for the high the high is very heavy and i loved it i'm here for it the body high is strong i felt it was just a really great high i felt the body high is intense and so is the head high it is just a really great heavy edible if you're someone with a higher tolerance this is inedible than i would suggest if you're someone with a lower tolerance micro dose it as low as possible as you think around 5 to 2.5 and see how that feels for you for me this was great at about 40 milligrams i loved it i was i was chilling um another great thing about this high is that it's not extremely long uh it only lasted for me for about four hours and then i fell asleep which is great though because sometimes you're not looking for highs it'll last you your whole day sometimes you do just want to knock out wake up and have a brand new day which for me this was that now if you're someone who is going to be going to maybe a party and you're going to want to stay up and you're going to want to drive home at some point la familia chocolate is not for you but if you're someone who's going to be chilling at the house maybe hanging out with your family and looking for something that also can help with a sleep aid or some sort of body recovery some sort of muscle recovery this chocolate is absolutely great um i did get the heavy sleeps but that is something sometimes you want from an edible so for the overall experience i would definitely suggest la familia chocolates especially if you're someone like me who takes edibles quite a bit and likes a heavier edible this one is for you it is really tasty really nice the cannabis flavor is nowhere to be seen on it so yeah if you guys go out and you guys see a lot familiar i would say pick them up as for the price i've kind of seen the price range between 19 to 24 so i guess it just depends on what dispensary you go to and what they're selling it at so yeah try it out i loved it it's definitely something i'm going to be buying again and again and again so my name is sarah b thank you guys so much for watching the haze please leave a comment below let me know if you guys tried the law familiar chocolates let me know what you thought about them did they hit for you

today we're doing a strain review on a blackberry kush so i picked up some of those humboldt farms this still wasn't cheap but in california i would say this is on the more affordable end of things before you know there was top shelf but now there's exotic shell [ __ ] it's just getting crazier and more and more expensive with delivery and everything came out to be about 60 dollars this is in indica i gotta say the nose on this the smell was amazing in the bag it lingering out you know i would say this is a blackberry smell but i don't think blackberries smell very much you know like i've seen them in the wild and this is a very kiefy flower like i said i only have crumbs left but it's a [ __ ] on a keefe so i'm gonna blaze that up real quick [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] very much this uh this tasty taste maybe i should search up this strain so lethally says herbal peppery and citrus pain management thanks to its body high effects it's a combination combination of afghani and blackberry nice it says it has a hashy jet fuel taste and aroma that is balanced by sweet berries nice nice nice relaxed happy sleepy euphoric and hungry i will agree that uh i got this hungry feeling from it i'm still feeling a little cerebral high i'm feeling a little goodness up there but it's not making my mind a race i'd say very good balance definitely been getting very high off it it's crazy seeing this level of weed again seeing just the [ __ ] ton of trichomes that is on here it's completely keefed up so many little pestles all right listen we gotta pay the bud tender so we got a sponsored segment the ganja berries wait a sec seriously thank you to ganja berry because otherwise i would not have been able to afford this weed these right here are actually made out of real goji berries from goji berries you can pack up to a gram and a half in here it's tasty and it'll have that slow burn best part these are actually pretty cheap i'm gonna open one right and you can use code stoned alone for another 15 off devlin check him out show him some love because that is how we acquired the cannabis for today's room jumping back into the blackberry strain cannabis infused dark chocolate bar with a hundred milligrams of blackberry and i'm gonna pull up the effects on that because it is a different strain blackberry is a mother strain of the blackberry kush so this is cool because i don't even realize ah it is raspberry cough crossed with the strain black domina and it's a buzzy and relaxing my tolerance has been pretty low and when i ate this hundred milligrams of course it started off a bit by bit like you know i'm really i'm just gonna eat one piece it's like i'll eat a few more pieces i'll eat the five pieces and then i you know eat the whole [ __ ] thing so before corova a different company used to sell thousand milligram [ __ ] bars and it would be like this giant scotch-a-roo thing i guess that's what you would call it and uh the whole thing was super strong so that [ __ ] was definitely the bang for the buck but i do understand why they cap it at 100 milligrams because i ate the whole [ __ ] thing you know and with munchies it's like you know it's a chocolate bar like obviously i want to eat the whole [ __ ] chocolate bar it's like really hard to just stop at one that [ __ ] is strong and there's so many memes about it that's the classic [ __ ] like oh these edibles and these edibles ain't gonna do nothing and then you know getting laid out by it it kind of tripped me out because again this is described as a relaxing high as a euphoric high but at just the highest dose like this it feels so strong in the head is like it doesn't really matter what strain it is it feels like this kind of sativa meltdown what's funny to me is every time this happens it's like getting too high or like you know even tripping or something it's in the moment i almost don't realize what's even happening because i was hitting my delta eight cartridge and i was just like damn i'm so [ __ ] hot i'm like this is crazy and then i was getting so high that i wasn't even thinking that i wasn't even realizing i'm just like what is happening like am i dreaming right now and like i just completely forgot that i even ate edibles i just wasn't even thinking about that i'm just like what happens like am i in between days am i in yesterday am i like about to go into tomorrow it was just uh it was really funny like being on that level so i just took a nap and kind of waking up during the nap and being like oh [ __ ] right i'm [ __ ] on edibles and i feel like psychedelics are almost easier to ride because in a psychedelic it's like it's crazy but you kind of ride with it and it'll change into something else it'll kind of like you know turn back around it'll loop but with an edible it's just like oh [ __ ] cause you know of course it's still just weed but it's just like a lot of input in the brain it's just like i wasn't able to just ride with it you know i was trying to go with the flow which is kind of like super powerful like trying to just sleep through it but then you know it's like halfway between the dream world it's a good time but it's just uh it's strong waves it's harder to just kind of like you know dissipate into it it's more just like definitely the blackberry edibles are very good smacked i was chapped i was very [ __ ] high and then i picked up some weight afterwards my uncle and i are convinced they're like is that edible you ate that weed and that's why you know like you got fat tasty stuff when i didn't know what weed i was getting and you know it still happens for sure that is one annoying thing is when it becomes super racy and you don't even know you just hit it it's like oh [ __ ] i like the strain because it is not that i find that sometimes with sativas it'll kind of like burn me out and then i'll actually kind of crash from the sativa and be very tired later later on so i'll pick a sativa because i'm like oh it's very energetic but then it kind of has a crash to it i like this indica i'm not feeling you know the gear is turning super fast i'm just feeling a good body high i'm feeling you know baked i'm feeling warm and generally that's what i'm looking for what i want to smoke you know as close to that as i can get that body and kind of hot great one i feel like for just chilling watching movies and [ __ ] for me like doing the editing not going too wild with it blackberry crossed with afghani kush well again shout outs to ganja berry they're the sponsors show them some love it's cool seeing these new companies pop up and this is definitely a fresh thing let me know if you want to see more strain reviews it is fun to delve into it because otherwise you know maybe i wouldn't have specifically looked out and tried some blackberry so i'm glad i did and this was a fun little experience especially having both the herb and the chocolate also yes this is the herb that has appeared in the stoned alone movies the upcoming detective trip as well as back in usa and this is a strain that i would recommend and come back to because it's very chill i'm feeling fantastic and i just finished it all so i would definitely love some more i enjoyed smoking this weed eating this uh chocolate i'll be seeing you around in the next time ciao and uh you know maybe hit that subscribe button if you will stay tuned for the movie", "_mJYQtsh94Q": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today i'm going to be doing another edible review i will be reviewing the chill chocolates bam now these guys are a traditional white chocolate with oreo i believe oreo cookies on the inside at first to be honest i didn't want to try this nothing about this packaging looks new or inventive or really appetizing the the gloss finish on these boxes is not helping it it looks it looks a bit cheap okay i don't want to be that person cheap edibles can be great sometimes but a lot of them are not so i didn't want to try them purely off just the way they looked and then the fact that they are pretty expensive where i found these these guys are 100 milligrams for 22. but i i tried them i did i said why not you know i need to try another new edible something i haven't seen before and these guys were those let me tell you yes it may not look like much but these edibles are delicious they are absolutely fantastic so they come in this small box in the box you will find this box and this box is actually super cool because this box can be used later like i can hold weed in it and stuff at least that was my original thought to do with this box but sadly i cannot open this box at all i'll try to open it right now and it has like a little thing right here to show you how to do it it should just be a squeeze on both sides here there's a little part where you know you put your fingers on and then you're supposed to lift this at the same time it all should pop off it should pop off easy it's for babies not to be able to get into but i'm guessing a lot of stoners can't get into this at all as well but in that box you will find this bag in this bag you will find your edibles these are the small milk chocolate edibles with cookie crunches inside a lot of the time chocolate edibles i do get a very strong marijuana taste to it these guys i did not at all so kudos to chill you guys made a great tasting chocolate i don't even like white chocolate i'm not someone who goes for white chocolate often it's not something i really enjoy usually it comes off too sweet but these are like fantastic and every one of these small little pieces is 10 milligrams and it comes with 10 of them i took 50 milligrams because i didn't think it would have much of effect to be honest i already was thinking down on this edible i said it doesn't look great it tastes almost a little bit too good i'm gonna eat a little more and 50 milligrams let me tell you this it was bomb if you bump into chilled chocolates buy them because they are bomb i mean usually 50 milligrams i wouldn't be like as blown as i honestly was and it was a good high it was good i wasn't sure what they used for um how to medicate these chocolates but it was very much a body high my body was super relaxed so if you if you suffer from a lot of body aches if you have a lot of back problems like i've been suffering with my back a lot lately these guys are great for that because they're also delicious they're delicious you don't need much of it and they work after my height went away i did get the sleepies though because it is such a heavy body high i do believe once these edibles kind of wear off your body now knows it's time to go to bed and that's what i did i fell asleep super early yesterday so each batch in the back it says is tested three times and let me tell you it is very accurate the milligrams on here was fantastic so if you're looking for something that's easy tasting something good to help you out with some back pains and it's something that's reliable with its strength go to your little dispensary and pick up some chilled chocolates man do it you will not regret it again my name is sarah b thank you so much for watching the haze your guide to a cannabis infused lifestyle and i will catch you guys on the flip side you", "ohxDUez4AoI": "real quick before this video starts only only 2.8 of my viewers are subscribed which is very depressing so if you like what you see scroll down press the subscribe button and yeah enjoy the video hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time wonka bar edibles uh i had one of these over a year ago um but when i had it it was a bit fatter this way it was a bit wider and it was 500 milligrams instead of 300 and also they didn't have these um flavors it was just the milk chocolate but now there's a bunch of different flavors mostly based around cereal i think there's some like candy based flavors as well this is the captain crunch it says it's basically like a black market edible i don't think these are sold in any dispensaries that from what i've seen warning contains medical marijuana each chocolate bar contains 300 milligrams plus 300 milligram milligrams plus of cannabinoids i got your nutrition facts right there three grams of protein wow um 220 calories serving size one bar i don't know how some people can just eat edibles like that but i they [ __ ] kill me like i i cannot handle edibles very well anyway if we bust this bad boy open i i swear i'm pretty sure the one way back actually had wonka like on the chocolate but i guess i could be wrong because i don't remember it that well but i'm a big fan of this chocolate to be honest um very potent i would say as well for for for a uh black market not extremely legit edible they're very reliable and consistent for what they are so i would definitely recommend them but i would also be very careful unless you are experienced with edibles i guess unless you eat a ton at a time and know where you know what your limits are if you have any limits i know some people that can just eat tons and tons and tons of these things and i feel nothing my dog's complaining in the background what bud i'm making a review one second anyways in conclusion if you're looking uh for you're not trying to spend a crazy amount of money if you're if you're in the realm of uh black market edible then i would definitely recommend these if you're okay with that pretty cheap only about 25 bucks a bar if you're just buying one 25 30 dollars definitely worth it this captain crunch flavor pretty good and i'm not the biggest captain crunch fan so i'm sure the other flavors um are even better so thank you guys for watching i got a bunch of videos like this if you enjoyed it uh drop a sub check out my other videos and yeah later", "KAycqbqNaes":

an audience hello yeah but anyways today I am going to be eating or trying to eat a 500 milligram edible that I did find at a lab that I recently went to it was the first time that I had gone there and I just had to pick these up for you guys because I've never seen them ever in my life and once I figured out that these existed I saw a video on YouTube and there was comments saying that they really didn't hear so I'm not sure if I should eat the whole thing or eat a hundred milligrams of it because the other time if you guys haven't seen my if you guys haven't seen my last video I did eat a moon edible 100 milligrams and that edible like totally hit you guys I Loki freaked out so yeah I know that 100 milligrams will do me justice when it comes to properly hitting me right but yeah I had to pick this up for you guys 500 milligrams you guys enough to make me feel like I'm dying I'm not even kidding but I don't think I am gonna eat the whole thing or the whole string but I am gonna offer some people some of the edible its if you want it you want it and if you don't then you don't know pressure let me go ahead and set this camera up for you guys I am going to open and eat this in front of you guys you guys already know the deal so yeah if you guys haven't checked out my last edible video go ahead and check that out and let's do this okay I am literally on my knees for you guys but let's do this okay so this is the edible again you guys look at this cute new packaging I've never seen this type of edible ever I just had to pick it up for you guys I have to I have to this one unfortunately is not really like childproof it does have that starting cut there so it can easily be open unlike the other edibles I've said that it's a great idea not to suggest an opening just because young adults and kids can be around as for me I do have a baby around so you know not good for that but other than that it is cute I love it yeah they're medicated nerds 500 milligrams that's just tripping me out like I don't really believe it but I don't know I mean it just say it on the packaging so it says total dosage is 500 milligrams of THC and the rope has eight servings so let's see I don't know I mean that's you so it's saying one-eighth of the rope is 50 milligrams so we can calculate that by cutting it in half and then cutting it in half again and then cutting it in half again so that's pretty much a small ass piece like literally this is 50 milligrams and then another 50 and like it's just I don't know it's pretty crazy to me it just say that it's 60 minute activation time right there so I guess it's gonna take about an hour just like the other edible that I did consume for you guys so it does have this California warning sign that everyone always looks for on packaging but yeah I mean I wouldn't honestly you guys I wouldn't really trust this because I did buy it and an underground type of lab I've never even heard of this lab I was invited I wasn't even gonna buy anything so these are kind of like products that I'm iffy about so I don't know I guess you have to do your research I didn't do much research but I did see a video online yeah that was it that was pretty much it if you guys do want to have more research on this go ahead and look up videos because I'm pretty sure these are getting more known out there but yeah enough talking I'm just super talking talking maybe because I'm so nervous I don't know but let me go get some scissors actually no it has the tear there um and then let's do this so let me do a quick thumbnail and then we'll get back to it it is so hot in here you guys I'm really trying to just do this so let's do it okay yeah ready or not here we go so it says teryn share which I do plan on doing I am going as my uncle probably if he wants to try some hey baby baby okay I'm doing a video let's do it so I'm gonna open it sorry my babies in the background you guys okay look at this you guys what the heck so I had this in the refrigerator and my mom was just like freaking out telling everyone this is not a candy that this is marijuana and Dada Dada and I mean yeah precautions you guys so I'm gonna have 1/8 of the rope okay so 1/8 of the rope that's what it looks like you guys and it does say on the packaging it is 15 milligrams so here goes nothing not a soul bomb maybe you wanna try some it's so bomb you guys this is dangerous oh my gosh you guys okay two eights of the rope so this is gonna be a total of 100 milligrams why is that so bhama if you guys hear little parts as my sister's baby they just want to be cheese massage they want to be here and watch me the film for you guys these are so so bomb he says that it has a super potent formula okay I think I should keep it like that cuz I don't want to freak out you guys but okay I'll have a little more so I can have half of it which is gonna be 250 here's another one so it should be about 250 milligrams if not maybe a little less a little more nice learn can't film here you guys it is so hot in here mom like I ate a little less or a little more of 250 milligrams you guys I'm gonna feel like I'm dying but I'm yeah let me go see if anybody else wants to have a little piece of it maybe just 50 milligrams or a little more I don't mind sharing this it's whatever I did post this on snap so if you do follow me on snap you know that I did post this and I asked you guys if you guys have ever tried these and some of you guys said that they smack which is why I'm kind of scared because I don't want them to smack me so hard but some of you guys said that they don't so I guess it's just our personal experience and yeah I hope that they don't super smack but if they do a Plus let's go see who else wants to try some of these so we are gonna go outside and I am so hot here because I closed all the windows and doors so that no noise could come in but yeah your girls ready to go outside and just breathe but I will be checking up when this [ __ ] starts to hit and let you guys know what I feel so yeah let's go outside [Music] do you want to chase up it's a 500 milligram nerd okay you guys my uncle is down so go ahead and open it and then 1/8 of the rope is gonna be 50 milligrams so right there it does okay getting eighth you know what anything I know how an ape looks and we know candy no a little more a little more this would be good in them yeah I mean if there's a 500 milligram rope come with me yeah cheers Cheers you have to let us know how you feel okay I am back and I am definitely feeling this edible more of like a body high I feel yeah like maybe more of a body higher than anything else I'm like slowly freaking out like I can just feel it creeping up right now we are watching a movie so yeah I can definitely feel it while I'm watching the movie and yeah I'm pretty good right now but you guys I can definitely feel it just like it's gonna hit me like I know it's gonna hit me super hard and I just I hope that I don't freak out but yeah this is an update this is probably almost an hour after I ate the edible so keep in mind I ate about 250 milligrams this is about an hour later which yeah like the packaging said that it would hit me 16 minutes later and it's about that and I can definitely feel it creeping up right now so yeah this isn't even this isn't even the full-blown like faded moment but I will be back for that I hope that I am not freaking out or anything but yeah my mom is making carnitas and I just cut onion and cilantro and yeah I helped her in the kitchen and I'm gonna show you guys what we're eating because it just looks so bomb you guys that goes everyday bomb like super bomb and they make the best that Anita's so shout out to them but anyways let me get back to you guys and then if anything when I start to really feel it I will also ask how my uncle is feeling because he did take about 50 milligrams so he isn't really gonna feel as much but he'll definitely be feeling something if this rope is potent like it's saying it is but yeah I'll be back I already ate a taco and it was so so bomb but this is what they look like ooh ooh they look so bomb the airplane the baby I totally forgot to record I am still a little faded I honestly thought I was gonna hit harder but it didn't the day is still going the days are going so I'll be back to let you guys know the update so I thought the Edible was going to hit a little harder after the last video that I did make but no incident I was probably peaking right there and it didn't go any further than that but um yeah I was expecting it to hit a little harder just because I did consume a 250 milligrams and it just wasn't that heart of a high or a faded moment but yeah I mean would I buy them again I probably wouldn't maybe for the flavor and the taste because it tastes so bomb but for it to like actually hit and make me feel super faded mmm I don't know I'm gonna have to think about that one but yeah it was pretty good I enjoyed it I still have a little bit left and yeah I'm pretty sure it did hit my feel not as much but yeah he's knocked out after a while I thought it was gonna hit a little harder but it didn't so that's kind of a shame because other edibles that I have tried they've hit pretty hard so yeah when I buy this again sorry I'm in the kitchen and everyone's eating and I just decided the wrong time let you guys know the update but yeah it didn't hit that hard would I buy it again maybe not maybe for the flavor and taste but for it to hit me hard no I'll probably do a moon because with a moon edible eye it got me so good with just one hundred milligrams I did check up on my uncle he is totally asleep so yeah I guess I'm gonna ask him later how he felt after the edible but yeah it was a good run I did enjoy the edible it was really fun eating it I was pretty excited and yeah I've never seen an edible like that and I'm glad that I tried it for you guys like a rating out of 10 probably like I don't know a 7 just because it peaked and then that was it like I didn't really feel like super faded or anything maybe I was more of a body high but yeah other than that it was good I hope they get like the video I'm gonna show you guys a bit of what my sister is making and then that's the end of the video or maybe I'll include a little more because we are gonna drink later so other than that thank you guys for watching do not forget to Like comment and subscribe but okay but yeah let me show you guys what my sister's doing because it looks so fun oh so good were the beers

see you guys in the next video and Cheers", "vS7e836qxyE": "[Music] so what's going on youtube i'm high i'm low and this is high on the low your favorite edible talk show right now what we got on the menu today though i should have made but you want to try on the menu that's the question yeah guys you need to you know we got a lot of stuff on the table you know feel free in the comments you know we do take recommendations you know we got to try them all you have to try them all we got to try them all so today coming from mexico oh [ __ ] in route through california awesome we got the la familia producto de los angeles cannabis infused chocolate what a mouthful [Music] yo so off rip nice packaging man nice professional packaging today we're reviewing a cannabis infused chocolate okay um i'm a little skeptical because it's a dark chocolate i'm not the biggest dark chocolate fan like i told you guys before but i'm hoping to try it out you know hopefully it changes my mind you know they have an opportunity today so 100 milligram deal all right 10 grams per piece it's an easy one low on the math that's about 10 grams per piece yo so let's um let's take a look at the packaging so you guys get a better look let's read the back yo there's a lot of information back there let's let's let them know we're lost chapter one dark chocolate mix chapter two ten servings one piece per serving i'm talking about 10 grams of these [ __ ] you got ingredients they got something in this ingredient that i've never seen before in the edibles and that is peppermint extract what the [ __ ] are we dealing with bro finish it off my mind is going to finish that off all right dark chocolate mint the serving size is one piece it's a 6.8 grams i guess that's the weight of the piece service size 10. uh this is 26 grams of fat zero sodium yo back at it again with the zero percent stats yo it makes no sense bro i'm watching your weight 22 grams of fat yo total cost five grams just forget you saw that um sugar 62 grams that should be sweet 62 grams that's a sweet dog chocolate for you yeah uh 10 grams per piece do the math because i'm not doing the pound on the sugar okay guys okay um yeah ingredients sugar peppermint extract abstract extract yo they got the palm kernel and palm oils i don't even know what that is bro processed with potassium carbonate damn well it's processed with that yeah it's it's pretty clean it's not like it went through a process bro it sounds like human directions [ __ ] [ __ ] got direction joe take one serving size 10 milligrams thc wait two hours jesus oh my god then it's fine i think i think it's a chocolate thing probably yeah maybe the chocolate takes a little longer it was a punchbox but it wasn't this one it was another punch bar and uh let me see yeah i mean yeah so this product can expose you to chemicals in the state of california to cause cancer that's a wild disclaimer it's a government warning so real professional product um one thing that it does have is it has the um the professional labeling where it tells you the type of cannabinoid uh the total amount of thc per serving these are all requirements and it's good to see expiration date is on here manufactured and a package date best buy so august and it's good for a year so that's a pretty good edible you know like you buy it and it's good for a year so that means that it's holding up and then you can speak a little on this one it's tested by think 20 labs i wanted to bring that up i wanted because i've seen that on there and it it's very intriguing because this is the first edible that i personally see not all edibles i've tried that actually was tested so basically um this company this company um think 20 labs it's a company based in la and what they do is try to keep the consistency between any cannabis product any cannabis related products like edibles marijuana rosin resin all that good stuff they basically test it and make sure it's consistent and it doesn't make you grow a third arm or something like that make you grow there yo so um you got batch id um serial numbers everything screams professional with la familia okay so for the first for the first mexican legit it's looking good it's looking good looking good and i love the colors on it too they really spent a lot of time in the packaging and they spent the money on getting it tested when so far in my books okay so and they got a little um fuel proof thing there yeah so as you can see this is the first time we've been trying this we haven't seen this we haven't seen this before um so sorry we messed this up oh hold on it's about to turn to a butterfly oh they grabbed me off with just the cover of the wrapping yeah i'll be inside the package yo if you mess up the servant size yo just give up bro just send it to us if you mess up the serving size they made sure they got it right what is that this is the scale i guess this is a chocolate bar and every 10 milligrams is the lungs this is a long slice so you think it's pre uh pre cut i hope so let's see we find those you know we're gonna check we're gonna check if it's easily breakable so and then they have a little message here as my mom always said growing up when you do something do it damn it's in spanish bro i'm gonna butcher this i i don't wanna i don't wanna disrespect la familia it seems like a very personal message about the brand and um it's just really shiny and with all these lights it's hard to read bro oh wow this looks like an invitation to get high look at it first invitation to get high right but but um you know i can appreciate that with the brand definitely you know be making it personal it's not your generic thing on the shelf you know i can appreciate that so damn let's open up this invitation wow wow it blew my mind it looks so good to do i don't eat the shirts killing packaging yo you guys can see the package in here right i don't even know what to pay for this packaging i don't even know what i paid for this yeah if i go up in one box you got another you know why is that fingerprinted you see it yo what's that about and the back too to turn it over it's on the back too damn is that like the certification i don't know really it looks good you think it's like do somebody touch this it's a grip it's a grip for the pack so now if you pinch here is it like when you're taking chocolate out yeah this is like a this is like a ziploc damn guys i must say we spent the past two minutes trying to figure out how to open this packaging here and they touch this [ __ ] wow crazy it's like it's like not respect to anybody but it's like they smuggle [ __ ] inside honestly i have some instructions on how to open the pack i feel good what's up bro we got a confession to make that [ __ ] was crazy you know i got a lot la familia was killing everything they was killing the packaging it was killing the labeling they was killing the little story inside you know the little invitation the wedding invitation they was killing all of that and then yo we got out the pack and yo we're gonna keep it all the real way real we ain't know how to open it bro it's not that we didn't know how to open it the cases were there no yo so sorry for the click bait but you on your own get some scissors that's how you open live 5 million yeah yo so um we got to get back to schedule programming [ __ ] yeah so uh let's about 10 minutes to figure out how to use how to open your [ __ ] and give up correct uh and uh so nothing to it let's get right to it get to it oh this one looks like if it matches up with this this is what the service size is like and let's see if it looks like it and it says la familia got yeah [ __ ] was hard to open bro oh you crazy that's a high on the low first you know but we're not afraid to admit and we didn't know how to open it you know what i mean we're not capping we're keeping it on it that's it wow look it looks like a kitkat yo a whole one you gotta break it in half nah this is 10 milligrams you can service eyes man you sure yeah bro you know the rules you the you the control the control familiar emilia it's hard and low a lot familiar yeah she's as big as hell i don't think i don't like that right oh but it's no knock to la familia i'm just personally not a dark chocolate fan i'm not a chocolate mint bin it is smooth and for a dark chocolate it's not extreme it's it's not bad i can get through it it's not judging me i gotta just check to see la familia milk chocolate or a white chocolate that's all it melts nice in your mouth that's a good chocolate rich chocolate the thing that bothers me though now that it tastes bad i don't taste the thc to be honest it just tastes like chocolate which is perfect you taste the peppermint though which i don't mind it helps me gives me another taste because you know the dark chocolate is just not for me but i don't knock it i definitely would recommend you know based on taste so far um how about you no it tastes good it melts within 30 seconds to a minute all right so packaging they got it on smash uh we figured out how to open it uh we need to get a la familia needs to start selling scissors but uh or use a little less glue correct or just put a little razor blade in the pack something man or just some instructions if you do anything just put instructions um because as a grown man it really bothered me that i couldn't open that back oh i got the thing to finally open up it'll open up from the bottom from the bottom so this is what was supposed to open and no no no hang yourself bro i know we're not the only one out there man i've seen some other youtubers out there struggling with this pack so i know we're not the only ones though and i ain't afraid to be the only one either i stand on that ledge so um let's take a deep breath to our wait time tomorrow's wait time guys two ten milligrams three pieces 30 grams total and we'll let's check back in with you guys and we'll check back with you guys in two hours [Music] no no i'm i'm when i'm breathing in it's going in my mouth [Laughter] [Music] we keep getting five new viewers a week you know we're gonna be under yeah we're gonna quit like in five years [Music] yo so la familia okay uh we're reviewing the dark chocolate bar cannabis infused 100 milligram deal how you feel i feel great bro how you feel pretty good yeah man uh really nice really nice everything about it was smooth it wasn't hard to digest now sometimes when we eat the chocolate edibles like i need a glass of water like to like help it go down this went down by itself you know i know you was drinking but i wasn't um i didn't i didn't have no assistance and it was fine camera guy's still sober so how does it what how does it really feel it's pretty good it's uh you got a lot of energy and then like it you know gets you high down yeah so packaging was fire you know what i'm saying they're waiting high on that um you know taste texture and low scale what you give it one or five it's technically even being a dark chocolate and i'm not a fan this is a five product for me but because i couldn't open it it lost a point like i lost the the excitement trying to figure it out and i know i'm not the only one because we youtubed it we couldn't even find it imagine you couldn't find it on youtube okay now i'm mad enough to say that right but i'm also happy enough with how it tasted to be like all right i'm gonna keep it up in the forest give it a four it's a five four four point seven it's a five for me four point five okay and please la for emilia in the comments of this post just say how to open it that's all we need that's all we need to so we wanna know the people want to know why you open it how the hell you open that [ __ ] bro it's a five but if you open it so on chase they should have put a warning five maybe or at least a zero percent fact can't open zero percent jesus i wanna love the can't open zero percent but they want to give us sodium how are you gonna review this so they can open it i don't know i can't open this zero like a it tastes like a godiva but in a cat form no i don't play lana amelia like that bro i'll do that bro this cannabis infused dark chocolate it's all right you taste no tac in it at all i will definitely know kind of nothing i will definitely try it all right guys love family [Music] okay good yeah yo you recommended for real yo honestly i do recommend this the pizzas come in great sizes the actual size of the pieces that's labeled on the get high invitation so i'm gonna call it and um it says that the high may take up to two hours it definitely did not take two hours it took more about an hour give it take yeah it was an hour mm-hmm but i'll give it a take um because i can't see you or use sign language in me bro let's say it took an hour on taste wise taste wise i give it a four and a half the only reason i give it a four and a half is because i didn't like the peppermint extract i don't i'm not a fan of peppermint but it tastes really good that's the only reason i give it a half what do you rate it on the on taste scale on the taste scale yeah on the low taste scale i mean for me personally the dark chocolate was nasty to me but like just not being biased or like you know taking it out of it like i would say for her for taste so if it tastes oh wow that's loads of mines usually i'm the critical reviewer here yeah um but remember i i don't like dark chocolate bro so okay yeah but this one seriously did not taste that dark it didn't taste that dark so let's move forward on the [Laughter] [Music] i thought about you okay yo you said moving on think about it this is good now i highly recommend taking this like with some friends yeah definitely i i don't know i don't know how interesting it would be by yourself maybe a movie what about you yeah definitely moving what kind of how are you feeling on this like uh up the uppity or laid back huh no i mean it's like mellow it's like it's in the middle mellow chill with your friend it's like it's like not chill though like chill is different like it's like i consider chill like yo it's not sugar or sugar high funny it's not sugar high five oh man that's definitely definitely funny you know one week later we could talk about sugar high yo that joint make you laugh for real um so la familia uh great product we're going to try your other stuff you know hit us up um share it you know so we can get the viewership because that's what it's about just educating the people um and just trying this stuff out you know we're enjoying what we do and and you know we're happy that y'all gonna try this stuff out have a good time y'all got you got a cotton ball i do yeah i do yeah well it's gonna want to follow us you got them all fine you're feeling like you you need a drink i'm talking i'm not even talking claire man it's a little tough you know we don't speak on that enough like it's not that we don't want to answer all the questions in the second half of the video it's just hard doing it high bro yeah we got cotton balls yeah we gonna you know what i'm saying you know they should watch the first part of the video yeah just watch the first part of the video for real like and the hardcore fans are just high right now chilling and just getting to laugh enjoy yeah i'm saying and for all you serious guys in the back half of the video lighten up you got me you think more people drink or more people smoke more people drink than smoke yeah you really think that yeah because you could go to the store everywhere and drink you can't go everywhere and smoke so you don't think like people i just think i just think it's about accessibility for people and they make weed a lot more accessible it's been very accessible now i'll tell you this we wouldn't high on the low how on the low would it hit a brick wall very very fast if we couldn't source different type of edibles to at least provide different content because let's not forget every week we come in with something different you know and yeah you know we'll circle back to certain brands but that's just showing love you know and uh we our friends don't even do anything for us right now so it doesn't even matter we're doing it off the strength because for us it's about the people getting the information you know what i'm saying definitely and then hopefully one day we can hook the people up simply put food hold up anyways guys moving forward oh [Music] you", "dQDOs3dX7xY": "[Music] welcome back to true buds reviews where we either love or hate it and today we [ __ ] love it damn right this bar is packed 180 milligrams they do have a six million bar as well but this one will get you truly live and what does it taste like tastes like heaven on a chocolate bar goodness said it better myself there's some higher talking experience and what is Cuba confections is a california-based not-for-profit collective we make only the highest quality medical edibles for patients crafted from all-natural ingredients and skillfully combined with cannabis lab testing every batch to ensure consistent THC potency we hope you enjoy our confections as much as we love making Kiva a higher chocolate experience as we look here at the Kiva bar 180 milligram bar is broken into 45 milligram increments so I like to take a triangle and that will get me feeling pretty good yeah does it have one of the highest THC potencies no edible that you're gonna find today yeah and this is just the [ __ ] [ __ ] yes is it gonna taste better than any chocolate bar you've ever had in the entire yeah now you listen here you listen good yep you comment down in the box below list no was good which ones that you [ __ ] with hate", "qqK060xvpIg": "[Music] hi there guys so good it's really good to see you welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you make sense of all those millions of seeming products at your dispensary all those bags with all those candies and gummies and cookies and cakes and whatever and drinks how do you know which ones to spend your hard-earned money on which ones did you avoid that's what weeds is here for that's what we're here for and today we're gonna let you know if it appears 100 milligram Rocky Widow is worth your money I don't believe it's going to be this little guy cost me ten dollars for one hundred milligram edible and I think I'm going to wish I spent my money elsewhere the rocky rope again is 100 milligrams from a tap here I've reviewed several that appears before found them to be lacking too severely lacking so I hope this one is just simply lacking and up here I found it to be bad on the really bad to be on the taste dimension for most of their products they taste they have that really astringent app weed aftertaste that it's really bitter and acidic kind of taste so I hope this would taste better because it's basically just a nerds rope I think it looks like the Nerds should hopefully mask the flavor of the gummy on the inside also I don't know I guess the gummy is the only part where the THC actually is and the Nerds on the outside don't have any or doesn't contain THC so you can see it here at standard-issue nerds rope up should they call it the rocky road so I'm going to eat the whole thing in front of you guys here I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know if this is actually worth your hard earned money um alright so without any further ado I'm gonna shut up stick this in my mouth hole here we go and there comes the weed taste and that comes stronger I was about to say oh it didn't taste so bad the Nerds are kind of like a cool cruel prank they mask the original flavor I go oh it's sweet and tasty and then you get into the jellied rope and then then comes that after flavor but it is not as bad as some of the other gummies that I've had like their standard gummy bears are way worse way worse tasting so this one for gummy is not bad I can totally get through this one all right you guys get the idea I think I lied when I said I was gonna eat the whole thing in front of you because it's gonna take longer I thought chewy but I won't finish it and I will come after you guys in two hours - what - no that this ed up your rocky rope and I'll finish this little nerves at the bottom - it's worth your money so thank you so much for watching weights guys we'll see you in two hours at pure I'm sorry just not what $10 I'm not high at all 100 milligrams of THC supposedly I have one more at appeared to review and I think that will be my last foray into and a pure in not there any worse than any other like your infused creations or voodoo sours I don't I don't think that they're necessarily and worse they might even be slightly better in terms of taste and consistency well I think voodoo tastes better but maybe in potency consistency in potency but who knows gummies just do not work for me why and and be though your mileage may vary you may gummies gummies may work for you animals manifest themselves weird ways and different people but they are not for me and I would not recommend them to anybody they don't taste good they don't get you high or they don't taste good to me they don't get me high and I just don't find anything pleasurable about them so I'll do my one last at a peer review that I've got and then I am going to say that we have reviewed enough and appear to know that ah that they are not for me and probably shouldn't be for you either okay guys that's gonna do it for this episode and this review here on wheats thank you so much for watching sorry to blast that appear so much here but again it's just done I can't help it it's you know if I'm not high I'm not high thank you so much for watching guys we'll check you out on the next review peace hello and thank you so much

be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "vOZQqYB52Lk": "[Music] what's up fun wolf and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show we help you make sense of your dispensary cocoa cocoa classic episode today and that means edible my favorite of all cannabis products we are taking a look at ed abou and I believe our second product may be third from Moon Moon Moon intergalactic milligram each intergalactic milligram each milligrams milligrams so this is a 100 milligrams of they're a rocket fudge sounds good I've had their spaceman mint bar before also 100 milligrams and I found it to be excellent so I'm coming up this one with some pretty high expectations we've got some pretty standard packaging but nice you know it's got everything you want to see on it including the lab testing results right there on the front from SC Labs which is great and then on the back you've got your nutrition information your ingredients and then right there whoops on that side mirrors are reversed it shows you your different ten milligrams serving size suggestions I think they're supposed to have discrete different little things but they don't but who cares and I picked this up from a brand new dispensary in Long Beach opened just yesterday called the lift and I picked it up for 20 bucks which is pretty expensive but not that expensive for a Long Beach okay oh wow and then look at this we've got even more packaging there on the inside with the childproof zipper thingy I think I figured out this one boy I have seen probably probably five that seems about right five different childproof mechanisms these modern child proofing packages I've seen and they're all different and they all are infuriating in their own little ways like this one I can see what I'm supposed to do but the mechanism isn't lining up right let's hope they get this [ __ ] ironed out soon because it sucks not to have that all right oh here we go here are the moon bars there are half of them there all right no there are six so there should be four remaining in here oops and there we go there the other four they say THC on them and this is the rocket fudge let's shut up and stick it in my mouth hall and of course guys I'm gonna be eating the whole thing not just the one ten milligram piece um that eat the whole hundred milligrams and then come back to you guys at the end of the review to let you know how all this is hitting so two hours later I'll come back to you guys mmm yuck as far as chocolate goes that's one of those cannabis tea tasting chocolates I've ever had um this chocolate doesn't mask the cannabis flavor really at all but that could be a great thing I've got my fingers crossed that that means this is potent as hell and they've got a lot of strong THC and vibed weed in there but if taste is important to you stick to your kiba's stick to your defenses cuz this does not taste good I'm actually surprised by how bad it tastes mmm well it does have me optimistic that this thing is gonna rock my world when when we come back so again taste ooh not so great especially for chocolate but it's all about that potency and so guys I'm gonna eat the last remaining six of these and then I'll come back to you guys two hours after I finish the last one to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching to this point and I'll see you guys very soon boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom moon moon moon moon moon if I want to get banned from it YouTube I'd show you my ass right now guys it's been about three hours since I actually had moon that's because I was feeling so nice and so relaxed and so high that I wanted to just keep on with that bus and three hours later I am still quite high this is another real win for moon it tastes bad it's one of the worst tasting chocolates I've ever had but but but it is only a hundred grams or sorry grams calories which is so much better than like the Korova mini cookies I know I just had like the Pete's mini cookies and they had 700 calories you had to eat a [ __ ] it tastes really bad to be honest but you have to only eat so little that little chocolate bars only like that big you know that wide so you just you know you can eat it in three bites and be done with it it's not gonna be pleasant but you are gonna get really stoned and you're not gonna have to eat a whole lot if you want to just grab something to split between three buddies pop it in your mouth man this will get three pretty people probably pretty feeling pretty high before like a show movie whatever moon has been surprisingly man for a smaller edible company or seemingly smaller I don't see them a lot of places I have really enjoyed my time with them this is a big big thumbs up for me guys so if you see moon in their rocket fudge or I think I reviewed their spaceman mint before go for it man they're great and guys right before I balance here I'm going to share with you something that is weed related as a cherry on top I knew I normally try to share something without you or share something with you that is not weed related but I want to go ahead and share with you something that you can definitely use I've had this bad way for a year now although it's oddly gross on the top this grinder is amazing Black Tie grinders used it every time I have flour don't really have to clean it very often it's just a very very sharp very very handy grinder I think it cost me 20 something dollars on Amazon you know upgraded from like the two dollar pieces of plastic [ __ ] to something really nice and the Black Tie grinders is quite as as nice as their logo implies so that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review both great products wholeheartedly endorse both thank you so much for watching to the end you big jerks and by jerks I mean Best Buddies thanks again and we will see you guys on the next review doses", "BzQ9i6EeCZQ": "all right so boom this is the official Twain 20 guy on how to safely consume weed edibles or any year for that matter because this is time that's advice you know I'm saying so I find that consuming edibles I eating it it's a lot more natural and has a less health risks than smoking anything you smoke and inhale into your lungs as the potential to affect your breathing cars in such as bronchitis and just overall get lungs see lungs other basic necessity of life right but at the point to note that not all edibles are created equal and being knowledgeable of the dosage level that you take is crucial in order for you to actually enjoy and have a good experience rather than be one of those people on YouTube that gives a story time about their worst experience of marijuana [Music] three hours later welcome back to no song edutainment yall already know what's going on subscribe to channel cuz I'm a fun guy I'm a cool guy I go through my day pretty normal like I'm a normal guy I'm a swell guy I'm a nice enough guy I'm a cool kind of guy I'm a pretty groovy guy I call this honest entertain you make you laugh but most importantly educate you on a variety of subjects that make you learn something they can apply it to your own personal personal life so mister my research the general consensus I see for a serving one serving of an edible is about 10 milligrams but not all will be dispensaries created equal like I said before some of them serve a bit more some of them aren't as precise and having each in each serving wrap individually so depending on where you get it from one serving we have a bit more THC than you might expect usually if it does have more THC than the 10 milligrams like limit it should have this image or however you wherever you see this image on the box right there but in the meantime products with too much THC must have these warning labels so I've told you why edibles are better than smoking or vaping me but how and what do you do to actually enjoy it safe so I got about five different steps for you to follow if you listen to me if you listen to me just listen to me you will enjoy your edible experience simple because I know it all I just played so most places require or from what I've seen research most states and my keys most provinces in Canada require a limit of ten milligrams of THC in a serving of edible but my suggestion Prasad is to tone it down a bit more and actually do five milligrams as your basic reduction to an edible cookie gummy bears or whatever so number one is important to read the packaging carefully so that you don't overdose or not overdose you can't really overdose on wheat but you can definitely take too much this easy there go anybody take a tab hallucinate you finished our trip the trip but chill out I got a heartbeat I can't feel [ __ ] so no longer do you have to play Russian roulette with your dosage amounts there's now a legal dosage of ten milligrams as your basic level of attaboy experience but if it isn't made at home then in that case be extra careful with how much you're taking in a given set or given serving size so especially if you're new to cannabis or you don't take it regularly it's important to dip your toe in the water a little bit before you dive in headfirst rather than taking the recommended ten milligrams take instead to five milligrams and then wait another two to three hours before you take another serving size just so that you are easing yourself into the whole edible experience and you can actually enjoy the high rather than you know some of the other stories I've seen on YouTube and even if you are a veteran cannabis user you should also implement my foot dosing which is start with five milligrams or even you start with the ten milligrams wait two or three hours and then add another one why should you do this because it gently stimulates the body's cannon but receptors which results in an increased high or increased mood productivity creativity without the sudden high effect that you might get if you were to just like consumer all I was in fact Oh Oh cookies very important to me I mean I love to me but they mean much more to me Tommy so the high is a bit more noticeable noticeable and more enjoyable like is you're kind of like on a roller coaster type of thing rather than already being at the top right so you're gently taking yourself to that peak or a high rather than just as soon as you get to the rides everyday at the top which is not ideal so again five milligrams as your basic level especially if you're a beginner and then every two or three hours just gradually take another serving size just so that you can safely and enjoyably each edible our number two is important to consider your tolerance having a low THC tolerance makes you susceptible to negative side effects of taking too much weed or taking too much THC such as paranoia anxiety and dizziness definitely without a doubt it's better to have an underwhelming experience than an overwhelming experience where you are shaking your you panicking whatever it is it's better to be disappointed than to be on the other spectrum if I'm gonna say okay do what you want you an adult but take heed take heed all right one word is good enough for the wise so he was so it's your first time trying a screen or not well since you interacted with marijuana in general don't try and keep up with the veteran smoker so don't try keep up with the rest of the crew just go at your own pace because there's it's not a race I see alright I got this off like that got the sauce little ketchup those sauce little ketchup thank you keep up with them because people that consume meet regularly already need a higher dosage to get their desired high effect and this is why I say it's important to take weed tolerance breaks the tolerance breaks for weed are important because it allows you to get higher for a longer period of time so your high or not it won't be like twenty minutes it'd be like two plus hours or so and you can get high on a small amount of weed which results in savings yeah I put it all together see it and trying to save y'all money I'm looking out for you looking out for your pockets so take means haulin sprigs periodically so that you can continue to not need a higher dosage and that your high can also last for a longer period of time simple so number three it just be patient like I said be patient with the THC and how it how long it takes to affect you depending on your metabolism and your body fat it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two or maybe even a few hours so these snacks are not like your regular snacks at the grocery store or the corniche story these aren't regular snacks that you can - to eat as you're watching a Netflix videos or Netflix shows or movies whatever it is take heed to the serving size and be patient for 330 minutes any for 30 minutes to two hours if you feel the pips this is the moment you feel the effect is when you can like perhaps take another one but even at that let it right out for a bit on number four you want to be mindful of your stomach's contents so the more food you have in your system the longer it will take for weed to get metabolized in your bloodstream and take effect however in empty stomach I lost with the edibles to activate Kruger so just keep it just keep that in mind when and if you are eating edible did you eat already because if you didn't it'll take effect quicker and if you haven't eaten already before it then start with half a dose or what you usually take or what you want to take just so that you know just you can slow yourself in micro dosing same as the same thing micro dosing is the wave don't just jump in and if you drank alcohol beforehand alcohol can increase the THC blood concentration in your system so it's important to use caution if you're mixing alcohol with edibles and number five just this is more of like the nurture you know they say nature is the nature this is more of an immature type of thing it just be mindful of the environment like are you around people that you or as you care about you want people that care about you right and are you comfortable around these people so if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or long much more it's better take it at your home with your loved one or parent or francica with it your brother sibling romantic partner whatever it is just be around if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or just in general you are taking a new strain it's best to be around people that you actually are familiar with and you actually care about just to that part of for you to experience some type of anxiety or panic attack or just seeing a familiar face will keep you a bit more grounded if you did end up eating so much but again the more experience you have the more likely you are to be comfortable the easier it is for you to be comfortable in different situations or different environments but yeah so my kudos take it easy five milligrams or as your basis for anything for the most part and then just gradually increase your high once you start feeling the effects and its best it's always better to have an underwhelming experience then an overwhelming experience londo and take these five steps into consideration you will have a very enjoyable read hi and again have other videos above or edibles from marijuana lay the topics in the description pink ominous video and we showed with an addiction to read if you like

kill the monster they call it the girl apps more please want to commend you thank you not this one", "H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "3XrKXtWPQW4": "you guys they turned out amazing look how beautiful they are mmmmmm like smooth it's so much just like melting your novel it's amazing hey guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you how to replicate and infuse my favorite chocolate bar from Purdy's I don't know if there's a party's in the States but in Canada we have lots of them and they have really good chocolate and they make this amazing chocolate bar that's white chocolate with sprinkles and pop rocks and is so good it is like the best ever only difference is that ours is going to be infused with coconut oil here's what you're going to need white chocolate sprinkles pop rocks and the most important ingredient coconut oil so this is the mold I'm gonna use for my chocolate bars and I'm not sure how much chocolate I'm going to need to melt so I'm just gonna have put my little chocolate wafers in here to kind of like visualize approximately how many I'll need so I think that looks about good I might need a little bit more a little bit less so we'll find out but I just don't want to melt too many if I don't need to since this is the only mold I have for a little chocolate cute little chocolate bars so I'm just gonna put the chocolate into my Pyrex measuring cup but a bowl or anything is fine I'm just shooting to use the pirate so that I can pour it out after so I'm gonna put this in the microwave for about 45 seconds so 45 seconds is third melting a bit ruin and stir it we don't want to over melt the chocolate or it will get like chunky so you just have to melt it slowly and then stir it melt a little bit more so I'm gonna put it back in for 20 seconds that was 20 more seconds and it is perfectly melted now and then we're going to add in two tablespoons of our coconut oil so my coconut oil is just that partly room-temperature partly melted it would be best if I had this sitting on the thread shows fully melted that way I could put it into the the chocolate a little bit easier and measure it out but I just scooped it I was fine too now I shouldn't have to microwave this again because the heat from the chocolate should melt the quill but I might not do it we'll find out just keep stirring it a bit to just warm it up and melt it so I think it keeps me melted a little bit more so I'm gonna put it back in the microwave for like ten seconds and I do want to make some of my chocolate bars Oreo so I'm gonna have like a mix so I'm just gonna bring up some Oreos and add them to some of the moulds okay there is our ten seconds and you can still see little coconut chunks but I'm just kind of stirring them in and pressing my spoon against them to melt them there's still a little bit of Trump so I'm just let this sit here and melt a bit more while I put my Oreos into my bowls just gonna break them up and put them right into the mold I think that I don't know like should I do them with Oreos and sprinkles like these ones over here all gonna be the sprinkle and pop rock ones but these two I want to be Oreo but it just like should I also have sprinkles I don't know okay we'll save that to add on top okay so that those little chunks have melted a bit you can mix that in and I feel like we're probably gonna need a little more chocolate like that doesn't look like enough for all these but before I add in my sprinkles and my pop rocks I'm just gonna fill up the Oreo ones now maybe a little bit more Oreo on top I'll crush these ones a little bit finer those look good it's like cookies and cream I wish I would have crush the other ones this small kind of looks a little bit better mmm it smells like cookies and cream okay now for the other ones that I'm gonna do top rocks and sprinkles I could mix it directly in here and then pour it in but I kind of want to pour it in and then add it so we'll see how this goes I think I'm gonna have to make more anyway and obviously you can use any fillings you want like you could add any sort of like cookies you could add mint flavoring you could do like marshmallows oh you can do anything you want okay I do need a melt a little more this will just be like a mini one maybe just like those like Hershey bars you get a Halloween okay now I'm gonna add the pop rocks cotton candy how good is that gonna be with this is anybody else is just like love cotton candy flavored things like what do you have flavor is cotton candy I just feel like it's sweet flavor okay it's open these up let's see what color they are okay so they're pink I would have liked it they weren't pink to be honest because like I really want to see them but they might blend damn with the sprinkles so we should probably be fine today I'm just gonna kind of like mix them in like how much do we want it there you'll see a man sprinkles now sprinkles are the best part I like lots of Franco I like the crunch of them in there and we're just gonna mix them in again my god this looks so good so I filled up my molds with chocolate and put my toppings in them and then I'm just gonna put them in the fridge for like I don't know 20 minutes 30 minutes we'll find out how long it takes alright guys they've been in the fridge for about half an hour and they are ready to come out so we're just going to pop them on out of their molds but we're gonna do it gently so we don't break the chocolate while it's coming up guys they turned out amazing look how beautiful they are okay the best part tasting them ah mm-hmm-hmm oh we have the extra sprinkles hmm yes oh these are so good they're almost better than the one from Perry which is weird cause like I use pretty cheap chocolate but I'm thinking the coconut oil being added like smooth it so much just like melt in your mouth is amazing thank you guys so much for watching please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe and I hope you have a wonderful day [Music]", "mdRGicxzPIw": "all right so this isn't something i'd normally buy but i picked up a uh chocolate bar from true leave and uh it's you know uh it's only 100 milligrams so i'll end up eating a whole bar i'll probably do 150 at a time of my uh rso but uh i figured i'd just go ahead and open it up and see we'll see what i get here hmm doesn't seem to want to come out let's try the other end okay it comes taped oh i see there's little child proof tabs [Music] thc well they really don't want you to get into these so 10 squares 10 milligrams each let me go ahead and try a sample here hmm okay that's a decent dark chocolate oh yeah slightly fruity like a lot of darks are well uh i'll eat at least half the rest of the bar and i'll put something in the description thanks a lot", "6J9aM0Gh0iE": "[Music] and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's old-school today guys cuz we are taking a look at an edible just like good times good times I mean old times but the old times aren't necessarily good times anymore because here in California we are fully in the new recreational world which includes this ridiculous hundred milligram cap on edibles not just that but makes absolutely crazy packaging requirements for all edibles here in California so what edible are we talking about that is ridiculous today what we are gonna take our first look at Plus gummies that's right another gummy review I normally tell you to avoid the gummies but I have heard a lot of good things about Plus and I am a little curious I'm always hoping to find another gummy I like cushy punch or flourish or Tiki killers that's actually worth something so I'm definitely looking forward to reviewing these plus gummies first thing you're gonna notice is how crazy this packaging is so here it is here is our plus gummies I believe they are sour blueberry blue in case you don't know is objectively the best flavor of everything if there is a multitude of colors and blue is available always go with blue because blue is much like a like a law of thermodynamics or whatever the case may be blue is always the best fruit flavor even though I don't know of any naturally-occurring blue fruits other than blueberries and blue tasting foods are hardly ever blueberries usually blue raspberry or something it's always the best trust me on this though so we have a sealed bag with you know all these insane requirements on it batch number this that and the other I mean it's great because it has all of those wonderful serving sizes and ingredients and all the testing results all this stuff you know I like seeing but it's a bag and then a fancy 10 on the inside I think all edibles now have to be bagged in addition to whatever kind of thing holds the edibles they have to have these sealed maggots it's insane it just boosts up the cost because this uh 100 milligram 20 piece edibles so I believe it's 20 gummies each worth 5 milligrams of THC cost me 20 bucks at my dispensary which is outrageous of course but that is the world we now live in and we shall review it as if it's the world we want to live in who knows I don't know what I'm saying I know I'm sad I'm disappointed that the edible world has changed so much and so for such and in such a shitty direction over the past year but let's stop the bitching and get straight to the review of the plus gummies cannabis infused sour blue berry so we're gonna open up the first layer of the packaging here it looks like it's got a little tear thing nice Oh and then then we got our second layer the zip sealed bag on side of the tear bag and then we gotta figure out how to open this the childproofing I think you ground push down and that breaks the seal yes there we go so second layer of security through now we're finally to our chin on the inside and to the gummies in here ah so here are our blue raspberry or blueberry gummies whatever they call it blue flavored the best 20 gummies in there give it a smell oh definitely a cannabis e odor which is not a bad thing I I'd like to know that there's some cannabis in these but also a hefty flavor and aroma of blue but certainly in a cannabis aroma there as you can see just a bunch of little squares dropped one there and let's pluck it into our mouths but before we do in case this is your first week to review the way they work when we do edibles we reviewed the whole experience I'm gonna eat all 20 of these gummies and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because it's you want to know how have it tasted like [ __ ] but you what you really want is it gonna get you [ __ ] up it's gonna get you high are you gonna get what you paid for it and that guy's is what you need to stick around for but first the taste test so here we go first cube in the mouth um very spongy gummies very very spongy almost hard to bite into because they're so Airy um a surprising cannabis taste them it's not awful but there is a 4 what is 5 milligrams of THC in these cubes definitely a cannabis taste to it but the blue the blue sciency flavor counter sex but if you don't like cannabis taste maybe you don't stick with these because you're gonna taste it again not terrible not overwhelming but it is surprisingly noticeable for what is just 5 milligrams of THC so guys I'm gonna eat me about what 16 more of these and I said I'm gonna eat me which is very back woodsy and folksy way of saying I'm gonna eat the rest of these so guys I'll see you in about two hours I'm gonna scarf these down and I'll let you know then if they're worth your money or not so thanks for staying tuned this far sticking around this far sorry guys this is really my second video back here on weeds and this will probably be another video between season 3 and between season 2 and season 3 so forgive my rustiness see you guys in two hours thanks for sticking around 2 hours since I have had the plus cannabis infused gummies looking at the camera for the first time now since coming back the fuse but I also see now I'm saying the word let's just start over one more time BAM I'm back guys it has been 2 hours since I had the plus cannabis infused gummies and I think there was an even yeah it says create on there as well there are a lot of nouns and adjectives and verbs on that packaging I'm really not even sure what it's called I'm just gonna call it plus gummies plus gummies uh guys I am genuinely pretty impressed uh for a gummy and for a hundred milligram edible this brought the heat um I'm not outrageously high but I am at like maybe a 6 somewhere in that range which is way higher than I expected it to be after a hundred milligrams and especially after a gummy I am pretty pleased with this now that is in the relative scale compared to you know this new world of edibles because this is a very expensive product you don't get a lot for your money here compared to the old world but in this new world this is a pretty good little solution um I found myself not maybe quite as high as if they were like akarova or a Kanaka mini cookie situation but for a gummy and for how much less you have to eat then which is very important to me you have to eat a [ __ ] ton of those cookies from like all you know Pete's and Korova and Kanaka all those ones you just mentioned you have to eat like 20 of those you know many cookies to get the hundred milligrams the gummies here were a hell of a lot more manageable that 10 was no problem to eat by myself I didn't didn't feel like a gluttonous badass after consuming that whole thing at all so really really pleased with that aspect um have a cannabis taste for sure but not awful um I didn't feel like retching after eating that not even close there was a cannabis taste but it was not the primary taste and again didn't have that just incredibly bitter kind of almost you know a cynic that Pacific we've tasted no no just the taste is there but then again for as potent as these came you know turned out to be you would expect that so guys this is a a nice win I think I'm I'm pretty impressed with Plus cannabis infused gummies and then also that were to create for some reason on there as well so I'm really happy with this I think I'll be reviewing some more stuff from plus in the future and if you see these in a dispensary near you and you guys want to eat all of something to get the hundred milligrams Jesus it's it's almost easier to recommend this then which is hard to say which is hard to believe actually then like the Kanak o or the kirova because it's just such it's so much easier to do and they're they're sort of equivalently priced you don't get quite as high but it's it's it's easier to it's easier to manage for sure so really surprised me on this one guys and what the [ __ ] let's just shoot the moon here guys I'm gonna throw a cherry on top - my little cherries on top here just little things I like to add that aren't necessarily we related something you can just do to enjoy throughout your week and I'm just gonna throw this one out because I am having an ever-loving blast playing spider-man on the ps4 from insomniac holy [ __ ] guys it's so great to see insomniac get this win I assume this game it's going to be an amazingly huge hit it seems to be it's only a couple days since it's been out but reception seems to be great and it seems to be doing really well sales wise I'm so happy for insomniac I love these guys since the ps1 days back in like Spyro loved them on the ps2 days Ratchet and Clank so my favorite you know 3d action platformers ever even love the resistance franchises back on the ps3 days and then they have been one of the greatest VR developers as well and I'm a big big fan of VR so you know what [ __ ] it I'm going to this endorsement is not for spider-man which is an awesome game I am having an utter blast with it it doesn't rewrite the rules anyway it's it's not a you know changing the genre it's just a hell of a good video game you know it's not rewriting anything but it's it's wonderful I'm having a blast with it but instead this cherry on top is just for insomniac in general they make great great games they've been making great great games for like 20 years I love them as a studio I'm so happy to see them having this huge success with spider-man so insomniac you'll never see this video but great job guys really proud of you and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review what a great time we had great gummies that were so good here's an extra piece of packaging we had [ __ ] spider-man and insomniac on our cherry on top woohoo this guy's has been a [ __ ] good review let's just acknowledge the fact that everything went aces this time which doesn't often happen

my eyes were this low it's at six o'clock now and so it's been an hour since i took them but i'm gonna just keep updating you guys more and more and see what's up with it um i'll pick it up like around 7 30 or i just feel like [ __ ] laughing now dude but we were just in a in target for a long ass time but yeah we'll pick it up later alright guys it's currently seven o'clock and it's a cool high it's a cool like edibles don't i never really had any smack but the ones i [ __ ] tried before and this is another one i'll add it to my [ __ ] list i'll give this one a [ __ ] 9.5 just because i [ __ ] with the high it's like a cool ass chill ass high you know it's not like that [ __ ] smack smack that i was [ __ ] thinking or expecting but it's like a cool last [ __ ] high you know i got the giggles out of it i got the laughs out of it um but yeah now we're just in the [ __ ] chill eat some pizza watch some tv and just [ __ ] chill i'll see what happens at eight um and yeah i'll just

think i last picked up the camera like that seven or eight i think i don't know when was the last time i talked on camera but it's currently 10 41 man and i just did like a fat ass nap um i think i rated the [ __ ] edibles and eight just because i don't like chocolate but the [ __ ] were fired and i sure was a dope ass high i should smack man that should be this bad um [Music] in the beginning it's like a cool ass like brush you know you get to laugh you get the giggles you're just chilling you're vibing and then once you just like start settling down you just relax dude you know you just calm down you just i think a fat ass nap dude i just [ __ ] knocked out feel good now i feel relaxed i'm calm chilling um but that edible was [ __ ] fire not even a lot i should really did smack all right guys it is currently the next day and i just wanted to pick up the camera i was just showing you editing the video and i wanted to give you guys a little bit more i wanted to give you guys a little bit more insight on to how much the [ __ ] wonka bar is smacked now that i'm sober and clear now that i can talk to you guys right and [ __ ] clear minded but yesterday i did not smoke all i had weed wise was that wonka bar and i was [ __ ] vibing and satisfied that wonka bar satisfied me throughout the whole day i did not want to smoke nor did i need a smoke i was just gone the whole day um so just to give you guys a little run down throughout the day i took the [ __ ] edibles at five o'clock and after taking the edibles we went to the store and that was like an hour and 30 minutes in and by then i was already feeling something um but it wasn't like an uncomfortable feeling i was i was vibing i was laughing it up i was just laughing it up chopping it up honestly like i just was laughing at nothing and felt like laughing at nothing um and three hours into the edible that's when i was really really feeling it in my head and i was just like [ __ ] i'm so blown and you guys seen my face at 10 41 when i picked up the camera on the last clip i was ready for bed i was so gone um i was just so blown i was ready to knock the [ __ ] out and literally that's what i did after that after picking up the camera and i hadn't slept that comfortable in it in a minute let me just tell you that edible had me out like a [ __ ] light um but i slept like a baby last night and i don't know if this is just me but me personally i don't realize how high i actually was until the next morning i obviously recognized that i'm high in the moment but the next morning i woke like this morning there was this morning this morning i woke up and i was just [ __ ] gone dude i felt so groggy and lagged um but it was nothing bad you know um i love being relaxed me personally i'm a relaxed person so it was just a good feeling for me you know i was just calm i took a fire ass shower and i was just now i'm just vibing dude um but yeah i know i gave the edible a 9.5 but that's just used to give an understanding of how [ __ ] dink it is but that was just my opinion go try it out for yourself or if you guys have tried it out already let me know down below um but literally i was satisfied with that [ __ ] wonka bar throughout the day and i hadn't had any [ __ ] edibles smack that [ __ ] hard you know that's gonna the wonka bar is on top of my list and then it's the um stoner patch edibles

Denver Colorado today is going to be another review day today we're going to be reviewing medically correct blueberry bliss white chocolate bar it's our newest product from their Incredibles line of treats and I picked up this from the giving tree' dispensary here in Colorado package looks like this nice foil package let's try to get it in there they're left and right hundred milligrams of THC in a 45 gram white chocolate bar some viewers remain remember I reviewed the mile-high mint chocolate bar by this company and it contained 175 milligrams for ten dollars and this contains 100 milligrams I think it was for nine dollars so it definitely doesn't have as much bang for the buck on paper that the other one did so but on a good plus side I'm anticipating that this should taste much better because or taste better because it has a lower concentration my dose right now you know as I've been taking is around 25 milligrams so I'm thinking one quarter of this should do the trick again and I said it's a nice foil package and I have to say medically correct this company has the best professional packaging of any of the and Colorado edible manufacturers that I've come across so far the packaging clear labeling of the expiration date lot number and ingredients and the ingredients are white chocolate medical marijuana rice krispies blueberries contains milk processed and a facility that processes nuts a little boring there for anybody with nut salad nut allergies so now let's crack open this bad boy and give it a try use a little tear off here on the end just like the mile-high mint chocolate bar so make that out well that's not very attractive blue I mean truly blue that many blue foods in this world but um kind of looks like play-doh or something like that but I like the fact that it's segmented into nice cloth segments so you can determine titrate your death so I'm going to take three of these off blue really so just break off three here let's pop one of these in my mouth and see how it tastes Wow that is a tasty chocolate bar I barely taste anything this is amazing that is the best tasting edible I've had so far absolutely just a tiny bit of aftertaste but I mean that that tastes like a candy bar apart from the Smurf motif it's actually a really tasty to treat all right I'm just gonna take 20 milligrams right now and see how that does for me one thing I just wanted to show here after I put it back in the refrigerator looks like I've been playing with crayons or chalk nice and blue and your fingers instead of like orange fingers from Cheetos and get hello its next day I'd like to apologize for the rough transition just back then the audio started flaking out at the end of yesterday's recording and I had to clip out the good stuff and remove the inaudible stuff alright let's move on to the review I'm gonna go back and review taste of the blueberry bliss bar as I said this is the best tasting product had so far I could have eaten the entire arm chocolate bar for enjoyment although I would have been pasted to the ceiling if I had done so there was only a hint of aftertaste as I said before you know it was barely noticeable the only complaint I could give about this product is its appearance I mean the ingredient the ingredient list says there are blueberries in there but I'm I'm not blueberry extract or genuine imitation processed blueberry spread type stuff so I'm assuming based on that list that this was actual just like a blueberry puree that they just mixed in with the chocolate giving that disturbing aqua Smurf vibe I was expecting a white chocolate bar with chunks and blueberry in it you know kind of like you know cookies and cream type buy but I think maybe they could have gone with that to make it a little more palatable on the looks side but taste is words count and I'm gonna have to give it a 10 for taste I mean it was actually tasted like a nice chocolate white chocolate bar moving on to pain relief this is where it falls a bit short for me this seems to be a THC only product so I primarily experienced head effects and very little if any body effects at all and that's really what I'm looking for for the most part because those seem to help my back and my leg pain much more than anything else it's not necessarily a bad thing though because it does the THC the head-high does help distract from the pain but it actually doesn't suppress it in any way for me I'd also like to mention you know I'd give them kudos for segmenting the product into easily you know the little segments so you can easily determine your dose you don't have to break it off and estimate maybe I'm taking 1/3 maybe I'm taking quarter I think all edibles should consider doing this if their axe the actual product they sell isn't one serving size so in summary for pain relief I'm gonna have to give it a seven for pain relief and that was only because it could provide some distraction from the pain you know making the hamster wheel go faster in the brain with the THC so again pain relief has a rating of seven moving on to the third point of my rating scale is side effects and this since this was a head effect type medication THC I have to say it was a very manageable high I felt in control at all times and went for a long walk last night and felt just fine I had a bit of trouble falling asleep and that's going to hit me a little bit because by the time about five hours after I took I tried to go to bed and I was just too wired I guess is the word you'd use to go to sleep so it gave me a little bit of insomnia which I didn't like but in the morning I woke up and I felt clear-headed and rested so overall I'm going to give this a rating of eight for arms side effects and again written review eight the higher the number is better lower side effects so for everything the higher the number is better and the forth point of my um rating scale is value and I do this through the milligrams per dollar ratio and early interview I said I paid nine dollars for a hundred milligram bar that translates to eleven milligrams per dollar that's rounded down eleven point three actually and I took three of the twelve pieces pieces overall you only saw him eating two on the video but I took one about an hour later and that was 25% of the bar so I just say it this clear way it seems to be for me and people with um low tolerance ER for four doses in the bar so for nine dollars there are a lot better deals out there so I'm gonna have to give this a rating of seven out of ten forum value but I'd have to say if you were to get this on a buy one get one type deal you would jump on it because it is a good product especially if you're looking at something to relieve PTSD or some sort of depression issue think so we've got our four ratings in summer we have 10 for taste 7 for pain relief 8 for side-effects and 7 for value giving an overall ganja geezer rating of 8 all right

description below alright until next time goodbye and stay", "PRQH7tUKs-E": "America loves its candy bars, and some of\nthe most popular candy bars date back more than 100 years. But which ones are the best, and which ones\nleave the most to be desired? Here are the rankings from yuckiest to yummiest. Butterfingers are definitely unique. And like so many unique things, people either\nlove them or hate them. There's really no in-between. The Butterfinger is likely so divisive because\nof the texture of the candy layers. If you're expecting a deliciously creamy peanut\nbutter experience, this definitely isn't it. As the old Bart Simpson commercials advertised,\nButterfingers are \"crispity\" and \"crunchity,\" not smooth and creamy. \"Crispity, crunchity Butterfinger from Nestle.\" \"Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger.\" So where does the unusual brittleness in the\ninside of a Butterfinger come from? Corn flakes. To make a Butterfinger, corn flakes are added\nto peanut butter, and then a separate sweet, crystallized molasses concoction is created. These two mixtures are folded together and\nformed into the bar, which is then enrobed in chocolate. Many people hate the result, but you never\nknow until you try one. Even the worst candy bar is someone's favorite. If you love coconut, Almond Joy or Mounds\nshould be your go-to candy bar. Almond Joy has sweetened, shredded coconut\nand whole almonds smothered in a milk chocolate coating. The main downfall is the chocolate itself. It's grainy and bland rather than smooth and\nsweet. But if you are a big coconut fan, you aren't\nmunching on Almond Joy for the chocolate anyway. You just want to get your coconut fix. Over the years, Hershey's has produced limited-edition\nvarieties of Almond Joy, including white chocolate key lime and pi\u00f1a colada flavored versions. Most of these variations have flopped, and\nthe company has thankfully stuck to the original for the last decade or so. If you prefer dark chocolate, grab a Mounds\nbar instead. It has the same coconut center, but with a\ndark chocolate coating, and no almonds. If coconut's not your thing? Skip them both. Both these bars are made by the Hershey Company\nand are chocolate-covered toffee bars. So what's the difference between them? They are ever-so-slightly different. In the Heath, the toffee is a lighter color\nand the almonds in the toffee are visible. The almond taste is the overriding flavor. In the slightly thinner Skor, the toffee flavor\nis rich and buttery rather than almondy. And the Skor bar does seem to get stuck in\nyour teeth a bit more than the Heath does. If you're a toffee fan, try them both. The subtle differences in the toffee will\nlikely determine your favorite. If you're not into toffee, which can be an\nacquired taste? You'll probably hate them both. With its bright yellow wrapper and big red\nlogo, you can't miss Hershey's Mr. Goodbar on the shelf. But this candy bar is mediocre at best. During the Great Depression, Mr. Goodbar sold\nfor just a couple cents each and was marketed as a \"tasty lunch\" because of the nutrition\nof the added peanuts. But it's been almost 100 years since then,\nand the bar has barely changed with the times. Peanuts and chocolate are typically an awesome\ncombination, but Mr. Goodbar doesn't really live up to its name. It's just milk chocolate combined with a bunch\nof Spanish peanuts, and though it's not horrible, it's not impressive either. There are just a few too many peanuts and\nthe chocolate isn't as rich and creamy as it should be. Unless it's one of the last candy bars on\nthe rack, you can almost always find something better to satisfy your sweet tooth. PayDay candy bars were created in 1932 by\nthe F.A. Martoccio Macaroni Company. Production of these peanut caramel bars has\npassed between multiple companies since, and they're currently part of the Hershey family. There's no doubt that if you love peanuts,\nyou'll love this bar. \"It's more than candy! It's a PayDay bar.\" \"Are those peanuts?\" \"Yes!\" A PayDay is simple: It's a log of firm caramel\nrolled in salted peanuts. The saltiness of the peanuts and the sweetness\nof the caramel makes for a happy marriage. But don't ever put it in the refrigerator,\nthe caramel center will become impossible to chew. The big sticking point for a lot of folks\nis that there's not any chocolate at all in a PayDay, though there was a now-discontinued\nchocolate-covered version many years ago. If you like the composition of the PayDay\nbut want chocolate too, then get yourself an Oh Henry! bar. The iconic Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar isn't\nlacking in popularity: More than 264 million of these bars are sold every year. But if you've ever tasted high-quality chocolate,\nyou'll know its popularity isn't necessarily because of the quality. Hershey's chocolate just isn't really that\ngood. It's not very creamy and even a bit waxy. But it's affordable, easy to find and, maybe\nmost importantly, everyone's heard of it. For s'mores over the campfire, Hershey's will\ndo just fine. But for melt-in-your-mouth lusciousness, this\nis definitely not it. And you don't need to spend a small fortune\non European chocolate to eat something better than Hershey's. Other brands of milk chocolate, including\nDove and Godiva, are better. So, if you have a choice, buy one of those. The 3 Musketeers bar is simple: a whipped\nnougat center covered in a coating of milk chocolate. That's it. Just nougat and chocolate. And while some candy bars feature very dense\nnougat, the 3 Musketeers nougat center is soft, light, fluffy, and delicious. But because these candy bars are so light\nand fluffy, one bar can feel a little unsatisfying. Are you wondering why it's called 3 Musketeers? When this bar was first manufactured in 1932,\neach package contained three small bars with chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry flavors. But during World War II, cost-cutting measures\nforced the elimination of the strawberry and vanilla pieces. Mars has produced other varieties of 3 Musketeers\nover the years, but the originals never came back. Hershey's Cookies 'n' Creme bars are the same\nsize and shape as its iconic milk chocolate bars. But these bars are white and contain little\npieces of Oreo-like chocolate cookies. Hershey's replaced cocoa butter with a mixture\nof oils to create these candy bars, so it's not even really white chocolate. Even so, if you're looking for something other\nthan milk or dark chocolate, these bars are a pretty tasty option that you can find at\nmost stores. If you like the white portion of the Hershey's\nCookies 'n' Creme but crave a little more crunch, you'll also like their White Creme\nwith Almonds bar introduced in 2019. These might be a little harder to find than\nother Hershey bars, but they are worth hunting down. Crunch bars have their issues, for sure. For one, the chocolate has a tendency to break\ninto a million slivers upon your first bite if it's cold. But the combination of chocolate and crispy\nrice is hard to deny. They're two things that just seem to go together. And if you're popping entire fun-size Crunch\nbars into your mouth, the shattering chocolate is less of a problem. Nestle sold its American candy brands, including\nCrunch, to Ferrero in recent years. But years ago, when Nestle still owned the\nCrunch brand, the chocolate giant expanded it to include Crunch Ice Cream Bars, a clear\nargument in favor of Crunch as a top-tier chocolate bar brand. Invented in 1964, this candy bar was originally\nmarketed as the $100,000 Bar before its name changed to simply \"100 Grand\" in the mid-1980s. It adds another element to the Crunch formula:\ncaramel. It manages the perfect amounts of caramel,\ncrisped rice, and chocolate so that none overpower the others. It may not be the most popular bar on this\nlist, but it does a lot right. And because of its name, the 100 Grand bar\nhas been used in several newsworthy pranks. In 2005, a woman sued a radio station after\nthey gave her a 100 Grand candy bar as a contest prize instead of the actual $100,000 she was\nexpecting. Originally produced in the United Kingdom\nin 1967 as the Raider bar, this candy bar wasn't brought to the shores of the US until\n1979. But it didn't take long for it to become a\nhit. The name Twix combines the words \"twin\" and\n\"biscuit,\" since Brits tend to call cookies \"biscuits.\" \"Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.\" \"What about the $100,000 Bar?\" \"Nope, rice and caramel.\" \"Nougat?\" \"No.\" \"Positive?\" \"Please.\" In the last thirty years, a number of different\nunusual flavors of Twix have been released, including coffee, mint, and Cookies & Creme. Still, most candy bar aficionados will agree\nthat the original variety still remains the best. In 2017, more than $63 million worth of Twix\nwere sold in the United States, making it one of the top six chocolate candy brands\nin the country. Chocolate, caramel, and nougat come together\nbeautifully in the Milky Way bar. Though this nougat isn't quite as fluffy as\nthat in the 3 Musketeers bar, it's not super dense or heavy, either. But make no mistake: It's the caramel in the\nMilky Way that makes it special. Some chocolate bar caramel is too hard, and\nsome is too watery, but the caramel in a Milky Way is gooey and creamy perfection. Milky Way isn't named after the galaxy. Instead, its name comes from malted milk,\na popular drink back in 1923 when the candy bar was introduced. And if you're traveling in Europe, try not\nto get confused. Milky Ways there are more like American 3\nMusketeers bars, while Mars bars in Europe are more like the American Milky Way you crave. So if you'd rather eat cheap candy bars than\nexpensive Swiss chocolate on your trip to the Alps, now you know. Standard Kit Kat bars have two or four pieces\nin the package you can snap apart. Each piece has three wafer layers separated\nby chocolate, and of course, the whole thing is covered in more chocolate. The result is a wonderfully light, yet absolutely\ndelectable treat. In the United States, 192 million Kit Kats\nare sold each year, making it the fourth most popular candy bar in the country. Outside of America, Kit Kats are sold in a\nwide array of flavors including scrumptious varieties like Strawberry Cheesecake and uniquely\ndisgusting ones like Cough Drop. In the U.S., you'll find the original milk\nchocolate version, as well as newcomers like Mint & Dark Chocolate and Lemon Crisp. Whatever flavor you prefer, few candy bars\ncan touch Kit Kat's versatility. You can eat your Kit Kats by themselves, break\nthem up into ice cream, crumble them into cookie batter, or use them to decorate cakes. We'll just note here that if Reese's Peanut\nButter Cups were bar shaped instead of cup shaped, they'd be at the top of our list. But we'll abstain from a debate about whether\nthey're candy bars. Reese's Take 5, definitely a bar, is the next\nbest thing. It takes the chocolate and peanut butter of\na Reese's Cup and adds caramel, peanuts, and pretzels. Initially released in 2004, this candy bar\nhas struggled to gain traction among buyers. Hershey has tried adding different ingredients,\nchanging the wrapper, and most recently renaming the bar as Reese's Take 5 to associate it\nwith that wonderful cup. Sales of Take 5 may never skyrocket, but that\ndoesn't take away from how amazing it is. Every bite is crunchy, salty, sweet, and chewy. It's beautifully complex. If you've never tried a Take 5, change up\nyour candy bar habits by giving this relatively new bar a try. Mars makes 15 million Snickers bars every\nday and dubs it the world's best selling candy bar. The original Snickers bar, first produced\nin 1930, is still the best. Its combination of caramel, peanuts, and nougat\nsurrounded by milk chocolate is just about perfect. However, you can also find several variations\nincluding the Snickers Xtreme, which does away with the nougat. Snickers Almond and Snickers Peanut Butter\nare also worth trying at least once, although they're not good enough to eclipse the original. Aside from just being delicious, clever marketing\nand advertising campaigns undeniably play a role in this candy bar's popularity. \"You get a little hostile when you're hungry. Better?\" \"Better.\" And it can actually pay off on its \"You're\nnot you when you're hungry\" slogan; it's hearty enough to make it a meal all on its own, yet\nflavorful enough to be an exciting dessert.

hybrid it looks delicious I got a discount on this one I think I got it for like 10 they retail for around like 13 bucks which you know for the price that's a little steep I mean there are other ones I think the tootsie roll type the chocolate a fees are around the same price point if I'm not mistaken so let's open this baby up comes a little foil wrap let's see if it's broken into segments or knots okay just like the other ones a little widow can be a little tricky it's not broken up but that's all good so it's a hundred so what I'll do is get about half of that more almost three quarters Panama's case is down pretty strong actually has a nice caramel feel to it though but let's see if it actually really does a trick for the price point taste is good there are no other products are cool too but the price is a little high I'll come back to you in a little while and I'll hope I am just that so it's about an hour and a half later and it's pretty chill laid-back nothing too crazy no anxiety not two blades honestly I thought it was gonna be a little stronger but still decent I'm sorry to say Chiba Chu I will not be buying your caramel again I don't think it's the best bang for the buck but if you are a caramel enthusiast suggest trying it as you can see though I did an evil thing I probably line it up on the chart here I ate probably about 70 milligrams which you know but still cool and I'm not completely hating keep it choose a legit brand this is just the least favourite out of your products for me what if you like [Music]", "F7pphiwz_LE": "[Music] hi there buds let's talk about my outfit really fast i bought this cardigan when i was like incredibly stoned asos was having like a semi-annual type sale and a lot of [ __ ] was parents and i saw this and there was like a video of a model wearing it was a nice tall guy and he kept swaying his arms and it looked so neat and i was like oh that's fashion like i need that and then i bought it and it came in and i was like what the hell was i thinking like how much did i smoke before i decided this was something that i needed in my [ __ ] life because now i'm highly embarrassed i've had this sitting in my closet for at least a year it's even got fringe like all the way around i've had this just like sitting there and i'm like what the hell like when am i ever gonna wear this and so i was like you know what i'm just gonna have to i'm just gonna have to make myself wear it so today i was like oh i want something new to wear something spicy so this is what came out you guys i'm not gonna lie though as ugly as it is i do have an amazing time waving my arms around in it and watching all the things just move like it has such great movement like this would be something great to go dancing or something i don't know i kind of i kind of enjoy it but anyways i hope you guys are all having a great day today i have something new that i've never tried before i saw this at the dispensary it's weed bubble gum i'm like you guys know i'm a sucker for anything new at the dispensary that's an edible i'm like i've never tried weed gum before and that sounds amazing this is bubble gum flavored by a company called joy gum it has 10 milligrams of thc per serving and there's 10 pieces so 100 milligrams of thc and i thought we would try it out i mean hopefully it tastes good hopefully the effects are really long-lasting i love the idea of using a gum as an edible because you can just sit there and chew on it like all day long maybe have like a gradual release of thc all day that's what i'm hoping for i've not smoked today so i can get a full feel of how this gum is going to affect me so i'm ready to dive in let's get into this [Music] open it up pretty easy just to peel off packaging [Music] it smells like straight up bubbles like [Music] there's no other wheaties at all you cannot tell that this is infused at all it just smells like bubbles it actually smells like really good bubble gum like almost like um i'm trying to think of the name of it the one that comes in the tape fruit by the foot oh it was at this moment that he knew he [ __ ] up oh my god my grandpa used to buy this for me when i was little and i used to just have pockets full of candy and the bubble tape bubba take i don't remember what it was called the tape like gum somebody out there knows exactly what the [ __ ] i'm talking about and i probably will be able to just google a picture and put it right here what i'm talking about but that's what this smells like anyways [Music] oh my god it has their logo on the go hope that focuses it says joy gum right there that's cute and on the back of that it has a little thc emblem just to show you that it's weedy all right i'm excited about this like they're super cute they smell good so we'll see we're gonna just do one first just for a little taste test and then i'm gonna chew this entire package all in one sitting because you guys know i like to i like to go boss to the walls cheers oh my god [Music] the taste is so familiar it reminds me of chicklets that gum in the 90s that was like it came in the yellow package and they were super duper tiny that's what this tastes like if i try really really really hard i can kind of take some weaniness but like you really have to focus on it overall first impressions the gum tastes incredibly good i'm gonna go ahead and put another piece in and another pretty soon if this is actually effective this will be a really cool way of getting some and with it being 10 milligrams it's like not too much for each piece you could easily just have like a piece of gum before you go to work and then be in like a little bit of a better mood than you normally would be without being like super stoned or repaired i like that but i like that they give you 10 pieces in a pack so that if you are like me and you want to chew like 100 milligrams of thc you can i wonder if it'll blow bubbles like i wonder if it's like a bubble gum let's see i don't ever think this is bubblegum but i'm gonna try again [Music] the texture of this gum is like one of those gums that kind of melts in your mouth it becomes really really really soft because all gums get soft obviously but you know how some gums are like they damn near feel like they're gonna disappear in your mouth that's how this one feels it's very very thin i don't mind that at all all right i mean i'm at 30 milligrams i mean it's only been like what like i've probably been recording like five minutes but i'm not afraid of 100 milligrams at all like i feel like that's not going to be bad for me so [Music] that's the rest of the gum [Music] i'm so sorry if this smacking loses about my god i feel like i'm spitting i'm really surprised about extreme this much come because it's like a lot i'm not gonna lie though it's pleasure like it tastes so [ __ ] good i'll be honest with you guys i don't feel anything yet like nothing yet nothing oh my god i'm gonna knock that over don't feel nothing yet but normally it takes edibles about 20 minutes for me to really build something oh my god like talking with those i'm going to do my heart maybe i fit in my cheek while i talk normally it takes about 20 minutes for like an edible to affect me so i guess i'm gonna sit here and shoot my gum circle the web a little bit probably get on my phone and um i'll give you guys a status update on how i feel after chewing 100 milligrams of thc [Music] [Music] all right it's been about 10 minutes and i already feel it like i definitely feel a little something my body feels relaxed i'm starting to feel relaxed like my mood is starting to feel relaxed i feel like this is gonna be a good one you guys like i'm really excited because i i don't feel like i normally feel effects like this quickly or this strongly i would say that i feel the same level as i did after drinking that whole 10 milligram soda already right now so [Music] i'll be back in like another probably 20 minutes 30 minutes and we'll see how it is [Music] i also noticed on the package that's zero calories so there's that and it's made in aurora colorado so it's like a locally made thing which is me [Music] edibles i feel like sometimes make me out of breath or maybe it's just all this to me regardless i'm out of breath then i'll be back [Music] i'm gonna be honest you guys i feel sick like i feel queasy i feel dizzy this isn't good like it doesn't feel good like i feel dizzy like i don't feel good at all and i feel like i'm sweating a little bit but i don't want to take off my cute little tassels because these are so much fun but like i don't i don't know i i don't know i don't know [Music] i don't know i don't like it like it's just like i don't know like i seriously feel like the room is spinning and i don't like that and i feel hot like i almost feel like i'm gonna get sick like i'm gonna get like like i'm gonna throw up or something but i know i'm not going to throw up like i didn't eat anything and like i'm in my mouth like i'm not gonna throw up i'm not gonna lie [Music] i'm just gonna tell myself this too shall pass and do few breathing exercises [Music] we're just going to power through this and see how it is in another 20 minutes or so [Music] also you guys i'm feeling a lot better like 100 better i don't feel dizzy at all i will say i do kind of feel like i don't know it's not shortness of breath it's almost like do you guys know when you get super stoned and you feel like something's almost sitting on your chest that's how i feel right [Music] now [Music] so it's like it's not like the best feeling in the world but like overall i'm gonna say like it's not bad so far like not horrible we had a little moment we breathed through that now we're in the little chest weirdness feeling but i'm starting to feel the like mental effects like i'm starting to feel strong a little bit which is kind of nice because i feel like edibles like they kind of go weird for me like some of them will affect me and only my body like i'll feel tingly all over like whatever and then some will affect me mentally and when they affect me mentally they affect me mentally like like really slowly so i'm starting to feel those effects a little bit like i feel a little spacey very relaxed still don't focus on my breathing just because it's so weird how when you get stoned you really focus on your breathing and then you're like i don't know particularly when you get that feeling and i know other stoners out there comment below if you've ever had that feeling because i know i know other people and i have it now i do feel tingly in my arms too my arms feel really deeply all right i'll be back probably in another 20 minutes or so again for another update i don't even know how long i'm going to update this because i think i'm going to shoot this stuff all [ __ ] day long because i want to say it was 15 there's no price on here but i thought i think it was fifteen dollars and if that's okay fifteen dollars for a full day all day so i hope that it lasts the full day and i'll see you guys around for whenever the next update is i'll be sure to let you guys know how long it's been i thought right now i would say probably i'll be back in another like 40 minutes or so but i don't know once you start to get to this level of your stone that's not the word that i was trying to go for once you get to this level of your high i feel like things get unpredictable like you tend to do things and you sometimes don't and it's just you know what i mean so i'll be back when i'm back and i'll let you know how long it's been [Music] it looks so much further down [Music] i work so much better as bubble gum after you really chew it for like a good hour or so because then it gets even softer and it works so much better bubbles anyways now we'll be back in like 20 minutes [Music] i feel like i should just fly off with these i'm like i looked at the mess i was like getting off here and i was like i want my transition would just be like and then when i come back i can just fly [Music] back what would you call this look you guys like what the hell would you call this for some reason it gives me like very mariachi vibes but it's like i don't know why i think it's because it kind of reminds me of a pinata i feel like i look like a pinata like i seriously feel like i could be on dancing with the stars with this outfit like what was i thinking i'm back it is now about 4 p.m i've been chewing on this gum all day long i haven't even taken it out for a break like i've some water with it but that's about it i will say the flavor of the gum it's like the flavor of a gum that's lost its flavor if that makes sense like it has that like mmm there used to be flavor here but there's not anymore and it tastes kind of like blend that's how it tastes right now the gum definitely shrinks over time i don't know if i'm just like accidentally swallowing it or something but like it definitely felt like a huge wada gum in my mouth before now feels like just like a slightly oversized piece of gum [Music] it does blow bubbles better now now to the effects i will say that i think that it's still effective like i still feel slightly stoned right now [Music] i don't feel like this was a frame frame i do feel like it was at first like within the first like hour it was really really really strong after like the first hour and a half like two hours kind of like a little bit so like i still feel like if i like chew on it a lot and actually like focus on chewing it i do feel like a little bit like i do get a little bit of like a revamp of the high like i do think that this is to in order to get the effects you do have to like sit there and chew and chew and chew and chew and chew because if you just let sit in your mouth i don't feel like it does as much for some reason would i buy this again yes would i use it all in one setting no because i felt like that wasn't necessary i feel like i probably would have gotten a lot better of an experience off of this with using half of it and i probably would have felt probably the same i would i mean like that's just my guess i feel like this was a little overkill for what it is particularly because like the effects don't last long like or like longer i mean they do a little bit because it's a gum and you have to chew it to get the thc to come out it is like an extended release in that aspect but that thc actually goes pretty fast i feel like like i feel like you get 70 of the effects of it probably within the first two hours and then after that you're just getting like a little twin to look the last thirty percent i'm definitely gonna chew it through bedtime but i don't expect any different results if i do have any different results i'll definitely check in and let you guys know but overall i would say i recommend it um for 15 you can split this up in probably like three or four different um sessions and that would make it like a little bit more affordable and not so expensive because for a one-time treat 15 is a lot but i'll definitely try this again i wonder if they have different flavors i would be interested in a mint um the bubble gum like it just loses its flavor and then it just kind of is like and i feel like with minty gums when they lose their flavor it's not as bad if you know what i mean um anyways thank you guys so much for watching this video if you like it give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below let me know if you've ever tried joy gum if you've seen this in your dispensary if you're gonna try it now let me know because am i the only person who just gets enticed by all the little things in the dispensary i literally feel like a kid in a cannabis candy store every time i go in there and there's like something new and i'm like anyways thank you guys so much for watching and i'll see you guys around for whatever shiny activity or video i come up with for next time and hopefully i'll be in a better outfit than this or if this is your definition of good then hopefully i keep this bar hi thank you so much for

we are taking a look at another edible we are taking our first look at chill just keep it nice and chill chill medical cannabis cherry chunk dark chocolate hundred and eighty milligram THC each batch is triple lab tested who doesn't love seeing that I love seeing lab tested results on my edibles let's read there are little flavor texts on the package here at chill we offer the highest experience from our cocoa to our cannabis we are dedicated to quality safety and social responsibility we work daily to give our consumers a consistent safe and delicious product our chocolate bars are handmade with ethically sourced ingredients of the highest quality this is truly the highest chocolate that's the second time they made that joke and then on the back we've got nutrition advice we've got ingredients love seeing those as well so a couple of points there for having lab tested results which you can see right there on the back having ingredients and nutrition information I always love to see that for my edibles so as I said this is chill a kind of nice packaging here 180 milligrams of THC and this is the chocolate-covered cherries flavored Wow okay so it is packaged and exactly like Bane bars if you've ever seen the bang bars it's both the same exact milligram \u00e4j-- and pretty much identical packaging so chill and bang very similar uh and this says keep out of the reach of children on it in case you're wondering what it says and do do keepo the reach of children and it looks to be exactly the same way designed as bang bars to a couple of rectangular shaped his nurse if I could get this whole thing open excuse me everyone I'm incompetent okay it's not exactly the same way as Bing I believe bang is for vertical rectangles this is ten half split in half rectangles well let's give this chill a taste I was gonna try to come up with something clever to say but I couldn't so that's why I just went let's get this chill uh taste let's give this Joe a taste [ __ ] you perforations okay in terms of chocolate I put it about the bang level of taste it's pretty good it's not the best this this ain't of all say this ain't Kiva in terms of taste it's right about the bang level so good good not meant in any way derogatory eyes and complain good solid chocolate no complaints about the taste don't really taste any of the cover are the big chunks of cherry as they promised but I'll say them not bad at all um so taste test is fine but now for the most important test is this chill gonna get me chillax in and for that guys you guys are gonna have to wait just a couple of seconds me however I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know for sure exactly how this chill is lying in thanks for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace chill the highest chocolate cherry chunk dark chocolate and guys this is pretty much bang every nice thing I have to say about bang and every the few not glowing things I had to say about bang apply to this as well this is good chocolate not great chocolate this is potent stuff but not the most potent stuff but it's available for a pretty decent price I picked this up at my dispensary for 25 bucks for a 180 milligrams that might sound like a lot but here where I am in Long Beach that's actually and at this dispensary is a pretty good deal I picked up a more expensive less potent two chocolate one that I'm actually more excited for because it's a default city but overall I really liked the chill this is something I have no problem recommending to folks again tasting pretty good got me quite high got me up to the eighth level easily and in on all it was pretty reasonable price to so as far as chill goes I am quite pleased with my first experiment with them that is the chill the highest chocolate a pun I don't think is that good cherry chunk dark chocolate if you see in the dispensary near you and they got it for a reasonable price give it a shot especially if they don't have Kiva or DuPont say or any of those you know premium premium brands I think Jill's gonna do the job for you guys and that is gonna do it for this review here on weights I appreciate you guys watching as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "c0ZL4aT6V4M": "so you fried American savory snacks um I got a lot of flack in the comments for it because I said I hate food why again the person who hates food to test food that's genuine is something that makes me not trust you as a human being okay so never never ever heard of us it looks futuristic futuristic kind of a kind of minimalist caramel peanut and almond nervous fudge does that imply there's zero fat or sugar the name zero suggested it's no fast but it's all do you know it is 230 calories per bar okay which by American standards that's pretty restrained this is where I point out I don't like peanuts so let's see how this goes I'd give that is blad this is dog food and sickening chewy yeah don't it's like an S zero zero two zero level of sales zero reason to eat this just look they like their silvery pocketing don't they I want it to look famous CATIA nice why are they getting these names from is the three little bits no fluffy chocolate on chocolate taste and it's whipped up as well it tastes like what we call Mars bars but without the caramel that's gonna just dry and so eat another bit of chocolate and the rest of us just further I'm a big problem with this after all the anticipation of three musketeers yeah it's very much a 2-tone thing don't know what the three musketeers again so one must be the chocolate dealers the fuller and the thirsty Oh Baby Ruth these are famous they're quite I don't know it feels like it's been real bursting of peanuts rich caramel and chewy nougat no good no more in okis is it's either a baby or I think played it rings a bell I have no idea a spa she's huge peanuts hanging up there look there's no labor to the job is there I like it really be 90 so no strong hmm it wouldn't be my first point to call push but after what me cases yeah they asked as a concept it is good it's got the nice big brown bus it's in the spot is from the distance as in like you know chocolate good cookies good oh there's a lot of ingredients they can barely fit the ingredients on the entire package you can see all the chocolate chips in there it's like someone trapped lots of rabbit through its my bottom okay it's crunchy it's nice it's like everything that you would expect it to be it's creamy it's sweet it's nicely cookie I'm actually pleasantly surprised with this one yeah Butterfinger breed the ingredients I like it because it's a bit witty wonka-esque yeah just son make a sexual I look gran roasted peanuts yeah it's like the second or third ingredient corn syrup sugar there is no Bossier English that's false advertising very crispity don't worry Tamika kind of tastes like a crunchy no it's not it's nicer than a crunchy that's interesting I would say it's kind of dry actually after all that it's a kind of flaky I love peanut butter and chocolate I really do so that's kind of the appeal America who stopped making chocolate with peanut butter what did you do when you lose there my mom sent me chopped it over if you're into sensual physical and creamy chocolate you know what else is just as creamy as this Hershey's bar go onto Facebook check out www.sceeto.com fats YouTube on your snapchat up I don't use snapchat but I'm sure you know how to do it", "SIyF1ZodZlY": "Let\u2019s face it \u2026 the chocolate bars we\nchoose to eat can make or break our day. If we decide to try one out and it\u2019s absolutely\nawful, and it later vanishes from store shelves, it\u2019s no big loss. But those epic chocolate bars we love from\nthe first bite can definitely cause us to be transported somewhere else entirely \u2026 in\na good way. And it\u2019s these bars we end up missing the\nmost if they vanish. Here are 10 discontinued chocolate bars we\nmiss - part 1. Kit Kat Caramac Well, by now we all know that caramel and\nchocolate go very well together. After all, the Caramilk bar is pretty famous\nand many enjoy its rich and pleasurable combination, almost as much as they love playing the game\nof trying to figure out how the caramel is inserted into the exquisite bar. So it\u2019s no wonder that other chocolate bar\nbrands wanted to get in on the game as well. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that Kit Kat released\nthis caramel bar, and although Kit Kat is known to release some pretty odd flavor pairings\nwhen it comes to their bars, this one was pretty run of the mill, as they say. And although there were a few that enjoyed\nit, perhaps it was its simplicity and run with the norm that caused its untimely demise,\nas many are and were used to Kit Kats that were outside the regular sort to be a tad\nmore extravagant. After all in Japan, there are over 50 astonishing\nflavors offered in the form of the Kit Kat bar we know and love. Perhaps caramel was a little too simple to\nsatisfy fans of the bar and its forays into the wild and crazy flavors offered. But, there are those that miss this one. 2005 marked the last time this one was seen\nin stores. Taz The Cadbury Confectionery Company goes way\nback, and when we say \u201cway back\u201d, we mean really back there on the old timeline. Is 195 years way back enough for ya? We thought so. It\u2019s true \u2026 the company got its start\nback in 1824 and well, it hasn\u2019t looked back since, releasing chocolate treat after\nchocolate treat, and although not all of the treats created by the great minds at Cadbury\nwere instantaneous hits, they have created some of the most important and successful\nchocolate bars the world has ever seen. But unfortunately, some of these have gone\nthe way of boxy television sets and the only way you can taste them now would be to travel\nback in time, and that isn\u2019t all that possible \u2026 just yet. And it wasn\u2019t that long ago that Cadbury\nand Warner Bros. Studios teamed up to create a chocolate bar that offered a whirlwind of\nflavor. The ever-popular character of The Tasmanian\nDevil definitely reached across the screen and touched audiences all over, and why not. Maybe it was the gibberish he spoke, or rather\nthe tornado he represented moving from scenario to scenario \u2026 whatever it was, he surely\nbecame a household name. So creating a chocolate bar that featured\nhis essence was a no-brainer on the part of the good people over at Cadbury. But like so many things from the years gone\nby, it fell out of favor with consumers, and that\u2019s a definite shame, as it would be\nnice to hold onto some of the things from our long-gone past, wouldn\u2019t it? Cadbury\u2019s Snowflake Now what could sound more appetizing or refreshing\nthan a snowflake? Can you remember being a kid and waiting for\nthat first snowfall of the winter season? Many watched the sky on a slow Sunday afternoon\nhoping for that first snowfall. The snow that would come signified countless\nhours of fun outdoors, whether it be snowball fights, the construction of towering snowmen\nand of course forts and tobogganing down the neighborhood hill. But for many, opening your mouth and sticking\nout your tongue and letting the fresh snowflakes land ever so softly was probably the highlight\nof the first snowfall, and we have no doubt that this was the sentiment Cadbury was going\nfor here. Now, we understand that a snowflake sure doesn\u2019t\npack a tasty wallop worthy of praise or delight, but it\u2019s the essence of the craving for\nthat first snowfall that likens the experience to a chocolate bar, as what can you crave\nmore than a sweet piece of chocolate? The comparison is actually quite fair; at\nleast for us that is, but we\u2019re sure you agree. Cadbury\u2019s Snowflake bar wasn\u2019t launched\nall that long ago. At the turn of the century in fact \u2026 in\nthe year 2000, but it didn\u2019t stay on the shelves all that long, as it was discontinued\nin 2008, but we sure had a good eight years, didn\u2019t we? Yes indeed, and oh the memories.. Mars Delight Just try to imagine how good a particular\nitem of food would have to be to create in people the type of wanton desire to inspire\nthem to start online petitions for the return of said particular item. You think we\u2019re kidding, but in reality\nthis happens far more often than you\u2019d likely imagine. Now Mars isn\u2019t as old and established as\nCadbury, but in its 87 years, the company sure has released quite a few tasty treats\nthat many have adored and even cherished. The Mars Delight is an obvious one that people\nstill miss to this day. The bar was very different from the classic\nMars Bar and perhaps it was this that made it so popular, as many consumers like change. It contained a wafer coated in caramel cream\nas opposed to nougat and plain caramel. It was coated in milk chocolate and that is\nthe only similarity between the two offerings. Cadbury's Nuts About Caramel Cadbury has tried to play the caramel card\nover and over again, time after time, and why wouldn\u2019t they? After all, they produced one of the most successful\nchocolate bars the world has ever seen. The Caramilk bar is composed mainly of caramel\nand they have used that sweet ingredient time and time again in a plethora of imaginative\nways. But in the end, it is the Caramilk bar that\nwins out and stands the test of time. It was created in 1968 and has sold a lot\nof units over the long years of its existence. But still, the fact that it\u2019s still around\ndoesn\u2019t halt people from missing the other bars offered by the company, like this one\nhere. Now the essence of the Cadbury Nuts About\nCaramel bar lies within the appropriate name, and it was the nuts that made it different\nfrom the classic Caramilk bar, and also what probably made it a little less popular, as\nthere are many out there that don\u2019t particularly like nuts in their sweets. But, the company even released ice cream bars\nthat shared the same name and list of ingredients, and although they did well, both items were\nlast seen quite some time ago. The 54321 Bar The actual title 5-4-3-2-1 was the name of\na song by the British Band: Manfred Mann, the group that brought the world `Blinded\nBy The Light,` a song actually written by the one and only legend, Bruce Springsteen. That was way back in 1964, however, and the\n54321 chocolate bar was a child of the eighties\u20141982 to be exact\u2014and it sold particularly well. However, it didn\u2019t survive the eighties,\nas it was discontinued in 1989, and it\u2019s still sorely missed by many to this day. The popular commercial featured a song that\nwas very reminiscent of sixties British rock/pop, so maybe the name borrowed from Manfred Mann\nwasn\u2019t exactly coincidental. In reality, it is in fact the same song, only\nwith the lyrics changed. It\u2019s also a title to a semi-popular Flo\nRida song entitled \u201cTurn Around 54321.\u201d But the similarities between the two songs\nstop there of course. The name for the bar however, came from the\nfive different ingredients that composed the bar: fused water, rice crispies, fondant,\nmilk chocolate, and of course caramel. The bar promised and delivered an explosive\nflavor that many are still dreaming about. Jacob\u2019s Trio Yet another chocolate bar on our illustrious\nlist of chocolate bars sorely missed by the masses, that got its start in the eighties,\nand while the era was a time for \u201cpartying,\u201d we\u2019d surely say that it was also a time\nfor tasty treats and of course epic Saturday Morning cartoons. We mention cartoons because the advertisement\nfor this chocolate bar actually was shot entirely as a cartoon and probably this was done on\npurpose. A catchy tune and tagline were also added\nto the commercial and the general public was hooked from the first reel of the ad. The song was a play on the ever-popular \u201cDay-O,\u201d\ninstead replacing the lyrics with Trio. The cartoon accompanying the song was cute\nin and of itself and featured the cartoon character of Suzy in hot pursuit of a large\nshipment of Trio bars. Simple enough, yet oh-so-effective. The bar was discontinued in 2003 but unbelievably,\nit made a return in 2016 after a campaign was launched for its return on Facebook, believe\nit or not. The power of united voices, huh? Mars' White Maltesars As they say, white chocolate isn\u2019t for everyone,\nand as the limited time these treats had on the shelves will prove, there\u2019s more to\nthe statement after all. Maltesers are pretty popular and the regular\nsort can still be found, but the white chocolate ones had a definitely limited run on the market. Yet another offering by the Mars Company,\nthese treats were adored by those who love white chocolate and would do anything to get\na mere taste of the substance any chance they get. Yet the lack of sales overall is what caused\nthis chocolate to be taken off the shelves and subsequently halted completely. Now there are many other white chocolate brands\nout there of course, but the airy and light taste that these particular treats brought\non is sorely missed by many white chocolate lovers the world over. Nestle\u2019s Toffo Here, the essential star ingredient in this\nbar by Nestle is all in the name, or rather a play on the name. And toffee is an adored treat loved by many\nthe world over. Toffee is made by combining both caramel and\nmolasses and the end result is nothing short of spectacular. So many treats like candies, desserts, cookies\nand of course chocolate bars contain this star ingredient, and the high impact flavor\nit brings can definitely be attributed to the success this treat enjoyed back in its\nday. Nestle has been processing food products since\n1866, and for the subsequent 153 years, they\u2019ve been bringing treats and products to the masses\nwithout ever halting on production. They\u2019ve released one food product after\nanother, particularly in the confectionery category, and all of these products have done\nwell. On the rare occasion, however, they did have\na few misfires, and after all, who hasn\u2019t had a few so-called missteps on their rise\nto prominence. The Toffo bar, which should have just been\ncalled the Toffee Bar, let\u2019s face it, struggled in its day to reach that global acceptance\nthat the company had hoped for. But it surely had its fans, of course, and\nthey are all missing this treat to this very day, still dreaming about the rich taste and\ntexture. But they can dream all they want, as it won\u2019t\nbe returning any time soon \u2026 unless somebody starts an online petition that is. As we\u2019ve learned, that tactic seems pretty\neffective. Fox\u2019s Echo Bars Echoes are still a wonderment shared by many,\nas the rebound of one\u2019s voice or any sound for that matter is pretty spectacular and\none of nature\u2019s many interesting phenomena. And speaking of phenomenal things this planet\nhas to offer, the many treats and bars we all enjoy can be considered pretty amazing\nas well. Aptly named, the Echo Bar was just that and\nthe combination of white chocolate and milk chocolate brought the best of both worlds\ntogether. In essence, the bar was primarily milk chocolate\nand if we can be granted the opportunity to juxtapose the chocolate echo with a real life\necho, you should see the same similarities and conclusions we came up with \u2026 the milk\nchocolate resembles the original voice called out into the vast mountains \u2026 the white\nchocolate represents the echo heard in return, as the echo heard is never quite the same\nas what\u2019s put out there. With us so far? No? We kind of lost the point as well, but it\nwas worth a try. Regardless, the echo definitely packed a punch\nworthy of its praise, and if you\u2019d like to give it a try, we\u2019re afraid you can\u2019t. Just imagine if you will, singing loud and\nproud into a valley expecting an echo in return, only to hear an utter and mocking silence\ncome back at you in return.

where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary I apologize still for the mayhem going on behind me here in the closet hopefully should have the construction wrapped up soon and something a little bit more visually appealing to see in the background so knock on wood so guys welcome to weeks as I said this is the first time you've tuned in to wheats the way our reviews work is I take the product I eat the entire thing of the product unless it's a special experiment or something I'm gonna eat or drink the entire thing and then I come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm actually feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review not necessarily just how it tastes I'm speaking about how things taste I think I'm probably picked up what is going to be the worst tasting edible I have ever had I have got a sneaking suspicion that this is going to be grotesque awful and might even make me gag so I'm really excited about it oh just give a pretty sneak preview there see this is another cannabis syrup I've reviewed one of their 200 milligrams before except I think I've reviewed a couple of their 200 milligrams before and really liked them found the taste to be a little hard to get through with their fruit ones and they've got a tons of fruit flavors all kinds of great cherry strawberry watermelon blackberries tangerine so on and so forth and those are all okay those are all doable but they do have something a little bit special a little bit something different a little bit something outside they're a fruity comfort zone and that's what I decided to go with oh and again this is a hundred milligram edible the first we've reviewed their 100 milligram line we've only looked at the 200 milligram before it cost me $10 or excuse me they cost $10 but I gotten a discount for just eight bucks to a pretty affordable price for this edible or this drinkable whatever you want to call it viscous liquid but the grotesque thing I picked up is the cannabis and it is going to be disgusting chocolate flavored syrup Oh God so this is a canvas chocolate flavored syrup 100 milligrams of THC in there they claim to be ten servings we're just going to do it all at once not going to chug it learn my lesson in the last time and if you look on the back there you can see I don't know how well it shows up but you can see this is actually rated by SC labs independent laboratory body that will determine how much tea is it C is in the product for real so you can feel pretty confident that this actually contains what it says it does all right guys I'm installing I've not been wanting to do this but it's time to it's time to go ahead man up and try this disgusting sounding cannabis chocolate syrup Oh oh boy I mean it smells like it smells kind of like Hershey's syrup it really does with weed and then like this other undefinable pungent something rather bottoms up oh my god it's so thick I wasn't think oh my god Wow excuse me it's like drinking wet cement um wow that is unpleasant it is just so dead there it goes again I'm burping again sorry I just sticks in your throat oh man this is they really taste it to be honest it just was like why does it feel like I put glue down my throat oh it's much much thicker than their other service which are already thick to begin with this is unbelievably thick oh my god here goes another little sip ah it does kind of taste like chocolate jorgito tastes like drinking nesquik mixed with a glue and weed oh well guys I'm gonna finish this off I think I'm about halfway through and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours if I haven't choked to death and let you know how we're feeling thank you so much for watching wheats guys I really appreciate it sorry been rambling here at the end but thanks for watching and I will see you in just a few seconds peace what guys I am back it has been 2 hours since I had the cannabis syrup chocolate oh boy and it was every bad every bit as disgusting and terrible as I had possibly conceived it to be it and that's only in terms of the taste let's let's get that right off the bat and actually it didn't even taste that bad it's just it has the consistency of bull semen so it's hard to get down I mean it's it's it's ridiculous you saw me literally choke on it there for a while so that being said it's great still I these hundred milligram canvases are yeah right at about to say half the strength of their 200 milligram brothers right where you would expect them to be good price eight bucks for this and yeah I'm pretty pleased with it I guess would say I'm pretty pleased with cannabis in general not so pleased with the chocolate syrup I would stick with the fruit flavored ones if I were you guys and I still haven't yet found that magic recipe to make it palatable I know I tried sprite in the past and that didn't sort of work out as well as I had hoped but I will find it because I'm gonna be reviewing some more of these cannabis syrups because I'm still intrigued by them so if I find that magical way out be sure to share it with you guys but otherwise that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you guys watching it as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "iCen9uvCh4E": "elevated in this one showcasing lightheart cannabis co 100 milligram full spectrum [Applause] thc gourmet

through these machines every day in Colorado when we started six years ago inconsistency was the biggest problem in the edibles industry and nobody was really testing products nobody was accurately dosing products we saw that as a big opportunity not only to set ourselves apart but to do what was right for the patients people didn't really like edibles because they were afraid of them you could have an edible one day and you'd be medicated fine you'd have the same edible from the same company the following week and you'd be over medicated that was the biggest concern that we saw and you know my partner Rick his expertise was perfecting a recipe and duplicating at 20,000 times a day when I approached him and talked to him about doing edibles that we treated like food you know

means edible uh an edible brand we've looked at many many times one of my favorites it's been a bit of a rough week here at wheat's hq in the world at large um southern california is burning the sky is orange outside of me i felt like i really wanted that edible that i was sure was gonna do the trick so what did i go with today an old favorite an old classic let's take a look at good old kiva again that's right one of my all-time favorites kiva manufacturers of the wonderful chocolate bars the little terabytes and even some excellent gummies uh not too too long ago they've branched out got some new fancy flavors out there including one of my favorite flavors period good old mint chocolate chip um it's a love it or hate it flavor i'm a love it kind of guy and i thought you know the world's burning let's do some kiva so uh this is as i said a kiva chocolate bar of 100 milligrams of a thc uh mint chocolate chip flavored picked it up for a uh respectable 21 at my dispensary which is more than average for the edible there for sure uh not too much higher than their chocolate edibles definitely higher than the gummies uh but kiva is a product uh of exceedingly high caliber so uh it is usually worth that slight premium uh so let's go ahead and get this 21 chocolate bar open we've got some very elaborate directions on how to open it here cuba seems to have quite the process uh so let's figure this out uh one press on flat surface tabs to unlock cool two well this is a flat surface two use finger to slide out three pull open oh that does not feel like that is uh [ __ ] it too stupid oh wait maybe i just have to take the sticker off didn't it say to take the sticker off but you know oh god damn it do i hate all these pieces of packaging ah there we go just rip it they make so much great child proof packaging but what they don't realize is when you make childproof packaging you also make idiot-proof packaging and while i am not a child i am definitely an idiot and i don't like being treated like a child but i don't mind being treated like an idiot um yeah how do you get something that's child proof packaging that's hard difficult to open for children but still oh my god remarkably open you know not difficult jesus christ wow that was a hell of a lot of effort i don't understand how that was even supposed to work it was glued at the very bottom like to the package oh well take that into account when purchasing this uh don't take this somewhere you need to open it discreetly uh boy okay so here we go here is our kiva th c 100 milligrams infused chocolate bar uh nice and green like mint chocolate chip so uh if i'm correct it's gonna be five 20 milligram little pieces in this bar yes yes yes oh wow there's some like real minty chunks on the back there so this is what our bar looks like or at least half of it the other half's broken in there uh five milligrams each of those little rectangles for 20 in total for 100 milligrams and all and like all

better be mature if you're watching this today we are celebrating a thousand subscribers on YouTube that's right a thousand of you awesome people subscribe to my youtube channel thank you everybody who Tunes in and watches my videos and shares them and likes them in comments I really appreciate that holy [ __ ] so to celebrate a thousand subscribers I'm gonna stick to the theme of a thousand and what I've got here is a 1-1 gram snake of some shadow I've stretched out here so we're gonna do a 1 gram damp of some of this grape star shatter if I can get it to focus I picked this up earlier from the hem Center really cool dispensary and this is about who cares what percent 66% but we've got a 1 gram dam which is a thousand milligrams of concentrate and then I also have a thousand milligrams of edibles that we're gonna take today so a 1 gram Babb and a thousand milligrams of edibles do you think that you can handle this what I've got here is the let's get it to focus I have the Colorado cannabis oil capsules and there's four capsules in here and there are a total of 350 milligrams through the whole bottle and they actually make these words four capsules and it's a thousand milligrams but I couldn't find that so these are just I guess less filled and the capsules but let me give you a breakdown we're looking at okay so each capsule is about 93 milligrams of THC and it is full spectrum or RSO so there are other cannabinoids and there's really good stuff I've had this many times before and it's actually my favorite edible so this whole bottle is 372 milligrams of THC and it's not like it's full there's only four little capsules in here and we're actually gonna take we're gonna take three of these which should be just over a thousand milligrams it'll actually be about 1100 milligrams so I'm excited and then I'm gonna try to stream on Twitch after this so this is for a thousand subs on YouTube but you know I stream every night on Twitch if you don't sub to my twitch

don't know check out all that stuff join the discord that's the good one let's take some of the capsules first maybe like a half now and half after cuz like what if the dev just wrecks me I can I can't continue let's give it a go so this is 350 milligrams for four of these and they're just little capsules and I guess this is the same size for all of them so if you get the higher dose which ones they just they fill more but they have more of the liquid in it early oil so let's go for it let's take a nap now [Music] just little GHC capsules I kappapa movement in this or above okay so that's four of them I think and honestly guys I mentioned it before this is my absolute favorite edible I hate if I want to take a thousand milligrams I usually hate a thousand to get high if I want to take it it's like several brownies or like a fuckload of gummies you know what I mean I'm not trying to eat like a [ __ ] eight ounce bag of gummies to get a thousand milligrams I'd rather just like pop a few capsules and this is actually these are the low dose not like a pop four and get a thousand milligrams some of them are even more potent so I need to look out for those they're hard to find and they're kind of pricey well that's half of it down it's about 550 milligrams of THC here was 1100 for the capsules overall so we have half of that down and let's fire up the let's fire up the nail here we're gonna do this on quartz banger I got the pearls in there hopefully hoping I can get the time right I don't do a lot of dabs on this lately so I'm hoping I get the time right but if not

This is a shame, because they are delicious! Today, it's time to look\nat some candy bars from other nations. Try them when you're traveling to other countries.\nAll of these candy bars offer a unique and exciting taste. So get those taste buds ready\nand let\u2019s unwrap 10 candy bars America wished they had. Kinder Bueno & Kinder Surprise These delicious chocolate bars are made by\nthe famous Italian company Ferrero. The word Bueno has Spanish origins and means \"good\"\nor \"tasty\". They come packed with a creamy hazelnut filling, a wafer shell to give the\ncandy bar a wonderful crunch, all surround by creamy chocolate. Similar to Twix candy\nbars, Kinder Bueno come in packs of two. However, unlike Twix bars, Kinder Bueno are not widely\navailable in the United States. Production started in the early 1990's and it was heavily\nmarketed first in Europe, then through out South America and other regions. Kinder Buenos\nhave always been made at both Kinder factories, one located in Villers-\u00c9calles, France and\nthe other in Warsaw, Poland. Kinder themselves however are most popular for their Kinder\nSurprise, which are hollow chocolate eggs featuring an inner shell of white chocolate\nand an outer shell of milk chocolate, and of course, a toy inside each egg. These also\nshockingly are not widely available in the United Sates. Due to outdated rules enforced\nby the Federal Food and Drug Cosmetic Act of 1983. The inclusion of a toy inside the\nKinder Surprise chocolate eggs have prevented them from being sold in the United States.\nThough in 2017, they slowly began to introduce them as \"Kinder Joy\" to the American crowd.\nThat said they are different from the original European Kinder Surprise so while the USA\nmay finally be getting their hands on these, legally, they still don't have the original. Bake 'N Tasty Mini Kit Kats in Japan Japan loves Kit Kats, this obsession lead\nto the creation of what has to be one of the coolest candy bar creations ever made, Bake\n'N Tasty Mini Kit Kats. These are Kit Kats that you bake and make yourself at home! Yes\nthat's correct, no eating this one while waiting in line at the grocery store, you've got to\ntake it home and make it. For this extra hard work you'll be treated with one of the best\ncandy bar experiences you can have. This is not a joke, there were literally line ups\noutside the Kit Kat specialty stores when these were first released. The basic rundown\nis you toss these little Kit Kat bake bars into your toaster oven and within minutes\nyou get a delicious baked wafer biscuit candy bar. The sugar content hardens during the\nbaking process and omits a lovely caramel scent. The only thing you could compare them\nto is something like a toaster strudel or Pop Tart, but these Kit Kats are on another\nlevel. There are two main flavors, Kit Kat mini original chocolate and Kit Kat mini pudding,\nboth amazing. And just in case you're thinking to yourself, hey I've got a toaster oven and\nsome Kit Kats, I'm going to make my own baked Kit Kats, don't do it. Kit Kat released a\nfriendly reminder stating that: \u201cKit Kat Bake has been developed in Japan, specifically\nfor baking; please do not attempt to bake other Kit Kat products.\u201d Sorry America,\nthis is a Kit Kat treat that's only available in Japan at this time. The Prince Polo Is Popular In Poland This candy bar is a time honored favorite\nin Poland. In fact, it's the most popular candy bar in the country. If you ever get\nthe chance to try a Prince Polo, be sure to indulge. You'll love munching on this candy\nbar's chocolate-covered wafers. Each bar has four wafer layers and three layers of chocolate\ncream filling. It's not just the Polish who enjoy noshing on these tasty candy bars. The\nIcelanders are also huge Prince Polo fans. Most residents of Iceland consume a pound\nor more of these chocolate bars annually. In winter of 2018, proud Prince Polo fans\nin Iceland took to social media to show off their own Prince Polo candy bars. Icelanders\ngot really creative when it came to posing with Prince Polo chocolate bars. Some posed\nwith the wrapped candy bars between their teeth, while one Prince Polo fanatic dressed\nup as an astronaut who was discovering a Prince Polo bar on a new planet. Sure, that last\none may have been Photoshopped, but it was all great fun. So, why does this candy bar\nremain so popular in Iceland? Well, it's been around for a long time. During the Fifties,\nthere were stringent rules about importing sweet treats into Iceland. Since there wasn't\na ton of options, Icelanders relied on tasty Prince Polo candy bars when they were craving\nsweets. This candy bar has become an integral part of Icelandic culture. Coffee Crisp in Canada This one might be the most confusing on the\nentire list. Why? Well coffee is global, essentially available everywhere in the world coffee is\nas global as products get. So you would think a delicious candy bar featuring chocolatey\ncoffee goodness would also be a worldwide hit, but you'd be wrong. Coffee Crisp is a\nCanadian only candy bar that actually originated in the 1930's, but has been around as we know\nit now since the late 1980's, when Nestle acquired Rowntree, the original manufacturer\nof what would become the Coffee Crisp candy bar. Nestle Canada has been producing and\nmarketing the bar to Canadians ever since. Many variations and limited edition flavors\nwere released over the years, including Coffee Crisp Triple Mocha, French Vanilla, Orange,\nRaspberry, Cafe Caramel and even a Maple flavored variation called Coffee Crisp White was released.\nAll of these variations have since been discontinued and are even harder to get your hands on.\nThere have been many petitions and general outcry to get Coffee Crisp distributed, particularly\nin the United States and one such petition was actually successful. In July of 2006,\nNestle Canada actually started marketing and distributing Coffee Crisp bars to American\ncities. However, in 2009 without reason Nestle Canada discontinued all marketing and distribution\nto the United States. While there is still some official and unofficial importing of\nCoffee Crisp Bars to the USA, this is one still remains out of reach for most Americans. Ovomaltine Chocolate Bars Are A Swiss Delight The Swiss town of Ovomaltine was once home\nto a pharmacist. His name was Georg Wander. He was a doctor who wanted to do his bit to\nlower the rate of child mortality. In 1865, which was during his time, some children perished\ndue to lack of proper nutrition. To do his part to help, he decided to create a powerful\nsource of nutrition, using malt extract. When the good doctor passed away, his son embraced\nthe same dream. His son was named Albert and Albert decided to fortify the malt extract\nrecipe, by adding cocoa, eggs and milk. By 1904, the recipe was complete. It was called\nOvaltine by those who spoke English. It was a powder that was meant to be stirred into\nmilk and drank down. These days, the Ovamaltine brand is still going strong. It's not just\nnutritional powder anymore. There are a range of products, including Ovomaltine chocolate\nbars, which contain yummy hazelnuts and the classic powder mixture. These candy bars are\na favorite in Europe. They carry the distinctive scent of Ovomaltine powder. The malt scent\nand taste tend to overpower the chocolate, but in a good way. It's also possible to buy\nbiscuits, spreads and cereals by Ovomaltine. Smarties, but not those Smarties While these are technically not a candy bar,\nSmarties are chocolate candies and boy are they good! These little candy coated chocolate\nspheres are indeed also unique to Canada, you will not find them south of the boarder,\nthough that's a complicated subject. Smarties, are already an American candy classic. You\nknow, those little cheap sugary pastel colored tablets that come in a roll with the ends\ntwisted shut, those are Smarties, if you're American. If you are Canadian, those are called\nRockets, and Smarties and brightly colored, candy coated milk chocolate button shaped\ncandies. They are much like M&M's which are sold in the United States, but also sold in\nCanada, confused yet? Here's the simplified version, there is already an American Smarties\ncandy company, therefore the Canadian brand of Smarties candies can't be sold in the USA\nunder that name. It's really that simple and for that very reason you will never be able\nto get Smarties in the USA. That said, this one is less of a bummer if you're looking\nto actually eat these candies, as you can go to any store and buy standard M&M's and\nbe treated to a very similar taste experience! Cherry Ripe Is From Australia Cherry fans in America may wish that they\ncould buy Cherry Ripe chocolate bars in the USA. These bars come from Australia and they've\nbeen around since the 1920s. Despite huge cultural shifts, this candy bar still reigns\nin the Land Down Under. It's actually the oldest candy bar in the country and was the\nbrainchild of talented chocolatiers who worked for a company called MacRobertson Chocolates.\nIn 1967, Cadbury gobbled up MacRobertson Chocolates. Thanks to Cadbury's resources and brand recognition,\nthe Cherry Ripe bar's popularity spread. This candy bar features a mixture of cherries and\ncoconut. The mixture has a texture that might be best described as spongy. Over a spongy\nlayer, there is a dark chocolate coating. While other Cadbury treats, including Crunchie\nbars and Flake candy bars, have also captured the loyalty of Aussies, the Cherry Ripe is\nstill a contender. It's iconic. Some of these candy bars probably seem pretty exotic to\nAmericans. In America, it's about the milk chocolate and the nuts and the caramel. Chocolate\nbars reflect the tastes of the countries that they are sold in. This is why learning about\ncandy bars from different nations is so interesting. If you grew up in Australia, you might find\nyourself craving a Cherry Ripe, rather than a Butterfinger or something like that. Double Decker Bar in the United Kingdom Yes, it's named after the bus of the same\nname, and yes it's from the UK where those very buses reside. The buses were even used\nin marketing the candy bar. Some will even say the very reason why Double Decker candy\nbars are not available to the U.S. market is due to the fact that double decker buses\njust aren't that common in the USA, though that seems unlikely. More likely is that Double\nDecker bars are made by Cadbury who on more than one occasion have created regional candy\nbars that they don't market or distribute elsewhere. But that's the history lesson,\nwhat about the candy bar itself? The Double Decker was first introduced to the British\nmarket in 1976 and has been going strong since. The Double Decker candy bar consists of, not\nsurprisingly, two layers. One layer of lightly whipped nougat, and another layer containing\nlittle crispy cereal bits. The whole thing is then coated in creamy milk chocolate. While\nthese look and taste amazing, it's very unlikely that the Double Decker candy bar will ever\nmake its way to the USA. Horalky Is a Slovakian Sensation The Horalky is a candy bar that was invented\ndue to a food shortage in 1960s Slovakia. At that time, hazelnuts were in short supply.\nTypically, hazelnuts were a component in wafers. Bakers changed it up to cope with the shortage.\nThey started utilizing peanuts, rather than hazelnuts. The peanut wafer was born and it\nwas good. The advent of the peanut wafer led to the creation of the legendary Horalky.\nIt's a candy bar which contains wafer layers, as well as a cream made from peanuts. There\u2019s\nalso a chocolate coating that isn't too thick. Decades later, a bakery called Sedita makes\nroughly one hundred and sixty million of these candy bars annually. Peanuts used in the Horalky\nrecipe are sourced from South America and shipped to Slovakia. Cocoa for the bars is\nsourced from the Ivory Coast of Africa. Peanut fans in America may wish that they could indulge\nin these bars. After all, both the wafers and the filling are made from peanuts.\u00a0The\nHoralky features vibrant packaging. Its packaging is something that many Slovakians recognize\nat a glance. These bars are so popular there, but most people in the USA have never even\nheard of them. Anyone who plans to visit Slovakia should also plan to pick these candy bars\nup at local shops. They're traditionally Slovakian sweet treats. Plus, they have an awesome origin\nstory. Aero Bars Have Stellar Mouth Feel Aero bars are delicious. This enticing treat\ncomes from candy mega-company, Nestl\u00e9. You'll find these bars, which have a unique texture\nthat's aerated, thanks to plenty of air bubbles within the chocolate, in a host of countries,\nincluding Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada and South Africa. Unfortunately, Americans\nonce rejected this classic chocolate bar, back in the 80s. They were launched in the\nUSA back then, but didn't really take off. Americans who have managed to find these chocolate\nbars since then, probably in Canada, often love the way that they taste. While Americans\nsaid no to the Aero long ago, they may be sorry now. Maybe the timing was just wrong.\nAero bars melt in mouths thanks to their texture. The bubbles inside of the chocolate collapse\nwhile the chocolate is inside of the mouth. This creates a creamy-smooth taste sensation\nthat's really awesome. This chocolate bar has been around for over a hundred years.\nIt's had some variations, such as the Dark Cherry Truffle Big Bubble Bar, the White Chocolate\nBig Bubble Bar, the Mousse, Aero Bubbles and others. The original recipe for the Aero is\nguarded with care. It's top secret. Any American who wants to try them should put them on their\nchocolate bucket list. Maybe a tour to countries where fun and different chocolate bars are\nsold would be a good idea? Aeros are available in typical, single-serving sizes, but there\nare smaller and larger ones too.

So tear open your favorite wrapper because\nwe're counting down the Top 10 Chocolate Bars Ranked Worst to Best. Skor Considering that this chocolate bar was made\nto be a direct competitor to the Heath bar, we\u2019re prepared to take a little bit of heat\nfor this preferential pick. Yes, we\u2019re claiming that the Skor bar is better than the Heath\nbar and that\u2019s why it is where it is on this list. While the Heath bar has long been\noffering customers a delicious toffee crunch, it is really the Skor bar that took the fantastic\nrecipe and brought it to the next level. The confectioners behind Skor were able to produce\na bar that reviewers claim has a stronger chocolate and a more buttery flavor and consistency\nin comparison to its counterpart the Heath bar, which is said to focus more on the almond\nflavor rather than the butter. The funniest part is that although the Skor was produced\nby Hershey as a direct competitor to the Heath bar, today in 2020, the Hershey Company now\nowns both bars! Despite no longer needing the two similar bars to go head to head in\ncompetition, a long standing feud in consumer preference has forced the company to continue\noffering both bars to cater to the fans. Luckily for us, it doesn\u2019t look like these crunchy\nbars will be going anywhere anytime soon - so they can continue sticking in our teeth for\nyears to come! Hershey\u2019s Cookies \u2018n\u2019 Cream Starting us off is a contender who is really\nan impostor - but just too delicious to ignore. Although years ago the\u00a0Hershey\u2019s Cookies\n\u2018n\u2019 Creme bar changed its recipe, replacing cocoa butter with other ingredients so it\nis no longer considered actual white chocolate, this has not seemed to deter fans from binging\non this far from ordinary candy bar. While many of the chocolate bars listed opt for\ngooey or crunchy fillings of peanut butter, caramels, and nougat, the Cookies\u2019n\u2019 Creme\nbar opts for a solid chocolate bar with mix-ins distributed throughout. The mix-in in question?\nDelicious chocolate cookie pieces. The entire bar makes one think of the popular Oreo cookie\nsandwich - and although the taste of the two is very different, it can be seen that both\nhave similar qualities. The difference mostly lies in the additional sweetness factor that\nthe bar offers in comparison to the salty crunch of the cookie. Fear not though, as\nthe entire candy bar is filled with tiny cookie pieces that give it just enough of that salty\nvs. sweet flavor that everybody loves. And anyone who adores this chocolate bar must\ngive this hack a try: take one Oreo, a toasted marshmallow, and a square of Hershey's Cookies\n'n' Creme bar. Assemble the three ingredients like a s'more and enjoy a flavor explosion\nlike none other! Almond Joy So how does a candy like Almond Joy end up\non the list of the Top 10 Chocolate Bars? By being so absolutely different and delicious!\nWhile most of the confectionery market in the United States has chosen to steer away\nfrom coconut, with its somewhat polarizing and unmistakable flavor profile, Almond Joy\nhas used the ingredient to its advantage in creating one of the tastiest treats on the\nmarket! Before getting any deeper into a few interesting facts about Almond Joy, it\u2019s\nimportant to give credit where it is due to the mother of the Almond Joy, Mounds. Mounds\nare very similar to the Almond Joy in nearly every way. However, the almond originally\nwasn\u2019t used when Mounds were created in 1920, leaving only the chocolate and coconut\nfilling. It would be 25 years before the demand for something new saw the addition of a popular\nnut and the Almond Joy was born. Unlike many chocolate brands who have dropped variations\noff over time, Almond Joy and Mounds have remained true competitors and friends in the\nmarket. As the popular retro commercials used to say - 'sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes\nyou don't'. With enough demand for both bars, Hershey has been able to continue production\nand satisfy demands since purchasing the company in the 1980s. In these difficult times, with\na slogan like \u201cUnwrap Paradise\u201d maybe we all just need a little more Almond Joy\nin our lives! Butterfinger In the race for the best baseball themed chocolate\nbar, the Baby Ruth is an easy choice to make. However, this close relative is an even more\ndelicious and arguably more popular chocolate bar to slide safely onto this list: the Butterfinger!\nThe hilarious name from this chocolate bar actually stemmed from a contest! Considering\nthat the manufacturers were already producing the Baby Ruth bar, executives marketed both\nbars by dropping them out of airplanes over cities in the 1920s. Although Butterfingers\nare rarely associated with baseball, these delicious peanut buttery chocolate bars are\nadored by candy fans. In fact, these bars are so valuable that in 2018 Ferrero Rocher\nbought the bar along with several other Nestle products for nearly $3 billion dollars! That\u2019s\na lot of cocoa! Although truly an American snack icon, perhaps no one loves the Butterfinger\nmore than one of America's most well recognized families, The Simpsons! Not only did Butterfinger\nhelp give the Simpsons a boost in popularity, as the characters appeared in a commercial\nbefore their own television slot, but the bar has also made guest appearances on the\nshow in recent years, including one of the popular Treehouse of Horror Halloween episodes.\nNothing beats a Butterfinger! Reese's Cups There is no doubt that one of the world\u2019s\nmost popular chocolate bars focuses on just two simple ingredients that are now known\nas soul mates: peanut butter and chocolate. Reese\u2019s cups were originally released to\nthe public in 1928. After good sales during WWII due to the fact that peanut butter was\nnot being rationed, Reese's cups continued to skyrocket to success. Their popularity\nincreased especially after their cousin Reese\u2019s Pieces was featured in the 1980s film E.T.\nThe Extra Terrestrial. Today, Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups are one of the world\u2019s most\nbeloved chocolate treats, accounting for almost 50% of seasonal sales. In fact, if every person\nfrom the US, China, Australia, India, and Europe wanted peanut butter cups, Reese's\nfactories make enough in a year to give each and every person one cup! That is a whole\nlot of peanut butter and chocolate! Nowadays, flavors from caramel, to crunchy, to dark\nchocolate and more are all available for purchase and that is just the beginning. Currently\non Reese's website, the public can submit suggestions for new flavors of Reese\u2019s cups!\nImagine the possibilities! Perhaps a peanut butter and jelly cup! Or maybe even a new\ncup entirely, with dark chocolate and a candy cane filling! For any fan who has thought\nthat they have had the perfect filling and cup idea, now is your time to shine! Twix So which one do you eat first? The left Twix\nor the right Twix? The idea that one side is better than the other when it comes to\nTwix bars is part of the company\u2019s genius marketing platform launched in 2013 in order\nto boost sales. Although there is no real difference between the two chocolate bars,\nthe campaign tells us how one side envelopes and the other side smothers the bar in chocolate,\nin describing how the left vs. right Twix bars are crafted. The advertisements even\nincluded a \u201chistorical backstory\u201d commercial to describe why the two bars are made so \u201cdrastically\ndifferently\u201d. Both bars are actually made of a biscuit interior with a layer of chewy\ncaramel and then covered in a smooth milk chocolate in exactly the same way. The true\nhistory of the name is really just a simple abbreviation of words. Instead of calling\nthe chocolate bar \u201cTwin Biscuit Sticks\u201d the name was shortened down to the popular\nand memorable \u201cTwix\u201d, which has to be one of the cutest names for a chocolate bar\naround! Before settling on the name Twix, some European fans may remember the chocolate\nbar being called \"Raider\" for many years. The \"Twix\" name was only changed once the\nbrand decided to venture into the United States. The taste is absolutely incredible and a perfect\noption for any date night, as each person gets their own chocolate! Win win! Just try\nto remember to actually share! You can still pick your favorite side. Milky Way It would be an absolute crime if this list\ndid not include one of the most iconic chocolate bars of all time: the Milky Way bar. There\u2019s\na reason that the cast of \u201cThis is the End\u201d finds themselves at odds over who deserves\nto eat potentially the last Milky Way bar on earth. These things are so creamy and delicious!\nWhat may be surprising to some, is that despite its popular use in American pop-culture, the\nU.S. version of the Milky Way bar, and the flavor that Americans are so accustomed to,\nis actually sold under another name worldwide. Although the Milky Way bar can be purchased\nglobally, the version sold in the United States is completely different to the international\nversion. While the American version of the bar features a caramel layer over a thick\nnougat and then draped in chocolate, the global version opts to remove the caramel and lighten\nthe nougat. These recipes may sound familiar to many, as on the global market, the Milky\nWay bar is actually sold as the \u201cMars\u201d bar and the international Milky Way bar recipe\nis sold in the US market under the name \u201c3 Musketeers\u201d. Confusing? Maybe. But luckily\nno matter what part of the world someone finds themselves in, they\u2019ll be able to get a\ntaste of some version of this light and tasty chocolaty nod to our galaxy. Snickers There may be no more well advertised chocolate\nbar in the world than the Snickers bar. In 2010, Snickers launched the \u201cYou\u2019re not\nyou when you\u2019re hungry\u201d campaign. The advertising campaign featured a wide range\nof celebrities with everyone from Betty White and Mr. T to Sir Elton John himself. The campaign\nfocuses on the idea of \u201changer\u201d which are those feelings of irritability commonly\nattributed to hunger. The campaign features a celebrity in an unusual role. Another character\nwill then offer a Snickers bar to the celebrity in question and after eating the bar, they\nimmediately revert back to their original self. Only after the hunger has been satisfied\nwith the taste of a Snickers bar is the scene set right. One such campaign featured Rowan\nAtkinson playing his star Mr. Bean character as a ninja. Only after Mr. Bean eats the Snickers\nbar does he return to his warrior self, enabling him to take on the troupe of enemies. The\ncampaign has been considered wildly successful, and in the first year of its use alone it\nwas able to boost sales globally by nearly 16%. This is a massive accomplishment for\nsuch an already well-established chocolate bar. With a wave of popularity like that,\nthe next time hanger has you down, reach for a Snickers! Kit Kat Whether talking among friends, checking out\nranking websites on the internet, or reading opinion pieces on the top chocolate bars of\nall time, at almost every turn, one encounters the beautiful red, glistening packaging of\nthe Kit Kat Bar. The light and beautiful textures of the wafer cookie layers, in smooth and\ncreamy milk chocolate sends fans through the roof when it comes to this chocolate bar.\nThis obsession starts at a young age as every child can remember digging through their Halloween\nbags in order to find just one more bite size Kit Kat treat. As fans grew up and their tastes\ndiversified, so did the flavor profiles of the Kit Kat bar itself, as the chocolatiers\nbehind this perfect confectionery worked tirelessly to develop new flavors. Although\u00a0the versatility\nof the Kit Kat may mean just about any flavor would taste good, it is the careful care and\nresearch that ensures every flavor of Kit Kat to hit store shelves is a guaranteed success.\nSince launching in 1935, Kit Kat has expanded to include flavors such as Dark Chocolate,\nOrange and Mint just to name very few. In Japan, the versatility of this bar, and its\nconnection to good luck, has meant that over 200 flavors have been created and sold! The\nnext time you\u2019re looking for a break, you know exactly which chocolate bar to grab. Dairy Milk The reason for both the name of the candy\nbar and it\u2019s creamy consistency can be attributed to one obvious ingredient: milk! At the time\nof Dairy Milk\u2019s creation, it was using far more milk in its processing than competitors,\nwhich in turn created a much more luxurious consistency that not only left a creamy and\nsweet taste on the tongue, but also a craving for another delightful bite! Apparently the\nAmerican market was actually fearful of just how amazing this chocolate tasted! In 2015,\na law was passed banning the import of the internationally made Cadbury chocolate, allowing\nHershey\u2019s to license and produce Dairy Milk in the US - although with a slightly altered\nrecipe. Considering that British Dairy Milk often beats out its competitors in blind taste\ntests, it\u2019s obvious why the US market would want to get in on the action and why the UK\nwas happy to keep their original chocolate stashed away! While many other nations are\nable to import the classic purple wrappers, not everyone may be familiar with the various\nflavor options. Fruit & Nut, Caramel, and Whole Nut (a hazelnut flavor) are some of\nthe tastiest varieties currently available for sale! Whether trying out an American or\na British version of the chocolate bar, you\u2019re already a winner because everyone loves a\ngood Dairy Milk!

gummies that's out but I forgot that I consumed the gummies and during the whole day I didn't really obviously I didn't feel anything really because I forgot that I even took um basically I didn't feel really much of anything maybe it's because of what I ate maybe because my maybe I should have a after maybe I know I ate after a wild learned later on that day but my shirt but time on how long I waited to eat but I think probably I ate too soon and I didn't make the hi I'm gonna make me hi didn't I bring the high up all the way but um I don't know I like some down on me because maybe I ate or I don't know my tolerance is too high I'm not trying to say that these gummies will not work for anyone else they just didn't work for me my tolerance is really high from marijuana you know so I mean like the next person they probably will work for you but with these do not work for me didn't taste that great they weren't delicious you're trying to get us give us someone that doesn't want but just

amigos and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode we are taking our second look at the kirova mini cookies that will soon be sweeping the edible nation we have already reviewed their saturday-morning many cookies and this time we are coming at you with the chocolate chip mini cookies available for 10 bucks at most dispensaries a pretty decent value another huge package if you watch my first review on this really my only complaint was the amount of stuff that you have to eat if you want to eat the whole package I know it's designed to be ten servings but let's be honest a lot of us are going to be eating the whole package and there are ten little mini cookies in here and it's a lot to get through fancy packaging really like the packaging outside of the [ __ ] child resistant zipper which is a practical impossibility for me to get open I'm just gonna cut these open with scissors and get right into it I really like the taste of the Saturday morning cookies the chocolate chip cookie I've had one of they're like regular chocolate chip cookies in the past it's not my favorite but it's not terrible by any stretch of the imagination so we'll see how the mini cookies fare let's go ahead and cut into them give them a taste here see how we're gonna like them again I would recommend have some scissors already if you're gonna get these bad boys so here we are here are their adorable little mini cookies they seem smaller than the sorry morning cookies but that could be just a mistake in my brain just pop it in the old mouth okay about what I remember be regular kirova chocolate-chip-cookie like hey les the cookie is way softer than the Saturday morning cookie way way softer and an ever so slight cannabis taste to it but not bad mostly just a okay chocolate chip cookie um I preferred the Saturday morning cookie to these in terms of taste but but these aren't bad so guys I'm gonna eat what eight more some two [ __ ] and I will see you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process not how it tastes but how it makes you feel so guys I'll see you in two hours to let you know thanks for watching peace two hours have passed and I am back welcome to weed skies and we are talking kirova mini cookies chocolate chip cookies hundred milligrams ten servings each oh they're good they're good I'm at maybe a about a six now maybe five and a half somewhere in there so you know about what you would expect for a hundred milligram product it may be a little bit higher than the traditional hundred milligrams ten bucks pretty good value cases okay they weren't my favorite I again prefer the saturday-morning many cookies in that regard but I in this new edible future that we're all going to have of this hundred milligram limit here in California these are probably going to still be top tier I'm definitely looking forward to finding some more of the new generation of edibles to review I'm hoping and assuming that Korova will still be a quality brand in the future I like the way the packaging is designed except for the terrible child-resistant stuff it's just so difficult to open but i understand they have to do it again to keep up with the regulations but on that I think the packaging is still quite handsome and I do like the additional information on the back of having like ingredients and nutritional information and all that fun stuff didn't really have that before so good to see it on there so yeah that's gonna be another thumbs up for me of the new generation of Korova reviews or edibles excuse me still it is not as good as their current edibles that they have out there there are 150 s 250 s yada yada yada so on and so forth stock up on those because those are going to be better values for sure if your dispensary still carries those and these grab the original line first but you know if they only have these you know it'll it won't it won't kill you and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always thanks for watching peace", "cmLmf5v9u0g": "hey guys thanks for watching we're doing edible reviews here on edible expertise um with cannabis being legal in um chicagoland area and and growing to the rest of the united states there's so many emerging players in this market today that we want to not really know what's going on so um we're reviewing the new terabytes today from kiva confections these are the chocolate covered blueberries i got them at new era dispensary down the street on north avenue in chicago check them out for you know your next your next run um but these actually these costs about 40 20 of these come in the 10 and they're 5 milligrams of thc each we're going to give it a taste and come back and see what effect it has so first glances here you can see that all the chocolate covered blueberries are in there um not a bad size not a bad size you know i'm looking for something that tastes good right but um [Music] we're gonna we're gonna see how this goes so let's let's give it a taste [Music] so first initial thoughts really chocolatey um nice and soft too um really good blueberry field blueberry sorry can you top really good blueberry taste as well um overall one of the top tasting edibles i've had and i've had a lot of edibles recently with it being legal in chicagoland area so not bad not bad um so we're gonna wait about an hour and come back and and see how i feel um because you know sometimes i've had 5 milligrams of thc you know i'm gone and then other times i can't feel things so we're going to see how i feel when we get back what's up guys so it's been about 55 minutes since we've taken the five milligram thc edible now again i i take it about i take i take edibles you know almost every day so it's different effect on me depending on the day it's been a while since i've had an edible but yeah this is giving me pretty high feeling it's uh it's hard to explain obviously but uh yeah good a good effect i would definitely recommend uh this is and now i'm gonna go watch some some movies or something but yeah take care", "qaufnL2w7WE": "[Music] hey homies welcome back to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking another look at an edible product we're back to the edibles today and today we are taking our second look at a product from moon cannabis infused moon intergalactic milligram ajmer ajmer image we're taking a look at their spearmint mint hybrid chocolate bar today it is compliant with the new regulations in his 10 10 milligram pieces the packaging is pretty cheap it's just stickers on this little childproof ziplock baggie here so it's just like a little ziploc bag with a moon sticker on the front and then on the back it's got all the nutrition information all of the allergy information yadda yadda yadda so on and so forth and then it shows you the 10 milligram edge breakdown for the bar there on the back which you can see we're going to ignore that and just eat the whole bar because that's the way we do it here on wheats so as I said I've reviewed moon once before and I thought the product was pretty good the first time I tried it this is the second opportunity of I have had I found this at my dispensary here in Long Beach for 10 bucks so a little bit expensive for a about in range for a hundred milligram edible but it is a pretty in substantially sized product which I actually kind of like there's not a lot to it it's very light product there's actually only a hundred calories in whole on this whole thing so a lot better I don't have any ten Grove and Minnie cookies in that regard but yeah it doesn't feel like a very big hefty value for your money but that's can be deceiving now I got this new childproof Ziploc packaging here and I got to figure out how to open it because it's not very simple it might be scissors time boy I might be too stupid for childproof packaging guys I would say it's definitely scissors time as I just destroyed it I'll be right back guys gotta go run and grab some scissors see in just second points against you moon I'm back and it hasn't even been two hours let's just cut through this [ __ ] packaging I really really really dislike this packaging holy crap okay I did manage to cut through it thick stuff hmm and here is our spearmint Bart I like it the way it looks it's got some green sort of Jackson Pollock II hate splashy looking things on it with some some kind of interesting shapes they're etched in it I can't really tell what those are but it's cool smells great smells like mint chocolate and it is as I said very in substantial feeling which I like in my eyes I don't like I meet a whole lot of something so this is 100 milligrams seems pretty good to me so let's stop with the yep and get with the tasting hmm it's like if you've ever had an Andes mint before the little pinch that little mints that they leave on your pillows sometimes it like hotels or after-dinner mints the little green foil-wrapped tiny little trapezoidal shape mints that's exactly what this tastes like perhaps not quite as good as an Andes mint it's so good no real canvas taste to it maybe slightly more than happy to eat this whole thing um no problem actually vaguely enjoyable so and the taste front very happy with the moon intergalactic milligrams basement bar cut as we always know here on weeks it's not about how it tastes it's not about how it's packaged it's not about the way it looks it's about how it makes you feel and for that guys you're gonna have to wait just a couple of seconds me however I'm gonna wait two hours see how it hits and I'll come back to you guys and let you know for sure thanks for watching weeks and I'll see you guys in just a bit peace welcome back to wheats we are here to talk about my thoughts on the moon intergalactic milligram \u00e4j-- space mint hybrid chocolate bar and this guy's is gonna get a love from me but I do have to apologize can I am NOT coming back to you two hours later I am coming back to you many hours later this little guy here it caused me to take a nap a wonderful wonderful restful blissful map I really like this one guys um it got me up to the sort of eight level of Highness tasted great a nice small discreet edible and that you didn't have to eat a lot to get high and it didn't have any kind of cannabis taste I actually liked the way it looked with that green speckles in it packagings not my favorite packaging but that really is about the worst thing I say about it um I'm really quite happy with the mood inter-galactic milligram pigeon I will definitely trying some more stuff from moon I know they've got a lot of products and a lot of very different sounding products and it's not just you know cookies and brownies they've got a lot of different things so I am looking forward to trying some more moon and again guys sorry it might get into Sydney hi because I passed out I fell asleep gonna pass out I fell asleep and I'm coming back to you just a little bit later than normal to let you know my thoughts here on the moon spaceman hybrid chocolate bar this guy's is a big thumbs up for me if you see this one at your dispensary and you like the mint flavored things give it a try I think you're gonna be happy with it and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you

"ZLpZxkFB2-8": "[Music] what is up my friends and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary uh and on today's review I've got the spatula the wheat sworn spatula and the trusty jar of Nutella that means that we are reviewing something that does not have fat in it because THC and fat go hand-in-hand so we're reviewing today we are taking our third look I've reviewed two of these this type excuse-me of edible and past Oh or I guess you would call it an ingestible cuz it's not necessarily edible per se so we are taking a look at th C capsules medicinal softgels today this is our look at the pro canna THC plus hundred milligrams 250 milligrams soft gels as i said i've reviewed two caps in the past both of those were 300 milligrams one was pretty good the the if it was delta-9 yes the delta nine capsules were good I enjoyed them they were a little expensive I believe they cost thirty bucks for the 300 milligrams and then there was also I think it was the gold caps which were also 300 milligrams which were 50 bucks I believe and they were completely terrible they didn't do anything at all to me so I've got a hundred milligrams this time so less than the others but this was a more affordable price I guess linearly it's the same price as the delta nine as it was ten bucks for the two of the hundred milligram pack so you know it's the technically the same price but certainly a lot better price wise than the gold caps pretty simple little packaging here just a cardboard box with some you know directions there on the back advising that we consult a doctor before taking pro kanna don't know why doctor is capitalized there let's go and open up see what these look like uh-oh they are weirdly shaped so here we go here is one of the capsules right here in this little package they're ugly little capsule first let's do a little bit of the good old and Nutella my favorite part of all fat-free reviews is getting a nice scoopful a Nutella yum yum yum yum yum yum who doesn't love Nutella heartless folks that's him okay so that should hopefully be enough back for now and let's go ahead and plunk this in forgot to bring my handy trusty Arnold Palmer tea with me so I'm just gonna have to dry chuckle I swallow that's the word for it so let's do it three two one down the hatch got one more here three two one down the hatch okay well so I've had both the pillows now that's 100 milligrams of THC or so they say now in my body with the requisite amount of fat to help activate it now all we're gonna do is our for me I'm gonna wait two hours for you guys through the magic of editing it'll be just a couple of seconds and I'll let you know how these pro can uh THC caps are hitting in just about two hours so thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours for me since I had the pro canna THC soft gels and let's do a little ocular test Whitis [ __ ] snow I don't know I want to let me say this right off the bat I want to love THC capsules I love the idea of them I love something that's discreet easy to take doesn't have any calories with it way of ingesting THC but these suck these didn't do anything for me I I mean it's I don't feel high at all nothing so in terms of what I have tried these are down there with gold caps they're not as good as the delta-9 obviously those got me at least you know somewhat high this is just a real [ __ ] product I don't know if it's on me oh and this time I also try it with fats I had had people in the bat before asked me like well maybe you need to try it with fat which I should have done anyways tried it with fat and still no result um I feel like I could you know if I was if I was a gymnast I feel like I could perform gymnastics if I was a mathematician I feel like I could perform some differential equations but I'm just a stupid idiot and I still feel like I can function as a stupid idiot even after two hours on the THC plus from poke pro canna man again guys I cannot articulate enough I would love for these to be the magic bullet you know an easy discreet portable way of getting THC with into your body that isn't either smoking vaping or having to consume something with a lot of sugar and calories I keep hoping for it I I don't think I'll be going back to pro kanna next time I have to review but I think I'm gonna keep trying to find that magic capsule out there to see if any of them work I'll do a couple more maybe maybe they're just not for me maybe there's something about mean that they just I just doesn't work as an ingestion method I would love to hear from you guys if you know any good capsule brands or if they work well for you please let me know leave a comment below or send me an email at wheats at wheats reviews.com and let me know what you think about these capsules because I'm trying to find a great one I'm hoping to find something that you know I can take with me to the airport something I can you know take with me into a concert you know that's not going to draw any attention to itself but so far of the three I've taken this I don't know if it's necessary worse than gold caps but it's not definitely not any better so far if you definitely want capsules stick with the Delta nine they're still not great they're still not my favorite way to ingest THC but definitely skip out on the procane a total dud of a product look at the [ __ ] back there that is the category that it's in and I am now just rambling so with that guys I am going to sign off from this review and that is going to do it for pro canna here on wheats thank you so much for watching guys and we will see you on our next review peace", "ShRai5Wnvg0": "Hey guys! It's Melena at Remedy Review,\nand today I'm gonna be trying Rosebud CBD chocolate. So, Valentine's Day is\nright around the corner, and I thought that there would be no\nbetter time than to try Rosebud CBD chocolate for myself. I've actually never\ntried any kind of CBD chocolate before, so I'm really excited to try theirs.\nThere's a hundred milligrams of full spectrum CBD in this entire bar, and it's\ndark chocolate which is my personal favorite so I'm very excited to try it.\nAnd even the top of the box right as you open it says things are about to get\ngood so let's hope so. Oh, this is super cute\nand it smells really good, too! Smells just like any regular dark chocolate\nthat you would get, and I think it's adorable. And now for the best part of\nthis video, I get to eat some chocolate so... oh yeah tastes just like any other\nregular dark chocolate there's no like cannabis or hemp flavor which is great\npretty much just melts in your mouth. So, yeah I'm definitely gonna be buying\nanother one of these bars for myself. That's pretty f---- good but honestly that's\npretty damn good not gonna lie. Oh, wait I think I just got a tinge of like weed\nlike this slightest hint it's gone now but it was like one touch don't know\nyeah I figured at this point that's not making it in there... Just eats the whole chocolate. So, let's\ntalk pricing. These chocolate bars currently cost around $22 on Rosebud's\nwebsite which is a little on the higher end, but they're vegan gluten-free and\nthey really have a luxury feel to them. Plus, they taste great so you can't go\nwrong. And from now until February 14th, you can buy one get one half off on\nRosebud's website so you can buy one for yourself or for a loved one or you can\nkeep both of them which is probably what I'll be doing and just eating them by\nyourself... this s--- is working I swear to God! Anyway, okay, so to wrap things up I\nreally enjoyed trying the CBD chocolate bar. I definitely think it's already\nstarted to work a little bit making these videos it's pretty nerve-wracking\nbut I feel pretty calm now so no trouble! And I would definitely recommend this to\nanyone that wants to try a CBD chocolate. This is the first one I've\never tried, and I really enjoyed it. I'll definitely be trying more in the future,\nalthough I don't know if any of them will really quite stack up to this one.\nAnd yeah I really enjoyed Rosebud as a brand, and you can stay tuned for more\nreviews on their products in the future!", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the kirova Saturday morning cookie thanks for watching [Music]", "txZvghp1mmE": "[Music] Rick with the best of everything let's take a look at the better than coffee energy bars just came in see if their energy bars or envelopes better than coffee this contained chicory ba and ma guano and maca or South American herbs the energy bars labeled was a net weight of 0.88 houses two are on 28 8 grams ekeus 0.88 houses he goes 25 grams when it was twenty five point seven one one five seven six 26.2 4 that's a real fat one this will separate out and make a nice little countertop dispenser put it in the cabinet anyway and our energy bar this one is twenty five point seven six grams so the Burano that contains about double the caffeine as coffee in Brazil South American stand very common to see Verona suckers velocity little chewy bar looking thing it smells very much like coffee of course the flavor on this is French Roast so it does also contain coffee powder smells pretty good your chewy bite and it's a bitter so that will be the maka we choked er there's dark chocolate  a maca root war uh no taste that coconut fiber and taste that actually knock down that bad now I've tried some of those sports grain bars that were really horrible this is so kind of tasty actually I

we'll take a look at my methods for making medals including peppermint bark cereal bars coconut oil gummies hard candies candy cap stash a lot of an mar leave a comment below with your favorite edibles for medicating and what your optimal dose is I find mine ranges from about 40 milligrams up to 250 milligrams of total cannabinoids I've had several requests lately for the peppermint bark I made around Christmas time and although we're well into the new year now i do have footage of the process so i figured i'd finally share it it's a very simple recipe that anyone can make at home as long as you have some sort of hash available you can probably infuse butter or coconut oil and mix that into the chocolate but i find that bubble hash dry sift or oven purged BHO works best just don't forget to d carboxylate your hash i prefer to go with 25 minutes at 225 degrees fahrenheit speaking of what works best this might just be my personal preference but this white chocolate classic recipe from lint works perfectly it's very creamy carries the flavor of your terpenes and it's all around great for baking and making chocolates their milk chocolate is great as well but if you're trying to capture either the flavor of your cannabis or the flavor of the other elements of your recipe which is peppermint in this case I would recommend sticking with the white chocolate while you could just crush up a bunch of candy canes I found these 9 ounce containers of crushed peppermint candy and decided to use them I will be mixing the candy in with the chocolate to give it some texture as well as sprinkling it across the top for better handling and bag appeal our third and final ingredient is of course our hash as I mentioned before I use a variety of hash form edibles and they all test differently in cannabinoid potency our dry sip comes out at around fifty five percent toll cannabinoids bubble hash at around sixty-five percent and BHO comes in at anywhere from sixty five percent to upwards of eighty percent since we're talking what I call food grade BHO and we're only focusing on THC I find you can estimate the final potency to be around fifty five percent we're talking formuoli that means we take our total weight of our hash and milligrams multiply that by fifty five percent or 0.55 and you get the total potency of that batch for example let's assume we have ten grams of BHO to make medibles with or ten thousand milligrams if we multiply that by 0.55 we get five thousand five hundred milligrams now that we have our total available cannabinoid potency we can decide how many medals to make based on her dosage keeping it 100 milligrams makes it easy so if we divide five thousand five hundred milligrams by 100 milligrams we can make precisely 55 doses now this is sort of a backwards way of calculating the recipe but it should give you an understanding of how we determine dosage what it leaves out is the entire rest of your metal bowl recipes this time the chocolate and peppermint candy if you don't take into consideration the weight or volume of your other materials you could end up either only having tiny bite-size pieces that are incredibly potent believe you somewhat unsatisfied or has to eat half a dozen brownies just to get the effect here are looking for depending on your recipe the letter could result in some rather unhealthy eating while the former might result in some very heavy sleep since these chocolate bars i am using our 125 grams each i decided to shoot for about 40 grams of chocolate per 100 milligram dose now that we've decided on our ingredients and calculated our estimated dosage we can move forward with cooking as you have already seen I unwrapped broke up and place all of my chocolate bars into my crock-pot it is important to keep it on low and slowly melt your chocolate so you do not burn it stirring often will help but generally speaking as soon as a portion of your batch burn the entire thing is going to taste awful once your chocolate is melted dump in your BHO dry sift or whatever hash you're using make sure you mix it very well so you can get even doses in the end it is important to get a consistent amount in each edible so you do not over or under dose each serving once I am confident that everything is thoroughly blended I mix around half of my crushed peppermint candy pieces into the chocolate as soon as the candy is blended it's time to pour the batch into your molds I would highly recommend using silicone molds for individual chocolates but a large cookie sheet works perfectly for the bark style chocolate just pour your chocolate candy BHO mix into the cookie sheet spread it evenly then sprinkle the rest of your peppermint candy across the top after about 15 to 30 minutes in the fridge it will be hard enough to simply break up into smaller pieces unfortunately I didn't end up filming that portion of the process but I do have a couple pictures to share make sure you work quickly using gloves and in a cool environment if possible this chocolate will melt in your hands and your mouth so store it in your fridge until you are ready to enjoy it I decided to make these again to get the finished product itself tested at the lab I shot for a slightly higher potency but since we have results we can control the serving size precisely and here they are from psi labs my 51 gram sample resulted in about 138 milligrams of THC if you wanted to portion this into a serving that resulted in exactly one hundred milligrams of THC we just plug our numbers back into the formuoli if we take a hundred and thirty eight milligrams and divide that by 51 grams we see that each gram of peppermint bark contains two point seven milligrams of THC now while we must do is divide our desired dose of 100 milligrams by two point seven milligrams and we determined that we need 37 grams of peppermint bark / quote-unquote 100 milligrams serving this peppermint bark has quickly become a favorite of my patients as well as my own and while it definitely seems to be Christmas themed I know I can infuse other candy into chocolates to come up with all sorts of holiday oriented chocolate bark so this really is something you can make year-round what is your favorite edible recipe do you like chocolate sand canyon or do you prefer to cook with infused butter or oils some same edibles have never worked for them has that been the case for you let me know in the comments below thanks for watching this episode of the fregoli formula lee give it a thumbs up subscribe if you haven't already check

lis throwing around these scissors and I've got scissors in my hand not because I'm reviewing scissors I'm sure that there probably is a market out there for somebody who wants to review scissors no I've got scissors because I'm here to open a tough package one that I knew I'm gonna have trouble with but one that I am excited for because it is my one of my favorite kinds of edibles and that is the chocolate bar ooh the Sun is making that very difficult to see bad son bad bad son la familia it's the product of Los Angeles the mint flavor I read all the Spanish in English oh it looks like there's like four years of Spanish paid off so this is the la familia de la I almost said that terribly mint to flavor 200 milligrams of THC really that is quite obnoxious how that shows up they're very thin curtains I have um very simple packaging on this it's just like a little aluminum wrapper on this green kind of iridescent packaging you can feel not much to it again just like a sticker on an aluminum packaging it does have nutrition facts and ingredients on the back which is great but no lab test results so this is came from a black market or gray market dispensary in California because we all we all know all legal edibles are now 100 milligram edibles topped and they have to be ten servings or more this is an old-school 200 don't give a [ __ ] how many servings so let's go ahead and cut open the top here take a look at this chocolate bar give it a taste and if you've never tuned in before and if you have tuna before you must really [ __ ] hate here this by now but if you haven't the way of the reviews work here on weeds is I'm gonna eat a little bit of this here in front of you not necessarily the whole thing because I don't want to bore you to death but rest assured I'll eat this whole thing and then after I finish it I will come back to you guys in another two hours write us about when you'd be peaking to let you know how the product is actually hitting because that's what you're really in it for that's what you really care about is you know is it really gonna make you is it really gonna work not so much how it tastes okay Wow a very basic looking chocolate bar here totally basic it doesn't even have like an imprint with their logo on it or anything it is just what 12 squares of or twelve rectangles of chocolate I'm not gonna break it off into single rectangles let's just give it bite on three it smells like no I don't really detect a cannabis odor to it definitely a mint odor I'm a fan of mint chocolate I know there are a lot of mint chocolate haters out there I don't understand that but teach their own okay that's pretty good chocolate I'm decent quality chocolate for sure the mint flavor is not overwhelming I've definitely had some mint chocolates that are way more minty flavor more of a hint of mint here which is nice really no cannabis tasting I can't really detect much of any no hmm well what I hope that means is the chocolate is excessively masking the flavor of the cannabis and not that there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there mmm I never got to mention I picked this up on at the dispensary that I mentioned for $17 I believe which is two dollars more than they charge for a two hundred and thirty sixty milligram delta-9 which are excellent so high expectations for the la familia mint 200 milligrams here well guys I'm gonna eat another nine squares of this and then I will be back to you as I said in two hours let you know how it's hitting thanks for watching weights guys see in just a bit peace [Music] it's two hours later hi guys welcome back uh it has been 2 hours since I had the la familia and that still does not show up very well on this camera and I apologize for that there's a little bit of a better angle and the familiar the family that la familia is together families together is my review the end no my more elaborate view is it's pretty good it's not the most potent chocolate bar I've ever had chocolate bars are usually I believe the strongest and best vector for THC this one doesn't feel like a - like a kiva equivalent to me certainly not not even close really but it's still pretty good I'm at about a 6 right now some somewhere in that range so it's not you know terrible I've had 200 milligram edibles that are way worse and it didn't it tasted pretty good there's really no cannabis taste so you know on the whole I it's not the best you know there are certainly better chocolate bars out there I still would even probably recommend one of the new Kiva 100 milligrams over this la familia 200 milligram but if it's although your dispensary has and you like the chocolate bars this one's got a good taste it'll still do the job it's just probably not honest about that 200 milligrams would be my guess so if you have no other options and you like chocolate grab it otherwise go with one of the better brands pick up a kiva pick up a default say even probably a chill that one doesn't taste as good but I think it's more potent so stick with the bit the bit better brands if you can otherwise la familia is not a bad alternative and that is gonna do it for this review and before I go I'm gonna give you a very quick cherry on top guys just a soup quick little cherry on top something just so delightful and hairy I'll get you out of here real quick and that is cursing swearing profanity I mean I've been profanity since before my teenage years [ __ ] I [ __ ] love cursing it's the [ __ ] [ __ ] damn [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] it's great um if you if you don't curse a lot you should curse more if you don't curse at all what the [ __ ] is wrong with you cursing is the best the science is on my side you know they say that people who curse are more intelligent they're more honest they're more empathetic I've read that they actually have bigger dongs and that they're also better lovers to that I most of those are things that I've read so uh curse say [ __ ] a lot you'll like it la familia it's not that shitty thank you for sticking around to the end of this cherry on top thank you for sticking tuned to the end of this review appreciated Alice always guys it's been a [ __ ] blast see on the next week's peace", "H5f073sUB6k": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to week two the marijuana edible review show where we

reviewed any of their this this one on any level before but I'm excited to do it because I love these kind of things and that's Kanako's 100 milligram lemon bar that's right 100 milligram lemon bar from canna Co super super excited I've loved every single can of coke product I've reviewed I've loved every milligram egde I've reviewed from them 100 250 and 500 although the 500s are definitely too strong for me to do in one go but I've done it before watch the video yeah so I'm super excited about this as I said I love love lemon bars too so I'm really looking forward to this one let's a look at the back of the box here I've already opened it up just a little bit to make this a little bit easier on me as we've got our back of the package here 440 calories for the whole thing the pure experience and lemon bar says on the front here delicious sugar cookie crust layered with lemon filling topped with vanilla icing and finished with refreshing lemon zest sounds awesome let's go ahead and get right into it here just a second and here we go here is the lemon bar a handsome product if I've ever seen one there's the sugar cookie crust the lemon filling and that baller-ass looking vanilla icing it's big it's very big much bigger than I thought it was going to be it weighs quite a bit it feels quite heavy let's go ahead and give it a bite there's a quality lemon bar mmm good

just a bit peace hi guys it's been Oh actually a little bit longer than two hours I must confess I accidentally took a nap in between this review which might have tested the power of the product of the Kanak Oh a lemon bar 100 milligram that I felt it necessary to take a nap in between the the review there I enjoyed the product quite a bit I loved how it tasted absolutely left how it tasted and it got me up to like a solid six half maybe from a hundred milligram at a bull which is just I mean it's just ridiculous it's incredible as all kind of coat products seem to be I love them all this is definitely no exception for me I love love love the lemon bar 100 milligrams even at 100 milligrams it got me really really high so I'm completely pleased with it oh I believe it cost me ten bucks at my dispensary so an utterly affordable edible as well if you see one at a dispensary and you like the lemon bars do not hesitate to grab one you will certainly be happy you did that is again the Kanak Oh lemon bar 100 milligrams thank you so much for watching wheats guys and we will check you out on the next review peace I'm not gonna throw that at this camera", "QwuSYP_-YFo": "[Music] hey guys

this I don't feel that I'm wait about two hours and come back and let you guys know how I feel it it tastes really delicious it did taste like weed not like overpowering like disgusting you know weed flavor but it is a clicker good you do taste of marijuana it's not overpowering where it's like completely gross but you do taste it they know it's gonna be an edible cuz they're gonna taste it not super strong but they're gonna taste that [ __ ] how they held it the right amount continue on South Fairview Street for four miles strawberry cheesecake he's really good know how I feel about an hour - okay so all right so head ease towards South Fairview Street head east towards South Fairview Street head north on South Huron drive Ford South Fairview Street in 400 feet turn right [Music] the second hour I still feel it turn left onto West Pendleton Avenue then turn right onto South Fairview Street [Music] turn continued on South Fairview Street for two miles [Music] someone doesn't smoke after the locker you know bring their faces there's a part of me really advanced for you okay nothing a little time thank feet I know I know my diary I know mostly the edibles make me indoors little feet rise slowly and an email heels battle but I was very curious I guess", "4PktvUEGyT0": "yo what is up everybody it's a good day to smoke today welcome to the sesh everybody thank you for clicking on my video i hope you drop a like if you did enjoy it i believe that's all let's get into some [ __ ] so after i got out of work today i went and stopped by a dispensary canna rx we got a few things so let me go through this and then we'll get to smoking don't you worry so first thing i got i'm gonna try out for you guys we got a um froot loops medicated cereal bar bro this [ __ ] looks good well i've actually had them before so i know they are good but yeah as you guys can see you got a hundred milligrams in that so that'll be good i'm gonna eat that and i'm gonna cut the video after i'm done smoking and i'm gonna come back later and you know we'll see how baked i am after this and smoking some weed free pre-roll came with the purchase let's look at that damn y'all looking pretty good last thing i grabbed this wasn't actually i didn't get this today i got this yesterday or the day before that but i got some batter this is some caramel candy kush but i've smoked a little bit of this uh we're gonna hit it out of my um nectar collector thing but yeah as you guys would you look at this it almost looks like caramel but um yeah it's some some gassy stuff it smells so damn good yeah i uh i recently got some diamonds i actually want to show you guys some diamonds sometime soon uh i meant to make a video on it the only thing is that i think i want to get a new uh rig or maybe even a puffco or peak peak puffco um because those are so much easier like when you have diamonds like they're just kind of like loose in this thing and it's so much easier to just like drop them in something like a banger or like a puffco um when i try hitting it with this it's so annoying like i'll try like you know try to like touch the rock with it and then it'll like suck the whole rock it'll like stick to the end and then you like get way too much or waste a bunch it's it's a little annoying so i got some batter this time just to be safe but you know it's some good [ __ ] still i forgot if you guys get pre-rolls it's a good idea to just kind of roll them in your hand not too rough but just uh you know gentle to like loosen up the weed make sure there's airflow because there's been plenty of times where i've gotten pre-rolls from dispensaries and they're just like packed airtight and they just sit there and smoke it's basically a wheat incent you're not getting anything it's a little annoying um y'all this is so good like there's nothing like working all day like an eight to like 10 hour long day and then you come home you haven't smoked it all that day and you just you spark up and it feels so damn good it's just um that explains the [ __ ] guys she's canoeing a little bit real quick for those of you who don't know how to fix canoes you know maybe best way to do it you know if you just want to smoke it you don't have a lighter keep hitting it but keep the paper side up so that the heat rises and burns that quicker hopefully um other way you know just light it a little light it from the underside i just kind of like even it out i mean you probably waste like a little bit of weed but it's it's worth kind of trying to get it back to like an even burn yeah i hope you guys are smoking with me drop in the comments how you're smoking you know smoking some dab some shatter blunt whatever the [ __ ] it is let me know because i'm curious and i want to know [Music] all right i'm gonna put that down for a second let's take a dab y'all let's get [ __ ] up this thing ain't doing it quick enough oh man that hit different i'm feeling good now that just like set me that set the pace for the rest of this video oh so yo the craziest [ __ ] happened this morning you guys little mini story here not like a big story it's not gonna be like the point of this video but on the way to work this morning so i got up right right well when my alarm went off i initially like woke up and it was one of those things where it was like man i just need to sleep for five more minutes just five more minutes i just i literally just closed my eyes closed my eyes for a second then like i woke up and i had to be to work in 10 minutes so you know like i got ready and [ __ ] super quick start bolting my ass over there and uh i live in maine for those of you who don't know but it's like uh in i'm in like a town not really a city so it's just a shitload of back roads everywhere so i'm taking back roads to work and on the way to work i come around this corner you know i think the road is like 40 or some [ __ ] i'm doing at least 60. just cruising and uh yeah i i so i see this cop right like i'm i'm going around the corner i see the cop my [ __ ] heart drops dude i just start like whenever i see a cop and like times that i have gotten a ticket before bro all this [ __ ] just like runs through my head in like a second like oh dude i'm gonna lose a bunch of money i'm gonna get a ticket i'm gonna lose my license i'm gonna like just like all this bad [ __ ] and then you know my heart drops and i look back he flashed his lights but he only flashed him for like a second or two and then i was just you know i was like oh [ __ ] so i don't know i don't know if he was warning me or if he was like doing that to signal like yo i'm stopping you but you know like i said i was on some back roads right so as i see him do that you know he takes a left into like some old uh car junkyard or maybe it was like a used car place a shitload of cars everywhere some of them were shitty some of them were like decent looking but he pulls in there and that was the last thing i see i go up over a hill and i'm just like [ __ ] [ __ ] like i'm already like running late to work and now i'm about to get pulled over and all this [ __ ] and oh [ __ ] i just dropped so after that

got here because this review is ain't restricted let's go what's going on guys I'm sorry qez welcome back to sarcastic first time here thank you for coming by hopefully by the end of this review you want consider subscribing I'm telling off this price tag but I'm gonna still keep it I want to give a shout out to my coworker J Capone for spreading the love with this edible I've had a falling out of this kind but we're gonna do this and I'm like Jesus alright so shoutout to proper edibles yes this is from companies called proper edibles and this is the original and it is a 100 milligrams full spectrum CBD that is the best thing to full spectrum yes now I was kind of skeptical this is off it's a 14 gram protein bar and if anyone's ever had protein it takes dusty it's it's a great it's like a grainy like it's rough it's rough so I'm like oh God so I'm like between the CBD and the protein I'm like please Jesus great this enjoyable now in here the flavors that I should be getting from in this is chocolate honey and peanut butter that's a mixture oh my god oh my god now this is $20 I mean it's probably I mean that's what the price is I need a saucepan and 20 bucks on the back our mission is to provide low-cost high-quality CBD edibles using nutritious ingredients without cutting corners ingredients so if you have allergies be careful honey peanut butter away walnuts organic coconut oil organic oats organic banana chips organic hemp derived cannabis oil this is organic now serving size one square two squares per container looking on this side what I screen captured it because of what it said I'm like how what's the dosage she's supposed to take it is my thing is like a look then I screenshot this each packet is two squares each square contains 50 milligrams that's nothing but it's edible I mean again I've had edible not every little CD about ever you can easily cut a square in half for variety or dos tres so we're gonna pop this in and come back and I'll see what was that nuts was just falling off of it I smell stuff if I eat it oh I smell I smell the chocolate and peanut butter in the protein how come I smell the protein I'll tell you protein so you can see its idea so you can see it has nothing there which is pretty cool you can see the nuts in there but it would be nice if they go what's called a blend didn't make it smooth Jesus I'm gonna do not bad you're not you get a little bit of the protein taste but it tastes more like granola like it's hot it tastes like a granola bar I guess that's the honey in it and the nuts yeah it's not bad you know I'm eating the whole thing yeah you're gonna see how it feel you're taking a little bit of the CBD a little bit that's not not bad cuz everything the balance is really nice but you do take this even you know it's there but you're gonna have like a granola type kind of you know granola bar but are you good on you you get that protein in there but everything else is helping to you know keep that grittiness away you gonna see what happen so usually like sometimes some edible and stuff it would say have it then like give it a some minutes or hours to have to take effect you don't have any instructions on how long so we won't see him what's done 7:16 I'm gonna come back at 7:30 yo I've turned off the camera look what time it is I turned the camera is about to get up to go wash the dishes I was like oh wait a minute I think it's kicking in a little bit again okay I mean it has how much pieces they say yeah one square two squares for container okay so - so you can tie them I mean cuz it's yeah it's effective it's a it's a relaxation I'm feeling nice kind of it's a little buzz but it's good okay come to Papa edibles yeah it's like over my head if I thought CBD you know usually affects me this is really nice I'm glad that again it wasn't really protein eh tasting I made it it wasn't protein eh tasted and yes it tastes like a granola bar it taste this the chocolates dinner but you know it's a good bread this is the night this is a good product I was actually recommended and I was like the $20 the leg little girl all right shot I began to drink a pone and proper edibles we'll put the link down below check them out oh let's see it again for washing dishes and I'm out", "2VNYCOaQFSY": "[Music] hopefully 71 the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this web view we are taking a look at the final product to review from a cushy punch their 100 milligram sativa variety flavor is strawberries the strawberry 100 milligram sativa variety of cushy punch we've looked at their 200 milligram TK o which I found to be kind of lacking and then we looked at their 100 milligram indica and in an experiment we also look at the 100 milligram hybrids and I found both of those to be not too bad so I hope that this is on the better end of the cushy punch I hope it's as good as the other two 100 milligrams I found those to be much better than the 200 milligram sort of surprisingly I would just go with 100 milligrams in terms of cost because I think it's about just about as potent as its 200 milligram brother so without further ado let's going to open this up and eat her down and what's gonna happen after that guys after I finish this I'm going to come back to you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part about the edible review not necessarily how it tastes but more about how it actually makes you feel so here we go looks like a like a little jam packet or a little jelly packet or a little butter packet it's got four little blocks in there and after we get it plopped out you can see it with its four a little squares but we're going to ignore the little squares there just plug the whole thing in my mouth and one go mmm not bad definitely a little bit of what we taste so much better than the infused creations or the what's the other one I can't remember the name off the top my head but any of those ones that are just like the gummy bears with the basically just like THC oil sprinkled on the outside this is a lot better this is more like the flourish although I don't think it's quite as good as the flourish so now that I've slurped it down I'm gonna wait two hours to see how I'm gonna feel you guys however have to just wait a couple seconds I'll be back right after this break here and I'll let you know how I'm feeling see you then it's been two hours since I had the cushy punch that's the name of it the cushy punch should sieve a hundred milligram THC strawberry flavored gummy here and I gotta say this might be the least hi I've been from one of their hundred milligrams it seemed like the hybrid and the indica hit me more that might just be because I've heard this about um because she punched before that they're not the most consistent some are code and some aren't and that might just be the case with this sativa I'm not not high just more at like four four and a half somewhere in that range instead of the six five and a half six is the other ones so a little bit less than before but again that just might be this particular batch where it might be that sativa doesn't quite hit me as hard but it still is better than my original impressions of could she punch way back when when I had their TKO at the very very beginning I still don't think it would be the first thing I reached for at the dispensary but it won't be the last thing I go for like my opinion used to be so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching it as always and we will see you on the next review peace okay", "rRdpXRVHZqU": "when i released my micro dosing story time video i had no idea that it was going to receive the attention and curiosity that it did since the time of that video's release which by the way you can click somewhere here to go watch it if you haven't seen it yet i've received a number of questions from you guys in the comments section and also in my dms about micro dosing psilocybin so today i thought i would just take the time to answer frequently asked questions about micro dosing and we're just gonna roll through them one by one before i begin though as usual a disclaimer i am not a medical professional i'm not an expert so consider the contents of this video to be peer to peer consider me your friend i've had experience with micro dosing and i'm just sharing with you my personal experiences also if you're under 19 please click away i just i don't want to be sued or anything this is probably the most frequently asked question that i get about micro dosing is how do i do it and the way that i do it is in capsule form so i know that certain people like to just buy magic mushrooms dried and then they they portion it out themselves and they'll microdose various different ways i personally prefer doing it this way because i don't like the taste of magic mushrooms and this way it's a lot easier and more convenient for me to know exactly how much i'm getting so one of these caps actually is portioned for the average micro dose which we can get into a little bit later one of these caps is 120 milligrams of magic mushrooms and i think that's a standard micro dose amount the first time i took it though i did get a little bit high but i'm gonna save my first time experience for a future question these days usually it's recommended that when you first start you take a cap and then you take a couple days off and then you take a cap and then you take a couple days off and it's important to do this so that your tolerance doesn't develop too quickly for me my ideal micro dosing schedule now is one cap every two to three days the whole point of micro dosing is to take such a small amount that you're not supposed to notice the effects of being on magic mushrooms when you're on a micro dose really what it feels like is your mind feels more open like i said before the first time i took one of these caps i did get high because i just you know that was just my response to a typical microdose the one that was proportioned out to me and that could be because i am a smaller framed woman compared to being a 200 pound man [Music] usually six hours so emotional side effects are very positive which is why i micro dose to begin with it takes my regular baseline mood and lifts it up and i'm left with this overall feeling of feeling like i can just handle the everyday stressors that come there have been some times when i've accidentally taken too much and i'm straight up feeling the effects of being high and so those can carry more noticeable side effects so physically i've in the past i've noticed muscle tension muscle cramps i've noticed heart palpitations my heart will start to beat a little bit too fast and um emotionally not every you know psilocybin trip is going to feel like the best time of your life sometimes you will be confronted with the things that were originally stressing you out but now it's like you're noticing them at full force so that's what we would call a bad trip but i have come to learn that there really is no such thing as a bad mushroom experience when you have a an undesirable trip then lean into that experience because you'll usually you'll often walk away from it learning something insightful about yourself so this one and i wish i had pulled up studies on this if i find the link you know i'll provide it in the description box below there was a study that was done that shows that magic mushrooms are the least toxic substance and i remember distinctly in a presentation one time seeing that alcohol was here and psilocybin was here alcohol was 52 times more addictive and more toxic than magic mushrooms sorry not addictive but more definitely more toxic 52 times more toxic [Music] it shouldn't but if it's your first time doing it i wouldn't recommend scheduling it on a day where you have a lot of big commitments or you have to be on the road a lot because you don't know how your body is going to react to that first dose do it on a day where you don't have a ton of big commitments and just be open-minded i would also recommend taking your dose earlier in the morning because one thing that i've noticed sometimes when i take my caps too late into the evening i'll just find it very difficult to fall asleep that night but i know different people have different reactions which is why you have to plan accordingly and give yourself ample space your first time it'll be either a very fun trip for you or a not so fun one but everything will come to pass and there is no such thing as a bad trip when it comes to the things that you learn and gain from it at the end of the day [Music] i've had experiences where i've taken too much or maybe for example in the beginning i really questioned whether i should be taking time off in between because i was like this is awesome i love feeling like that so that i started taking caps every single day and i quickly built a really high tolerance so then i started just taking more that wasn't a good idea because it led to a couple of experiences where i was like okay this i really want this to end and i should be working right now but instead i am kind of freaking out a little bit i take full ownership of those experiences it was a learning curve and now i know what my happy medium is [Music] i wouldn't recommend it i have friends now who are on antidepressants and they take psilocybin and they have had no issues although this is something that i don't feel comfortable dishing out advice on i'm just simply sharing that there have been people who have had no issues mixing certain substances together and for me i micro dose for medicinal purposes so i'm usually not i'm not drinking i'm not doing other drugs it is purely medicinal you can prevent tolerance buildup by sticking to a regulated schedule and not letting your microdosing get a little bit too out of hand like the experience that i previously described if you do end up building a high tolerance though i've heard that if you take a week off you restore your tolerance by 80 and i would say from anecdotal experience this is true before i wrap up i want to bring up a point that i forgot to mention earlier magic mushrooms aren't addictive in the way that some antidepressants or cocaine hair and you know hard drugs are because when you stop taking mushrooms you don't experience withdrawal effects so it's not a chemical addiction and i would say that if you decide like this is working really well for me and you continue to incorporate it into your life that's not necessarily a matter of addiction it's just you found something that works and you have made a choice to to continue to integrate it into your life like i have yeah and i think that's it i hope i was able to answer all of your questions if there was something that i missed please leave a comment in the comment section below and i will get around to it and it's been really encouraging just to see the feedback about this topic in general i i'm going to leave some more resources for you if you want to continue to learn more about this and i'm gonna try not to make a political point here i always do and then it gets cheesy and the video gets too long maybe i should very quickly anyways um yeah i'll see you in my next video [Music]", "NqEVxYb8imo": "[Music] that's pretty good welcome to wheats guys the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review is a good old-fashioned classic because we were taking a look at edibles and a classic edible kind at that the cookie we're finally digging into big Pete's here I've heard actually a lot of really good thing about big Pete's so I am excited to give it a try but that's a lot of calories in here haha just look at the nutrition information [ __ ] um so this is the mini cookie model which seems to be the biggest model out there for edibles in California I'm gonna say pioneered by Korova I don't know if that's actually true um that's where I first saw the the first time used some to use that model was kirova so 10 cookies 10 milligrams of THC each because that is what the regulations are you can only have ten milligrams max per individual serving and then you can only have ten servings for a total of 100 milligrams for any legal edibles so this is a big heavy ass hunk in bag of cookies there's 700 calories in total we've got a really wonderful packaging here great information lab testing results right there on the back nutrition information ingredients dosing instructions everything we even have a little story there on the back which I won't bore you with I'm just gonna take a peek right right out of here now uh okay good for you big Pete not that interesting so uh if you've never tuned into ones before unfortunately I'm gonna eat this whole friggin bag of cookies um because that's the way we're our room edibles reviews work is I eat the whole product to review the whole product and let you know how I feel about it two hours after I finished the last one of these cookies really don't have to eat 100 calories worth of cookies right now but I do it for you guys so uh I actually figured out how to open the childproof baggy on this one goomy I'm learning smells in there ooh they smell really good actually they smell like really really good peanut butter cookies there is a little bit of cannabis odor but they smell great here we are we've got the little lattice work on the top for the peanut butter cookie it looks good god damn this is great there's maybe a little bit of canvas taste but this is a good peanut butter cookie it's a lot softer I mean it's not soft but it is a lot softer than the the other mini cookies there's ones have the more Chips Ahoy brittle II thing and this is a little brittle but it's suddenly a little chewier than the others and it's great it's got a great peanut butter flavor just the right amount of crunch whoops mmm well if I have to eat ten of these at least they taste pretty good right okay chewie on the taste front guys I can tell you these are great genuinely surprised I mean I've heard good things about him but that [ __ ] was unexpected how good that was um so big thumbs up there but really guys what we all want to know is anybody can go get a mazing bag of cookies for the 20 bucks with these costs you want to make sure that these [ __ ] expensive ass cookies are gonna get you really high and for that guys you look to stick around for just a second and I will be back to you guys Oh in about two hours or so after I finish off this whole bag see you then [Music] big Pete's welcome back to wheats guys it has been about two and a half hours since I first checked in with you and I am ready to check out because big Pete's is a big ol win and the potency column look at them eyeballs red as can be man I loved big Pete's guys the cookies tasted excellent this is on the top level of hundred milligram potencies I mean this is about as potent as it gets great packaging I mean look at this you know tons of information not and not terribly ostentatious do not feel like you're spending extra money on it big Pete's man this is a huge thumbs up I could not be more happy with this the only problem is I have not yet thought of a cherry on top so I have to sit here and think of one for a second cuz I can't leave you guys without a cherry on top with something this exciting right that would feel rude I got it I got it I got it I'm gonna share with you guys a novel that I share with a lot of people that I quite like that I think have good taste like you guys cuz I think you guys all have great excellent wonderful taste is the most successful book I've ever recommended to people in terms of like batting average of them loving it I met a hundred percent right now or a thousand batting a thousand try not to mix metaphors holy [ __ ] that's a lot of build-up for the book which is then we came to the end by Jonah no not Jonah Joshua Faris Joshua Faris I think that's his name if we're not I'm going to be embarrassed great novel it's a weird novel that's told in the first person plural meaning they say like we and us instead of I and him or her and it is about the dot-com collapse an office that's like an advertising firm for dot-com companies right at the end of the dot-com collapse it is hysterical is so funny it is very poignant and it is sort of has come around to being sort of relevant again today with the shape of the tech industry so again that was then we came to the end that was a really long cherry on top and I just plucked that one out the sky love that book love big Pete's and their indica cannabis infused peanut butter mini cookies 65 million thumbs up way up in the sky but-but-but-but boom guys oh love you big Pete's I'm not a crook oh I don't know what's going on I'll see you guys on the next review", "UfXchhtG5NY": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you decide what products are worth your hard-earned dollars at your dispensary and which ones are utter junk and today we are talking about one of my favorite companies when we haven't had a chance to review a product from in a while because they haven't had anything new coming out but now thanks to the new regulations here in California that make edibles be a hundred milligrams max and ten milligrams per serving Korova one of my all-time favorites has come out with a brand new line here they have the Korova Saturday morning mini cookies ten milligrams per cookie at it for a hundred milligrams total so ten cookies in here at ten milligrams each it's a huge package it's so much bigger than their normal packaging which is crazy its its massive and it was only ten bucks but then again that's a bit that's more expensive than their one hundred and fifty milligrams cookies that they used to have that were just single cookies but it's big packaging because it is holding ten little mini cookies in here I really like the packaging it's very handsome I really quite like it a lot it's got the new props on there keep refrigerated bla bla bla bla bla but shows you know it's compliant with them new regulations and then here on the back it's got it finally has nutrition information corroded before I don't believe actually had nutrition information on their packaging but they do now and it's got like the ingredients and all that fun stuff on there and now they have this child resistant packaging that is very tough to open because I've tried opening one of these before and they're quite difficult to open especially if you've not encountered it before I'm super excited to try these it actually I've been wanting to review them for a while they've taken me some time to find they're not in available and a lot of dispensaries yet which is odd because you know supposedly next month is when these regulations take effect although I believe you have until July to like get rid of your old stock of stuff but yeah I assume you'll start seeing these everywhere soon but I've been wanting to review these for some time because I assume they'll be as ubiquitous as kirova in no time so here's that obnoxious child-resistant packaging you have to place one thumb in the middle of the zipper and place one thumb into the back panel zipper and pull gently apart it's easier said than done you know what I'm just gonna cut into it because I hate it I hate the child-resistant label packaging I'm a child I'm too down for it dumb child here we go here are the mini cookies ooh they're handsome quite like them aesthetically they look a lot like the full-size versions don't have very much of a weeds odor chewy and kind of crunchy but good nice pretty good very little canvas ace if any at all I'd like it just as much maybe even a little bit more than their 150 milligrams Saturday morning cookie it's great it's got the rice krispies in there good cookie good cookie taste it's a little bit chewier and crunch here than I was expecting it to be but it's not bad it's not bad not a bad combination at all i I'm not dreading having to eat nine more of these so guys I'm going to finish the rest of this bag off I've got a lot more to get through and then I will be sure to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process I'm probably about two and a half three hours or something on my way to go see a movie and as soon as I get out of there I will let you know how I'm feeling thanks so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours since I had the kirova mini cookies medical cannabis Saturday morning cookies 100 milligrams THC 10 cookies and I am more than pleased to report that kauravas unrivaled potency is in still intact this is a strong hundred milligrams in these 10 cookies here in fact my only complaint about it is and it is a complaint well I guess my two complaints there the packaging sucks I don't like this child restraint and packaging because I'm I'm stupid I'll fully grot to that and you know I'm not I'm an intelligent person but it's annoying it's hard to open even trying to follow the directions it's not like the childproof pill bottles that are very easy to take off that's a minor complaint the big complaint is it's a lot to consume for one person I know these are designed for 10 servings and they really are because it's a lot to consume it's I mean you can see how big this packages and it's packed to the brim with those cookies it's for our calories of cookies which isn't a whole lot but at the same time ten of those little mini cookies it's not a insignificant amount it certainly feels like more than one of the normal size but still I'm gonna recommend it especially for this new wave of products that are coming in that are going to be these ten milligrams servings of ten servings each this is probably going to be really great III heartily recommend it if you cannot find if the any of the other Korova still lying around if your dispensary is only prop to 1/5 compliant grab these you'll be happy you did if not go ahead and stick with the original batch because that's gonna do you better but but these are a fine replacement it's not the end of the world for edibles but you know it's not it's not going to be the same same world we remember anyways guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching thank you so much and we will check you out on a later review peace that's okay", "HIwES9pE_yY": "[Music] welcome to week everyone the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at a brand new brand we are looking at dedicated medicated we are looking at their Cinnamon Toast Crunch bar it's a pretty low-end edible it's only 100 milligrams of THC and it only cost $4 at my dispensary so I don't have a whole lot of I don't want about a lot of high hopes for this but I am willing to be surprised and I hope to be surprised so this as you can see here is basically a rice krispies treat but instead of Rice Krispies there cinnamon toast crunch and again pretty cheap looking packaging just like a shitty little sticker pasted on there and a little vacuum seal bag but again only four dollars and 100 milligrams of THC so without further ado let's open it up and give ourselves a little taste test here so if this your first time tuning in tomates everyone the way we do our reviews is I eat this bad boy up I don't eat the entire thing in front of you because it just takes too long but I you know sample it make sure it tastes good let you know how it tastes then I hop off the camera and I come back two hours later to let you guys know how I'm feeling after consuming the whole thing and we wrap up then okay so here we go here is the bar right here you can see all the cinnamon toast crunch the marshmallow fluff it's kind of light and gooey very true it mmm look my prediction guys is you know exactly how this is gonna taste um no we taste no real weed odor probably because it's such low potency but it tastes exactly like you expected it's gonna taste it tastes like the rice a homemade rice krispies treat but with cinnamon toast crunch so otherwise pretty good or excuse me in other words that's pretty good and at least it is to me but we know the most important thing is not how it tastes but rather how it makes you feel and for that I'm gonna have to finish this off and I'm gonna have to come back to you guys two hours from now and let you know how we're feeling then so with that thank you so much for watching weeks guys and we'll check you back into two hours germs I am back it has been 2 hours since I've had the dedicated and medicated cinnamon toast crunch 100 milligram edible and I feel nothing literally nothing whatsoever not I can't say I'm too surprised knowing the price and the sort of shoddy craftsmanship involved but it's still a disappointment again this was only four dollars but still I was hoping for some kind of sensation but this could just be this particular edible or just this particular batch or whatever the case may be I do have some more dedicated medicated edible reviews on the way and I am certainly hoping for something a little bit more promising or a little bit more you know something will actually give me I but but maybe that's that's too much of a hope for a four dollar product again this was the dedicated medicated Cinnamon Toast Crunch 100 an\u00edbal total wet part of the product uh thank you so much for watching weeks guys and we will check you out on the next review hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment

just kind of [ __ ] curious so anyway in this bag excuse me a little coffee today I know CBD in it pretty much it does have six point two five milligrams of THC per almond in the whole bag you got 100 milligrams of THC which means you go with 16 I think 17 say yeah 17 servings in here as far as nutritional facts you know me I like to look at the nutritional facts to see if this really really worth it you got two grams of fat because it's only one almond so that makes sense to carbs that's not bad no fiber one gram of sugar that's not bad at all one gram of protein so you can get your buff on

in\nchocolate bar form they thought it would be an instant hit\ngreat success and yet surprisingly it kind of flopped\nthis confectionary was originally launched in 2007\ndiscontinued in 2012 secretly re-released in 2013\nonly to be discontinued again the bar was introduced to several locations such\nas canada new zealand and australia however due to\nlow popularity they were pulled from stores

videos thank you for taking your time and watching them i also want to welcome all the new youtube subscribers twitter followers and instagram followers to the family remember to click the subscribe button below that way you can join the fam that way you don't miss out on any new episodes new giveaways and more let's get right to it on this video i'm going to tell you about the true chocolate bar that i picked up from true leave in tallahassee i paid 20 for this bar and it came in at 100 milligrams total divided into 10 squares of 10 milligrams each looks like a standard chocolate bar the ten squares are clearly marked and easy to split apart and a square does have a thc warning icon so you can easily tell its medicine the smell is that of delicious milk chocolate the flavor is only of milk chocolate there was no oil or wheat taste none of that i ended up eating the two pieces shown here to test the effects i did this since i eat edibles for my back pain on a daily basis so my tolerance for them is high for people new to edibles i recommend trying half of one piece waiting an hour and going from there on to the effects the first effect that failed was the stress of the two and a half hour commute to tallahassee fade away this left me completely relaxed and my head feels a little bit lighter than normal and it also feels like my eyesight takes a little bit longer to catch up to the movement of my head later on a gigantic smile came over me and i know it was a chocolate since i was dealing with a work issue at the time my chronic back pain is gone and it stayed gone through the effects there were also tingly shields every now and then when my skin was touched her air went on my skin this bar gives me high hopes for when they start doing strange specific edibles in the future the best part is that true leave has shown time after time that they're able to grow at an absurd rate so i bet the strength specific edibles won't be too far away plus my opinion that edibles is going to be tarnished by the fact that i eat edibles on a daily basis making my tolerance for them higher than normal so in my humble opinion these will work best for people who are not daily edible users can i work on the strain for sure the effects of this bar were strong enough to keep my mood balanced my back pain gone and kept me stressed and anxiety free this helped my work very big time i use this edible any time day or night i hope this helps you meditate right have a great day", "BwSxDovwTvg": "oh gosh I'm watching you cut me out of weird time so good to see

Camino the Kiva Camino cannabis infused gummies and we're really going with that cannabis infused gummies named with all these companies aren't weight cannabis infused that is and this seeming to be the new enclosure du jour for all gummies going forward uh first and foremost these are the best tasting gummies I've ever had edible gummies for sure possibly even just normal gummy candies these are excellent uh and they are pretty damn good too um I'd say they're maybe not quite as strong as the plus gummies that I've reviewed a couple of which I really really liked but these are not far behind at all and they taste so much better than the plus gummies which don't taste bad to begin with it's just that Keva they have some witchcraft they they have some witchcraft and they can keep that nasty cannabis taste at bay nothing all cannabis taste is nasty but it's usually really gross in the gummies but not here and so it's still pretty potent today got up to about a six or so for a hundred milligram edible not too bad not too bad at all so I definitely enjoyed my first experience with kiba's and Kamino line and I yeah maybe three or four flavors and I look forward to reviewing them all because my boys at Kaiba dog and that guys is gonna do it for this review really positive here so anytime we have one of those positive reviews we like to put a little cherry on top a little some extra that you can enjoy throughout your week that isn't necessarily weed related doesn't need weed to help you enjoy it on this week it's something a little bit different I don't often endorse food but this one is such a good deal that I thought I had to give it a shoutout and that is imitation gruel not so not real gruel real gruel is you know it's it's okay but you pay extra for it the imitation gruel is amazing it's got a very sludgy texture a kind of would you describe it as kind of an earthy may be a dirty taste a dirt dirt a posture or dirt - white kind of tastes you know it's it's great um and according to Krusty the Klown nine out of ten orphans can't tell the difference so we are talking Kiva wildberry Caminos super thumbs up and imitation gruel Krusty the Klown says nine out of ten orphans cannot tell the difference and this guy totally agrees imitation gruel check it out I don't think you can actually find it it's from The Simpsons so maybe that's what my actual cherry on top is The Simpsons the good Simpsons not the bad Simpsons so season 9 and then stop Wow that went a long ways for that but I appreciate you guys watching thanks you guys are wonderful just such good guests and wonderful conversationalist so we feel like we have a real dialogue here you and I the audience so thank you so much for watching weeds guys I will see you on the next review I

could nosh on candy bars from other\ncountries. Thanks to the power of the Internet, they may be able to order these candy bars\nonline, but they generally aren't sold in USA stores. Here are 10 Candy Bars America\nWished They Had - Part 3. Cherry Blossoms In Canada Cherry Blossoms are a classic Canadian sweet\ntreat. A Cherry Blossom has a maraschino cherry center that's wrapped in rich chocolate. These\ndelicious confections pack all of the flavor punch of typical candy bars, but they're shaped\na little differently than regular candy bars. Cherry Blossoms come in square packages that\nare fairly small. Inside of each square box, there is a single Cherry Blossom with a rounded\ntop and flat base. There are also multi-packs, which allow candy fans to get four Cherry\nBlossoms per package.\u00a0Americans can find these treats online, so they're not totally\nout of reach. It's easier for Canadians to find them in brick-and-mortar stores. These\ncandy bars have been available in Canada for many decades. This classic Canadian confection\nwas originally manufactured by a Canadian company called Lowney, which was later acquired\nby Hershey. These candy bars are special because their luscious cherry centers are surrounded\nby delectable cherry syrup. They're also special because their chocolate coating features roasted\npieces of peanuts and bits of shredded coconut. All of the flavors and textures come together\nand the end result is amazing. Americans who love the sweetest of candy bars should definitely\ntry to get their hands on Cherry Blossom treats. Nestl\u00e9 Lion Bar In The UK Most Americans have never had the chance to\nsample Lion candy bars from the United Kingdom. Lion candy bars are made by Nestl\u00e9, which\nis a company that definitely has a strong global presence.\u00a0Nestl\u00e9 tailors its offerings\nby country, to ensure that each nation gets food products that suit national preferences.\nThe Lion candy bar has been offered to UK residents since the mid-1970's. It's a classic\nand beloved United Kingdom candy bar which provides a plethora of yummy flavors and textures.\nThe bar features crunchy cereals, caramel that's delightfully chewy, and wafer that's\nlight and crisp, with a milk chocolate coating. This candy bar is a substantial and satisfying\nsweet treat. This candy bar has very bold packaging. An illustration of a roaring lion\ndecorates the red and brown wrapper, along with bright yellow text. Because Lion bars\nare imported from the UK, most online shops that offer these bars to American customers\ncharge more. Lion bars from abroad are delicious and they are exciting because they are something\nnew to Americans. Cadbury Moro In Australia This candy bar is available in Australia and\nNew Zealand. Candy fans in the Middle East are also able to enjoy Moro bars. A Moro bar\nis a lot like a Mars bar or a Milky Way bar. This candy bar, which has a distinctive black\nwrapper with yellow text, is renowned for its Cadbury milk chocolate, caramel, and nougat.\nSome restaurants in New Zealand offer patrons Moro bars that are deep-fried. Americans who\ncan't get Moro bars can always deep-fry Mars or USA-style Milky Way bars, to enjoy unique\ndesserts.\u00a0The Moro is a candy bar that's not too easy for Americans to find in stores\nor order online. If you're an American who's looking for unique treats from other places,\nand you think that you'll enjoy a candy bar with a nougat and caramel center, which is\ncovered in a delicious layer of Dairy Milk chocolate from Cadbury, then hunting for this\ncandy bar online may be worth your while.\u00a0The bar is actually marketed as being a great\nway to access energy fast. People who need a boost while they're on the go can eat Moro\nbars to get some needed calories rapidly. If you're determined to try a Moro bar, you\nmay want to look for these types of candy stores online, or in your own town or city. Nestl\u00e9 Daim In Sweden This Swedish treat gets rave reviews. The\nDaim bar was invented back in the 50s and it's still going strong today, although most\nAmericans haven't heard of it. This bar is manufactured by the Marabou company and it's\na version of a Heath bar, which has similar ingredients, but doesn't taste exactly the\nsame. Marabou actually tried to get the recipe for the Heath bar, way back when, but the\ncompany that produced the Heath bar wouldn't share. However, the Heath team were willing\nto share a list of all ingredients used in the bar. Once Maribou got the ingredients,\nthe company started coming up with its own Heath-style bar, which was eventually called\nThe Daim bar.\u00a0A Daim candy bar is a chocolate-covered toffee bar. It features an inner core of almond\ntoffee that's crunchy, plus a tasty Maribou chocolate coating. Some people add pieces\nof Daim bars to their baking recipes to give them more Scandinavian flair and great taste.\nBits of Daim bar are also amazing add-ons for ice cream. Full-size bars are available,\nas well as fun miniatures. Some Americans are able to access the miniature Daim bars\nat local IKEA outlets, so keep this in mind if you're American and want to find Daim bars.\nWhile the mini-bars can't currently be ordered at IKEA websites in the USA, they are available\nvia some other online retailers, although prices for the imported treats vary widely\nand may be a little steep, depending on the online retailer.\u00a0Over the years, there have\nbeen some interesting limited-edition Daim bar flavors, including Cappuccino, \"forest\nfruit\", gingerbread and mint. The original flavor, with crunchy almond toffee, is very\npopular with consumers. Cadbury Curly Wurly In The UK The Curly Wurly is a UK sweet treat that's\nso much fun, thanks to its unique ladder shape and its chewy texture. It is possible for\nAmericans to order this United Kingdom candy bar online, and some retailers do offer it\nfor reasonable prices. If you've never tried a candy bar that resembles a caramel ladder\nthat's coated in delicious chocolate, you may find that giving the Curly Wurly a try\nis a great idea. This candy bar is definitely unique.\u00a0This bar is marketed as a twisty\ntreat and it has a fairly low calorie count, compared to other candy bars.\u00a0Fans of Cadbury\nchocolate will probably love the Curly Wurly, if they can get their hands on it. It's a\npopular Brit treat that's been manufactured since the Seventies. You'll find it in England\nand in a range of other nations, including Romania, Australia, Portugal and Malta. Originally,\nthis exciting candy bar had a different name. It was known as a Marathon bar and it came\nin bold red packaging.\u00a0Each chocolate-coated caramel ladder is 8 inches in length. Caramel\nstrands covered in chocolate offer a true \"melt in your mouth\" experience. Mr. Tom In Switzerland This Swiss candy bar has an interesting and\nmemorable name and also tastes great. The bar features plenty of caramel and roasted\npeanuts. It comes in yellow packaging with red lettering, which also features images\nof comical people and cartoon characters, including a clown in a tiny red hat. Crafted\nby a company called Hosta Meltis, Mr. Tom candy bars taste somewhat like peanut brittle,\nbut they're easier to snack on, because of their crisp and light texture. If you manage\nto access one of these candy bars, you may find that you're able to inhale the candy\nbar in record time. Each crunchy bite will be delicious. Every bar has 60 percent peanuts,\nwhich are coated in caramel and made into bars. Peanut and caramel fans may find that\nthis candy bar is worth finding online, even if it's almost impossible to find in local\nshops. This is a candy bar without chocolate, which makes it a stand out. It's perfect for\nthose who want sweet treats that don't feature chocolate. This is another bar that pairs\nwell with ice cream. If you manage to find a Mr. Tom, break it up into pieces and add\nthem to vanilla ice cream. You'll love it, and can thank us later. Nestl\u00e9 Polly Waffle In Australia For a while, the Australian candy bar known\nas the Polly Waffle was off the market. It was reintroduced to Aussie consumers in 2009.\nUnfortunately, sales of the rebooted Polly Waffle weren't as high as expected, so the\ncandy bar was once again discontinued. Many people in Australia do miss the Polly Waffle.\nLuckily, this classic Australian sweet treat is slated for yet another comeback. A company\ncalled Robert Menz bought the rights to the Polly Waffle in January of 2019. Robert Menz\nrevived another legendary candy bar, the Violet Crumble, and may have the same success with\nthe Polly Waffle.\u00a0The Polly Waffle was a tube of waffle wafer that had a marshmallow\ncenter. The tube and marshmallow filling were covered in chocolate. It's safe to say that\nlots of Aussies are celebrating the pending relaunch of the Polly Waffle. Mackintosh's Toffee In Canada Awesome and creamy Mackintosh toffee is renowned\nfor its exceptional taste. It's available in Canada, but USA residents can probably\nfind it online without too much of a problem. In the USA, it won't be available in brick-and-mortar\nshops, unless they are candy shops that specialize in imported treats. This treat was the brainchild\nof a man named John Mackintosh. He owned a candy shop in England, which opened for business\nduring 1890. He got the idea for the toffee after starting his candy shop business. Since\nMackintosh toffee has been around for over a century, it's definitely a classic candy\nthat has a proven track record. The toffees are found in Quality Street candy tins, because\nthe Mackintosh family invented Quality Street. The Canadian bars are fantastic. They have\na hard texture at first, but quickly soften when they are chewed. In addition to bars,\nCanadians are now able to access smaller toffee bites that come in bags, which some people\nfind very convenient. Cadbury Crispy Crunch In Canada This Canadian candy bar has a harder-than-average\ntexture, thanks to its peanut flake filling and chocolate coating. The filling is crispy\nand crunchy, which is why this bar got its name. The Crispy Crunch comes from Cadbury\nand it was invented during the 30s. Its inventor was a man named Harold Oswin, who rolled candy\nfor a company called Neilson's. He invented the bar because a contest was announced, whereby\ncontestants would create candy bars and submit their concepts. He was the winner. The bar\ninitially had a log shape, but the shape was eventually made flatter, and the flatter shape\nis what is sold today.\u00a0During the 90s, these chocolate bars were available in the USA.\nUnfortunately, the company that distributed them went under. This meant that Americans\ncould no longer buy the candy bars in shops. A low-cal version of the bar surfaced in America\nduring the middle of the 90s, but it was a limited time thing.\u00a0When Cadbury began making\nCrispy Crunch bars, the company altered the classic recipe a little bit, to reduce saltiness\nand add sweetness. Currently, it's not too easy to find Crispy Crunch bars at online\nretailers that sell imported candy, but you may be able to find an online retailer that\ndoes ship Crispy Crunch bars to American customers. If you're in the USA, consider crossing the\nborder to get a Crispy Crunch, because they are really great candy bars. Ferrero Duplo In Germany Americans with a taste for European candy\nbars should try to find Ferrero Duplo bars, which come from Germany. These candy bars\nare the most popular candy bars in Germany. They've been best-sellers for a long time\nnow. The Ferrero Duplo features myriad layers of thin wafers, along with nougat cream. The\nwafers and nougat are covered in creamy milk chocolate.\u00a0These bars are available at online\nretailers that serve American customers, so getting your hands on Ferrero Duplo bars won't\nbe impossible. However, online availability and price vary widely. Ferrero is the same\ncompany that produces some beloved products that are available in the USA, including the\nall-too-addictive Nutella spread, with its distinctive chocolate and hazelnut flavor.\u00a0If\nyou love other Ferrero products, such as Nutella, you may want to sample Ferrero Duplo candy\nbars. There's a reason why these candy bars are so beloved in Germany. They're truly delicious\nand also quite easy to eat.

wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and look at this little puppy hook-shaped doohickey I've got here today Tara from Kiva Kiva guys we reviewed Kiva products before nothing quite like this we've only reviewed their chocolate bars which are among my favorite edibles if a little pricey they are delicious and today we are looking at their espresso beans coated in dark chocolate not only is this the first time I have had the tera kiba product this is the first time I've had chocolate-covered espresso beans so I'm excited on two fronts that's my dog Newton the back there everyone say hi so let's go ahead and open this up take ourselves bite and explain how wheats works so if you guys have never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work is I am going to take this edible eat some of it in front of you here not necessarily the whole thing because I don't want to bore you to death but I rest assured I will eat the next the whole thing over the next couple of minutes and I will come back to you in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review now we've got a sticker here that says hard to see with no background start with one bite that's the wait for at least two four hours for the full effects we're going to ignore that advice and go straight into the beans here we go whoo that tastes like dark chocolate covered coffee beans Wow that's not bad actually they're very bitter but no wheat taste so I see you I'm specific you're not also very caffeinated is that part of this I hope maybe a fun side effect so guys they're quite a few of them in here I'm gonna crunch and munch on them all and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how these guys are feeling I should come to you quite high and quite jittery from all the caffeine well who knows maybe unroasted espresso beans don't have caffeine I don't know who says who's to say we'll find out soon see in two hours feels like I'm caffeinated already see you then peace guys I am back it has been 2 hours thank you for sticking around and man I love this the Terra the Kiva excuse me the Kiva ter a hundred and twenty milligram espresso beans are great I mean I'm really high for 120 milligram Anibal they tasted great and I feel pretty energized like yeah you know like there's just probably quite a bit of caffeine in there maybe yeah this is this is a great great product another real win from Kiva I was I was optimistic about it but it was a little you know trepidatious and never had like the chocolate-covered espresso beans and was a little worried about how potent they might be and how they might taste and on both fronts I gotta say they exceeded expectations really happy with this one from Kiva and this is again the Kiva Tara espresso beans it cost me I believe 12 bucks at my dispensary worth every penny home run love it if you see it a dispensary grab it and that's gonna do it for this episode here on wheat skies I would throw this at the camera like I normally do but I'm afraid it would break it because I think this screen is made of glass yes I think it is okay all right well thank you so much for watching and we will see you on the next review peace No hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "7U_ET0_HVOw": "oh hi guys just enjoying some splatoon too but that's not what we're here about we're not here to talk about splatoon - as fun as the game may be we're here to talk about marijuana edibles welcome to wheats guys the marijuana edible review show the one where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's late at night and I'm ready for bed but I can't go to sleep so that's why I've got my cushy punch hundred milligrams here indica variety right here you know Ben so I'm hoping this is going to do the trick this is the second time of reviewed cushy punch I reviewed their TKO formula before 200 milligrams and found it to be pretty disappointing to be honest it did not do much for me since that time I have had several several people come up to me and say and I come up to me I mean comment online that's what I mean by that I've had simple people comment to me online saying give Chris you budget another chance sometimes that their formulation isn't as strong as others but when it hits it really hits so I decided to give it another chance and this seems to be the perfect opportunity when you're ready for some sleep with the indica variety so let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste and I'll come back to you guys in just about two hours after this and hopefully be ready for bedtime so let's find out if that's going to be the case or not okay so we've got our little jar here it looks like a little butter Pat actually a little pad of butter that you would get at our restaurant it's a hundred milligrams of THC in here I said before so let's go ahead and open her up and slope her to him and hopefully get ready for bed in the there we go there's our corner and there she has one big gummy pop her out for little rivulets they're not gonna care just gonna plump the whole thing I'm not it's not super great it's better than the like confused creations or those kind of edibles I've done as good as the flourish it sort of tastes more like a flourish type edible than the infused creations or at a pure or any of those two so it's better than those but it's not as good as the flourish company's in terms of taste so from here guys I'm just going to wait it out and hopefully in two hours I'll be ready for bed so I will see you guys then I'll see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the way the wheats reviews work for you it's just going to be a couple of seconds so I'll see you on the other side of the break and for me it'll be two hours and I'll let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you soon peace mission accomplished I think and a slight redemption for cushy punch I am ready to go to bed quite sleepy at this point looking forward to hitting that pillow and I feel pleasantly buzzed for one hundred and milligram edible this cost me eight dollars at my dispensary all-in with all the discounts so you know pretty affordable 400 milligram edible and I do feel about about a six maybe five and a half or so so you know I'm not super super high by any means but you know definitely high noticeably high and ready to hit the sack so I'm ready to give cushy punch another chance try another one there edibles because they earned their Redemption with this one I just there 200 milligram did not see you know any stronger than this for sure maybe it's just as people have told me their potency seems to fluctuate up and down so maybe this was just a stronger batch but we'll review some more could you punch in a few to see if my opinion changes but for now this was a pleasant surprise and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat skies and we will check you out on a future review peace", "y-UlV_CJ-NA": "i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less is more so we're 30 minutes in i'm just going to check back in an hour i've literally just been on i was let's say facetime but i'm in i'm team android right now so um yeah on video chat right now so um i've just been checking in but we'll see in 30 more minutes so at 2 35 we'll see if i feel anything um and then again at what's after 2 35 305 we'll check again um but yeah so i'm just going to keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little bit of a second like everything nothing's funny nothing's funny okay anyway what i was saying is i said i was getting checked back in at 2 35 it's 2 42 and i just can't stop laughing because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um since that happened it's just been like everything's funny i don't know how to describe it other than like get so lovey it's so weird because like i think i might be high but i can't i keep saying that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "eSw1S_tEOLo": "what's up YouTube it's a boy stuff we preview Channel Denver coming back at you with another weed review we review number 10 today I'm doing something a little bit different we're going to do an edible review it is Incredibles indica Fruit Chews it's a hundred milligrams each one of these is ten milligrams and there's ten of them in there so each one of these right here is ten milligrams so I'm gonna go ahead and give those a try I'm gonna pause the video wait till I start feeling the effects and then I'll start the video back up again and we'll see where we go from there are these it's been about 20 minutes and yeah they're pretty effective you can feel it right off the bat I'm sure as time goes on as time progresses they get stronger and stronger but about 20-25 minutes in boom you can definitely feel that they're definitely there it's you know I mean it's definitely very very very effective no indica I don't know how you're going to feel the difference between indica and sativa when you're eating when you're eating edibles I don't know because it affects your body so much I don't know how you would be able to feel the difference between an indica and a sativa but these are in different shoes so yeah I don't know you know I'll be able to tell but um yeah these are pretty effective the price point for these ten of these gummies which equals a little over a hundred milligrams cost $17 they were on special for $17 I think they were normally like $19 or $18 so they weren't special for $70 I think it's well worth it for seventeen dollars you get blasted out in your brain basically 100 milligrams is pretty good thousand milligrams is insane so yeah we just keep trucking with that once again it's your boy Seth we would do Channel Denver coming to you with another weed review and a mouthpiece you",

"egNB5MXTmmc": "[Music] hello squid the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another drink Dixie elixir that's hard to read as Dixie there di xi\u00e8 elixir there are half and half lemonade NT th C infuse 100 milligrams so I reviewed a lot of drinks here on wheats and I find them to be pretty good there's some really great ones out there cannabis quenchers awesome Jasper's amazing there of course some Dead's out there but on the whole I do like the drinks so I'm really looking forward to this Dixie elixir half and a half a pretty cool little bottle here it's got a wrapper on the outside I kind of like the idea is that the cap there at the top if you want a dose the cap is designed to help you dose appropriately helps you decide like you know oh what's 10 milliliters blah blah blah blah blah what's it what's a dose of course we're going to ignore that and just drink the whole bottle in terms of half and half I love me some Arnold Palmer's which is what a half lemonade half iced tea is love love love them so I'm hoping like this the drinks in terms of taste are all over the map sometimes they're really bad like as Aspen but that means they can produce excellent rewards like zest and sometimes they're not too bad but they often have this really bitter aftertaste and I find that to be pretty often the case with the drinks I'm having trouble getting it off which is you know par for the course for me we're almost there keep peeling this plastic layer off until we eventually get to the goods oh boy there she goes okay there she is all defrocked there's a little cap that you can pour it in so on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition information I sadly don't see any lab and testing results but that's okay we're gonna hope that it has 100 milligrams in here it says shake gently before consuming which is what we shall do I assume this opens like a childproof lid it does handsome looking bottle there down the hatch hmm it's okay definite cannabis taste to it more tea than lemonade taste it's not too bad um it's only eight and a half ounces so I'll be done with it in no time again there is a slight cannabis taste to it it's not as bitter as the cannabis quench reserves ASP but but it is there so if you really hate that cannabis taste you might want to pass on this one but for me I'm uh I'm I'm I'm David it's again it's not as bitter as some of the the other brands out there hopefully it means it's still gonna be nice and strong so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I'm gonna come back to you in two hours like all of our reviews to let you know how this Dixie elixir has landed thanks for watching weeds guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] Dixie elixir half and half and it's pretty good it is in the oh it got me to about a six I'm about a six right now 400 milligram edible that's not bad and one that only costs eleven bucks which I think I neglected to mention the first half I'm pretty pleased with it the taste was good for a drink it wasn't outstanding tasting and it didn't get me crazy high but overall it's a pretty good little product one that I'm pleased with if you pick if you see it at a dispensary near you and you're looking for a drink and they don't and you don't want to get completely [ __ ] up the Dixie elixir might be the product for you I think I might try another one in the future see how it goes for me but overall this is a it's gonna give them my own thumbs up for me not a not a ringing endorsement but but far from uh from a negative review so uh that's gonna do it for this review here guys a nice short and sweet one but before I go and share with you a little cherry on top something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily we'd really did something I just love that I want to express to you guys and hopefully you will dig as well and this week uh it is going to be Silicon Valley yay there's a little Dinesh in a little guilfoyle now normally I'm very much against these little pop vinyls I think that's what they're called these things just seem like capitalism gone amok but well here becomes capitalism run amuck I think I got in flight two for $5.00 at Gamestop and I was like well III have to have a Dinesh and Gilfoyle so Silicon Valley uh-huh on HBO great great show

season right now on HBO check it out if you haven't I'm sure you've heard about it from people other than just me and that guys is gonna do it from the cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat thank you so much for sticking around to the very end guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "K3jYmHtFVoQ": "today we read it we got a weird article yeah contacted me

uh we're gonna start [ __ ] buying the goods and stockpiling how much what's the most you guys doing cuz I remember last time I heard you probably town I did three thousand I didn't you always do more than wrong I was doing five hundred when I may if a break yeah yeah yeah that's right I was eating two pieces of banana bread when you were still [ __ ] I'm not saying you were you know you don't have a better resume than I do but I'm saying I've done more stars and you've done no you have yes I know cuz I eat five before you even look at the money for hands at a time sometimes I can barest I am this does I really think I'm crazy well that's your self I think we're okay every strong honest about it right a room but I'm happy you went through that I was very worried about you so four thousand milligrams and they're trying to they're trying to minimize it to ten yeah listen Ben no one needs forth we worked it took us five years of hard work education this has not been some [ __ ] to walk in the park this is testing on when I go to acupuncture like I got a coupon which I used to go every other week so she to me up mmm-hmm like smoke will come out of me you could smell the reefer in the rooms how much pot have you been smoking is there an alternative tennis you know can I start eating anymore and then she would I would eat it more and then she'd say well something's going on with your dreams and your gallbladder is heavy to them because when they stick the needle if that hurts that that that that uh chakra that means there's something going on there so this last Tuesday I went guys she tuned me I'd say how hard she told me up all right so I had to go home usually acupuncture day I don't do dick I hate planning spots on acupuncture day because I know at night if she did a good job I'm not gonna want to do that yeah you told you to drink water either like dinner and what the [ __ ] acupuncture syncing and this time I was so tired when I got home I slept three hours that afternoon I used to go there for that I went down for three not one and a half per three and I'm with the bed last night it had to be 11 o'clock and I woke up at six straight usually I got up three times to pee cuz I'm over 50 not last night [ __ ] I slept right to six like a soldier had to pee like a [ __ ] it was coming out of my ears", "P-dRSRsevMc": "[Music] what's up true bustling excuse me let me finish this chocolate come on I'm doing these reviews and tasting it for you guys I feel weird talking through my mouth but you know you got to do what you got to do thank you for tuning in true buds TV it's the Venice cookie Co 100 milligram cookies and cream chocolate review they're tasty and they're potent three got me feeling it and they have a cool story I'm not going to read the whole thing you can go online or read the back of their packages if you buy so yes I would buy this again but at the twenty two dollar price point I just don't know that's steep for a hundred milligrams twenty-two bucks big this packages why do you put it in a little bar I mean I think I got there one hundred and eighty milligram for twenty bar back months ago for like eighteen bucks fifteen bucks but this is before everything went rec and prices just went through the roof here in California speaking of them actually going to show you guys this receipt I'll zoom in for a close-up so you can actually see what it says but anyway I went to lax CC of Spencer e next to the LAX Airport and I got this Venice cookie Co chocolate for $22 I got the flower top-shelf they have on here for 4461 now my subtotal is 6661 right okay not bad wait here come the taxes see a sales and use tax 9.5 percent 633 la tax adult use 10% 666 cixi stacks 15% 9.99 total 89 59 I'm paying like $23 in taxes on these two little things it's pretty ridiculous I mean I guess this is a downside of the whole recreational boom don't get me wrong I wouldn't change it I think it's moving everything in the right direction let's legalize it everywhere we all know my opinion but I just wanted to show you guys these taxes so it's as if it's your first time where you've been and you're wondering why it's expensive and have it looked at the receipts they will tax the [ __ ] out of your [ __ ] that's the truth thank you guys have a great night dead morning any time I hope you love this channel as much as I love kicking it on it does that make sense yeah I think it did you know what I'm saying guys I'm clowning on you just having fun and that's what this is all about having fun that's life right you", "h-6YwrWLcZc": "[Music] hi friends welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I'm gonna be a basic [ __ ] in two different ways I'm gonna be your basic [ __ ] because I'm reviewing your most basic of edibles your Chiba choose that's right your Chiba choose I believe this is their deco dose 100 milligram edible and it's America's favorite edible according to High Times on the back is certainly not my favorite edible this is the second time I reviewed a Chiba Choo I found them to be too expensive for what you get the first time I reviewed them I didn't find to be terrible I found it to be good tasting and it got me a little high but overpriced and I assume this is also going to be overpriced for a hundred milligram edible I do like seeing on the back the lab results and I do like seeing the nutrition information the ingredients you can see all that on the back there which is really nice and in the second way that this makes me a basic [ __ ] in addition to getting the most basic edibles is its PSL flavor that's right guys this is the pumpkin spice latte hybrid hundred milligram at th C Chiba two so when you compare this with your favorite Starbucks latte or take it on its own which is what we're gonna do I've never actually had a pumpkin spice latte I'm not sure I actually like pumpkin spice anything but you know we'll give it a go I assume Chiba choose are gonna be one of the casualties in the New Age of edibles that are coming out soon because they're not dosed in the 10 milligram variety so there it is that's all you get for your money in this little tiny rectangle right here this pathetic little rectangle is your full of your monies every cent of it goes in there and let's see if we can actually get this caramel out out losing any of it there it goes there it goes so here is our dose PSL flavored pumpkin spice latte Chiba choo we'll pop it the whole thing in hmmm very basic no it's good it does have a slight weed taste to it um but the sort of cinnamony taste of the pumpkin spice helps mask it but there is a weed taste to it it's not overwhelming but there it is there just to let you guys know but overall it's my kind of edible small discreet I think it weighs 0.3 four ounces and it only has 44 calories in total so kind of like that that's great small and discreet but guys the most important part of the edible review it's not about how it tastes it's not about what kind of packaging it's in it's not about any of that kind of stuff it's all about how it makes you feel and for that guys you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer for me I'm gonna come back to you after I see the death of Stalin so I'll be back to you guys in about two two-and-a-half hours to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching wheats it I'll see you guys soon peace guys [Music] it has been well more than two hours since I last checked in with you talking Chiba choose here and I gotta say I enjoyed the movie way more than I enjoyed the Chiba choo not that I didn't that I find some value in this pumpkin spiced caramel hundred milligram from Chiba choo it's just I didn't find as much value as I do from a Kanaka or akarova or any number of other edibles out there it's I'd say it was 100 milligrams yeah I felt like it didn't feel that strong I say again to beat a dead horse here as a can of Quahog milligram err but it felt pretty strong it's just for that price I could have gotten to Kanaka cookies easily for the same price as this and while this is nice and discreet I really like the fact that I don't have to eat as much that I do getting to you know or I can't go cookie it didn't taste incredible there was a cannabis taste to it still so it wasn't like it had this amazing flavor either for me this is going to probably be a pass going forward with Chiba choose this is our second hundred milligram of that we've reviewed from them and the second time I found them to be okay at best so I think I'm gonna tell you to skip the Chiba choose going forward unless you really really really want something small and discreet and even then there are other options out there like punch bar that are gonna get the job done but one thing that I am going to recommend and I'm gonna use it as our cherry on top for this review here is the movie I just got out of and that is the death of Stalin by [ __ ] Armando Iannucci anoche something the guy who created veep is what you need to know his brand new movie starring sexual creep Jeffrey Tambor looks like a sexual creep Steve Buscemi and just about creepy people so go check it out it's hysterical and also very very disturbing that is the death of Stalin playing in some theaters near you I hope go see it I laugh my ass off and I was also very very disturbed which is my favorite experience in a movie theater thank you so much for watching guys and thanks for sticking around the end of this cherry on top and we will see you on the next review peace", "tIVQ7Lwq5-s": "what's up youtube welcome reefer ross here and uh today got a little bit of a different video for you guys i don't normally make videos like this um but today since i had no weed to smoke and no dabs or nothing like that i figured uh why not make a nice little uh edible video for you guys so as you can see there two chocolate cookies um 200 milligrams thc in total so they're 100 milligrams thc each hybrid um but yeah so i figured why not since i don't got anything to smoke it's been a while since i've made a video too it's been about two weeks now because i've just just had a lot going on recently and um been trying to secure funding for my uh glass blowing because i needed to upgrade my equipment unfortunately because the torch i got is just it's good to make like small little like dabbers and beadwork and stuff like that but unfortunately for making like bongs and rigs which is what whenever i go into smoke shops that's all they want is mostly just bongs and rigs and spoon pipes um but my torch isn't big enough to handle that yet unfortunately so i got to upgrade my torch which the torch i need is like 1200 bucks so i'm trying to secure funding for that uh but yeah so i figured why not in the meantime since i don't have any uh weed to smoke and i couldn't go and buy more weed um i had some edibles so why not get get an edible going for you guys and show you guys what that what's that yeah what that is like oh it smells super chocolatey it smells like a brownie actually so we got one little cookie there nice looking little cookie it smells good it kind of smells like a chocolate mint cookie a little bit like a mint oreo or something but i guess let's take a bite here definitely has a bit of a weedy taste to it not too strong though actually tastes pretty good it's actually a really good cookie so i'm not usually one for edibles i usually prefer getting high um smoking but i figured for you guys on the channel today why not try out an edible of course it's got a cat hair on it already perks of having cats but i have one cat but he sheds like enough for three cats i swear always cat hair plus i just picked them up so i probably have cat around my hands it's got a bit of a weak taste to it but as someone who likes that wheat taste in their edibles it's pretty good i know some people don't like that taste like my cousin she hates that weed edible like the weed taste in the edibles but me i like it but i've also eaten a lot of edibles all right cheers guys i'm gonna save the other one though i'm just gonna eat the one for now because 100 milligrams that's pretty good so that'll probably get me pretty baked but so i'll probably end up pausing it stopping the recording and i'll come back in a few hours when it's like really hit me and settled in when i'm nice and baked um so i hate the edibles around 11 15 ish in the morning and it's now just about two i am definitely feeling nice and stoned i'm feeling good i'm just vibing you know chilling and uh yeah and i ended up looking around and i ended up managing to find the last little bit of shatter so i i was gonna take it off camera and i was like oh [ __ ] yeah dad and i was about to take it and i was like you know what i gotta take it on camera for you guys because i was like i'm gonna hop back on camera in like 20 minutes anyway so i'll just save it right and so i had it and i saved it up for you guys but yeah so off that edible right now like i haven't had anything to smoke i'm just feeling good i'm vibing i'm feeling nice and chill uh i feel like my eyes are a little bit more more closed you know a little more shut uh a little lower um but yeah other than that i'm feeling pretty good feeling feeling definitely like there's some thc in my system off that last one but uh let's get into a dab here guys so i'm gonna heat up the torque nail here all right so we got the nail nice and heated up here and uh or the banger i should say it's not a nail it's uh i'm using a quartz bank but yeah just a quick little video for you guys here today nothing uh too special just ate a little cookie there and uh now i'm gonna take this little dab so cheers guys so that that i definitely feel too that hit me nice and hard um all right but yeah so like i said not not a long video here for you guys because i don't got no weed to smoke and that was the last my dabs right there i was lucky enough to find one more for you guys but um yeah so i promise as soon as i get more weed and as soon as i get more dabs um i will definitely be coming at you guys with more videos don't even trip um i'm just right now just a little more focused on trying to get together my business and get glass blowing so um but yeah because i gotta secure some funding for my uh so i can upgrade my equipment so i can start make actually making money but so yeah i'm gonna get up on out of here hopefully i'll have another video coming out for you guys soon um i'll try and get one out as soon as i can as soon as i buy some more weed uh but yeah so i'm gonna get up on out of here i hope you guys enjoyed this one hopefully you're nice and baked and remember to do something positive i say it and i try to say it in all my videos at the end but like something something little is holding the door for someone like i know right now it's a little harder with social distancing to kind of help people out and whatnot but um just i don't know even like a little small smile or a nice little compliment can be something tiny and minuscule for you that you forget um in 20 minutes but it could change someone's entire life around you really don't know so um yeah remember to spread that positivity guys and just you know be kind smile uh but yeah i'ma get up on out of here hopefully you guys enjoyed this one reefer ross peace out", "OnmUvQFoJWE": "hi everyone so I'm going to be doing a review of the green apple medicated hard candies from cannabis no I'll just take the whole it's a hundred milligrams of THC it's just a different flavor than the other ones but I have to try it out there it is a whole bunch of little squares all stuck together Wow for for not a whole bunch each 25 milligrams of THC I'm tasting THC um I'm not tasting green apple at all there a little bit of sweetness but not not green apple I would say just like taste like maybe like a corn syrup or Oh like little sugary you may have some people I would say just ignore it so well this has been here because it takes usually like an hourish you start to feel it but I have another right and I'm gonna smoke now wait for this to kick it by the time this takes in this will be all do you like doing its job I should have maybe broke these up because it's like cuz they're in the way like a look right there anyways let's get this lit [Music] still under under the tree where nobody could see so I'm gonna smoke this but time I'm done this those will be dissolved go jump in the shower because I probably won't want to feel like taking one later and come back and let you guys know what how I'm feeling now so with a package again you get them at can abysmal what we back up this kicks in probably not out here but I'll be back okay so it's been an hour and a half and as you can tell these have kicked in my eyes feel so heavy and like I just feel really relaxed and you don't feel like doing too much like you know thank God I did everything earlier cuz I would not do anything like that on this I your whole body like it just makes you feel relaxed I like this is like an oh my [ __ ] like that's my rating of it it's it's very good um yeah you get like a little bit thirsty but you also get like hungry so I got try them these are my favorite um like for a licorice I like I like this one I don't like the one that it's all twisty it's like a little bit tough and it has like a weird taste to it I don't really like that one I like the nibs or the you know how you can get the licorice that's all Brown you could probably watch a movie on this um more like hmm more like like those action suspense drama ones my son is bright um yeah it's uh just like the Owens is good I didn't taste the green apple though but it doesn't matter because it feels good like you feel good you don't feel like doing much but you feel good like read watching TV movie not cleaning or laundry or anything like that this is the stuff that makes you feel like you know after you shower and like you know everything's done so and you're you feel like like sleep is gonna be really good but it even feels better when you have like wash sheets and stuff on the bed well I checked that this is what that makes you feel like like we wanted to get into a nice clean bed and just ah watch TV here just lay there and think I wouldn't recommend reading a book because I don't think you would get very far well that Sun is bright yes good eye you know what Lola's hard candies from campus know they're really good like they like I've tried other ones from a different dispensary and they weren't good at all the ones I can abysmal there uh mm-hmm you just go there and get them like it's it's good stuff [Music] and by like can I do that Sun is really bothering it's really bothering me down d'arnot all okay there I don't know that'll have to do um was I talking about them mmm I don't remember well with the can of the Canada's no like they never let me down they just a face cell is it was very good so you should go there I don't understand why like people are so against feeling like this you don't there's nothing wrong with what you're feeling you don't you know what's going on and stuff I mean I don't understand that so like what you know think it's Saturday why I like smoke a joint and do edibles like what's wrong with that it gives you like you know time just to relax that's what I think it just you know that's what it does for me and if you didn't want to do the animals and you know there's the other there's other ways of doing it but I feel really well like I feel like you want to get comfy I'm in the chair with the I watched all the the what do they called the throw blankets today and like we have quite a bit so but those are like there's always soft and stuffed you know and you hang them outside and they have that outside smell and I just I think that's what I will be doing after is getting one in or two of those blankets and just watching something TV or something and covering up with the pie cake I'm just just chilling I should have brought something else other than these nibs I can't get the munchies do I feel paranoid yes yes as in I wouldn't answer the door at all continue doing whatever it was I was doing stuff feels really good good like [Music] I don't know how to describe it I really don't I feel like um I'm just really good like um not like good like yeah I'm not be but good like as in relaxed and I guess at peace like just really like you're enjoying stuff like you have time to enjoy stuff that's how I felt also any aches and pains and it helps with that it helps Brooke like everything I can can't think of a thing that it wouldn't help with subjects we were sad you'd be happy after if you were when I was a kid okay so the way I'm sitting on the bed I'm one legs just dangling down and I'm ever like when I was a kid I used to always think there was something something under the bed that hurt you know I grabbed my knees my feet probably for my ankle I remember him I remember like I go I got so bad that at my parents house the hallway and off to the right there was the bathroom and then there was my room at the very end of the hallway was a closet and on the left side was my parents room and my brother's room and everybody it you know had to go get a drink of water or something and my bed was never close to the light switch so I don't have to shop the light go like at the beginning of the hallway run as fast as I can and just get like step into my room and you'll leap across onto my bed because I thought there was something under that was gonna grab my feet and then I get that I you know it's probably like I know it's nothing but I still get that feeling sometimes and it happened while I was doing that so that's why I told you I don't remember I was talking about before this and it's probably not gonna come back to me either but hate when that happens [Music] that's good I would like I highly recommend it it was like I took it I 530 so he's hired at 5:30 I kicked in like seven ish maybe a little bit after not much and it's oh I can't hang on okay and it's going on 7:30 right now so like you're gonna feel like this for a while so which is good

deputies around to keep you safe from all the bandits welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I get a lot of questions about people asking for tips for determining if an edible is potent as advertised so today guys I'm gonna share with you five common sense tips on how to avoid getting scammed when it comes to buying edibles getting scammed at the dispensary is pretty easy it's a nascent market with little to no regulations and zero accountability there's also lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of money to be made so lots of money and no accountability equals sleazy scores for scammers and fraudsters and it's bad enough when dispensaries and growers mislead their customers on what strain or how potent the flower they are buying is but at least the customers can see the product they can verify its weight they can smell it or whatever other rituals they have to test their weed sure they may not be getting the premium product that they are supposedly paying for but if they're buying an amount they will generally get that amount edibles however are much easier to scan customers with a customer can't verify that 200 milligrams or whatever listed on the package is really 200 milligrams they don't see the edibles getting made they can't see it being packaged if you want to buy a product you've got to take the company at its word that their product is potent is advertised store that your dispensary isn't gonna sell you a shitty product and good luck with that so I don't want to scare anyone away from edibles because they're [ __ ] awesome there are tons of great and reliable edible companies out there and more certain to come soon and experimenting and trying new products is half the fun but before you go and buy something expensive you've never seen before try utilizing these five tips to save yourself some money and some heartache so tip number one don't trust weed maps or your bud tender for their recommendation both these places especially weed maps is swamped with a bunch of bots and fake reviews that amp up a lot of really shady companies like lol edibles or infused creations all those have been pumped up by their respective companies and they mislead you and also speaking of people that mislead you your bud tender may very well mislead you they may have some kind of sales contract or sales target for some specific edible or they may have some kind of relationship with an edible manufacturer and they may be just be trying to sell you something that is not very good I've certainly seen it happen many times I've seen a lot of bud tenders Hocking lol edibles saying it's you know the second coming do not be fooled by them do your own research ahead of time don't trust weed Maps don't trust your bud tender know what you're looking for add of time so tip number two is in this case you want to judge a book by its cover or you want to stick to those reputable brands and what I mean by judge a book by its cover is looked at like the packaging is the packaging nice is the packaging fancy does it really show off the edible and all its glory I'm just talking about canna Co I'm talking about Korova here these guys have great packaging vibrant packaging that really shows off and sells their product and generally speaking the fancier the packaging the nice of the packaging the nicer the product maybe because they have the money already from being a bigger brand to invest in their packaging you know I'm sure it's the dog wagging some tail here a little bit as to what comes first but really take a look at the packaging do not buy anything that's just in like a plastic ziplock bag with a sticker over it it's usually going to be a bad product you want to take a look and make sure it has respectable packaging faziz that's usually a pretty good indicator that it's going to be a decent product so again judge a book by its cover and stick to those reputable brands stick to the big-name guys out there the big-name guys are big names for a reason again that's gonna be your Korova that's gonna be your Kiva that's gonna be your Kanaka that's gonna be your flourish the big guys are big again for a reason and they all have nice packaging so again look for the fancy packaging stay away from crappy packaging it's usually a pretty good indicator that what's inside is just as what's it's just as crappy as what's on the outside so tip number three is baked goods are good and chocolate is the best so I'm gonna go ahead and combine this with don't be a dummy stay away from gummies that is mostly true almost all gummies are bad with a few very notable exceptions like flourish do not get infused creations do not get at up here you're gonna see a ton of prepackaged edible or gummy edibles out there and they are almost always terrible with again a very few exceptions when it comes to gummies if you see flourish go and pick them up but outside of that stay away from the gummies there are usually a little bit cheaper than other things usually sometimes even substantially more so but that's for a reason because they are not as potent as advertised so stick away from the gummies State stay close to the baked goods your cookies and your brownies not even the Krispies like the rice krispies treats the fruity Krispies i'd stay away from those as well I don't find those to be as potent your brownies and your cookies are your best bets but for the absolute best bet go with the chocolate bars that is the best way I have found on all of my reviews for getting THC and the most potent gram for gram has always been chocolate bars kiva bang for twenty two phones say all those great ones there's so many out there and it's usually if you can find a chocolate bar it's gonna be a fun fun ride so again tip number three baked goods are good chocolate is the best stay away from gummies alright so that brings us to tip number four and that is to look for independent lab testing results this is a big one if you can find on you package or somewhere actual lab testing results that is he and don't just look for them to say lab tested look for the actual results you'll see tons of edibles out there lying about being lab tested and then this that and the other but if they don't have that actual result printed on the package it's no good plenty of people will lie about being lab tested or they'll get one product lab tested and say their entire line is lab tested if you don't see the actual results it's wasn't lab tested just go with that so look for that lab tested results look for independent verified results printed on the package or if not printed on the package printed it on a sheep close by something that will let you know that is as potent as advertised so again if you can find those lab tested results and it comes up as potent as advertised go and pick up that product it's gonna be good to go and then finally our fifth tip here is the most important one and the one that I cannot stress enough and that is you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles if there is a deal that seems too good to be true if you see a 500 milligram rice krispies treat for ten dollars don't go running for your wallet to pick it up and buy up the entire stock because they're lying to you it's not gonna be 500 milligrams it's probably not even gonna be twenty milligrams it's probably just gonna be an operation to fleece you out of your money if something seems very expensive there's usually a reason for that if it seems out of line it's probably because it is high quality stuff made with quality cannabis and quality ingredients and it's gonna stand apart the best edibles out there do cost a little bit more but they are absolutely worth it and almost invariably true if a product seems to be too good to be true in terms of price it absolutely will be so stay away from anything that seems to be too good to be true in terms of pricing and make sure that you know edibles are expensive guys so don't be surprised when you have to pay 22 bucks for a hundred and eighty milligram chocalate bar that's just gonna be the way it is out here but again you get what you pay for so if you pay that premium for that chocolate bar that fancier looking brand you're almost certainly going to be rewarded in terms of potency or taste or whatever the case may be so you absolutely get what you pay for and guys those are our five tips there just to run through them one more time don't trust weed maps or your bud tender for your recommendation do judge a book by its cover stick to those reputable brands number three baked goods are goods chocolate is the best stay away from gummies number four look for those independent lab testing results and then number five you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles what you pay for is what you get so if the deal seems too good to be true it very likely is and guys that's gonna do it just follow those five tips and you should be ready to enjoy some high-quality edibles and if you guys have any other tips or pointers that you want to share just

rice krispies treats with some cereal they contain a hundred grams of CBD great treat and get medicated good life smoke shop bye", "k6FyvC_HVwg": "[Music] howdy-doody friends welcome wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and let's just get straight into it on this review we don't need any preamble we don't need anything and I know I'm being ironic right now by talking further after I saying let's get right into it but right now we are getting right into it and this is a review that I am super excited for because it is my favorite company my favorite edible company out there we are taking a look at one of their new products their hundred milligrams snickerdoodle and that's right it's by the fine fine fine folks at canna Co this is their updated 10 milligrams 1010 milligrams scored pieces I've reviewed one of these already they're chocolate chip cookie it was wonderful I loved it loved it loved it I thought that their solution to the California system of edibles where you could only have 10 every edible has to be 10 servings of 10 milligrams each it's pretty ludicrous the last one was just like barely cut into ten like a pie like ten slices of a pizza but really I just ate it as one thing and as I assume anybody will and I that's what I plan on doing here as well guys I'm gonna eat this whole cookie maybe not the whole thing in front of you because I don't want to bore you to death but I'll rest assured I will eat this whole snickerdoodle cookie and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because that is what you are here for because I can already tell you this is gonna taste great because one it's a snickerdoodle into its can of coke so let's open it up let's talk a little bit about the packaging first wonderful incredible packaging from canna Co as always all the information you want to see nutrition information ingredients all that great stuff all their information on where to find them at Instagram at Facebook all that great stuff so perfect packaging nice and simple why don't we open it up on the inside and we've got the actual product in here and it is in a different color bag normally it comes in a color-coordinated bag but I guess if they're only doing 100 milligram edibles at this point they don't really need multiple colors they can do with just one so begin this is the snickerdoodle I'm a big fan of snickerdoodle cookies and I'm a big fan of canonical products so I gotta say my expectations for this one are pretty damn high here is the snickerdoodle cookie just as ludicrously cut into 10 pieces you can barely even see those score marks on it if they don't reflect through to the other side insane that that is a 10 10 milligram pieces but I don't personally care I would much this is actually much preferable to me then the Korova solution of 10 mini cookies give me one cookie give me one thing to eat and I too much time explaining these rules they're terrible that's all you need to know here's the cookie Kanako's snickerdoodle let's give it a bite it's got more bun almost a lemonade quality than most snickerdoodles I've had less cinnamon tea it's good I mean it's a good cookie I think in terms of taste I prefer their chocolate chip cookie to the snickerdoodle um but you're not gonna eat this and hate it I've had a really bad snickerdoodle I a with the TKO snickerdoodle cookie it was dry crumbly just in the tasted film this tastes good I mean legitimately I'm happy even it's the magic of candy coat well guys I'm gonna finish off this cookie I'm gonna break it into little triangle sized pieces here and then eat them in ten different ways yeah right I'm gonna eat the whole thing because I'm not a lunatic and guys I will see you in two hours to let you know the effects thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you in just a bit [Music] hi guys I'm back it's been two hours since I last checked in welcome back to weeds pardon the green-screen they're in the back I'm just a little spoiler alert a little too damn high to move it or to care to move it that is that's because canna Co worked it's magic again this is a hundred milligram dream this wasn't my favorite tasting Kanak oh but that Kanaka I'm starting to convince be convinced is can I can can I do no wrong is that yeah that's how that pun is supposed to what I was supposed to say is can I do no wrong but I messed it up and that's okay because everything's feeling great I love these guys I love their products this is just another winner I don't know why I mean you can tell how much I love them because how many of their reviews I do it's because I'm always excited to see them and I'm always excited to get a chance to try a new one and share it with you guys at this point there's no real beneficial reason for me to do these because we just know they're gonna be great but it's an excuse for me to have you know a great time myself so I'm gonna be a little indulgent a little self-serving and and do these reviews every now and then still so another winner from Kanak Oh again it's not my favorite tasting of theirs it's uh if you're going with a hundred milligram line I actually really like the chocolate chip cookie I thought was really good and that lemon drop or whatever it's called lemon sugar cookie that one's pretty good too but it's you know it's not bad it's far from the it's it's it's it's in good tier it's in a good it's it's in the good tasting tier for one hundred milligram edible so it's just not the their best anyways that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats sorry for the delay back with my cherry on top for the week and that is something that I have found myself surprisingly getting back into months after it has come out and months after it's sort of heyday and that is splatoon - on the switch I have played so much of it in the past two weeks more than I ever did when it first came out big reason being my partner picked up pretty switch and also got a copy of it so we have been playing it together and I used to I always enjoyed the game I always thought always a really well-designed game and certainly a novel interesting and what would you describe it optimistic design aesthetic something you know very different something that isn't about just killing other people but still captures that shooter feel I always liked it but I never I would get sort of bored out of it out of there a couple of games or I'd want to move on to something else but after finding it you know with my partner playing I can just play it over and over again and really really enjoy it and I actually stream that over at my other twitch channel or a youtube channel which is who be arted who we are did well you can figure it out H oh wait wait how you spell that WH o PR t he D ooh boy that Kanaka is still having great but yes I've been really enjoying splatoon too and if you guys have a switch you've got to give it a shot feel free to play with me and even if you don't have a switch it might be good enough or that Plus Zelda and Mario might be good enough to warrant picking one up if you have any any passing interest in any of those they're all spectacular but that's gonna do it for this cherry on top guys thank you so much for listening and we will catch you on our next review peace", "KVKmLQ4HwZ0": "hi everybody so today I'm going to be doing a review on the medicated hard candies this one is great so it's a hundred there's the 100 milligrams of THC right there it's from cannabis no I did the blue raspberry one before and I I didn't taste blue raspberry at all so hopefully this one tastes like grape I'll take them all why not so open and all these flippin things I can never okay always stuck together but it's not just so like I'll show you what they look like Thanks so they look like this like usually come like this these ones are because of the heat but they they come like this so they're 25 milligrams each you get four blocks which equals the hundreds milligrams I'll just a little piece so they look I broke it off as I was talking they look like that just little little cubes so it tastes like a little bit like grape and that was probably add I can taste the grape in these okay I can still taste the the THC but overall the grape flavored hard candies from Canada's mom are good that's like sometimes you get a little bit of THC and the rest of time it's grape so it's just about 6:00 p.m. right now this usually takes like an hour and a bit to kick in usually I'll be back alright told you guys know when it kicks in you know all the good stuff but so what I'm gonna do actually cuz it takes so long I'm going to roll a joint and I'll smoke that while I wait for this to kick in and it should be decent ah-ah-ah I'll really join up and smoke that and come back and let you guys know [Music] all about the hard candies from cannabis no okay I'm back and as you can see this stuff has kicked in so I smoked it what I told you guys I was going to roll the joint I smoked the gorge and if you want to see that part you'll have to go and watch the video before mine or yet before mine in its video I smoked it so I took I took this at 6 and I want to say like around seven ish I could start to feel it and it was like oh this feels good and then so then I was like you know what I'm gonna wait a little bit just to see if anything is different or so I waited and I was like so lolling around because it's 8:30 right now and this stuff is I didn't realize how strong the scats and like you feel good but you don't want to do anything like you're like everybody I would recommend you take a shower cuz the shower feels good if the reason I took the showers because I wasn't feeling very well and cuz I just kept on getting stronger and like I tried to sit down and relax and that didn't help and then I was getting like these pains like it was like really really deep into like that the area where sometimes it's painful anyways and yeah like I didn't feel well so I took a shower and that that helped okay I feel like better like I don't feel like I'm gonna throw up cuz that's what I felt like I'm not really sure why but like if you were to do this at somebody else's house um you might as well bring like your pajamas or something cuz I think you wouldn't be leaving yet BRE thirsty on this this is a this isn't oh my [ __ ] like this is really good get in cannabis Mel cuz their stuffs good yeah you really don't feel like doing much like um you're in the shower for like a long time and it's like really hot so that you know that feels good whatever but then it gets to the point that there's like too much Steve in there so you know whatever and then you just feel like doing like nothing but you may want to find like a good place to sit or lay in watch TV or just think about things or just really do nothing I wouldn't recommend like reading a book cuz I don't really think you'd get far you me at this point in like I'll keep busy but like if you were to read a book I think right now I'm like if you started to you would you wouldn't get very far like you would you would have I could forget just talking about oh okay if you're reading a book like you may get maybe ten minutes and then you probably fall asleep because this stuff makes your eyes like really heavy like they just like they feel like heavy hit down here like I think anybody could tell that you were high because there would be no hiding that one not only hungry or anything thirsty yes but like I'm not hungry or anything so that's good because I think if you were to eat a lot on this right now just because I mean probably like not feel very well like you'd probably throw up or something yeah and the grape um the grape flavor yeah I think it's good I so far that's the only one that I've had actually tasted like what it said cuz usually like I say I could just taste the THC in it oh I am so thirsty what's relaxes you I find to like your I think if you had like sore muscles you know from doing whatever running or I don't know just it kind of like eases everything like it just kind of like your muscles don't feel all like like in a like in a ball like however like that they feel more like you know just like they're just relaxed so if you have pain regarding that this would take it away if you have like just general aches and pains this would be also the stuff that you would like to sit down to like this is the stuff that if I would like to be sitting on a porch and like in a porch I say in on Auto Parts I hope to god I didn't say invited yes sitting on a porch like you know like the farmland type of stuff I can't like a great big it's like I'm just meadow way out there and you can just sit in your rocking chair and just look out into the meadow um this would be the stuff to do it on because you may find like it would be peaceful because you wouldn't be around like neighbor you wouldn't have neighbors and stuff and I think that would be something good for people to experience you may find like a peace with yourself or something like that I don't not really sure so just walking away yeah I don't even I don't even know what I'm gonna do but I have to stay busy because I will fall asleep everywhere looks so comfortable yeah you're not like this high isn't getting any like lower whatever it's not decreasing it's just there like it's it's just there where like no matter like you tried to think it off or just like it's just there like your whole everywhere your whole body is high I guess which is a little weird and I never thought of it like that but I guess so right because that's so I don't know unless it I don't know maybe I just want to talk about stuff I can't um what else what else does this make you feel like doing mmm if you had a lot of time on your hands and you wanted to redecorate your say living room or something the base would be the stuff to do that because you'd be so concentrated on how you know everything looks and how blends in together and stuff like that this is like the stuff that I will say to that you would want to say if there was like one Christmas thing that you did by yourself you know I don't think putting up the tree would be that but if it could be maybe you'd anyways or whatever this is the stuff that you would want to want to do it on because you'd be doing that but then you have like a lot of thoughts just about things and hmm I don't remember what I was talking about so I will have to start I need a subject which I have no idea what it is you feel kind of like exhausted on this like you just you know such a hard day Wayne you did have a hard day but if you didn't have a hard day this stuff makes you feel like you had like just an exhausting day that's good seeing them like like now like it's getting closer to 9:00 and you're hungry like it's a little bit there now but it's not like you need to like be something really good and you're you may want it but then you may wait like Oh see I told you it makes you I feel tired and your eyes really worried I couldn't imagine doing like anything real like like I know there's people hide like drink and drive and I know there's people that do other drugs and drive including lead or edibles and whatever but I don't know why you would drive when you feel like this I mean yeah you would be cautious but I don't know I just I don't know I to me that's not a very smart thing to do but you know just my opinion and um so anyways it's an oh my [ __ ] that's what it feels like to me that's like a whole review of it right there you get it at cannabis no I the package is not here but it's the medication hard candies grape yet four cubes and it's each cube is 25 milligrams of THC um makes you feel like doing nothing I'm very happy before like you get to this part I'm still happy I just feel more relaxed if that makes any sense I can relaxed and I'm happy relaxed not like well yes you can be pissed off and relax because that doesn't even make sense like I'm mmm I think I just need to somewhere I think so that's that's everything that's I don't that's everything I don't have anything else to talk about get a cannabis mom just charlie so that's it that's all bye", "8OJ6v23ah6w": "good morning guys I wanted to quickly go over how to calculate milligrams of THC and explain what it is exactly I think this is one worth knowing since milligrams of THC is quickly becoming the new dominant unit of measurement when it comes to trying to discuss dosages just like it's the dominant unit of measurement with prescription medication and a lot of other substances also in legal jurisdictions it's becoming increasingly the standard way to label the dosage up on marijuana edibles and drinkables when we talk about weed traditionally it was always done by weight grams ounces pounds and so on which was very broad and also very standard and in the last 15 years we also started using percent THC to be more precise which describes the THC content of a particular strain per gram and thus its potency per gram but that figure was always expressed as a percentage for example this strain is 12% THC but now we've gone one step further to the milligrams that milligram figure is not as confusing as it seems if you have one gram of weed also known as 1000 milligrams and it's a strain that's 12% THC that means there's 120 milligrams of THC in that single gram why do we need to take things to milligrams because one standard dosage especially when it comes to edibles has been defined as 10 milligrams 10 milligrams of THC is the amount of THC that a relative novice consumer would need to consume in order to feel mild of cannabis effects a mild high so if you buy a marijuana chocolate bar and it states that the whole chocolate bar contains a hundred and sixty milligrams that means that's that chocolate bar has 16 of those standard doses and they're most likely divided into the little chocolate squares in that bar now that doesn't mean that to the average marijuana consumer they'll be able to get decently stoned off of ten milligrams as I said in my episode on tolerance just like with alcohol marijuana tolerance Rises 10 milligrams is really just a measurement for novices for myself I need at least 25 to 30 milligrams and my tolerance is above average but it's nothing special I know super heavy marijuana users who don't feel much of anything until they get to about 50 milligrams but if you're just starting out with edibles 10 milligrams should be your first trial run obviously to control dosage on such like with such precision you have to live in a legal weed jurisdiction because that's the only way you're gonna see the percent THC or the milligram THC vigor expressed in a reliable way on the package so there you go now you know what milligrams THC is and how it might apply to you hope you enjoyed the show if you found it useful be sure to subscribe and hit that like button see you next time", "2t1zAl2y4WA": "what's up family and how we doing tonight and welcome to another great episode of Bammer TV I am Dave your host as always and don't forget to tune in to the weed reviews playlist we are posting a new weed review every week or two weeks right now so definitely tune in for that but today I want to give you a quick little how-to video on something that we really should be thinking about a little bit more and that is how to accurately dose your edibles the big thing with this is you don't want to accidentally give anyone an overdose it is possible to overdose on edibles I have done it it's not a very fun time what I want to tell you guys is how to accurately dose your edibles and it's actually a fairly easy process as long as you have all of the right information what information do you actually need for this process you need the accurate test results for your butt or your trim whatever you're using for your edibles and you need a reliable method of extraction and a reliable method of integration or homogenous ation into your edibles to make sure that it's fairly dose throughout the entire batch and not just you know you have one cookie that's 500 milligrams you have another cookie that's 10 so you take your test results from your reliable lab or however your tester marijuana and you take the number that is the percentage of THC so the average is about 24 so let's go with 24 for today so if you're T of your weed has an average of 24 percent THC in your test results that breaks down to 240 milligrams per gram if you're not good at math here we go one gram is one thousand milligrams so if you have 24 percent of that is THC you know that it's 240 milligrams per gram is THC so what do you do with that information you take that number times it by however many grams of marijuana you want to add into your butter oil tincture have whatever you want to do and that is your total dosage for that product say your you use 10 grams of 24% THC marijuana so you know that your batch currently has 2,400 milligrams of marijuana if you're using this in edibles and say you're dosed in your butter the same way and you want to make sure you get 12 cookies out of this batch you take your 2,400 milligrams of THC divided by 12 and now you have 12 200 milligram pieces to enjoy as far as dosing for beginners and whoever else may be eating these you have to understand when you consume edibles your system intensifies it there's an enzyme in I believe it's your liver that transfers the Delta 9 THC into Delta 11 THC which is approximately four times more potent so you have to be very careful when you're dosing your edibles because even a dose of 50 milligrams in your system is more like 150 to 200 milligrams so you really have to be careful with this stuff that being said guys remember you need accurate test results from your lab you need accurate and reliable homogenous ation skills to make sure that everything is completely incorporated throughout the entire batch and then you need to be able to do some basic math that's my little spiel for today I hope you enjoyed it like I said in the beginning tune in for more weed reviews and other marijuana product reviews and like I said I'm Dave from Bama TV pleasure as always and I'll be seeing you there [Music]", "dO7VuHMBPhI": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today we're going to be doing another edible review we are going to be reviewing the very well known but new to me wild edibles so let's talk a little bit about wild in general they are a portland-based edible company and they specialize in using things that remind them of the pacific northwest and what makes it special and using those ingredients and those fruits and other items found in nature to make these awesome little gummies now in this box there is a hundred milligrams and there are ten small gummies i also want to just talk about real quick how the packaging is it is so cool so you open it like this and out comes this little pocket super easy to open you just squeeze on the side like this bam pop open and you will find these small little sugar coated gummies these gummies are made all with natural flavoring i absolutely loved these edibles they are not overly sugary at all which is fantastic they taste like a natural gummy something that you will find like in a trader joe's or something like that i started out with 40 milligrams and it hit it hit good too i loved it i wasn't overly i didn't feel dumb which some edibles can make someone feel dumb i didn't feel dumb i didn't feel like falling asleep was just so awesome i've been finding too many edibles lately that make you just want to pass out and these guys kept me up kept me going and once the high kind of wear it off and the after effects kind of left i still was able to have a great functioning day which is really nice i love the artwork that will did i love these little huckleberry flowers you'll see all over it and i believe every box looks a little different it goes with whatever the flavoring is which is really awesome on the inside it gives a little message and i'll read that for you the edible contains hybrid perfect for preparing for life's adventure it's a little like the perfect balance of wearing pajamas to work i just really appreciate the the thought process that went into the packaging and making of these edibles now i believe these guys are the number one selling edible in all of oregon and it makes sense they're based in portland but i found them also all over california they are a little bit more expensive than your normal edible but they are extremely consistent some edibles are really great one bag and they can taste great they'll be just like mind-blowing you can give a bag to your friend next thing you know they say it never hits them i don't believe this will be a problem with these guys i'd say if you if you were going to be hanging out at the house like all of us are right now but you're going to be studying maybe doing something for work i'd say eat one of these little guys and you're going to be chilling you'll be chilling you'll be chilling hard yeah so if you guys see these little edibles anywhere i would say pick it up you will not be making a mistake i promise you all right guys so that will be it for my small little review again my name is sarah b thank you guys so much for tuning back into the haze if you like this video please hit that like please hit that subscribe if you want to see more reviews and if you've tried wild please leave a comment below and tell me what you thought about them again guys my name is sarah b thank you so much for watching the haze your guide to a cannabis infused lifestyle and i will see you guys next time you", "zF9psraVJiU": "[Music] marijuana's review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review it is a classic that's right it is an edible review today on wheats and today we are taking our first look at a product from a Satori Satori cannabis infused highbush blueberries in dark chocolate I don't know where the highbush blueberry is but I'm excited to try I've uh this has a big big competitor out there in the wonderful Kiva chocolate covered blueberries so we'll see if Satori can hold their weight this is a modern animal in California so it is compliant with all the packaging regulations and of course the THC limit which is a hundred milligrams and at least ten servings curiously there is a sticker here under the net weight that says two point four seven ounces let's see what they covered up or maybe they just didn't have anything there in general they forgot to put something let's see what's underneath the sticker I'm just genuinely curious oh they just said it was fifteen more ounces than it is or grams rather sorry who knows what happened probably a in production that would be my guess so again the company is Satori and on the back you've got everything you would like to see you've got your nutrition facts you've got your lab results right there which are having a little trouble focusing love to see those and of course you've got your ingredients and all that fun stuff and then unfortunately we've got this shitty packaging which I always suck it open so just bear with me because this might have to be one of those times that I run grab the scissors and just say effort because the the instructions never really do do this any justice locate lip with grey dots and oh boy I'm going to go locate some scissors which I now happen to keep in the office how smart is that go me this sealable bag and here we go so here are our chocolate covered blueberries excuse me here are highbush blueberries lalala and let's give my taste yeah neutral dark chocolate covered blueberries um not bad I want to call it Kiva good but um there's a slight a slight but not overwhelming and on the edge of noticeable even cannabis taste with these but really you're tasting mostly chocolate and blueberry um so no complaints on that front the chocolate itself is good not super super great again I think the Kiva tastes a lot better but these are these are fine I have no problem eating all 50 of these in here I guess if they're too mega 2 milligrams THC per piece so I'm guess I'm gonna beat about 50 of these over the next couple of minutes and guys like all our weeks with use if you've blown or if you've never seen one before what we do is I'm gonna eat this whole package to screw this you know ten servings nonsense I'm gonna eat the whole package and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of every edible review do you get up or not so guys I'm gonna finish these off and I will see you guys in just a bit peace satori cannabis infused high brush blueberries in dark chocolate in the intervening two hours I neglected to look up what high brush blueberries are so I still don't have that to tell you but what I do have to tell you is that I like this product it's not perfect it's gotten me to about a five right now for a hundred milligram edible that's not too bad the taste is pretty good I enjoyed the taste oh and I forgot to mention the price at the very beginning it seems to be about in the range of every end now right at 20 bucks at my dispensary so this was uh this was a pretty good one it didn't have to eat too much but you did have to actually eat quite a bit there were 50 of them in there it seemed like more to me but maybe I'm mean I certainly wasn't counting but again I'm pleasantly hi it tasted good and in this new world that's about as best you can really hope for all that being said though I am still gonna recommend if your dispensary has this and kid the kiva blueberries get the kiva blueberries even if they're an extra five bucks or something trust me they taste a lot better and they're probably I think they're a little bit more potent too so yeah go for the Kiva if you see them there but this is a totally fine substitute and if if you're not looking for a bunch of mini cookies right now this this uh this should do the trick for you I would imagine so that's gonna do it for this review here guys on wheats it's about a 3/4 thumb up which I'm happy enough with but before I totally bounce I'm gonna share with you a little cherry on top something a little extra ad to your weeks that you can enjoy with or without marijuana whatever the case may be and this week I want to recommend to you another movie this movie is the first movie I have seen in theaters twice in one week the I saw it two times in a single week in the theaters and that's the first time I've done that since I believe the Fellowship of the Ring back in 2001 and that movie is sorry to bother you not a perfect movie by by any means but in a potentially future I mean definitely a future cult classic maybe even just straight-up classic once the rest of the world catches on you may or may not have heard of this movie I will be very brief in my description and try to give away as little as possible because the story goes and really unexpected places but the elevator pitch a young black man in Auckland gets a job at a call center and he learns at the call centre to basically be the best salesperson he needs to use his quote unquote white voice and his white voice is dubbed by a different actor hysterical thought-provoking and just a great film check it out it should be on video on demand probably by the time this review goes up so that's gonna do it for that cherry on top again that is the film sorry to bother you by the wild-ass director of boots riley and the review again was Satori cannabis infused hi brush blueberries a loved one like the other so thanks so much for sticking around here to the very end guys really appreciate it and we will see you on the next week's review peace",

welcome to episode 7 of the ganja geezer it's a very sunny afternoon here in Colorado at convenient I just looked for 20 p.m. so for 20 I'm going to do another review today and what we're going to be reviewing today is a product called the blue kuduro pick this up last week as a buy one get one i'm going to try the hybrid version of it today so combinations teva indica and this is made by a company called MIP manufacturer website dub dub dub deep blue kudu calm I'll put that link down in the description 100 milligrams in this bar and it's kind of when they described it to me it's kind of like a tootsie roll so the ingredients on this are chocolate organic vanilla extract organic tangerine flavor oil powdered sugar organic coconut oil nonfat dry milk cocoa powder light corn syrup and cannabis and again there's 100 milligrams in this little nut log here there's a technical difficulty so what I'm going to do now it's also know also here it says new and improved recipe and then I've always loved new and improved always implies that it was old and lousy before so I'm going to take this thing and it doesn't seem to be really very packets friendly here so I'm peeling off the end it's going to peel back I'm probably to take about a fifth of this it's kind of crumbly it's not like a toy Tootsie Roll is kind of like a compressed brown kind of crumbling off as I check yeah it's kind of nasty so when I cough about that much little knife down here I'm very soft softer than a 20 cut off the end here got your rather unappetizing little compressed now and avoid instead of the circle so let's pop this in the mouth and see what happens the very weedy very very weedy and taste nobody would eat this and I realize it's not just a chocolate brownie or chocolate fudge it's got more of a consistency of fudge and then a tootsie roll it's not nearly as chewy but again a heavy heavy on weedy taste and 100 milligrams per log so that would and I pay ten dollars for this now to be fair i got this buy one get one at the giving tree it was a the buy one get one day for selected edibles there but i'm going to evaluate this based on its actual list price so that would give it am milligram per doc milligram to dollar ratio at ten so that's not very good that's Louis one of the three that I've reviewed so far that's it for now if I think of anything else up tomorrow when I come back and give you the evaluation for the actual pain relief and effects I'll let you know well it's next morning now this is the recap of the review of the blue kuduro the 100 milligram hybrid version that I took about a quarter of the roll last night so that should have been around 20 to 25 milligrams and let's recap the taste and consistency well this ain't no tootsie roll you know this kind of way it was described to me at the dispensary this Mort tasted like a dry fudge with a serious ganja funk I mean it was a really strong there's no way you can miss it the aftertaste wasn't bad but not good I've said the consistency was the most unappealing thing about it it kind of tasted like dry dry really dry fudge just like a Elmo sandy taste so with that I have to say I have to give the edible rating of this as six so taste rating on this of the four of them out of the four rating from my scale I give it a six now pain relief this is the high point of this um little long goodie this worked really better than I expected based on its reported milligram content within 90 minutes I was fully medicated and at that peak I experienced a serious body effect I mean it was a significant body effect I could really feel that the pain relief was excellent felt a little heavy in the body but not in an unpleasant way and also a very solid head effect a very lightheaded fat and solid had effect nothing that I couldn't handle it wasn't like I was unable to comport myself in public I would say this hybrid definitely lean toward the indica side of the scale based on amount of body effect but overall very very good lasted also for a very long time the head effects were gone within four to five hours and the body fix lasted until after I fell asleep now so that was 6 plus 6 7 plus hours and woke up this morning felt very good was able to do a three mile mark with a mile walk with minimal discomfort after the way I felt yesterday that was saying something I have to give the coup du roule to some hybrid cooter roll a 9 rating on pain relief so very very good third part of my I'm rating scale is side effects as I said I got a significant amount of body high and that made for some couch lock not bad i mean it i was very very relaxed actually sat through an episode of american pickers and I hate shows like that so I kind of tells you i might have experienced some couch lock but i was stable still able to read in function i was also able to go out into a couple errands so I was not scared to go outside or didn't feel uncomfortable so I'll give this a good solid raining of 84 lack of side effects very good and value this is where it gets hit again this is 100 milligram role for ten dollars that's its list price now I said before that I got it as a bogo the buy one get one at the giving tree so instead of 100 milligrams for ten dollars i got 200 milligrams for ten dollars but that's a sale price and i only go by a retail price for the rating so at the retail price of 100 milligrams per ten dollars it gets the rating at the ratio of 10 milligrams per dollar and that's the worst i've done so far and i'm going to have to give that a value of six on the scale alright in summary that means that you had a 64 taste a 9 for pain relief a sick an 84 side effects and a 64 value that gives you after you / for a ganja geezer rating of 7.25 but actually you notice there it's a 7 I decided that as subjective as these are you don't I'm just going to round down if it's below point 5 on the scale I'm going to round down if it's above point 5 on the scale I'll round up so the actual rating will be a 7 well that's it for now that's a review of this next maybe not next time but I had to mention here that I had a low kudu sativa role which I will be reviewing the future i'll probably do it in a much shorter format maybe just actually do the effects and not the unwrapping and everything just to say how that worked out but until then i'm going to say goodbye and stay medicated you", "szIfo0BJMs0": "[Music] there's a color-changing pineapple behind me see know what that means it means it's time for weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode I'm gonna help you make sense of one thing I have never understood at any of the dispensaries I've been to because I have seen this product at practically every dispensary that I have been to and I have never ever picked it up because it always seems like such a bad deal to me and that is cheeba choose as I said I have seen these at practically every dispensary of it around but I have never actually picked them up because they just seem like a tremendously bad value so this is their extra strength hybrid and chew at a hundred milligrams of THC see if we can actually get that oriented properly for you probably not oh there it goes um so yeah you can see hundred milligrams of THC 520 milligram doses but let's look at the back and you can see that price tag they sell this for 15 bucks I got a discount for 13 to 13 dollars for this tiny tiny tiny little thing now I do like small edibles I do actually have always have an affinity for potent things in small packages that's what she said but this just does not seem like it could do the job hundred milligrams isn't that much especially for 15 bucks and it just doesn't seem like it could pack that much of a punch in something this small I mean I've had like the punch bars before which are quite small or I've had the bang the bite and each of those actually had nearly twice as much THC in them as there's this thing did and they were considerably bigger even still so I do not know what to expect I'm hoping because they are everywhere they're sort of ubiquitous that means that there's some reason they're so popular and they're as potent as they are but we're about to find out together all I know is if this ends up being a disappointment I'm gonna have some harsh words for Chiba Choo so I'm gonna shut up now open this up pop it in my mouth poll tell you how it tastes and then I will be back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling although for you it'll be just a couple of seconds okay so I'm unraveling it here comes in it is definitely a caramel I don't know how you would split this in five doses otherwise it's pretty pretty mushy it smells good it smells like a caramel I'm just gonna plunk this whole thing right my mouth I'm gonna do it in two bites just do it in one here we go well maybe actually cut some music in my new tune there we go down the hatch so it taste is good you've got to give him credit for that wow that was a really good taste in caramel perfect sort of consistency very little cannabis taste I was happy with that but what I'm unsure about is how this bad boy is actually going to hit me for that guy's you're gonna have to wait a couple seconds me on the other hand I'm have to wait a couple hours to see what its gonna do to me I will let you know I'll see you guys in just a bit peace it's been two hours guys since I had the Chiba juice and it's just as I feared Chiba I'm afraid I do not choose you it's it's about as bad as I had hoped um yeah I can't say I feel nothing I would say I'm at maybe a three two and a half somewhere in there um so you know not high at all you know I feel something maybe there's sort of the effects after you had smoked a joint an hour later or something just like the echo of a high so it's you know it tasted good I like the taste of the chima choose it's just too expensive for what it is and does not provide enough of a high I have tried other 100 milligram edibles that I've hit harder than this and that 15 bucks for this thing it's just it's it's too much I cannot recommend the Chiba choose at this point I don't think I would be reviewing any more Chiba choose just because you know one and done with this one maybe unless you guys really have some wrong feelings about other ones or if there's something you really want me to review from cheap at you let me know but otherwise this one is enough of a bummer on its own then I don't feel like I have to run down there their entire catalogue I think they have more projects than this I think anyways that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and I will see you on our next review peace pretty good", "Xzvry5RWQIo": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "HUb6baa_ym4": "hey guys welcome back to my channel I hope you guys are having a good day you know what I mean like I'm so sorry for my wheel being in the way but um here's the thing I can't do anything about it because I don't have my tripod my tripod broke I try to get a tripod the other day and they didn't have any for some reason so I'm guessing I need to either order one online or just somewhere else I don't know what to really do about it but right now you're just gonna have to kind of deal with this I couldn't move it but then I'm gonna be like up here to video so I don't know what you guys would prefer see I'm saying like I just don't have any like flat oh that kind of worked okay okay we're gonna roll with it anyway so today I'm doing a quick little review on an edible eye balm I love edibles I mean I love him but at the same time they're deadly to me they're strong girl I took a edible for 4/20 it was the la familia hot chocolate one I took the whole thing and that thing smacked so today I didn't really want like a chocolate or like a brownie I wanted something like more candy like so I got the Smokies edible and these are in the sour blueberry fruit shoes basically so it's a hundred milligrams there's two milligrams of CBD per not per actually the whole bag is I guess that's what it is now per serving it's 10 milligrams of THC so per gummy and then 2 milligrams of CBD in one little gummy so I'm not gonna do the whole thing and by the way you guys this review is going to be really really [ __ ] forward really honest I'm gonna tell you guys about the taste I haven't opened these or anything yet so I want to record like my reaction of like the taste that I get instead of like trying them and then coming back and then you know my thoughts would be kind of you know what I mean so yeah anyways these are vegan this is a vegan uh thing not all of them are weakened from this brand so if you are vegan and you know you stay away from Dairy and stuff so I'll definitely ask them which one is the vegan one because I know not all of them are vegan but I know that their dairy they're gluten-free all of them are gluten-free but not all of them are vegan so I just got this because of the flavor you know what I mean so I'm not vegan so it doesn't matter to me but it's a good thing that it is vegan so I don't mind it and I don't really care so yes so the ingredients on here is just sugar corn syrup pectin I don't know what that is but it is citrus acid natural and artificial flavoring FD&C blue one which is probably like the color of the candy soy let union I don't know and then cannabis extract so the weed basically you know so yeah the sugars in this is four grams I'm thinking yeah per piece it's four grams so if I'm gonna have three of them for 12 grams of sugar when you do the math it's kind of a lot so these are sour they're Fruit Chews had crafted gluten free vegan and so I watched a review on these and people said that only 40 will do the trick I'm gonna try 30 just because I want to see how I feel and if I don't feel it as much I'm so sorry about the [ __ ] Sun oh my god but if you don't feel it as much then I guess well if I don't feel it as much because you're not going to taking them I am but if you don't feel it as much then I'll take then I'll take another one pretty pretty much but I know how adipose are they sneak up on me I keep eating them like I eat them and then I keep eating them and then boom you know so these were $21.99 okay before attacks at my dispensary so I think with tags and all the little bag they charge me for because I've got to break minds it was like $25 so basically it's really easy to open I just rip this up hopefully it's easy to open it cuz I haven't even opened it yet already strong it's kind of like this there's like a little this in here and I'm guessing you pull that apart and they open up they smell like blueberry literally like [ __ ] they smell like powder aid okay you guys the blue powder right that's what they smell like I totally spot on that's what I'm getting and they look really cute and like flat and big oh they're soft they're like super gooey look at all that little sugar let me just you know I'm saying basically they're just coated in sugar they're sour they're pretty big I would say they're like as big as a [ __ ] let me see some money up in here so this is a quarter and then they're a little bit bigger than a quarter even so okay you guys so I'm gonna try one and I'm gonna see you in like a week [Music] mm-hmm gather my thoughts okay so I'll say this they taste really good they have they're sweet they are sweet you know I'm saying like I'm not really like a candy person but I like gummies and like sour stuff so I can make an exception but they're really good I had one of these they don't taste like we do know what I'm talking about you know when you take some edibles and they have that weird like nasty aftertaste of the weed you know you can you feel on the back your throat and all that I don't get it with these ones so I'm gonna take another one this is gonna be my number two you know I'm gonna take the three in front of you guys so you guys know what's real and I'll check back in with like in an hour and two I got some laundry to do so I'm gonna be a little bit busy and then they're just gonna hit me like a truck and I'm gonna be gone you know what I mean I don't know I hope so I hope these are strong they were saying these were strong so they better be so this is gonna be twenty you know what I'm saying these are really good you guys like even if they didn't have ween in it I would probably eat them they're kind of like okay they're like a sour patch kit all most like they kind of remember that but they're not as sour they're like they're like up from sourness it's like a good five it's it's the perfect amount it's honestly good with this week and see what I mean so I'm gonna eat one more you know I'm saying well you know we get lead tea today [Music] he was a [ __ ] fly in here anyways these are really good I wish they had like a pack where they had like all the little flavors that would be really dope like you know they had blueberry rhinos berry that would be mom like a little mixed assorted pack but yeah so I've had if I'm gonna have three out of like seven left so that's 70 grams seven milligrams so basically I'm ready to eat another one this is gonna be thirty and I will check back with you guys and an hour or I think on the back it tells you yeah wait two hours so I'm gonna wait two hours and I think he's gonna give me pretty lip but I don't know because I'm not smoking at the time maybe I will smoke a bowl but I'm not gonna like smoke because I feel like when you smoke weed and you take edibles it's both of them combined and it's just too much so I'm really trying to see how strong these are going to be just with 30 milligrams and if you guys the real tea on this you know I'm going to eat the last one and then I'm gonna go and go do my little [ __ ] wash my drawers and then I'll be back and then I'll tell you guys how they are so yep sure yeah of course chuckles you guys but I told you guys I did a little bun you know what I mean it's like a tank guys so it's like eight o'clock now I took those three edibles at 6:00 it was kind of like noise in there but anyways there's six it's been like two hours I smoked a bowl I'm not really feeling it all that much so I'm gonna wait until like 20 more minutes see if it kicks in and then if not I'll take another alignment so then I'm gonna give it the complete fill out two hours so you know it's good at all so we'll see but if not I'm gonna take one more or maybe two more to see if it's gonna hit me later but yeah that was 30 milligrams and it's been like an hour and 40 minutes I don't really feel anything but I'm gonna wait 20 more minutes because you know how they are they hit out of nowhere so I'll be back with you guys I'm kind of talking fast I'm not trying to but it's just a quick update you don't even a brief summary so I'll be back and I'll see you in a bit hey y'all so it's an update it's been I think a day or so two days I don't know when I recorded that video but basically I'm here to give my initial and final final thoughts you guys about that edible the was it the sour blue raspberry by Smokies the gummies the Fruit Chews to be exact you guys they were [ __ ] smacking okay when I had the 40 milligram that night oh my god was I gone was like on I kept [ __ ] eating I didn't really felt them like hitting me like instantly instantly but I felt like they really creeped up little by little and I also feel like it took a little bit longer for 40 milligrams to hit me it took like I would say to and I have hours and then I was just like Munchie [ __ ] madness you know I was eating anything I was just eating chips food I ate even after my dinner like have some snacks if you're gonna eat some edibles because trust you're gonna need up and then what's getting pulled in here okay and then I took 50 milligrams that I think the day after okay I took 50 milligrams and that actually hit me a little bit sooner I would say that one they fit me I don't know why maybe like maybe because the timing that I took them at I feel like the first time I took the 40 milligram I took it at like 4 to 5 so it was like kind of late afternoon already so you know it girl was tired she was doing her SH and she was tired but the second time when I took it I took it earlier in the day I took it out like 2 o'clock because I wanted to be like awake and [ __ ] at least enjoy my high you know so I took the 15 milligrams and on this sweet so I took him I took him I'm chillin literally I would say two hours later two hours and ten minutes later it hit me I was at Walmart I was grabbing some things and that [ __ ] hit me like a brick like oh my god I was literally in one of the aisles and I was just [ __ ] dying you guys and I know you guys don't really care because don't everybody feels that way but I was legit like [ __ ] dying like over nothing and I was just like the [ __ ] but I realized that okay the edible so I know decided it's my cool I left Walmart and then even when I was home after that my boyfriend looked at me and he was like you're [ __ ] what did you do like I guess I was that [ __ ] high guys but I was like I just knew what it was you know to me that I didn't feel like I looked that [ __ ] high but I guess to somebody that you know from their point of view they would get it but um yeah to me I was really [ __ ] high but still productive so I would recommend taking them on like a very like good day that you're not gonna do [ __ ] you're gonna be eating a lot you're on your own time definitely don't do it if you're gonna go into work or something like that it's noticeable if you're high you know what I mean it is for me so my eyes got a little they got sleepy they got a little low they got red so you know but you guys the edibles smack I totally recommend them I'm going to try other flavors you guys I'm gonna do more reviews on this monkey's fan because I think it's probably one of the good ones okay really good really good so I've been totally gonna recommend to you'll I haven't tried other flavors but I definitely like the sour blue raspberry because I'm a sour person so you know I like sour candy so they were really my cup of tea so if you guys are into that I definitely recommend these edibles so that is my review you guys I don't want to keep going on and on and on but the same thing basically I rate him a 10 the taste is a 9 out of 10 the potency is a 10 out of 10 because I was gone with 40 so that's good because you can literally take 40 40 and then maybe the other two before work because it's like okay they're not gonna hit you as hard at vicious 20 milligrams you know what not as me as hard but like so like 42 like 60 it's like the perfect range for me yours might be a little different so I don't know so be careful but your dosage and all that dogs barking so I'm just gonna go and yeah you guys have a good day I'll see you on my next one bye bye", "ks2Cc1fykuE": "[Music] that wasn't that good welcome to wheats guys the marijuana review show will be help you make sense of your dispensary today's review is one I am particularly excited to share with you guys it is one of the most popular brands out there for edibles and that is cushy punch and today we are taking a look at their brand new flavor and now compliant with the new edible regulations here in California we are taking a look at their Private Reserve that's right it is a hybrid blend so this goes up there with their other hybrid they're indicated sativa and now they have a private reserve it is about one to two dollars more expensive depending on affability dispensary you can pick it up from and I am not sure what makes it Private Reserve I don't know what that even means maybe it's the fact that it's made with full-spectrum cannabis oil whatever that means or maybe the fact that it's not a food product means it's what it's a the Private Reserve I don't think so but we're gonna eat it the whole thing just like normal so this is as they say it is sixteen by sixteen 6.25 milligram doses which is compliant with the regulations and you can see on the back it's got all the information you want to see it shows the dosage ml 10 pieces wait 60 minutes ingredients nutrition facts and on the side here we've got gluten free dairy free fat free peanut free and non-gmo I was really hoping there was gonna be some gluten in there I'm a big guy peanuts can take I'm sorry if you do have a peanut allergy though I must make your life really [ __ ] so here we go here is the package on the inside like the old cushy punch it is divided and like the four squares but then they say you should divide those four squares into four squares of six point two five milligrams each I'm gonna guess nobody ever does that now I just have to figure out how to get this little foil little off here I don't see an open here anywhere oh I think I got it I think I got it guys just delicate easy and there we go oh yeah it is it is very easy to pull out twenty-five different little individual slices no it's not it's just one big glob yeah I'm sure somebody's gonna take the time to take a little knife and cut this up into twenty-five little squares and not do what I'm about to do right now and just plop this whole thing in my mouth actually I'm gonna eat about half of it right now and then plop the other half in in about half an hour come on out no come on daddy's hungry [Music] my camera person just laughed at me I'm gonna get fired for that nothing this is a paying job god damn all right we have our gummy it is for squares they're mean you can really taste the Private Reserve that actually does have I equal considerably less weed flavor than in the normal cushy there is a wee taste especially in the aftertaste it's not as strong as the other cookie punches it has a bit somewhat present like kind of fruity punch taste to it oh it's not bad it does again it does have a strong cannabis aftertaste but far from the worst in terms of gummies it's not pleasant but it's small enough and easy enough to chew down POC down that I'm not looking not dreading having to eat the whole thing so I'm gonna eat this other little half in probably about half an hour and I will see you guys two hours after that to let you know how this cushy punch ride that reserve is Landon thanks for watching wheats guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] johner matey [Music] yo jerks welcome back two weeks it's been about four hours since I checked in with you talking cannabis in ears cushy punch Private Reserve and it's only been four hours four not any particular reason largely just because I am lazy but I am happy to tell you that the cushy punch Private Reserve is at least as good as the normal cushy punch I'm not sure we declare it any better it seems to taste about the same maybe slightly better and I'm about as high as I am a hundred milligram cushy punch which is pretty good and high for a hundred milligram edible so I'm altum Utley quite pleased with this I picked it up for a cheaper price I believe only $12 which is a very cheap price I assume you're gonna have to pay if you're paying full price plus tax on this closer to 28 places and for that price I mean it's right in line with the other gummies it's probably worth it I'm not sure it's worth a premium over the normal cushy punch but if you're feeling fancy and you want to donate an extra dollar to the fine folks at cushy punch go for it I think I'll just stick with the regular ones from now on and that guys is gonna do it for this review thumbs up for me but before I go I want to share with you a little cherry on top something that can be enjoyed with or without weed something you could just watch and enjoy throughout your week and this one guys I do definitely definitely recommend that you have weed because you're probably not going to make it through without it and that is my favorite music video of all time and that is Corey Shores crying for America it's a bit hard to find I'm not gonna lie it's not easy son but I will be sure to include a link in the description so that you guys can check out this music video and feel inspired and maybe for the first time in three or four years believe in America I'm actually tearing up just thinking about it Wow again um this review is cushy punch Private Reserve it's pretty good but my cherry on top is [Music] I'm praying [Music] Cory you know what's gonna have trouble with this it's Cory shores crying for America and Wow Wow thanks for watching weeds guys we'll see on the next review", "ziGBxX3OPz4": "a review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking another look at an edible one from kirova we are taking a look at their third in their line of ten milligram ten mini cookies today we are taking a look at their ginger chew 100 milligrams in total 10 cookies 10 milligrams each this is our third look at Carrabba's mini cookie line I believe I think we've looked at their Saturday morning cookies in their chocolate chip ones so today we are taking a look at the ginger chew probably my favorite of all the kirova products so I'm super pumped for this one it's in their same very big packaging that they've got for their other mini cookies and on the back it's got all the stuff you need it's got the nutrition information how to open this packaging f-that though I brought my scissors because this is hard to open son oh we've got our ingredients there on the front everything you need to know and it says proudly packaged by Korova in Oakland at California so as I said this is our third time looking at these cookies I've had the same qualms every time I've looked at them in the past it's just a lot to eat it's a lot to ask of any person to eat in one sitting now granted it's designed to be 410 servings but I know a lot of us out there gonna eat the whole bag that's 400 calories a lot of cookies a lot to get through to get to get your edible dosage in for the day I'm going to attempt to open this childproof packaging but I assume I'm going to fail at it and eventually just going to have to open it the old-fashioned way with scissors but I'm gonna give it a go I'm gonna see if I finally can figure it out and the answer is looking pretty much like a know screwed straight to the scissors strike against you chromophore these nearly impossible open childproof packaging alright so here are our mini cookies they're in the bag all ten glory cookies whoops one escaped the bag that'll be our first one to go down there is the mini cookie they're dipped in cinnamon sugar mmm smells delicious smells just like a molasses or ginger cookie let's take a bite hmm now that's very different than their original ginger tube this is much more like your standard ginger snap and I like it it's very crunchy it's very crispy cooking it's not as chewy as their full-size ginger to cookies it's much more got that snap that crunch to it like your standard um molasses or ginger cookie really like it no cannabis taste whatsoever but in here very crunchy hmm I do like it though Wow these are good I wish I didn't have to eat ten of these you get a good high but you you know you have to accept it as it comes so guys in terms of taste Wow Kovu knocks it out of the park again but try not to talk with my mouth full this mic prime but as we all know guys it's not about how it tastes it's not about how it's packaged it's not about how it looks it's about how this product makes you feel and for that guys I'm gonna come back to you in two hours or for you it's just gonna be a couple of seconds and I'll meet you guys on the other side unless you know exactly how we're feeling after we've given this Korova ginger too many cookies the two hours it needs to fully hit so guys I will see you in just a bit to let you know how it's hittin thanks so much for watching weights and I'll see you soon peace [Music] sumos welcome back tweets it has been several hours since I last checked in with you and we got ourselves another grand slam home run slam dunk knock out of the park [ __ ] gold mixed metaphor sports metaphor wind metaphor for kirova and their mini cookies with their ginger chew oh my god I love this one uh this might be my favorite tasting Korova product yet I love the the I well I'm a big fan of ginger snaps molasses cookies and this one tastes actually even better than their 150 milligrams ones they're crispy crunchy exactly what I want no cannabis tastes the only problems with this package again it's not necessarily Carabas fault is how much you have to eat and how hard it is to open outside of those two things I mean this is a home run for kirova I am and all those mixed metaphors I used earlier love the taste love the texture the cookies love how high it got me got me up to the eight and a half level for a hundred milligram product this is utterly ridiculous it's really amazing absolutely love this if you see this at your dispensary and you're not afraid of eating a lot of cookies or or if your tolerance is lower and you just want to eat three or four cookies this is the way to go for sure this is another great product I've loved all their many cookies this is my favorite one by far though the ginger chew but it's really just gonna come down to your preference and cookies as I said love those molasses cookies love those ginger snaps and this is one this one is for me and it is a love pick it up if you see it and guys before I bounce here I want to share with you a little bit of a cherry on top we've been doing these more and more recently so I want to share with you another graphic novel I I'm not sure if the video had come out first I share with you why the last man I'm going to share with you my favorite graphic novel series of all time and it is also a show on AMC that I have not watch and that is preacher now preacher is only it's written by a man by the name of Garth eNOS it's not for the faint of heart it is incredibly violent it really puts the graphic in graphic novel I believe there are ten of them in total and it is an incredible story it is of the story about a the eponymous preacher who wants to go confront God and ask God why he has abandoned man basically and it is an incredible story start to finish and it goes to really unexpected places really wild places and has similarly to Y the last man one of the best conclusions in all of fiction ever one of the most perfect buttoned up absolutely pitch perfect conclusions I've ever read you've got to give it a shot again that is preacher by Garth eNOS it's a graphic novel if you're a little afraid of spending all the money it would cost to get it all up front go check your local library see if they've got preacher and give that first one a shot I think if you read that first one you're gonna be in for the rest so guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "NCOe80ySpkY": "Oh what's good I am a keel the real deal with LV cannabis for views and welcome to my video introduction for evergreens organics expresso dark chocolate bar see here in this package this is the 100 milligram version on the back we got all the lab results there the serving size is one tenth of the chocolate bar and there's ten serving size in here it's broken up nicely you see there's a THC warning on the pieces of chocolate you can really see the in the back there on the texture must really have expresso beans in there every green organics has a lot of respect here in Vegas and I had a chance to go visit the kitchen and I was very impressed to see that everyone in the kitchen well first of all there wasn't a lot of people in the kitchen but everything made in the kitchen is made by hand everything's cut by hand packaged by hand from the gummies they're trimming by hand the cookies everything is made with love there and a cool thing about this product is you can't really taste the cannabis even though there aren't any terpenes reported and the lab results I'm expecting a full body effect so if you want to see my full review for ever green organics espresso dark chocolate bar I'll see you at lv cannabis reviews calm [Music]", "G0jD8cPWg-s": "[Music] [Music] what up YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube this is where G smokes this is the only review video an edible review video of nature's greatest watermelon white chocolate one for those of you unfamiliar with Illinois laws I'm fairly certain that edibles can only be a hundred milligrams and that is the maximum allowance for any edibles apparently so unfortunately we really cannot rate this on the scale of one to ten in terms of potency so that will be out of the question but we will be rating it there's a how it tastes the presentation the delivery how fast it takes to thicken and also overall my general thoughts and I've actually never had an edible from this company I've never tried an edible of medical marijuana edible from Illinois dispensaries yet so this is gonna be my first one I'm really excited and without further ado let's get this thing pop open it's smells just like watermelon that's crazy again this is a white chocolate wanna know and bar you guys want to see the back here's the back I'll do a nice little zoom in for you [Music] total THC content is 100 milligrams total THC a is zero and comes in this fancy four-piece looking barn look at that guys it's just smells I gotta live it smells just like watermelon like that artificial flavor a lot watermelon regardless well well and has got green swirls through it now that's still presentation I like it I really I really think it looks just what it's supposed to smell and taste like and looks super watermelon II super kind of fake almost but I like that fake watermelon flavor anyways so here we go without further ado the one thing I have to point out is unlike a lot of chocolate bars these don't have the milligrams on them which is something maybe maybe something nature's grace can work on they're just blanks blank blocks and I know that so impatient prefer to have the milligram and the dosage on there terms of the flavor you can taste the wheat in there it's really good this is not a strain specific chocolate they do not give you what's in it you don't tell you what kind of strain trend uh ground whatever was used to create this Keef what-have-you hatch so my assumptions will be that it was probably made with trend some of the lower great stuff just to maximize your profits which is fine as long as it works and tastes good and we're gonna be the judge of that in a little bit I'm gonna get back to you guys after one hour after eating 125 milligram piece of this chocolate I'll let you know my overall thoughts what I think are strong overall it is in terms of daily consumption and is it worth the money and I'll Dee's I paid $16 for for the entire hundred milligram bar but typically they're $25 apiece I actually got them on that's the only reason why I'm reviewing them because otherwise I really stay away from edibles no Illinois I feel like 100 milligrams for 20 bucks and Ava's just not worth the money at all I've definitely had some strong homemade edibles that are like way beyond that that would just put you on your body with that being said I think the overall taste is really good it tastes very very very watermelon and that mix of baked green and pink flavor it's really prescient but it's good that's kind of like Jolly Rancher watermelon almost the there's almost zero taste of weed in there now you can tell there's weed in there but it's very faint and I think that's what they were going for it's extra sweet I got shit-faced alright again like I said I'll get back to you guys in one hour and let you know what I think about these as my final thoughts and also my through 10 score for now just chill back and hang tight smoke on something showing something drink on something if you got it stay lifted and we'll drive [Music] three hours later what's up what's up you guys and we're back it's actually been three hours since I last talked to you and in that three hours I decided to see two more pieces so I'll just 75 milligrams of this 100 milligram chocolate bar and here's the final square that we're gonna eat right now I love the taste these are gate keys all day delicious what are my final thoughts and my rate well honestly if it wasn't for the price of retail price of $25 for a hundred milligrams my overall score would be like a 9 out of 10 I think they're really good flavor wise taste wise they're very creamy they're very milky they have that artificial Jolly Rancher flavor that I love so no complaints there and overall I love that you can almost almost almost not taste the weed in there it's it's almost not there so really well done really walled me in every wall code however giving that value is important to all of us $25 for a hundred milligrams is so now where is it I mean I literally ate the whole bar today in a matter of a few hours and I'm not even there you might as well have taking your money bought some flour smoked that flour and still feel higher than I do and have some weed leftover first is hitting the entire chocolate bar granted even if I ate it all at once I doubt it would do anything as a longtime smoker and Big Daddy it's not gonna do [ __ ] so what's my actual rating one through 10 on this I give these edibles six point five out of ten if there are $10 there would get a much much higher score in my book but currently for the value and the price on them and what you really got out of it versus just getting flour or getting concentrates or hash it's just not worth it just not worth it and with that there's the would you smokes and I'm signing out stay lifted yeah I'll see y'all on the next one [Music]", "INGue0fpEaA": "[Music] hey guys what's going on it's a girl I'm back cuz Queen and I'm here with another review a product review and today I'm doing one of my favorite things in the world I'm gonna review one of my favorite things in the world chocolate mmm chocolate and today's review is on Hayes and Maine and this is actually a milk chocolate and when I saw that it was one to one CBD and THC I was all over this of course as you can see it says 250 milligrams and then it has I think it says 34 percent cacao for milk chocolate that's pretty good and like I said one to one CBD THC and the 250 is 125 milligrams of CBD and 125 milligrams of THC so per piece per piece I'm going to get 12.5 CBD 12.5 THC which is you know 25 basically milligrams but the reason why I wanted to try this is because normally and I've said this before at this stage of my journey since I'm starting off I'm still a newbie I'm starting off pretty small as far as the amount of THC I try to consume I generally try to stay between 5 and 10 this is 12 but I'm hoping that because it's a 1 in 1 that the CBD will offset the high filling of the THC because this is more THC than I normally consume in in edible I'll just say that so and I should have haven't had we chocolate before so this is a new one for me like a chocolate bar cuz this is Arizona by the way my house is pretty cool but uh it was like a hundred and I don't know five today alright so that is what a serving size looks like and again I'm gonna tell you when it comes to edibles listen this chocolate board you're gonna want to eat the whole thing okay okay and what edibles one of the best ways to consume them I'm gonna get this out of my hands because they blow milk with edibles they tell you to hold it in your mouth and let it know I don't want to say just all but like what chocolate of course let it dissolve but like when you're doing oils and things like that hold it in your mouth awhile and kind of let it get into your system I'm really trying to you know it's good okay so I wouldn't to me is not there to try to compare it to something like the Hershey bar or something like that because I'm pretty sure it has a higher the cow example but I think it's very good I mean I think it's very good chocolate there is just a a back note like a under note of the cannabis but it's it's I mean it's it's almost not there it's very mild and maybe because I know that it has cannabis in it I'm picking up on that but I think if you just gave it to somebody and they were just eating it they wouldn't they wouldn't pick up on that but it's actually really very good and that's again I tell you guys that's the thing about edibles when they're very good like that you're you're more apt to pick up another piece because it's like you're not really even thinking about it you know is this unconscious thing to continue to you know don't want to consume something delicious something good and before you know it you're like you know 10 sheets to the wind and you're trying to remember why and so with this chocolate is very good yeah that's it's very good so I might if I feel any any differently or if someone notices me filling in you know a little bit like who I'll do a reaction video after this just to kind of let you know how about ten twelve point Bob didn't mean [Music] it's something that I would I mean I said this a lot edibles are not cheap that candy bar probably cost about 12 bucks for a candy bar yeah it's like normally you can go get a candy bar for a dollar you know 50 cents or whatever but we have to realize that this is also medicine and so you need to compare it to that and not compare it to something like a chocolate bar because at the end of the day when you're comparing it to actual medicine you know that it's a completely different story right so we have to be careful how we you know frame it but as medicine goes yeah that that went down pretty good so alright guys that's Hazen main milk chocolate and I like it I do alright guys I will talk to you later alright bye hey guys hey listen I just got through in a fish sandwich just everything's good but yeah they had me needing a snack yeah it was good very good chocolate and that was great for a while and I tell you again the edible is that I'm not I'm not going to talk too much right now you just have to be careful and I only have one square I don't understand how these people be putting back you know so much damn weed Oh anyway yeah [Music] you [Music]", "wbuT7KPgeDE": "[Music] 80s welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are taking another edible review we are taking another edible review I believe we're doing another edible review we're taking none but we are taking a look at my best buddies over at Kanak oh I wish I knew some folks over I can't a co so I could give them a big ol hug and let them know that they do right by us so guys we are taking a look at another canna co-product another one of their 100 milligram 10 milligram or excuse me one of their 100 milligram edibles that are broken into 10 10 milligram pieces there we go we got that out correctly as you can see they have a sticker right there 10 10 milligrams squared pieces per package frankly it's a little ludicrous it's just a cookie with barely cut ten little pie shaped or you know pizza is shaped slices out of it it's it's absurd it's absurd it's just to know that they can say they're compliant with the new regulations but everybody knows the new regulations are horse manure and so this is the kind of stupid lengths that Kuster companies are gonna go to to get compliant even though it's helping nobody and it's just making everything a little bit more worse but anyways doesn't matter still really really excited for this product this is the candy coat peanut butter crunch cookie picked it up for $8 here in my Long Beach dispensary a pretty good deal for a hundred milligram edible and especially for one that if history repeats itself and the reason I am is speaking so graciously about canna Co is they've never failed me in the past they've always been both incredibly tasty for inedible and very very potent for the milligram each listed also love peanut butter cookies so got a very very high expectations for this one so this is as I said there are peanut butter crunch cookie with chewy delicious peanut butter chip cookie topped with crushed peanuts sprinkles sounds delicious to me Kanako's patented probably not actually patented but nice box there nice packaging it's got all the information you want ingredients nutrition facts if not unfortunately their actual I don't believe they have their lab testing on there but um other than that it's a great package um a nice nicely laid out nicely designed all that fun stuff and then the inside we have the actual edible right here let's go ahead and open it up and give it a taste and if this is the first time you have tuned into a wheats review before the most important thing to know is that I will be coming back to you guys in two hours actually it's gonna be closer to three hours this time cuz we got to go see a movie and after I get out of this movie I will be sure to let you know how this cookie is actually hitting me that's what you're really in it for not so much how it makes how much it tastes but more about how it makes you feel so this is the cookie that's broken into ten parts as you can see it's ten easily defined easy to break apart pieces not at all just trying to fake their way into compliance because you know why not you can see they doesn't even go all the way through to the bottom but hey who cares I literally prefer it this way so here we go here is the peanut butter crunch cookie it's good it's really good sorry I'd shoot for such a long time there but I always get people yelling at me for talking with my mouth full let you know sometimes you got to you you gotta get it out really like the taste of this cookie as it the title implies nice and crunchy rich peanut butter taste no cannabis taste really to speak of I didn't detect any if you like your peanut butter cookies crunchy you're gonna like this one men at least for the first half of this review of the first part the taste part can't code knocks it out of the park again but for the more important part how's it gonna make me feel well guys you're gonna have to wait a couple of seconds to find out me I'll let you know as soon as I get out of the movie exactly how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeks guys and I will see you in just a bit many hours since I checked in with you and my high has actually gone way down but that is not in any way to suggest and again I am sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you guys but that is in no way to suggest that there's anything wrong with this Kanaka peanut butter crunch cookie it is amazing this is another another winner from canna Co even these many many many many hours later I am still high as I said I picked this up for eight bucks it tasted delicious was a hell of a value what else needs to be said um at this point I think I'm largely sadly done with canna Co outside of two exceptions I am going to review their paleo bar because I know a lot of people want to know about edibles that are gluten-free or vegan or sugar-free or any of those things so I'm going to review their chocolate paleo bar which I'll have out at some point and then I still do have ambitions of finding one of their 1000 milligrams and reviewing that maybe maybe for our 4/20 special perhaps maybe maybe we'll do it for 4/20 or maybe our 2006 chrysler it's a great tasting cookie it's a potent edible it's affordable there is nothing else that I can really say about Kanaka at this point other than buy them buy it if you see it if you haven't yet what are you waiting for this is I mean I said it many times and I will say it again this is my favorite these are my favorite people who make edibles there are they they work magic that other people seem to not only not only not only not possess but are not even in the same universe of Kanako's great stuff if you see that peanut butter crunch cookie give it a shot if you see any Kanaka product give it a shot and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "BOOLG1NPYiU": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are looking at a product that we have kind of sort of looked at before but in a smaller form factor we are taking a look at another product from canna Co their PB&J blondie again but this time instead of the 250 milligram we're gonna take a look at the 100 milligram to see how that hits to see if it hits relatively as strongly as the 250 s and 500 s that we've looked at before I thought it was probably good to make sure that we've got the entire gamut of Kanako's products covered so I went ahead and picked up a hundred milligram err as well now I already know how this bad boys gonna taste I'm pretty sure I know how it's gonna taste it's gonna taste excellent and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get pretty high still even though it's only 100 milligrams that's just sort of the magic of a can of coke so here we go oh you can see the hundred milligrams come in this sort of baby blueish color they all have a different color corresponding to their potency we hunt 100 milligram is this nice blue here alright well I'm gonna go and open it up eat her up and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the way our reviews work and that is also the most important part of the review process so here we go it's a handsome product there that peanut butter swirl on top the jelly oh my god the blondie let's give a bite as advertised that really is blondie batter swirl with peanut butter chips and raspberry jam topped with peanut butter frosting and peanut butter chips all those things are true taste very good but guys how is this bad boy can make me feel for that I'm gonna have to wait two hours and you're gonna have to wait a couple of seconds and I will see you on the other side of this break to let you know how we're feeling thank you so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you soon peace okay guys I am back it has been two hours since I had the Kanak OPB NJ blondie and I am extremely happy to confirm it is as potent as I was hoping it was gonna be this is the most hundred potent hundred milligram edible I've ever had for sure in terms of just 100 milligram edible this thing hits like a hammer tastes great man I know I've already had the 250 milligram variety but even the 100 milligrams variety here is is almost does the trick for me I'd be a tough to decide between which to pick for me but it's great if you see this at your dispensary near you grab one you'll be happy you did you'll be you'll be quite high for quite some time and you'll enjoy the taste as well well guys that's gonna do it for this review here on week's happy to have another homerun

tune-up real [ __ ] good Sam are you chewing up the bagging case to be a Joe in it we pitch our winterized he definitely did some beer chilling it now oh yeah", "UuPkvzB0xxw": "today I'm going to show you how to make homemade chocolate like a chopping block it's very very easy and very very tasty first of all we're going to melt the butter i'm using 250 grams of butter our tourist right in the pan so the gas on we also need to add water half of the glass of water go straight in it saucepan i'll be using wooden spatula just to make the butter melt so the butter has melted now now is the time to add sugar so i'm adding one half glass of sugar the next step is to make sure that the sugar has melted completely i just put the heat slightly lower the gas on the web set ink but otherwise you don't want to be splash of the hot butter because it will really really hurt so now very very gently stir it make sure we melt the sugar properly I haven't done this chocolate blog for better over the long time I remember last time it was approximately ten years ago Allah had the last time my sis I lost used to always make here and me as a big teenager it was a very easy thing to do when you had the chocolate craving and it tastes awesome so bring that we got slightly on higher setting now so in the panel right now I've got half of the glass of water one and a half of glass of sugar and one block over 250 grams suspending the sugar properly just keep stirring cookie dough on any sugar to be banned the bottom of the pan the next stage we have to add cocoa so postpone here and I'm using very very good political power which is very very dark and we need fight you spoons so I put free now I think I'll put about four four pips big spoons tablespoons of put the hit on the lower settings and just staring we have to cook completely melt everything together I will show you no matter how this is looking so now we have to make sure that all the ingredients have drawn together see on the Carlos look I'm dark so the coca is nicely melted so I'm going to let the dance off and put this to the side to cool down because at the moment is very very hot and I'll give this mixture to be quite cold loop one before I can actually join the rest of the ingredients in the mean time what I can do I was slightly bigger saucepan here and I'm going to crush my biscuits basically I don't want very small piece of my biscuits quite nice chunky pieces maybe like this size just crush your head up go straight to the pan some people may be like slightly smaller pieces and you can put it in the back and used rolling pin wacky get it quite a few times so you put smaller pieces i'm using slightly bigger pieces that's one pack another half so I put one and a half pack of these biscuits just plain butter biscuits and the rest half I'm going move on to the side break it up as well I can use it for decorations after all right so that's all done select the shower yet so in the small bowl I put my biscuits which are ready for later for decoration in a big one big pot that's when my mixture is going to go and Here I put my chocolate which is calling the owl now we just have to wait approximately half an hour for this ingredient to cool down and then we can do the second part so I'm going to have a cup of tea now half an hour has gone now I managed to have my cup of tea and also managed actually to make a lovely green smoothie very very healthy thing to have right so now the chocolate mixture is quite cool so I'm going to do now I'm going to ask how the milk to it and i'm going to use electric mixer just to mixer so make some noise now put it on the lowest setting you will get speaker and speaker you this is I speak now right i can so thick now i'm going to cut you up just to mix everything together hold this powder you need some food Moses here good muscle workout can you see how the color it's lovely and brown very very chocolatey and it smells very nice as well make sure there is no lumps anywhere the everything is nicely done tastes lovely right now is a time for this it's I'm going to put all the biscuits in and just mix all together good i'm going to add some raisins as well just for the flavor so very good quality raisins thank you so much lancia Oh some fun oh it's getting really really difficult now to move this around so stir it is evenly distributed I think that was time to put this mixture into silver tres meses move the camera on two sides sometimes you just put the next you're not into that silver trays since very very stinky I've downloads so you can see this nice and lumpy you got all these pieces of these skits and raisins you can use different forms I use them once because it would be very easy to take thick out after and you can do this post so there's no washing today just press it down is the second former outside wow it's very sticky and this will last in the fridge for quite a few days so I put few biscuits just inside the trace on top so this is going to the fridge now for couple of hours", "H6cYs4ZcSv8": "[Music] revue show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my Nutella here pancakes love Nutella and I love Nutella too so I've got my Nutella so you know what that means it means we are taking a look at another gummy that's right we are breaking the cardinal rule here on weeds don't be a dude don't be a dummy and buy a gummy we are taking a look at a very very popular gummy brand may be the second most popular gummy brand behind cushy punch and that is the gummy brand from Chiba choose themselves Green Hornet I had a lot of people asked me to review the Green Hornet's and we're finally gonna be doing it this is their 100 milligram indica variety love everything on the back it's got all the stuff you want to see the batch number from the lab testing nutrition information all that good stuff ingredients it's all they're so good on them for putting all the information on their Bravo to you Chiba chews now if you've seen my reviews in the past you know my Chiba chews I'm really feeling them to be sending my world on fire I found them to be good but not great more okay however I picked this one up for a very affordable price just 10 bucks for a hundred milligram edible which is a pretty good deal so it's a little bit cheaper than most of the Chiba juice and so I'm I'm more excited about this one and I'm an indica fan so let's uh let's give it a go I do have the uh oh looks like my dogs have come back from a walk welcome dogs welcome dogs low hello hello goodbye dogs farewell dogs sorry about that guys so yes back to the Green Hornet really excited about this one because it was more affordable and I've heard a lot of good things about the Green Hornet's now if you know as you know I'm not a big gummy fan really only flourish and tiki killers the only gummies that I've really really loved and cushy punches I find to be OH a so Green Hornet is fighting an uphill battle there but let's give them the benefit of the doubt open this bad boy up and give it a taste so if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work it's very very simple I'm gonna eat this whole thing and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so uh it tells us to cut the gummy into ten ten milligram servings there's it's little cut guide where of course not gonna be doing that I guess that's how they're gonna get compliant with the new regs whatever so here is the gummy The Green Hornet fruit punch flavored and again I picked this up for only ten bucks at my dispensary which is a very good price for these Green Hornet's so let's let's break off half here and give it a taste I forgot my I brought my Nutella to have some fat whoo wow that is woo that has a heavy heavy heavy cannabis taste but that is encouraging hopefully that means it's going to be as potent as advertised and seeing this lab tested results in the back gives me faith so let's add a little bit of chocolate to it here just to give ourselves the best chance of making sure we can get high mmm that Nutella makes that a lot easier to go down alright guys well that's gonna do it for this first half of this review for the second half and the most important part will it get me high I'll come back to you guys in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds through the magic of editing so I will see you guys in just a bit to let you know peace [Music] help I've been stung by a Green Hornet welcome back to wheat skies it's been two hours since I've had that Green Hornet and it's pretty good it's up there with good gummies like flourish I actually like it better than Sheba chews period I think it got me where I want to be some pink there I'd say I'm at a seven and a half somewhere in there not to put too fine a point on it uh yeah I I like The Green Hornet quite a bit uh the indica variety at least is muy bueno uh muy bueno bueno bueno way down yeah I'm really pleased with it pleasantly surprised I like it better than any of the other cheapo cheese I've tried so far a really a nice little edible nice discreet package it tasted like barf but that's to be expected for something that's so small and so potent so I don't really hold out it against it but it does taste terrible so if you're really sensitive as a taste no this one is this one's got a pretty intense weed flavor but on the whole if you can get it as cheap as I got it because I got it for ten bucks but I sometimes see these go as highs like seventeen or higher maybe I don't know the that's why I don't really screw that she would choose that much is there crazy expensive but if you can find this for around that price it's uh I'd say it's worth it I really had a good time with this one that's the Chiba choose Green Hornet's a fruit punch flavored one hundred milligrams indica give it a shot if you see the dispensary near you and before I go guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something a little extra something that's not reviewing weed just something I like in my life that I want to share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related and on this review my little cherry on top is let's give it up for the air pod I hope there's not too much earwax on that because that'd be really embarrassing the air pods they're really good I hope I'm saying that right air pods that's the name of them the names dumb but they're actually really incredible little wireless headphones earphones I had a pair of Plantronics wireless over-the-air ones noise cancelling ones that I had for two years that I adored and have been using the air pods on and off for a while and and really come to appreciate them and they're discreteness in their ease of use and the just pull it out pauses the music all that good stuff really enjoy it if you have an Apple product if you have an Apple phone give the air prodigious shot if you haven't already I know they seem a little expensive but I think they're worth the the the Apple tax in this case so guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats that's gonna be a thumbs up for the Green Hornet thank you so much for sticking around at the very end of this review guys and we will catch you on the next one peace", "ro8rNrOkLpQ": "hey what's up everybody just doing a real quick review on these little mini chiba chews from medical patients only um this is uh sativa

bastard open oh god ah no i'm just [ __ ] kidding i got all my fingers okay anyway all these packages are child proof because sometimes you can rip it like that but it is not the easiest thing so take a little back paper off that's unwrapping a cheap achievement right there and that little piece of caramel that's a hundred milligrams actually my honeymoon i'm good though they still use a hash oil

weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we are YouTube's preeminent marijuana edible review ship again only because we are the only edible review show on YouTube so today we are taking a look at another product from TKO edibles we are taking a look at their s'mores krispies I've been reviewing a lot of krispies recently this one looks pretty good from the outside a lot of marshmallow a lot of chocolate a lot of crispy a lot of um so um this is I think the fourth or fifth thing we've reviewed from TK edibles this is my first hundred milligram er I've never quite liked the taste from any of them but I've always found them to be rather potent so I am hoping that this one tastes better it looks better than any of the others but we shall find out good and open her up and give it a taste here that is better tasting than any of the other TKO animals it's not great incredibly thick incredibly chewy well Arviat room it's not bad I actually kind of liked the taste of it very little we taste whatsoever I'm not bad at all thick and chewy if you can imagine it's like almost like graham cracker in there which I guess it makes sense for s'mores brownie or s'mores crispy and then the chocolate and marshmallow I like it quite a bit but guys as we always know it's known about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel and for that I want to see you guys in two hours to let you know how this bad boys heading [Music] [Music] well guys it has been 2 hours welcome back two weeks has been two hours since I had the TK oh hundred milligram s'mores Krispy here and I got to say for a hundred milligram edible I feel pretty high I feel pretty pleased with it as in edible the best tasting TKO edible I've had so far and for 100 milligram ER as I said I am feeling rather high I mean not outrageously high by any stretch but higher than it was expecting - for a hundred milligram edible it doesn't feel that much different than their 160 milligrams to be honest so yeah I'm pretty positive on the s'mores crispy from TK oh maybe my new favorite product from their sin terms of taste and potency and they're pretty cheap - I think this cost me six bucks at my dispensary so this is a pretty worthwhile purchase I think so if you see the TKO s'mores crispy at a dispensary near you and you're looking for something that's not gonna get you send you to the moon something a little bit more low dose feel free to pick one up it's pretty good and with that guys I'm gonna sign off here thank you so much for watching this review here on

special guest reviewing the la familia hot chocolate chocolate bar so super excited to check this out it's a mexican style chocolate bar um i've never had it it's delicious some of my friends hooked it up so we're gonna be trying this out today uh 100 milligram thc bar 10 milligrams thc per serving um mexican style hot chocolate total fat 25 grams sodium 15 milligrams total carbs 55 grams sugars 56 grams of sugar ingredients sugar palm kernel palm oils whey cocoa non-fat milk sunflower less lecithin vegetable oil corn syrup solids sodium cassini potassium phosphate sodium citrate sodium aluminosylate mono and diglycerides sucralose vanilla and cannabis extract a lot of tongue twisters there directions take one serving 10 milligram thc wait two hours for effects before consuming more uh warning warning total cannabinoids 94.52 milligrams so in this package it says 100 on the outside and then 94.52 so there is a 5.6 now i'm sorry 5.5 difference in milligrams in the thc this is 5 milligrams shy so it's less than a hundred unfortunately so every single serving on this will actually be nine milligrams of tdc not ten as listed so i'd probably be eating two pieces manufactured september 21st package september 24th best buy september 20th uh blah blah blah blah blah tested by thing 20 labs cool you ready yeah one bite talk about it two bites quite a bit so we got this cool dosing chart in here you are not lucky to be here the world needs your perspective they are lucky to have you antonio t harrino president and ceo of the hispanic heritage foundation so the chocolate comes in this cool bag child proof got the same information that's on the back here basically on this so all you do is go you go on the little grippy tape here and you'll twist and it'll open up and you've had real mexican hot chocolate so you can kind of go by you you guys can kind of see some of the chocolate pieces look it's got la familia etched into the chocolate with the little mooring thing that's pretty cool so i'll leave that so that's not 10 milligrams these are not needed to nine so this one each is nine here okay all right so i'm gonna do one bite of it and talk a little bit about it here we go cheers there's like little crunchies in there it's not crispy it's just little hot chocolate bits it's so good it tastes really delicious it tastes like mexican hot chocolate but it's really good it's got this nice cacao flavor i can see why it has 56 grams of sugar definitely has a lot of sugar to it it's rich that's what it is i wouldn't want more than one piece i think yeah or two maybe two i still need my milligram dosage so two pieces would be my max before i'm just like curved but i'm gonna score out of ten it's really unique i don't typically go buy chocolates in the weed industry right i just don't i prefer i prefer you know a bunch of gummies or crispies what do you think 8.9 that's pretty good i'm just an edible significantly better than the chocolate the other chocolate i've had here in california i'd like to know there's definitely some funky ingredients in here that are a little concerning with just the chemical nature of their names yeah i wish it was a little bit simpler on the ingredients but it takes a lot to get a lot packed into this deliciousness so i guess i can kind of you know consider that um i'm sitting there patrick packaging is beautiful half of it this is recycling recyclable this is a little much for me but cannabis infused chocolate product los angeles you also have to think about like it's beautiful the culture it's beautiful uh i'm i'm chilling at a 9.25 um i just i take i don't like that it's not 100 milligrams it's 100 it says 100 milligrams on all the packaging and then the sticker says 9. like i can't stand that so we need to get that efficiency and consistency established immediately uh in regards to that if they made sugar-free oh maybe i would bump this up yeah yeah if there was a sugar-free version of this it'd be stupid fire so yeah 8.9 for me 8.9 for you 9. what'd i say 9.25 yeah 9.25 from me great work la familia you guys were killing it man i appreciate everybody who watches these videos for all the love this is another west coast we too review we've got jazzasaurus la familia j ping respect my region make sure you all go tap in youtube ig tv all the places all the things a place for things you know

like guava and passion fruit so i figured you know let's try these you know uh edibles are cool but i make my own out of distillate rso and all that kind of stuff see if i can get any kind of a focus on that nope okay let's see what you get okay so it's two bags it says 100 milligrams thc 10 milligrams per gel all right so it's like two little baggies stuck together okay let's try one of these bad boys out well that's [ __ ] delicious oh i'll finish this little bag out i'll leave something in the description thanks a lot", "3iypIyD8pVM": "one of you to dish your boy big mike foale 20 laps down and today we're gonna try out these edibles nut bars rotten egg extracts they come in four different flavors today we have all four flavors which are cannabis infused dark chocolate milk chocolate mocha crunch milk chocolate and cannabis infused salted arming dark chocolate note is made with actual 100% pure distilled pill because their concentrate companies these are a hundred percent vegan gluten and dairy free certified 100% organic Fairtrade cacao I don't think that matters on whatever they got going on in them so these are 80 milligram bars and different stores have different prices they run they range in different prices but this is something different I thought I might want to bring to you so let's get started what I've done I'll take our one of these bars show it to you and then we'll try some mouth just try these mocha crunch okay these were the hard time winner 2018 this one another 2017 2018 so this was a hard time award you see and they come in 240 milligrams slugs 80 milligrams each one is 10 let's try one out there definitely made with high quality chocolate this with the chocolate now one thing like I said a higher quality chocolate the things about the chocolate you don't taste cannabis so you got to be aware of stuff like that you might think that because it tastes good no taste nothing we don't work don't put that in your mind as a fantasy if you eat them they definitely have a full effect a very common natural effect so during your local stores and you happen to come across these extracts these candies or if you're in the edibles don't try some difference you like edibles checkout no they also I have extracts these are the bars but they also sell good extract so bone you like this video check out another video you looking for a little more Big Mike check out my playlist you really like my bike you want to see me all the time look down it's a button if they subscribe you hit that button you get the bill next to it you know any time I post so this should work Big Mike 420 lifestyle you have a great great day goodbye", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "00ArNfhqkLg": "hey what's that boy girls welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at one of my favorite things out there and that is edible chocolate love the chocolate bars and we're taking a look at a huge brand today one of only reviewed one of their products foreign have found it to be not so good so we'll be interested to see if their chocolate does any better and that is flavor ex-flame rx Flav prescription I'm just gonna go flavor X I don't want to say it they're 100 milligram toffee bar Oh made by Kanak oh I had not seen that there that's exciting that hopefully makes me optimistic I didn't know this was made by Kanak oh the flavor X bars I have only tried their fruit bars before exiting back there they're they're gummy snacks and did not really enjoy them but chocolate is usually a much better vector for THC and this is a pretty huge brand I see them everywhere everywhere this is the new regulations size 10 milligram pieces 100 milligram total although it says it actually has not yet been a lab tested there again you can see Hanako so we are gonna be optimistic and hope that it is as good as the other Kanaka products and better than the Flav Rx products I've already reviewed so here we are here is our flavor X bar inside its packaging oh and this cost me 20 bucks at my Long Beach dispensary so I'm out in line with the 100 milligram edible now which is a bit unfortunate it let's dig it out and there we go pretty simple ten pieces very small pieces of chocolate I guess they're only ten milligrams and again it is toffee flavored so let's give it a try well there's some good quality chocolate mmm no cannabis tasters because I don't really taste anything but hmm good rich milk chocolate top you provide is a nice little crunch the flavor front could not be more happy with it but guys as you all know it's not about how it tastes I mean you wanted to taste good but what you really wanted to do is to get you high and for that guys like all our reviews I'm gonna finish off this flavor X bar over the next couple of minutes here and then once I finish it I'll come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling is that's the most important part of any animal review so wish me luck I know I've got my fingers crossed I hope this one's gonna be a winner and I'll see you guys in just a bit I'm back and has actually been more than two hours since I checked in with you with the flavor rx bar I got a little ahead of myself in my activities but I am happy to tell you this is a good product um I did not like flavor X cartridges and I did not like their candy but I quite like this chocolate bar I tasted really really good on the upper end of the chocolate it's not the best of the best I've had but really pretty damn good and it's quite potent for a hundred milligram edible this really did the trick for me um I'm hoping or suspecting that the made by Cana Co is why that this one did the trick so this Flav rx chocolate bar is actually gonna get a big thumbs up from me it's not a plus tier like your Kiva or your de francais but it is close it is tasty it's pretty affordable in this new world um and uh it'll get you high so flavor X toffee 100 milligram bar that's gonna be a thumbs up for me give it a chance if you see it at your dispensary think you'll be happy you did and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on our next row deuces", "l5SplV_jSiM": "[Music] hi friends welcome awaits the marijuana review show we help you determine which products are worth your money and which ones should be left on the trash pile of history we're not necessarily history I don't think any of these products are gonna make history but if there is one product out there that is guaranteed to make history it's the one that I've got in my hand we're going to be doing another edible review today and my heart of hearts my favorite of favorites Kanak oh that's right guys we're back with another Kanaka review we are reviewing their chocolate chip cookie today and I'm really delighted to see that these have are already compliant with the new regulations they've got this little sticker on here saying ten the ten milligrams scored pieces per package so that means they're good to go with the regs theoretically so that hopefully that means they'll be in more areas soon hopefully that means that you guys can find can't go play in your dispensaries and start enjoying the products as well now um if you've never seen a can't go review before I heart them I love them they're my favorite edible manufacturer in the world I've got no doubt some thinking this one's gonna be great this one here is a hundred milligram variety as you can see from the sticker on the top lovely packaging as always from Kanak oh nice box nutrition information on the back just great great stuff to see love it as always so let's go ahead and open it up and give it a taste here it is in their traditional sort of teal greeny packaging for their 100 milligram varieties and I'm interested to see how its scored to be ten different ten milligram pieces of course this is wheat so we're eating the whole thing not just a single piece oh wow yeah this is uh this is their idea of look it's ten different it's ten different pieces because it has ten different little cut marks on it fine by me fine by me better than Corollas mini cookies which you have to eat so many of I'd rather just have one big cookie that's sort of haphazardly scored into ten different pieces scored let's go ahead and get a taste it smells great oh my god it smells so good let's give it taste here it's great oh my god no cannabis tastes really good cookie I'm most vibing eating this quickly I'm gonna enjoy I'm really truly a.m. Wow they're miracle workers I don't know what else to say I didn't know what else to say I do actually matters it's not about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel and if I have any guess it's gonna make me feel pretty good but you guys will have to wait a couple of hours well actually you guys just have to wait us a couple of seconds I have to wait a couple of hours to find out but through the magic and Wizardry of editing you guys will know in just a couple of seconds whether on highest buck or not thank you for watching weeds and I will see you guys in just a few please deuces it has been Oh two and a half hours since I completed that wonderful wonderful can of coke and guys it lives up to Kanako's reputation I was gonna tell you about where I am and what I'm doing what I just saw oh I just saw I Tania and woo I'm not sure what to say about that but here's why I am sure I want to say Jericho's chocolate-chip cookie while it's ridiculous they're split into 10 pieces strategy is the little preposterous it's still as amazing as it ever was and hopefully always will be because even at 100 milligrams I'm I'm like a seven five maybe and it tasted delicious couldn't recommend it more highly and I picked it up my dispensary at a discount I believe for an average of nine bucks I say average because I got two for a discount see that's how good Kanaka is is I'm trying to explain my math of purchasing to you all you need to know is buy it if you see it you're really gonna like it just don't split it into tenths just eat the whole thing you'll be happy ok thank you so much for watching guys you're wonderful and and thanks thanks so much deuces", "8ID6ayefO4Q": "[Music] [Music] hello and welcome back to hello hi and today we're cooking red velvet chocolate chip cookies white chocolate chips and we're adding a sprinkle of regular chocolate chips only because i ran out of white chocolate chips but let me show you how these cookies look inside do you see how moist those cookies are we are making these today so we're using can of butter and duncan hines cake mix for everyone who's not a baker this recipe is for you so let's get started for this recipe you only need four ingredients one box of red velvet cake mix two eggs a cup and a half of white chocolate chips and a third cup of can of butter and if you want it really strong go ahead and bump it up to a half a cup and before we start make sure you preheat your oven to 350 degrees and if you haven't already subscribe to my channel and give this video a thumbs up below in a large bowl combine the cake mix eggs can of butter and chocolate chips and start stirring them together but be careful if you drop an eggshell like i just did take it out keep on going i use a folding motion with my spatula to combine the ingredients to make sure i don't over mix the batter because you will be tempted to use a mixer when that batter starts to become heavy but try not to use a mixer unless you have a folding attachment because it'll over mix the batter and result in flatter crispier cookies make sure you mix the batter for about 5 to 10 minutes until it's well combined or you don't see any more of the cake mixture your batter should look like this when you're ready to make your cookies okay now it's time to put the cookies on the cookie sheet now i have a martha stewart cookie sheet but if you don't have a martha stewart cookie sheet or a sheet a cookie sheet that has a silicone lining please line your um cookie sheet pan with parchment paper or they'll stick to the pan so you i have a well i did have a ice cream scooper but i can't find it one of those things that walk away in the kitchen and you just don't know where it is so today i'm using a one tablespoon to scoop the cookie dough and put it on the sheet you don't want to take these cookies and ball them up with your hands because as you can see they're very sticky so you don't want to use your hands you definitely want to use ice cream scooper or a one tablespoon measuring spoon to get the cookie dough out you want to make sure the balls are big enough so when you cook they're nice and thick and don't come out flat so don't be stingy when scooping that cookie dough okay now that we're done we're going to put these in the oven for about 12 minutes on 350 and then come back and take out our cookies and see how they came out i can't wait for y'all to see these cookies okay everybody the cookies are out of the oven and i can't wait for you to see them look at those cookies they look so good i'm not going to try one because i already tasted the dough and i already know that they are strong but you go ahead and make these cookies um it tastes great and thank you guys for watching again don't forget to subscribe to my channel so you can see more cannabis recipes and i promise to make them quick and easy as usual thank

guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are reviewing probably for the last time because they've disappointed me so many times nother bar this time they're salted all chocolate as you can see here it cost me 12 bucks at my dispensary although I believe I got a discount for 10 is it 200 milligram edible and if it really were as potent as advertised or merely cody has advertised it would be a good deal I reviewed two nutbars in the past on the boat pretty disappointing to be honest so I don't have a lot of expectations for this one I reviewed a 100 and a 200 milligram in the past and found them both to be lacking in the potency department but but pretty good in the flavor so let's go ahead and note but be salted almond one chocolate here and give it a taste I believe I picked this up at cool calm collective and Huntington Beach Orange County so here we go we've got our packaging here this fancy gold foil we've got a little bit melted somewhere along the way but you can see what it looks like they're little nutbar symbols get a bite you can see the salted almonds on the back it's okay mmm very sweet chocolate very sweet did you like almonds you're gonna like it better than okay it's good chocolate take a second place we just did let you hmm not that low liking the chocolate yet again but how am I gonna like how it makes me feel for that guys you're gonna have to wait just a couple of seconds me however I'll come back to you guys in two hours let you know our feline thanks for watching weeks two hours later alright guys it's been two hours I've got to admit that this is the best of the nug bars that I've had so far I am definitely the most high from this one which is curious that I'm certainly more high from this one that I alright perceive myself as being more high from this one than the other two hundred milligram when I had not a whole lot more but but noticeably to me so there might just be some batch issues I'm not sure there but I would say the last time I was that maybe a you know three something like that and it's what I felt no rocking about a five so you know there's you know definitely something they're still not my go-to not gonna be my first thing I like the taste of it this actually grew on me quite a bit as I ate it I like the dark chocolate I have like all of theirs in terms of taste and this one ended up being a pleasant surprise in terms of I was expecting nothing from it and a nice little high so I got to give it to nug bar on this one they they they earned some kudos so as mild as praise is that that as I have given it I'm not sure if you can call that kudos or not but you know whatever thank you so much for watching wheats guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on the next review peace", "gSHmQHsNXeU": "welcome back to another hatch TV all moms mortal and this is a very long overdue edition of oz eats edibles today I got orange cush soda that's saving this guy on my

put that in the description below medical cannabis auto warning medical use only not a food keep out of reach of children that is everything let's do this it smells great does it smell like wheat at all and the fizz and the pop and the fizz was still there so it's still good luckily I didn't wait too long to drink it so here we go orange juice soda first taste was just like soda does not smell like weed well it doesn't taste like soda it just seems like orange you weed drink tastes like orange tastes like weed it's kind of thick I kind of taste the fit the fizz of the soda I don't know if it's because it's been the month long I'm just sitting in there but I taste it I think I've already drink drink too much so I'm gonna drink a little bit more I'm gonna try to get it to the black okay I know I drink more than the recommended dose so we're gonna tune in in about two hours and see how I feel afterwards I'll see you guys then it's been like a half hour only and I've been sitting in this chair with like all these ideas in my head like firing you know just all the synapses just sparking like there's a lot going on up here but physically my body is unable to move really I think that's where the hybrid really kicked in in this drink of the orange kush THC soda the indica is strong in my body right now and the sativa is very strong in my brain my words are not keeping up with my brain right now like seriously it's pretty good stuff I think I forgot to put the microphone in too so there might be different audio there so we'll find that out shortly I could see myself getting some of that and you know taking a couple shots worth after a long day of work you know that's how I feel drinking that but it doesn't make sense that it's a soda to treat it that way because the fizz is gonna be gone you know it's going to be very flat tomorrow so I might finish it off tonight and get really messed up and put like a real super clip at the end I mean just really jacked up and we'll see how that goes okay so I'll look forward to that and always remember to medicate responsibly okay I'm out of my home I'm legal all that jazz just be safe be responsible don't give anybody a reason

sense of your dispensary and on today's episode we are looking at the final Kiva product I think we have reviewed them all now unfortunately as sad as that might be this is the key 180 milligram bar the blackberry dark chocolate flavor super super excited about it every Kiva product I've done from their chocolate buyers to their Terra's their chocolate covered blueberries or espresso beans haven't blown me away every time both in tastes in terms of potency so I'm very very excited for this I believe this cost me $50 at the dispensary but with the discount it was probably closer to 12 or 13 dollars so pretty affordable 480 milligrams well not the cheapest in the world but but you definitely get what you pay for here so let's go ahead and open it up and while I open it up I'll explain the way our reviews work in case you've never tuned in before where reviews work is on the eat this candy bar may be all that in front of you maybe not depending how long it takes but I will eat the whole thing over the next couple of minutes and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so you can see there keep it right down into these four forty five milligram bars this fancy packaging and the double layer here and most fun this was actually made on 420 of fortuitous so let's go and open it up and try this kiva 180 milligram black berry dark chocolate bar if I can get it open technical difficulties stand by got it I thought I did I did it I open the package guys go me so there we are one of our 45 milligrams rectangles there got a little pot leaf on it mmm and that is delicious love it well another winner in terms of keep taste from Cuba but for how it's gonna make me feel guys that's gonna take two hours or actually a little bit longer than two hours because I'm about to go see spider-man homecoming right behind us here so I will see you right up from the movie to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching guys and I will see you in about two-and-a-half hours peace [Music] hi guys welcome back to mates it's been something like almost three hours since I last checked in with you since I had meet Kiva a hundred and eighty milligram blackberry dark chocolate and I am still feeling quite high three hours later loved it tasted great feeling super high I mean I outrageously high but very high for a hundred 80 milligram edible can recommend this Kiva just like into the others no problem all the key 180 milligram lines are great just go ahead and grab whatever flavor seems best for you I like the mint Irish cream and the dark chocolate tangerine the best but they're all incredible and they'll all get you [ __ ] up so this is a easy easy recommendation for me the key 180 milligram blackberry dark chocolate also spider-man homecoming it was a lot more fun than I thought it was gonna be so go see that too if you haven't seen it yet but I'm probably gonna

chocolate bars using some semi-sweet chocolate and some cannabis infuse coconut oil to see exactly how I made this check out one of my recent videos I'll post a link in the description but the cool part about today is Russell at cannabis candy molds shoutout him sent me these chocolate bars along with my favorite part these cool ass molds and look professional they look like molds or chocolates you would get at a dispensary also came with some foils some bags to wrap them up in who wouldn't love that as a present and a cool stamp so you could put that on anything to keep it out of reach and keep things safe what you need here is a double boiler or you can do what I'm doing iced have a pot here I'm gonna use a pyrex dish I was gonna buy a Dutch oven but I'm like I don't have one so I want to show you you can make it work with what you got I'm going to turn this on to a low medium low heat set that baby in there and let's start out with the semi-sweet chocolate I'll pop the camera in so you can see a little better you don't want it too hot you want to make sure you do this at a slow low temp as you can see it's starting to melt it's probably about two tablespoons there that's a lot that's probably over a half cup that supplies half cup three quarters so I just added half of the other chocolate bar to give it a little more texture because it's looking a little liquidy give it a little stir now we're gonna go ahead and just dump it in the mold so there we have it we have the foam molds about 1/2 cup of the coconut oil with a bar and a half of the chocolate we're gonna let it set in a refrigerator for about 30 minutes to an hour all right so it's about an hour later and they are hardened let's go ahead a little put beautiful beautiful might have been able to wait an extra few minutes but hey I wanted to try one no let's try one tastes good nice coconut oil flavor chocolate animus taste isn't overwhelming thank you again Russell at cannabis candy molds for the amazing

we do and our hot stocks are on fire if you want to take your investing at the next level join my patreon for the daily hot stocks trade alerts and to model my high growth portfolios plus you can join our discord with thousands of active investors that are talking deals every single day without further ado let's look at our top stocks right now uranium stocks are hot and i know this because our hot stocks have been churning out uranium place for a while now our first stock is north shore global uranium mining etf and they are made up of a basket of uranium companies involved in the mining exploration as well as companies that hold physical uranium i love etfs because they are less volatile than the individual stock and they can deliver great returns now let's check out the beast mode scorecard urn m has been on fire and is up 40 year-to-date 94 in the last six months and 268 last year the etf fund ratio is 0.85 and now let's take a quick look at the charts all right we're now looking at urn m which is our first stock and it's an etf and let's go over the basic chart setup the blue line is the 20-day moving average the red is the 50 and the white is the 200. i have a pmc indicator and i've got a macd and if you'd like to get my labeler at the top that is in my education channel on discord and i've got a link set up there so you can get it for free okay in looking at this let's go over what we've got first off i want to show you what a breakout looks like so this is what's called previous resistance the stock came down tested that 50-day moving average came back up and then it closed over the previous high and that's the start of a breakout and we always want them to close over that high then it ran right back up and now the cycle is repeating and it's came back down this time it's tested the 20-day moving average it's gone back up and it just closed over that previous high so it's currently starting a breakout and this can be a great time to get in some people love breakouts some people don't i'm one of them that love breakouts a few other things i want to point out to you is this breakout is done on high volume and you'll see this is some of the highest volume we've had on this stock in the last six months so that's a really strong plus and let me show you a couple of other things you notice right now how the stock is running up and you're going to notice the same run up on the pmc as well as the macd then it came up here you'll see that the momentum started to slow with the pmc indicator and it came down the macd followed and then it hit the low right down here at the 50-day moving average and now the next time it started to go back up and that same pattern is repeating although it's not as strong i would like to see this up at this level or higher but for this time that's okay because we've got some really good volume here that i do like and now what do we have happening we've got the macd coming back up and this one's just about to turn up as well so that's a real plus sign so we always like to see the price and these two charts move in unison if you think of them like a wave rolling together that's a good way to look at them and if they're not rolling together then that's a bit of a warning sign and we call that a divergence so here's our first stock it's looking good and as you can see i'm also in this stock and i've got a trail stop on it i believe set it 10 there it is 10 so i'm in this stock and i'm riding this breakout looking good energy fuels is the leading u.s producer of uranium and vanitium and an emerging player in the commercial rare earth business the scorecard shows year-to-date they are up 69 129 in the last three months and 740 in the last year if you look at the top you can see their estimated intrinsic value is 9.11 which is higher than their current stock price now look at the bottom and you'll see their total assets to total liabilities is 5.46 and this means they have 5.5 times the assets compared to the liabilities which is really strong but the rest of the fundamentals are weak if you have been with me for a while you know that means this is a swing trade for us where we get in and get out and take our profits and that's exactly what we've been doing here's another stock that's been making us really good money ticker uu uu energy fuels and on this stock we've got a very similar pattern we've got the waves that are rolling and then a really good time to get in on this stock would have been right down here whenever it came right up over the pmc and then it popped nicely it went through a period of consolidation right here and it's on another breakout of its own yesterday it popped really big with the highest volume we've seen again uranium is breaking on breakouts you look at almost any uranium stock they're doing really well on this one it's made our group a lot of money but it shot up so much i would call this too much too fast and i personally would wait on this one to come back hopefully back down closer to that 20-day moving average to get into but this is definitely a great stock that you want to have on your radar uranium stocks are hot we've been crushing it with truly for about a year and they are the leading medical cannabis country in the state of florida which is the third largest state in the u.s their location is perfect and just think of all the millennials and spring breakers that enjoy some recreational benefits and then think of all the retirees that might want to enjoy a little pain relief this is one of several mj stocks that i own right now and this is a great time to buy the dip because i expect many of the mj stocks will actually double this year the beast mode scorecard shows year-to-date true leave is up 62 726 in the last year they have a net income margin of 16.4 which is pretty good and they are growing their revenue over 100 percent last year and this year and patrons be sure to check out the rule of 40. truly a cannabis is a stock that i love and this is one of my long-term stocks i own quite a bit of it and you'll notice i don't have a trail stop on this one because you don't see it on this screen and that's because i really believe in the cannabis stocks for the long term so let's start down here at the bottom and we can see this is a beautiful tight channel that actually ran for a couple of months and anytime we can get in on these it's ideal you buy whenever it touches that bottom of the channel which is traveling right along that 20-day moving average and then you can sell whenever it reaches the top and you can wash rinse and repeat or you can just simply buy and hold while it's going up and again again i mean this stock i really love and there's a couple of really good things i can show you on technical analysis here remember whenever we want to talk about it how things go in waves when the price goes up we want these two to be going up the same way so here we had a really big run up the price hit a new high as did the pmc indicator and the macd indicator we came back down and then we came right back up and we hit a new high and this is what we call a divergence because we've got a new high in the price but you'll notice that we weakened on the pmc indicator and we weakened on the macd so the divergence is higher high but a lower pmc and a lower macd so that's a warning sign and then what happened after that the stock weakened now that brings us to where we are right now whenever we've got the pmc that comes down to the zero or the macd that comes down to the zero or very close this is what i call a reset and i love resets because it's often whenever a stock is getting ready to take off again so what happened now in my mind we've reset we've got a macd cross we've got a pmc cross where we just crossed the zero line and we went bright blue and this means that it's outperforming the s p 500 that's what the pmc measures and this one is available only on think or swim and now we've got a breakout play we've got to break over the previous resistance which is right here around fifty two dollars and we closed at 53.04 i love breakout plays right after they close above the previous resistance so this is prime for me and i'm already in this stock quite heavily and i'll probably buy be buying this more i'm just waiting on that powell announcement to see how the market reacts so a little conservative on that i want to make sure everything is okay first but love this stock it's been very kind to us we got started with new last summer which is the eevee scooter company and don't mix them up with neo the eevee car company neo is in iu where neo is nio since we started playing them they are up about 500 percent and they are rapidly expanding and growing i've seen their scooters in sofia bulgaria and even into blizzy georgia and they are perfect for both daily commuting and in tourist areas as evie scooter rentals their score card shows year to date they are up 51 11 in the last six months and 548 percent in the last year they are a profitable company with a net income margin of seven and their revenue growth forecast is 75 for next year this little scooter company is fundamentally strong and growing like a high growth stock and they are going to keep getting better with neo technologies we can show off a little more technical analysis so here we've got the stock running up to a nice new high everything is looking good it comes up hits the same level and look at the weakening on both the pmc and the macd so we know things are getting weaker it comes up and hits an even bigger high and now it has really weakened and broken down and then one of the things i love doing with the macd is playing red light green light so if we've got a red light and you see that little red arrow here that tells us hey man hold off on this stock and wait and then over here we get our green light and we had a reset on both the pmc and the macd and then look what happened it takes off and goes up so now it's ran up very high we hit the same level of a high right here we're at about the same level and now look our next high about two weeks later look at the breaking down same thing that happened over here with the breakdown and now the stock has fallen we've got a very deep reset here and this is a little bit of a warning area where i like to see things strengthen up just a little bit more before to make sure that it's going to be going up but i do like this stock and i'm waiting to buy on it and my profit target on this one is going to be right about these previous highs that we had two resistance levels right at around 53 dollars so i'm looking to buy this and then write it up hopefully hitting a profit target of 53 dollars in phase energy is another fundamentally strong and profitable company that is growing by leaps and bounds in phase designs and manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that include solar generation home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control in-phases shift about 20 million solar micro inverters to commercial markets in north america europe and australia the beastmode scorecard shows they have a p e ratio of 167 year-to-date they are down about one percent but i see that as a buying opportunity they are of 139 in the last six months and 543 in the last year their net income margin is strong at 17.3 percent their revenue growth was 24 last year which is good and the revenue growth forecast this year is 71.7 there was a huge push to solar energy because it is getting less expensive and more efficient and in phase is a rapidly growing international company in phase energy is a stock that i love check out this channel beautiful going up and everything we just covered today shows the same thing here new highs breaks down reset goes back up and up here we've got a beautiful high another high and it's breaking down we hit another high all-time high right here and it's completely broken down and so this right now is telling us hey we're in the red light zone we should not be buying and look what we just got yesterday we got a green light on the macd it's starting to come right back up and again this one's going to have my profit target on it of 218. so that's what we're looking for and now is a great time to buy this stock if you believe in this sector and industry like i do and as a bonus let me throw in one more stock that's one of our hot stocks that's been on fire for us this little company is under the radar for most people but has been ripping out huge profits the company's name is danos and their ticker symbol is dac they are one of the world's largest independent owners of modern large size container ships if you think container ships are boring wait until you see the numbers all right the scorecard shows they are up 130 year-to-date 642 over six months and 1 405 over one year just think in the last year tesla is up a pathetic 695 percent and danos is up more than twice that and they are available just below their book value lots of my patrons are in this play and we're all crushing it i never thought this stock would run up this much but here we are and if you can believe this they are still priced just below their book value and last year their revenue growth was 3.2 percent and their forecasted revenue growth is now 24.5 and now i hope you're sitting down because their net income margin is 33.3 percent and just in case you were wondering tesla's is 2.3 percent and our bonus talk is dano's ticker dac and this one's been very kind to us this one's been good for a lot of great profits what last six months it's up 753 percent last year it's up 13.92 so doing all right you can see i've got a trail stop in on this stock been in it for a while it's running up really nice and check out this divergence we hit a nice high here beautiful up high here we come down and now the stock is going higher and higher but we've got a divergence where it's not going as high and check this out right up here we just hit a new high today as a matter of fact 51.3 and it keeps getting weaker and weaker and then if we look at the channel i drew on here for you you'll see that it commonly comes up to the top of the channel comes back down to that 20-day moving average in the bottom of the channel comes back up back down and now that we're back up and look at the divergence so what am i expecting the stock to do i'm expecting it to come back down and that's what i'm watching and waiting for and then i'll be watching to see how this does and if this comes all the way down and then comes back up with a full reset i'll be happy and if the price continues to go up and everything is not moving in sync and that's a bit of a red flag but this stock i've just got my trail stop in and i'm going to ride it as long as it goes and when i've got a good opportunity to buy i'll come right back in and add more to it i know we are still in a volatile market and yesterday the market's pulled back because everybody is waiting to see what federal reserve chairman jerome powell is going to say it is a tricky communication because his words can send the markets crashing down or racing up while i think the federal reserve will have to make changes later this year that will be bad for the market i think we still have a fragile economy and hope he only has positive news if you want to lower your risk then wait and see how the markets react to what he has to say up next we've got our question of the day from aaron do you still have a 10 trail stops on all your stocks on most of my stocks i have trail stops to protect profits or limit risks because that is proper money and risk management the amount of the trail stop will vary for example volatile stocks will need a bigger trail stop percentage or you will constantly get stopped out early the ideal place to put your trail stop is just below previous levels of support and if you need help with that search youtube for my video on when to exit a trade many times i use a trail stop from about eight to twelve percent but know that one size does not fit every stock for my long-term stocks that i believe in those will not have a trail stop for example my retirement portfolios hold a lot of my long-term stocks if you

for a review number two this time the review is going to be the mile-high mint milk chocolate pink edible by the company medically correct and the product line from what I could glean from their website which I will put in the description below is the incredibles line there's several different bars that you can get in that line I'm going to try some of those in the future so as you can see it's already opened and I'm kind of doing a retro review here because I have taken a couple doses of this already but I wanted to go through the whole process with you on this review so you're not gonna get any unwrapping unboxing excitement here but you have a little tear tab here you rip it open and it's a foil foil pack it's really nicely professionally packed and what you get is it kind of looks like a KitKat you can't really see with the light but it there's three different pieces and there's three different bars and it's interesting from the dosage it says this take one bar one for high dosage patients take one bar every four hours if I did that I I wouldn't get up after the first one I'd be sleeping all day long so I've already taken two doses of this with the piece that I have and what's taken here so tonight we're going to take about let's see a ninth of it is what it kind of translates into a little handful here that should be about a ninth of it so I will munch that up and let you know what it tastes like first thing you notice when you pull it out of the package is a really strong mint concentration this they've really loaded it up and I'm pretty sure they did that to mask the THC twang that kind of nasty taste that the cannabis adds to the food that's one thing about cannabis it isn't so great as it doesn't taste very good I'm gonna get a glass of water just sec alright got a little bit of water to rinse my palate since I'm such a well renowned gourmand I can't go and Canon gourmand I don't know what you'd call it but again the taste is pretty dang good what other benefits does this have that I can determine before I actually see the effects expiration date on this I noticed is like two years which is really great that if you buy something you don't want to eat it all right away you can throw it in the freezer and probably wait at least a year and it'll still be just as efficacious take value this has a hundred and seventy-five milligrams of THC you can see it in that little green splash up in the center a little bit and this was a ten dollar purchase and so if you use my milligrams per dollar scale that translates to seventeen point five milligrams per dollar that's a really high rating from other edibles that I've eaten and another interesting thing when I was looking at this I got a read you the disclaimer on the back of this I've kind of liked it levels of active components of medical marijuana reported on product labels are not subject to independent verification and may different differ from actual levels there's the weasel they don't really know exactly how much is in here and this product is infused with medical marijuana and was produced without regulatory oversight for health safety or efficacy and there may be health risks associated with the consumption of the product dot dot or it may just or it may be saving your life I don't think it's just that's a little bit hyperbole but this is kind of an interesting little disclaimer I read on this again this company is medically correct I will include their the URL down in the description so I am signing off for now to assess the most important criteria pain relief and how any side effects may arise I'll take some notes and make it back to you it's a dirty job but someone's got to do it all right it's the next day I've just come back to the computer to do my assessment of the mile high milk chocolate bar also known as the Hershey bar from hell and I'm gonna we're gonna see how it holds up under the rigorous withering scrutiny of the ganja geezer all right based on my 4-point system for rating number one is taste I rate this an 8 out of 10 the combination of milk chocolate and strong men easily masks the THC funk that's present and Homa you know all edibles that I've had so far and again your mileage may vary I'm a big fan of milk chocolate and mint so that was a plus for me pain relief I'm gonna rate that uh no eight out of ten very good pain relief pain down the left leg completely was pushed into the background mild nagging pain stolen the lower back but easily manageable number three was side effects when my reading the side effects I'm gonna rate it a seven out of ten very manageable light high with calming effects and I was fairly easily able to comport myself in public at least I think so went for a walk and I felt great during it final rating is the milligrams per dollar rating and as we as I discussed earlier it's 175 milligrams in a $10 bar so easily I'll move the decimal one place and it comes up to seventeen point five milligrams per dollar which is the best non sale or non buy one get one price I found so far so I give that were rating a nine out of ten you add them all up the eight eight to seven and a nine and you get an average of an overall rating of eight eight out of ten for the month mile-high mint milk chocolate bar are you pretty impressed with my Photoshop food air of putting that number over the pot leaf that was a lot of work there so you should be impressed if you are impressed please click the like button down below or leave a comment both positive and negative the

look at our second product from the folks over at dedicated medicated first we looked at their cinnamon sin toast crunch I think it's what they called it 100 milligrams today we're continuing on with their breakfast cereal line and we are looking at Applejack Applejack my guess is they're actually Apple Jacks and just like the dedicated medicated we looked at last time basically this is just a cereal bar I like a rice krispies treat but instead of rice krispies Apple Jacks if you watch our last video you know that I did not particularly think the dedicated medicated was a good investment it may mean I did not get high at all but again it was only four bucks but you know four dollars for nothing is still four hours for nothing so uh you know precedent suggests that this is not going to be a good animal okay it smells like Apple Jacks and marshmallow fluff as one might expect comes apart nicely well unfortunately Applejack's are just not a good serial to have as the rice krispies treat or a whatever Krispie Treat in kind of marshmallow conglomerate they're just too chewy or too crispy this doesn't really work choo-choo any amount they're too big it doesn't even have the benefit of tasting good butter but it might so give me high right maybe right it's not terrible Asian it's just why would you want to Rice Krispies dream with Apple Jacks they're just rice krispies but it's all rice krispie treats it's I care what it means J tempered and marshmallow that being said if you ever seen weeks before what we're going to do is I'm going to come back to you guys in two hours don't

we help you cut through all the [ __ ] and garbage that is out there in the edible world and the packaged goods edible world we help you cut through all that [ __ ] and find the best products the ones that are worth your hard-earned money today we have a product reviewing another hundred milligram cannabis syrup blackberry flavoured this time and I would say so far cannabis has definitely proven to be worth your hard-earned dollars but we'll see how this one fares the BlackBerry flavor also I curiously I know I pledged not to do this again but I tried a different variation maybe the fruity color combination and the fact that I think I had too little sprite in too much syrup precluded me from enjoying the sprite mix before however this time I went with the sprite cherry even though I swore it off last time said it still was gross because it was I had only a lot less sprite and I had double the amount of syrup mixed in so this time I have half the syrup and I'm gonna have more sprite and maybe that'll make it more palatable we'll find out so I went ahead and took off this annoying little packaging here alright thought I did okay yes there goes uh let's pour the sprite in first or cherry sprite I know black berry cherry sounds like a weird concoction but uh you know might be good we'll give it a try alright cherry blackberry it this sounds like a coke freestyle machine right here sprite cherry blackberry soda all right I got my sprite in dumping the blackberry stuff in it looks very purple um looks like cough syrup I mean of course it does um nothing can be worse than the taste of that yeah I can be I can be comforted in the fact that I know nothing will be worse than the chocolate syrup I took straight and let me get something to mix this with actually I'll be right back who cares Yolo alright let's see how this sumbitch tastes this is cherry sprite mixed with blackberry cannabis 100 milligrams well that is significantly better still not good necessarily you can still taste it in the aftertaste thing this sort of heavy sort of cannabis in that thick syrup sort of taste but it is significantly better than the first time around yeah significantly better and the flavors match pretty well cherry blackberry who would have thunk alright guys well I will I'm gonna drink the rest of this over the next couple of minutes and then I will see you in two hours but you will just see me well I should I won't ever see you presumably you'll see me in just a couple of seconds but I will be back in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review alright guys I will see you then peace [Music] whoo-ahh guys it has been two hours since I had the cannabis syrup a blackberry and I am pleasantly high maybe six and a half maybe a six somewhere in there my tolerance is still a little bit lowered but I I would I would definitely recommend it it's another winner from cannabis cost me eight bucks normally ten dollars again at a discount so it's pretty affordable you know right in line with a know normally costing one hundred milligram edibles and as you can see my slurred speech I am actually pretty high and I thought the sprite cherry sprite and Blackberry combination worked pretty well it definitely definitely helped that I had a better ratio of sprite to a better proportion of sprite to to syrup in the cup that certainly improved improved it I wasn't necessarily just the cherry flavor but yeah another easy recommendation for cannabis the blackberry flavor man you know it is what it is it's not not my favorite I think that would go too well actually no that's the blackberry with the cherry is the best way I've experienced it it was the best flavor so it is my favorite what was I talking about yeah I liked it that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching it as always and if you see cannabis at the dispensary nearest you and you're not afraid of a thick thick syrup you know something a little different go for it go for it thanks for watching weeds guys we'll check you out in the next review peace", "lur_XKWEC9A": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary classic ass episode today which of course means an edible and i think maybe uh the first edible we have ever done here on wheats was from this company uh this is a product i just learned about a couple weeks ago and was super excited to try and that is the korova one of our long time favorites although it's been a couple years probably since we've reviewed one of their products this is the korova mini cookie single serving technically 100 milligrams so what makes this different is this is just one cookie with all 100 milligrams in it as opposed to the bags of 10 cookies that have uh 10 cookies with 10 milligrams each for 100 milligrams total so this is way less this is considerably more potent than your standard karova mini cookie uh and that is something that i always endorse i like smaller edibles i like edibles where you don't have to eat the giant all kinds of things and this one here is definitely that just a delightful a little a mini cookie and i believe i picked it up for 13 at my dispensary which is a pretty good value uh the the bag of 10 mini cookies i think is uh more on the order of 20 so you get the same amount of potency uh in a much smaller package uh so we've got our cookie here on the back is the ridiculous dosing guide uh so let's say you really wanted to break this down in the 10 milligram pieces that the state requires well that's how you do it um i don't think any person's really gonna do that i think this is probably more designed as a single serving and that's how we're gonna do it so let's go ahead and open up our karova mint dip mini cookie take a look at it there she is ah man this brings me back uh i ate a dozen of these back in the day the full-size ones back when um edibles could be of any size or milligramage they want uh i this was probably one of my two or three favorite kroba's the mint dip nostalgic for it anyways so this is our 100 milligram edible let's give it a bite here straight into the mint [Music] [Music] wow [Music] holy hell if that has if that has 100 milligrams of thc in it i would be very very impressed but also not that in surprise because it is corroba they make great products this little mini cookie with 100 milligrams of thc that i just had half of in one single bite um has very little weed taste shockingly little it's there but for something this small and with that potency i was expecting a lot more to be honest um i am not going to knock that against it i am however curious to see how it is going to come out so i'm going to finish off this uh little cookie i'm going to give myself probably a half hour so to space out my high and then two hours after i have the other half of this i'll come right back here with you guys and let you know our wrap-up thoughts the most important part about the edible review is it actually going to get you high so until then stay high stay healthy and we'll see you then bye everyone i'm back guys it has been two and a half hours since i had that first bite of our karova mint dip cannabis infused cookie and this is a huge winner for corova this is precisely what i wanted ah man what a good feeling uh this is what i've always hoped for desired is the super potent super strong small packaged edible and that is exactly what is uh delivered here uh taste was very much on point uh shockingly low cannabis taste for a surprisingly powerful edible uh as you can tell the eyes are even quite bloodshot it's uh how potent this is um i can't say for absolute certainty that this is like a one-to-one equivalent kind of high to the uh ten mini cookies uh but i can say for absolutely sure uh i feel um as uh as uh sure as i've ever felt in endorsing this uh even if i can't say it's as great as there are 10 mini cookies in terms of potency uh this thing is still damn good damn good enough that one of my dogs has decided to open the door there so ah wow a little rambly here that's how uh we know it's quality massive massive thumbs up for the corova cannabis infused mint dip mini cookie if you're like me you like potent edibles and you like them in a smaller form factor give this one a shot and then anytime we have a review we like this much we like to add a little cherry on top a little something extra just a little non-weed related thing that we can give out as a little recommendation this week here's something that uh that's exactly what i wanted to in the moment um uh we'll go a little too fur here a little channel youtube channel recommendation all of this stuff from veritasium which i think i may have or may not have cherry on top before uh but we'll go with the very specific video titled the infinite pattern that never repeats oh man it's a 21 minute video of pure interesting mathematical goodness i'll give it a chance give it a shot it uh it even if you don't like mac it looks cool as hell um and i think you'll still get something out of it uh also goes great with weed um or without your decision so guys two things i love super super much here our kurova mini cookie mint dip and the channel veritasium with the video the infinite pattern that never repeats how cool anyways guys that's gonna do it for this review and cherry on top thank you so much to anybody who made it here to the very end until we see you for our next video stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "jFcWBeILpxU": "hello and welcome to episode 14 of the ganja geezer today is another review day and I'm going to be following up on my latest shopping trip and we're gonna be reviewing dr. J's hash infused star bars white chocolate and cranberries and take the stuff from the giving tree a few days ago this is a company dr. J's hash infused edibles as usual I'll always include the website URL down below the ingredients are sugar cocoa butter dried whole milk soy lecithin added as a multiplier natural vanilla flavor cranberries and hash infusion oil now from their website it says that this is a cold water extraction hash versus a ethanol or butane hash they also make a big deal no preservatives or artificial ingredients of any kind in this product also on the back a lot of information which at the bottom includes the lot number and a very clear expiration date which I like so overall a very professional package and it was $13 and there is two hundred and fifty milligrams of active hash oil in this product so let's cut this thing open I got some scissors here now the bar itself is wrapped it looks like it's some foil yeah it's just straightforward tin foil and it's just a little brick Oh chocolate with some red reddish flecks in there which I'm assuming is um the cranberry if there's anything else I should be concerned so 250 milligrams here so maybe a sixth or a seventh of this is what I'm going to consume I have a knife here I'm going to carve off a little chunk that's gonna be easier said than done this is very hard flaky you know that's not working well well so there's a problem right there for me is that you just kind of broke up and fell apart so you can see here I don't know if I can show this just kind of fell apart into little flakes the chunk that I'm going to eat which I think's about 1/6 or 1/7 of it yeah I don't know I mean I'm my EverQuest for my quest for non weedy tasting edibles is still at a search very strong taste again the concentration of this doesn't surprise me alright I can taste the white chocolate in there got a little bit of the cranberry but huge strong cannabis some aftertaste well apart from that as you can see here carved off a little chunk off the corner that maybe not enough but I'm really not gonna take a risk of something with as much we just concentrated a dose so I'm going to sign off for now and tomorrow I will let you know the other three factors in my rating pain relief side effects and the both discussed the cost for a milligram ratio detail then the die is a medicated [Music] well I'm back for the review of the dr. J's white chocolate and cranberry star bars that I took last night and let's start with recap of the taste one word for that is bread very very strong cannabis taste when eating white chocolate you one would expect a very one very sweet rich treat with cranberries in there you know a really tasty kind of chocolate bar it's what you expect and all you get is really just weed weed weed weed kind of almost a cognitive dissonance in my head you know you expect one flavor and you get a very strong flavor not a pleasant one instead so show you how much I took here I just took a little chunk off the corner there maybe a sixth of a bar maybe a little less and you can't really tell the color and the lighting in here but there's almost a light greenish color in here so you know there's a very strong concentration of hash and fusion in here and when I'm taste alone I would give this a five because it's maybe even less but it's just bad but I'm giving it a modifier of adding two because of the high concentration of Medicine the 250 milligrams that's in this small little block so I'm going to bump that rating up to 7 to be fair because it is highly concentrated so for taste a final Taif final rating of seven now going into pain relief as you saw I only took a sixth of a bar for a dose and I got minor to middling pain relief you know it was still there but and also it took almost two hours for it to peak and it was a minor peak at best I'm thinking maybe a fifth of a bar or maybe a little more would be a better dosage that effects were minimal so that was a good thing overall taking the small dose into account I'm giving this a seven for pain relief as well as taste so 747 for pain side effects minimal minimal light head effects and easily manageable very easy no couch lock whatsoever so content a king and its out this light dose I'm giving that a nine for side-effects I was perfectly manageable I went out did anything I wanted to do except drive so again nine for side-effects now value no this is where this thing really shines if you look at it from the milligram two-dollar ratio I use you have 250 milligrams for thirteen dollars in the bar that gives you a milligram $2 ratio of 19 rounded down which is very high in fact it's the highest I've gotten so far so I'm giving that a nine as well not a 10 because the effects were so mild compared to other reviewed products like for example the mile-high mint chocolate bar I reviewed last month so in summary 7 for taste a 7 for pain relief a 9 for side effects or the lack thereof and a 9 for value gives you a 32 divided by 4 gives you an overall ganja gita geezer rating of 8 ok so a little aside here so this is an 8 a nice little bar very concentrated medicine 250 milligrams so my quest for an actual palatable treat is still ongoing any feedback for many of you in Colorado proving to me a treat can be made truly palatable but it would be very welcome I plan on heading over to a place in Denver called the ganja gourmet in the near future to see what they have to offer I'm thinking the dose that that you need needs to be added to a larger meal to dilute the ganja funk well that's it for now

"lSD37qU4tKw": "[Music] stoners pot heads lend me your ears for is a new episode of wheats thank you so much guys for coming back and joining us here on wheats the marijuana edibles Rob you show where we help you make sense of you our dispensary if this is the first time you are joining us here on wheats our goal is to help you make sense of your dispensary helped you understand that giant wall of edibles at your dispensary lets you know which of those products are worth your hard-earned dollars today we are looking at another drink from habit habit based out of San Diego California this is their sparkling grape drink 200 or 100 milligrams of THC promises rapid onset which I like faster apparently then your typical edibles it's got some real fruit in there or so it says 71 calories 2 servings it's a fancy looking bottle serve cold lay open slowly let's follow those directions and give her a taste so on weights the way it works guys if you've never seen this before is I'm gonna sample this product I might finish it depending how long it takes but I will finish the whole thing before before too much longer and I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how this edible or in this case this drinkable is doing so without further ado let's open her up open slowly I can see why fizzy fizzy fizzy slow slow slow slow it down still fizzy still too fizzy of this sparkling grape there we go it smells like grape juice no discernible weed out or whatsoever it smells a little bit like wine I suppose that's not too unexpected being sparkling grape juice let's give her a taste YUM no we taste space like sparkling grape juice and pretty good sparkling grape juice at that well I would drink this now again this is a little bit on the expensive site at $12 but I really like the habit I had before I really found that the rapid onset to be true and I found that uh the high lasted quite a while but that was the Kiwi flavour so we'll see if the sparkling grape is just as potent as the Kiwi YUM I gotta say on taste especially in comparison to dozers which I've had before this wins hands down let's taste legitimately good well guys I'm gonna finish off this habit sparkling grape here and I will see you in two hours to let you know how we're feeling thank you so much for watching weeks guys we'll see you soon peace it's been about two hours since I had the there we go the habit sparkling grape 100 milligrams beverage here and I like it quite a bit and I believe their claim that it does have rapid onset I was feeling it uh probably about five to 10 minutes in maybe I don't know maybe a little maybe a little more and then it was a pretty consistent hi there uh I do I I feel like starting to come down already it's maybe peaked at around the 90 minute mark but for a hundred milligram consumable it was pretty potent it still was a little bit on the expensive side at $12 but this is a drink that I have no problem recommending as you are comfortable with the expense and don't mind uh trying something a little unorthodox again that's the habit sparkling grape made there in San Diego California if you see it a dispensary near you feel free to give it a shot thank you so much for watching wheat skies and we will check you out on the next review beasts I guess I can't throw this one at you because that would be dangerous just buddy

wheats the marijuana review show we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our second look at a product from canna MX taste innovation or canna mix I'm not sure how they want us to say it only the finest quality this is their milk chocolate bar with 320 milligrams of THC and if you saw our first cannon mix review it was of their 500 milligram gummy bears and we thought that was a big wet pile of dog [ __ ] so I'm giving them a fair shake for their chocolate eye I certainly hope it's good I'm rooting for it to be good I'd love to be nice and high I certainly don't not want to be stoned I didn't want to don't want to waste my money on this stuff so I'm not looking to give him a negative review but I just want to let you know right off the bat I had a very negative experience with my first product of theirs so on the back that got their mission statement here canna MX focuses on manufacturing original and healthy cannabis products that make medicating easy effective and convenient all of our ingredients are sourced from the US and made from scratch in our facility every product is carefully infused and always lab tested that wasn't true for their gummy bears their gummy bears no lab testing results on those and but it does send the BAC lab testing by CS labs although I don't see the test results on here and actually if you go to their website canna em XCOM their website is down there IP server could not be found so they have a website listed but it's not actually up which is also a very bad sign so this cost me 20 bucks at my dispensary which is a very very good deal for a 320 milligram and chocolate edible Kiva's run about 20 dollars for 180 milligrams to fajn say i've seen it up as 20 as high as 25 bucks for 90 milligrams so 320 milligrams for 420 bucks is a really good deal it's borderline a steal if it actually proves to be potin as it says it is so I really hope that to be the case let's go ahead and open it up and give this canon MX so on the inside we got pretty standard packaging nothing too special just a little wrapper and here it is oh it's in little torn off chunks it's kind of broken in there let me in total looks like six maybe yes so six rectangular we get here of the canna M X chocolate let's go ahead and give a bite of it give a taste test mmm pretty mad tasting chocolate but really no cannabis flavor whatsoever um really yeah no cannabis tastes just kind of low-grade milk chocolate disconcerting that a 320 milligram chocolate eyeball has no cannabis taste but then again I normally find chocolate is the best mask for um cannabis so there's reason to be hopeful maybe it really just is completely masked by the chocolate flavor fingers crossed as I said there's reason to doubt but I'm willing to give him the benefit out and I'm hoping to get high so guys I'm going to polish off the rest of this chocolate here and then with all as like with all our other reviews I'll be coming back to you guys in two hours to let you know that how this chocolate is landed thank you so much for watching wheat guys and I will see you in just a bit peace it's official and welcome back to wheats it's been two hours since I had the Kanna MX milk chocolate bar and what is official you might ask well it is official that I have now had the worst edible chocolate the worst cannabis chocolate I've ever had yeah this is definitely not three hundred and twenty milligrams my fears about Kenna MX were totally realized I don't feel high at all I guess maybe around it to somewhere in there possibly this is cannabis chocolate almost always gets me to a place I want to be Kiva de false a bang chill even hubby those are all I mean they're all half the milligram \u00e4j-- or less than this Canha MX but they do ten times the damage this is a shitty product from a shitty company that lies to its customers both in our gummies and in their chocolate I feel terrible because I bought another product from them that I will be reviewing as well which is I feel terrible that I've given them more money or given them more exposure because they don't deserve it it really makes me upset that they have a website on the back that does not work in any way shape or form the says the IP address is down I don't believe for a second that they're actually lab tested these products or if they are I don't believe for a second they come back as 320 milligrams they actually I take it back they might very well be will have tested they just might come back with 40 milligrams or 30 milligrams on them they say lab tested but they don't give you the results and you can't go on their website to see you know any of that information so can I MX if you are out there and you want to speak up for yourselves if you want to you know speak up for your products I would love to have you want I would love to talk to you would love to know what your company's about why and why it seems to me at least that you guys are ripping your customers off I promise you if you come on we'll give you a fair shake we will not you know it's not going to be to attack you I I'm just I would love to to have you guys because as for right now I'm gonna tell my viewers here to stay far far far away from your stuff I I think your scam artists to be entirely frank I think your con artists and I know this is probably not gonna get you to want to come on but I think you guys should be ashamed of yourselves [ __ ] you boy can MX another real debt of a product so many a row just dud dud dud I probably won't release them all as duds in a row but just know personally here at wheats HQ I have this is like the seventh review in a row that I have had that has been a complete and utter failure for me so I'm coming off just a string of losers here and canna MX might be the biggest loser of them all boy as the edibles in California start to wind down as we get closer to that date the end of June where everything has to be pushed over to the new hundred milligrams ten dose rule there seems to be a lot of shooting companies trying to make a quick buck releasing some [ __ ] products before then and canna MX is pretty high up on that list boy another bummer I am so sorry guys I really wanted something fun for you I really wanted to come to you guys blazed out of my skull singing its praises but not to be not to be thank you guys for staying tuned to this end of this review sorry I've been a little bummed out with everybody and on these reviews but we'll find we'll find that good one soon we'll find that that new winner well guys

the concentrates that's what we're here for we're here to help you make sense of all that mess what you do you be spending your money on what's worth it you know they've got so many products that it's an overwhelming mass of products what should you actually be spending your hard-earned money on and today we're gonna answer that question in the form of edibles and we are going to take a look at our our first look at 420 bar 200 milligrams of THC starting off with the milk chocolate I've got another flavor to review as well now this is from VCC brands which if I'm not mistaken is actually the same people that produce the cannabis quencher drinks which I like quite a bit I think this is the same company bcc brands so I've got high expectations for this because I do like the cannabis quenchers quite a bit so this is I said 200 milligrams of THC and here at ok package nothing too fancy nothing to you know neither neither nice nor uh nice um it does not unfortunately have any information on it in terms of lab testing which is not my favorite thing I always like to see the lab tested results but being from if this is BCC brands of cannabis quencher I hope I can trust them chocolate I usually find to be the best vector for THC I almost always find chocolate bars to be my favorite way of getting THC down I find them to be the best tasting and usually to be the most potent so again more expectations for this bar excuse me for scratching my nose there so let's go ahead and open up and while I do that I will explain to you the way weeks reviews work if this is the first time you guys have ever tuned in very very simple I'm gonna eat this entire bar of chocolate not necessary the whole thing in front of you don't want to bore you to death well this entire chocolate and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how the product is actually working because that's what you're in the port you know it might taste great and you might like the taste but really you're paying the big bucks for how it's gonna make you feel so that's what I like to come back to you guys and that's what makes sweets special that's what we do here that nobody else does so let's go ahead and open this up and get taste test and hopefully enjoy quite a bit I do like that the package there shows you you know that each little thing is 40 milligrams pretty nice oh it does have a rather strong cannabis e odor to it oh I should also mention the price I picked this up for 20 bucks a bad a discount that there was a 20% off so I think I ultimately got for 16 which is a 16 it would be about what I want to pay for it 20 bucks you're encroaching on Keitha territory and it's gonna be hard for this to be as good as Kiva I like the design on the chocolate little leaf bar there a little concentric circle is pretty cool again it doesn't have a rather strong cannabis taste let's break up brick here and give it the old taste test okay well no matter if it's a good sign or a bad sign that is the most cannabis II tasting chocolate bar I've ever had there was a heavy cannabis flavor drip not overpowering not revolting by any stretch it's just I find chocolate usually does a very good job of masking that th that cannabis taste and and this this still had quite a bit of it so [Applause] hopefully that means it's going to be very potent and just not the best tasting chocolate in terms of taste this is not the best tasting chocolate I've ever had for short um but again as we just established it's not about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel guys and for that I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know but for you you just have to wait a couple of seconds think it's through the magic of everything just watch which guys and I will see you in just a bit deuces hi guys welcome back two weeks we are talking the 4/20 bar milk chocolate 200 milligrams of THC and I am pleased to tell you like VCC brands other product cannabis quencher this is a quality product now I need to address right off the top that I did not like the taste this is some of the worst tasting chocolate I've had that's cannabis flavored my favorite cannabis infused rather it was really not good but in terms of potency this one absolutely hits it's 200 milligram mark and then some I was I was still am not was still M crazy high two hours later actually it's closer to three and a half hours later on I watched a movie and ended up doing some other things so it's way later than I thought and I'm still rather high definitely hit up maybe like an eight eight and a half really enjoyed the effects of the 420 bar just not the taste so much but but this is at your dispensary you know if it's between this and Kibo or to fall say go with the key here the default say but if it's between this and say bang or something you have a tougher choice I might even stick with the port go with a 4:20 bar between the two of those but so you know it's not as good as the absolutely best out there but it's still a damn good product and I don't think you're going to regret picking it up and guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always thank you so much we will see you guys on the next review peace", "HtaG8WmgrFk": "three amazing items left hopefully on the dish the dankness here colors pedro sweet sativa hawaii heartbreak pre roll and this shall we WOWY chocolate ten and ten so let's shuffle it that's pretty good shuffle there we go come on disc a dankness give me something good to eat look at that I got it that's pretty good I guess it's chocolate time chowie Wow eat chocolates it's legal edibles here we got this shall we Wow a milk chocolate coming in at a meager ten milligrams of THC but also ten milligrams of CBD so I never get into the CBD I never found any good use for it or anything anyways I thought I would get this just check it out with something a little different because those bang ones I had they were ten so this is a 10 with also 10 of this so we'll see if it actually does anything I have no idea so I'm just reading the back here it's got some little instructions here says the balanced chocolates are made with 10 10 and 10 each piece can be split into two squares to enjoy with friends what yeah right fucking a bunch of people all sitting around on a 10 milligram fucking chocolate bar are you kidding me we recommend starting with just one square but then waiting to feel the effects before having more while you wait you could invent backstories for Street strangers anyway I don't understand what that thing is talking about that's all crazy but it says start with one square and there's two squares or yeah two squares well you know what fuck that I'm gonna start with two bars because fuck that here we go open it up here Nano somebody my tolerance is just way too high so I figure two bars should give me an idea see there's one kind of neat actually not melted which is nice in Alberta right now they had to recall chocolates or something because they're all melting and I can't sell them at the moment which although I guess that would encourage you to make your own and while making their own you'll probably make them way stronger and for way less money so you probably are gonna hurt them so there we go two of these shall we Wow he's you know what should we take a look with a microscope here we go up close on the chocolate with the microscope [Music] that's neat you can see like the grooves you can check them out the grooves where the letters are see that it's getting super close-up on that look at that I'm getting a top-down view right on top pretty cool huh it's going close still cool I guess it's still cool I don't know these things look ok let's break it open OOP looks cool looks like chocolate so yeah I guess I'm gonna have to eat these fucking things and we'll see how it goes okay well here's number one holy that one mm-hmm not bad [Music] hmm nice tasting chocolate very nice tasting chocolate they mean a cool thing no not really though so this will be neat to tell because I do have a pretty high tolerance I make my own cannabis oil all the time and I have it every night I've had it every night for like three months so my tolerance is up there so this would be a good indicator how this stuff is for people with a high tolerance I would say high edible tolerance not high smoking or vaping tolerance but high edible tolerance so I'll be cool [Music] anyways I'll be back need is too of course but I'll be back I'll let you know how this is I'll come back in like 45 minutes or something do like the other ones there I'll check back in in a little bit so it's been 50 minutes and say these things and I do feel a little something but it's so light they almost don't know if it's even anything it's like it's like if you're sitting here and you think you hear a knock at the door so you go over in your check and then you open the door like you look around there's nobody there so you come back and sit down and 20 min 20 minutes later you're like did I just hear a knock at the door and you run over you look again nope nothing there nobody's here so that's what it's like so far for these fucking things and you know how much these cost there were seven dollars and 20 cents each so this is like $15 what it seems like now is like fifteen dollars thrown in the garbage because this stuff is absolutely pathetic fucking shit but I will give it another 45 minutes I'll be back so I'm back here with the spend another hour so I have two hours after I've eaten these fucking things ten milligrams THC 10 milligrams CBD these are seven dollars and 20 cents each so this here is like $15 I pretty much just threw right in the fucking garbage so this stuff here is absolutely pathetic is severely underpowered severely overpriced I'll rarely say this but do not buy legal edibles they're not worth it they're fucking garbage you can make your own stuff way more you can make way more potent stuff for way less using stuff that you buy off OCS I do it myself like I'll put a link here's a link right here check out that that's how I make my oil my cannabis oil and it's way better so much better than this garbage and the funny part is I make it out of my garbage like I make it a vape scraps not even you know it cost me nothing to make it really so what the fuck is the point of these things I have no idea I don't think I'm gonna buy any more legal edibles maybe I'll try the candies the gummies I haven't tried those yet but anyways that's it for now two things left on the disk of dankness you like checking those out and I hit the subscribe button and the the Bell there it'll tell you when they come online but for now that's it for the whatever you call these things these cherry pieces of shit absolute garbage anyways see you later have a good one everybody", "v_oohD32QyE": "hey guys it's december and that means a new nutclub box and also it's almost christmas time which they remembered it's december which means a new nude club box and happy holidays to everybody uh this one's for me from nut club so unlike most of the time it is not in fact just the design on the box but they really did wrap it and they gave it a really cute little bow and it's super exciting so let's uh let's pop this open and see what's [Music] inside oh and underneath is a holiday themed box so just like way back for pride we got a special box we got a special uh december box so that's really fun on the bottom like our holiday bottom a little holly there um man this is this is really cute i'm really excited to get into it we've got all of our uh holiday things and of course some cannabis leaves so if you haven't joined us before this is a nutclub box i get it monthly and it's full of like six to eight products uh i don't choose them but i have some preferences related to them so it's going to be a surprise for all of us [Applause] some put presents under the tree others just smoke the tree thanks nightclub oh let those angels sing with an emoji great happy exploring well that's nice okay it looks like a couple brands none of which we've seen before so set these aside in case i have questions but let's hop right into it here is the box it looks like we've got some edibles definitely some uh vape cartridges and uh i can't read that upside down but we're gonna find out uh this month no flour i took that out of my preferences so i went only edibles and vapes um we'll see how that turns out differently if it changes the number or type of products but um generally i mean the box is full it's always full uh one of these we've seen before from sarah the cannabis infused gumdrops spicy passion fruit flavor i tried these uh last month they're great they're delicious uh they stay pretty fresh they're in this cute little package you get 10 of them um and they're not too strong 7.5 milligrams of cbd 100 milligrams thc across the entire package so you're really only looking at like 10 milligrams thc per gumdrop so nothing too strong and really tasty um yeah they say spicy um and there's even a little tiny chili pepper on the box but like it's it's not spicy it is like the vegas hint of spicy it's like the lacroix flavoring equivalent of spicy um yeah okay so this one which i couldn't read it says coffee and donuts so i'm guessing it's an edible um oh yep it is a cannabis infused chocolate bar with 100 milligrams of thc and no cbd i guess coffee and donuts would be the flavor and it's by uh coda signature products south american milk chocolate coffee toasted milk cinnamon sugar um yeah i actually have a branding card on these guys what do you get when you combine creamy milk chocolate fresh brewed coffee toasted milk a dusting of cinnamon sugar and solvent-less cannabis extract the number one best-selling cannabis infused chocolate bar west of the rockies now it's available to you in california decadent delicious and precisely dosed coda scored the first ever perfect score from our nudge club curators says coda signature in a quote on their branding card so let's um let's take a look at this guy uh it says please open face up and there's these like two circles uh perforated circles are tamper evident oh so i'm going to pop those punch those in press these and here we go oh it does not want to come apart okay well whole thing here then uh that is a chocolate bar it's cut in like cute little diagonals and it smells really strongly of cinnamon sugar um yeah let's let's try this if it'll let me uh-huh okay all right all right it's not that sweet i might expect and there's a little cinnamon to it not overwhelming almost more like a toffee in terms of sweetness and flavor i guess because of the coffee in there um i think that succeeds is both a chocolate and an edible um only five milligrams thc per serving so not expecting it to be too strong but it is delicious so uh this one gets a recommendation from me uh definitely check this out coda signature coffee and donuts all right what else is in here okay keef circa 2010 cannons infused mocktail beverage fruit punch flavor with 100 milligrams of thc so you're starting to see a pattern there in terms of how much shows up in each one of these products refrigerate after opening yeah nothing too exciting do we know anything about that we do drink your cannabis keith was born in 2010 as one of the original cannabis infused beverage companies high quality products stay in the party sharing a cannabis adventure keefe is considered the number one cannabis beverage brand in the united states according to bdsa i really wish they told me what that stands for um we'll take their word for it okay a social cannabis adventure cheers um fruit punch [Music] oh i hope i was supposed to take it because okay and it is like one of those child safe kind of tops oh it's a dosing lid with 10 and 15 milliliters uh markings i'm about to make a mess okay so that's uh fruit punch colored certainly um it smells like kool-aid to be honest yeah that's um it's exactly what you'd imagine it tastes red and with just a hint of sort of cannabis oil on top of it uh so i wouldn't say uh there's any sort of blend to it and i might even suggest mixing this with something else but um absolutely drinkable um and fun cute cute little container um it's actually it's not plastic i think this might be aluminum so uh cuda stem for that yeah keeps fruit punch cannabis infused mocktail nice so that is the third edible so far and we'll finish that with those uh we see saw this brand uh last month cannabis with their syrups i got to try their fruit punch last month and this time it's pineapple um [Music] i'm not going to pop this open because it's not very exciting this stuff's pretty viscous that's that's the one thing i learned it it's really a syrup it's not like that one which is easily drinkable kind of pores and slides so i wouldn't recommend doing it as a shot you might mix it in something um yeah really not a lot to say about it if you like pouring sweet syrups into your carbonated beverages this is obviously aimed at you and i got no problems with it so that's cannabis syrup pineapple flavor 100 milligrams 200 milligrams i'm sorry two fluid ounces 200 milligrams thc so pretty potent uh and that's my fourth my fourth edible so wrap on the edibles we got two beverages and two candies um pretty good haul overall and let's slide right into the uh the vape cartridges my personal favorites okay so there's four of them here representing four different brands this is one we've seen before uh cravana ascend is the product line uh dutch treat is the uh strain and it's 88.8 percent cannabinoids and 84.44 thc so once again a really high strength concentrate um and this is from a pretty big brand they've got this you know cute little package it's got a sticker you've got a slice and a button you've got to push um i really liked uh the one i got last month which i believe was wedding cake um it was sweeter than i might have expected so i don't know if they flavor these um or if it just happened to be the strain um but yeah it didn't clog no issues um looks like travon is a pretty big brand you can you can usually trust them there's nothing too exciting inside this except for the little cartridge itself and yeah we'll set that aside uh next one is alpine premium cannabis oil not to be confused with himalaya who gave me a premium canvas oil last month this is a sativa jack herrer 85 thc so even stronger than the cravana one and uh yeah 510 threaded cartridge uh if we want to open it not expecting a lot of surprises but yeah here we go so got a 510 threaded cartridge little rubber pieces uh covering the mouthpiece and the threads and a incredibly light colored oil like yellow but like pale verging on it's really just translucent it's almost like a clear oil so that's kind of cool um you see them they can they can go from like amber to to brown and this is certainly on the lighter side um i'm looking forward to trying that one yeah [Music] okay and these last two are by docist a brand i've tried before but i've never gotten from a nug club these guys pride themselves on making really tightly controlled uh dosing so uh you've got a little bit better idea of how much you're in taking so this one is a dose controller that sounds like a battery for the rest of us but let's find out yes yes yes yes all right great so this adorable little guy is the battery uh it looks like yep this cap pops off and there's the threading uh these are not universal they don't work with every 510 threaded cartridge so i couldn't use this carvana or alpine cartridge with it um similar to like a pod system right uh docest pods i don't know what they call them guess we'll find out pots they're pods okay doses pods go with the doses controller which is the battery um yeah uh looks like yes okay this guy's got a little usb charger so probably not live yet but we'll keep this guy out so we can see what the flick goes with it alright so then also from doses this is the thc plus formula pod pretty minimalist container there 82 percent thc less than 2 percent cbd is the flavor bliss thc plus okay a formula pod contains 200 doses of high potency cannabis oil for use with the dose pen rechargeable system got one of those all right cool so nedclub giving me everything i need to make this happen um only i could open it all righty wow okay so similar kind of package to the other one and it's in an adorable little wow um this guy's a little house okay yep says thc plus doses on it same white color there is a switch not even a button if you guys can see that uh on the bottom pull that down and and what happens we don't know what happens i'm gonna have to actually like wet read the instructions slide the case away from the lid away from the lock switch and lift all right all right so switch on the side slides outward then it lifts up it's like a puzzle okay at last here is our dose pod bliss flavor it's got an interesting little magnetic connector there haptic feedback buzzes yeah no screwing so that's kind of nice just magnet to magnet and with the dose pan the real difference from it and other ones because it's it's sort of the same like you inhale off of it and then it vaporizes but unlike other ones where you press a button or that's just on a timer the doses pen will buzz at you and stop producing vapor when you've hit one dose we'll see if it's got enough power to do that for us perhaps without my neighbor pulling out of his driveway okay we'll see if it's got enough power uh to give me a dose yeah so after about two seconds uh it buzzes at you to let you know it has deployed a dose uh so for those of you that are worried about overdoing it or maybe even new to uh vaporizing cannabis something like this can be very useful uh for those of us who do it all the time i find these to be a little tiresome um just because like i don't know i can decide how much of a hit i want to take off of a vape pen and having it controlled by this little buzzy device doesn't do so much for me but um never had any problem with their products and my friends who've tried them really like them obviously having a rechargeable version is great previously was only deployed to sort of like all-in-one uh disposable pens and i've talked about that in other videos but when you have an all-in-one pen with no recharger i mean there's a chance the battery's gonna die on you before you use all the product and that's just you know money down the drain and you have to like deconstruct everything if you're not lazy enough to just toss it and try again so um overall you know i like i like the doses product i think it's got a very uh clear use uh for a certain group of people and it's not for me but you know i appreciate getting him to try it because i certainly wouldn't have bought one for myself i'll throw it in with my vape collection and so that brings us to a close right let's run through it one last time right we've got doses controller battery and pod bliss flavor carvana and alpine uh concentrates and then four different idols so to sum it all up that is seven products hundred and thirty dollars after tax if you wanna get your own save twenty dollars you can use my referral link which is right there in the description thanks so much for watching [Music] [Music] so [Music] you", "Jsr_LEOd_xI": "everyone and welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are talking about dedicated to medicated and I realize I've been saying that wrong the entire time I just now noticed the two there and the dedicated it's not just dedicated medicated it's dedicated to medicated which I'm not sure why it's not dedicated to medication but whatever I know that that doesn't quite run anyways here's what we're looking at today the dedicated to medicated Reese's treat 100 milligram edible here so we've got a little warning on it at the bottom we've got our ingredients which is curious because if you look there it says ingredients marshmallow cannabis oil dry cereal and ellipsis what does that ellipsis who knows well anyways guys if you've never seen wheats before the way this works is I'm gonna eat this open up this bad boy eat a good bit of it here in front of you guys let you know how it's tasting let you know how it smells all that good stuff and then I'm gonna come back in two hours to let you know how the edible is actually hitting so without any further ado I'm gonna open up this packaging munch give it a little munch here see how it's tasting and I'm gonna finish it off off camera you come back to you guys in just a little bit okay so we're not further ado let's do this okay hi guys sorry I'm using a gimbal right now that's making this very difficult alright we are back with our Reese's treat Reese's treat here a hundred milligram bar cereal bar let's give it a taste first give it a smell smells exactly like Reese's treat cereal Reese's puffs of cereal mixed with the marshmallow fluff how does it taste like a Castelli version of what you're measuring um the Reese's puffs cereal is not a good medium for crispy treat they're too puffy did you dick they're too hard to chew so okay I mean I like rice krispies treats and I like recent puff cereal but it's just not the best of those combinations so I'm gonna finish this off here because it's gonna take me a while to this whole hung down and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling if it's anything like many of the other dedicated to medicated it's gonna be a little disappointing I've reviewed a couple of their products in the past and film them all little underwhelming but I'm hoping to be surprised with that guys thanks for watching I'll see you in two hours bye [Music] hello everyone welcome back two weeks it's been two hours here since I had the dedicated to medicated racy Street and this makes the triumvirate three four three dedicated medicated that are not so good this hundred milligram editable excuse me has no effect whatsoever don't feel anything or I don't think I feel anything total total bust but as they only cost four dollars it's hard to be super super disappointed but you'd hope even for four dollars that you'd feel something anything but that that makes the third dedicated to medicated in a row that has been more than disappointing so I'll review one or two more see if they get any better and if not that's gonna be that's gonna be it it's gonna be curtains with a dedicated to medicated line for me you'd think three strikes and you're out but I'm a little bit more persistent than that okay guys and with that that'll be it for this episode of wheats we will check you out on the next review thank you so much for watching see you next time hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "wSDwefu92VU": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary welcome to weeds guys on on today's review we are taking another look at a product from the fine folks at the Venice cookie Co and today we're taking a look at their I assume compliant with the new edible regulations taking effect this July their cannabis infused dark chocolate sea salt vegan no gluten 10 mini so there are 10 minis of whatever these little chocolate bars things are we've reviewed I think these are the people that make cannabis quencher and they also make the 420 bars which are really good and this is their new minis line here again probably can plant with those regulations on the back everything you want to see a product testing provided by SC labs love seeing that nutrition information ingredients all that fun stuff and a lot of text to get through that I'm not gonna read peace-loving cannabis that's all you need to know so this has the annoying new packaging they their instructions are to grip rip and enjoy will see if I can actually get that to happen I doubt it this new packaging is the worst Korova uses it I think Hanako now uses it it just it really sucks and their grip rip and enjoy is not precisely helpful alright guys I'm gonna have to go uh maybe grab like there's a tear thing but is that going to help no why do they even option offer the option to tear I'm gonna have to go grab some scissors I'll be right back defeat it and I'm back that was a bit of a pain in the ass I understand they have to do this but I am too stupid for this kind of packaging so here we go here are the minis right here it'll a lot like their candy bars just sort of broken up into ten little mini now this is the again the dark chocolate and sea salt let's give it a taste oh very salty well I gotta say I think that's too salty for me I'm normally like the dark chocolate sea salt combination but damn there is a lot of salted here whoo but the chocolate itself is a pretty good quality I feel and very little cannabis taste mainly just because it's covered up by that salty flavor whoo yeah way too much salt good well oh why why would you do that the rare edible where the taste is not bad due to the cannabis it's due to a different ingredient not my favorite but as we always know it's not about how it tastes it's more about how it makes you feel and for that guys I'm gonna finish off the rest of these minis although I'm not really looking forward to it and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review process all right guys what I'm gonna polish off these hundred milligrams cannabis infused dark chocolate sea salt and I will see you guys in just a bit peace [Music] welcome back awaits guys it's been two hours since I had the oh whoops there we go the Venice cookie Co cannabis infused dark chocolate and sea salt hundred milligrams here and although the edible had way way way way way way way too much salt in it I ain't even salty because damn it hits hard this is another win for the Venice cookie Co really really pleased with how it feels I I'm at like a seven or so for one hundred milligram edible which is pretty good I like this one quite a bit and it cost me exactly ten bucks I think my dispensary you know I think it was twelve so you know decent for a hundred milligram edible especially a chocolate one I said I like this one quite a bit I would definitely recommend it if you can find out at a fair price especially if your dispensary is now only stocking these hundred milligram edibles if this is the time of a hundred milligram edibles only if you're watching this then yeah then yes I recommend this one go for it so uh yeah I'm I'm pleased with it if this is our future if it contains edibles as good as this well it's far from ideal it's not gonna be the hellscape I once thought it was so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "eraBNQUqVt0":

for the first time I'm like are you like so we get touched a lot of products at Fast Company and we love covering them the latest came from a group of students at Yale they made the verb caffeinated energy bar the idea is it's a somewhat natural energy bar you know has like oats agave syrup and things like that but it's infused with a hundred milligrams of caffeine sourced from green tea their pitch is that for two dollars you basically get the caffeine of a cup of coffee but it actually cost less than a trip to Starbucks with one question is just are these energy bars as delicious as that afternoon cup of coffee like is it just about the drug that is caffeine or can I actually sort of refresh myself by eating one of these so we're gonna put it to the test right I'm from Chicago I come in and we film all week when we do these things and we're constantly exhausted so instead of the three p.m. cup of coffee we're gonna try the verb energy bar and see if we can finish the day without crashing all right so we're driving to Boston it's 2:20 all of us are currently exhausted behaving lame so it's time to caffeinate [Music] across the lower bar with like a Quaker Oh like chewy one bad bet definitely taste healthy are you guys feeling it no it's like the three of us just doing for the first time I like are you like let me feel a bit of an energy kick stop in anymore whether it's the sugar the caffeine our foundation there of like I just hit like I feel better I think it's definitely doing something so it's been an hour we had our caffeine fix and I feel like crap let's go know about you could maybe Chipotle will make it feel better [Music] today right now we've got a shooter that maintain Boston and hopefully this little dog bark lies us over I really need this right now it's also not as nice warm clipping in the car as it is when it's been chilled very particular I can call Baba can I say yesterday I felt like I kind of crashed harder than I live with a cup of coffee I wonder if it's because like think about how fast we're eating this cup of coffee you might be like enjoying or yeah totally you know sir I'm I'm back home the adventure is over and I am officially done eating caffeinated energy bars for life you know I think most of us choose coffee and tea because it's really enjoyable to drink that as for the caffeinated energy bar it's sort of like a dry crumbly sweetened piece of cardboard that honestly could use a cup of coffee on the side anyway what do you think is this product useful or useless let us know in the comments below if you want to see more useful or useless click here and for more Fast Company videos click here and don't forget to subscribe", "96y9vctDktw": "hey guys Rebecca from elements of eternity so today I am working with cannabis again I am making a edible medicine I'm making chocolate peanut butter truffles these are actually going to be dipped in homemade organic chocolate so I already D carved my marijuana and medicine and today I am using sunset sherbert this strain is actually known as galette oh it's a indica dominant hybrid 85% indicus of 15% sativa strain it's very potent it tested about 29% it's mom and dad is Girl Scout cookie and pink panties actually so I was wanting to make an extra strength medicine here I wanted them to be about a hundred milligrams apiece by the time I'm done with them now for starters they recommend around 10 milligrams and see how it goes so to make my butter I used a organic here's my gonna be the mix I know it's cream but it tastes just like the inside of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup but I used an organic hormone-free churned butter cream like a butter and organic coconut oil is going to be for my chocolate and what I did was I usually it is about two ounces per pound of butters but I actually used three and I didn't use trim I actually use the buds I got this from the cultivation car farm the other day and I grind this up so I ground up the three ounces of this and to measure your THC when you're making edible guys it's always a rule of thumb that one gram of cannabis has a thousand milligrams of dry weight that means a strain house like say for instance 15 percent THC now this strain has 29 percent CHD their THC so it's higher but for instance the average medicine flower has 15 percent THC it'll have about a hundred and fifty milligrams of THC 15 percent of say a thousand milligrams equals 150 milligrams but sorry I got dizzy for a second but the average strain actually is only 10 percent anything over 15 or 20 percent in your strain is considered above average and high in THC and it's considered extremely potent and this strain here I'm using actually for edibles is really good with appetite stimulation it helps with pain restlessness and sleepiness the great thing about these is that it doesn't it does make you feel good and euphoric but it's not supposed to knock you out now if it does knock you out that means you took too much and since everybody handles edibles completely different it's highly recommended that if you're not used to edibles to start small like say for instance these are a hundred milligrams apiece to start out actually in a fourth now if you're you know used to this and all that you've got to eat the whole thing but yeah so what i'm doing here actually I need in my hands are sterile I need 50 of them if I have 50 of the these right here that's a hundred milligrams each now if I don't make it that far and get actually 50 of them then they're actually going to be more potent than that and I have my labels and ingredients in all that forum these are amazing alternative medicines for you know people that are really having a hard time with illness or cancer say nausea energy or whatever and I'm using the stainless steel ball is half of them because I want them all to be the same size and what I do is I dip them in powdered sugar so that they don't stick and kind of just pack it in there and knock off the excess so that and like I said they're going to be dipped in chocolate so they're going to be so they're going to be truffles chocolate peanut butter medicated truffles mm-hmm by the time I'm done with them and you know for people who are not familiar with edibles when they eat them they expect this high like you would smoking marijuana and it's actually nothing at the sort now you do get high and you do get intoxicated I'm not gonna lie about that but it's not the same you can be in a lot of pain and within a half an hour you'll start feeling your pain ease away or nausea or joint pain muscles it's great for arthritis hey guys I'm back along my camera father so I just did my chocolate oh and by the way I'm sorry my phone cut out I had to lower my resolution on my phone so I could finished the video so this half is going to be a little less better quality so I made my chocolate which is just organic coconut oil organic cocoa powder some honey and since it is summer months I want my product to hold up so I added a little bit of organic beeswax to the chocolates so that it holds up and I also crushed some Adeem a nuts which are kind of like a bean they kind of taste like a roasted peanut and I crushed them up it's gonna go on the tops and I set these in the freezer anything easier to to handle and for the chocolate to free zones or set up so we're going to do and let it drip off c6o and if you chop wits like this and you're wanting to add toppings you have to do it right from the get-go because once it cools um just like so so I'm gonna pause this and get more done and then I'll be back okay guys I'm back so I ended up getting them all done dipped in chocolate and they turned out really great I decided to only put the a dummy on some the Adame nuts and for packaging they actually go on one of these a little and they hardened up great so they go on one of these and in one of these boxes and plated with the ingredients and the sonim so yeah they turned out great I must say guys that I know they're at a hundred milligrams but I'll tell you what I test all my products so I um tooth like I don't know it was like a [ __ ] half a teaspoon of just the filling and let me tell you I'm I'm really feeling motion but I was really nauseous and hurtin and that's all gone a little loopy I honestly wouldn't drive that's for sure so yeah I'm really really happy with how they turned out and they turn nice and hard because I put the little bit of beeswax in it so yeah that's about it so I'll talk to you guys later bye", "MTDlNM7LYFQ": "[Music] welcome to infused eats the cooking show where everything is infused especially me tonight we're making confused s'mores this episode is brought to you by mighty fast herbal infuse ER visit the herbal infuser calm for tons of infused recipes made just for you now let's get started here's what you gonna need to make infused s'mores you need one and a half tablespoons or so of infused coconut oil or butter 2 cups of chocolate chips you could use dark chocolate or milk chocolate need about 16 marshmallows for this quantity of recipe as well as 16 graham crackers we also need some candy bar molds optionally and a fire and some sticks now the first thing we want to do is to infuse either our coconut oil or our butter and you could use the mighty fast herbal infuser if you want it to be quick and easy or you can use any of the methods that we've shown you before for infusing coconut oil or butter it's up to you which one you want to use but either way make sure that you decarboxylate your herbs in the oven for 250 degrees for 25 minutes before you make your infusion [Music] now the next thing we're gonna do is to infuse our oil into our chocolate for this you're going to set up your double boiler over low heat and just as the chocolate starts to melt you can pour in the infused oil or butter then just continue letting it simmer and as it does whisk it together until it becomes smooth and fully combined and before it gets too hot and tacky you want to take it off the heat [Music] and the next step is sort of optional because you can also use just wax paper and pour this out on some paper and to break it into pieces later but if you have some candy bar molds it's a lot easier to break it up into full-size or regular sized sections so I'm using the candy bar molds that I have here and I was able to make actually about four bars with the amount of chocolate that I have now and you want to let those chill in the freezer for one hour or in the refrigerator for two hours by the time your chocolates getting ready to use it then you want to build your fire and roast your marshmallows and whether you like them burnt to a crisp or just lightly golden brown well that's up to you either way it's going to be delicious now you could use a torch or some other way to toast off your marshmallows but there really is no other way to make s'mores in with some good friends around the fire [Music] and now we come to the fun part for the stack and smash if it's hot outside like it is here you might want to use a cooler or some cold presses like I am to keep your chocolate at a chilled temperature otherwise this kind of chocolate would melt really easily but my bars are fully formed and I've taken them out of the molds and now I'm cutting them into pieces for each of the individual stacks and also we have some marshmallows ready to go and you want to use the marshmallows when they're fresh off and watch out for the critters when they're outside because they like s'mores too so then we're going to stack a marshmallow on top of the bottom of a graham cracker and then add some chocolate the amount is up to you and then put another graham cracker on top and then you smash them together ever so gently try not to break the cracker but you want to press the chocolate down into the marshmallows so it all kind of smells together into a gooey gooey delicious flavor that's totally infused and totally satisfying [Music] now s'mores are best enjoyed outside by the fire with some good friends so make sure you have some good friends on hand and head on over to the herbal infuse or calm to find out how to get your very own herbal infuse or device and for some more recipes I hope you enjoyed this recipe on how to make infuse s'mores

chocalate this is their dark chocolate bar 200 milligrams of THC I've already reviewed one of their products liked it quite a bit I reviewed their milk chocolate this time we're looking at the dark and I gotta say I'm pretty I got good expectations high expectations for this one because the first one was such a success so we're out here at the beautiful dog beach you can look behind you and see all these wonderful ships maybe maybe not long the beach I believe the second largest port in the United States may be the first largest by dollar amount it's even a little larger spy dollar amount or byte the total tonnage I care I have smashed my finger making this very difficult to open guys oh wait wait I see something here ah I got it but I'm dealing a thumb so here we go we've got our high five bar here you can see it with its little logo embossed on it let's give a bite of the dark chocolate again this is 200 milligrams oh and it cost me I believe 15 dollars at my dispensary so a pretty good deal for a 200 milligram chocalate bar oh no tastes pretty good good dark chocolate nice quality almost zero cannabis taste - uh - speak up almost none whatsoever just a good quality chocolate alright guys whoop I'm gonna finish this off and I will come back to you in two hours or through the magic of editing just in a couple of seconds and we'll let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] two two hours later alright guys we are two hours in the future um and I am talking about high by dark chocolate 200 milligrams of THC and curiously at least curiously to me I am less high than I was for the milk chocolate I definitely am less high than I was that the less high five bar not dramatically so not the golf isn't extreme but I am noticeably less high I'd say I'm maybe four right now which is not as high as I was hoping to be I was hoping I was gonna be as high as the last one but that's just not the case so maybe their chocolate isn't super consistent I don't know yet we will experiment some more with high five but I I would say for sure I definitely feel less high than I did the first time just look at my eyeballs why does snow not that's a perfect metric by any measure but you know in a pinch it'll work so this time it was a little bit of a disappointment for hi-fi uh yeah I was I was expecting more so they got pinged a little bit for that I'm sure just four diminished or four reduced expectations but I'm human so I'm fallible I still don't hate it I still like the way it tasted and it's still and I'm still kind of high so you know it's not a complete loss and it was it was 15 bucks so it's not the most expensive chocolate bar edible it's just this is no longer in the same ballpark as like a Akiva bar this is this is out of that contention out of that conversation now well guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on a later of you piece spec pack through our why is my tongue blue Oh brisk that's why bye guys", "wGLelLSwMS8": "okay welcome back to you weeks everyone the marijuana edibles review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at another product from punch combo we are looking at the peanut butter dark chocolate punch combo 225 milligrams of THC 39 calories per serving three servings in the package we're going to ignore all that and eat this whole bad boy to see how it makes us feel now I have had one punch combo before I quite liked it it wasn't the best tasting snack I've ever attaboy I've ever had but it did hit pretty hard as advertised and it's been such a small discreet little package I mean like look at that a tiny little package with 225 milligrams of THC and it doesn't taste terrible it doesn't taste great but you can definitely Jack it down oh I didn't even notice this before 9 individual 25 milligram doses it shows you what it looks like when it's broken down they're pretty nice not that you really need a reminder Oh berry peanut buttery looking so there you go a lot of peanut butter a lot of chocolate there she is again this is the punch combo peanut butter dark chocolate that we are reviewing on wheats 225 no make up 225 milligrams of THC here we go it's not bad you can still taste the weed um I think it's actually better than the dark chocolate raspberry yeah the peanut butter helps mask the weed flavor better but there is definitely a wee taste to it but it's not terrible I mean you're not gonna you know struggle to get this down it might even taste good dis done not to me but again 225 milligrams of THC in this tiny little package so let's go and polish it bad way off you knew I liked you all right well that wraps up for the punch combo nice and easy to get dem don't have to sit there in two for an hour um but the most important thing as we know guys is not how it tastes but how it makes you feel so I will come back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling then and hopefully it's just like the other punch combo and packs a powerful wallet so guys I'll check back with you in two hours until then thanks for watching everyone has been two hours and welcome back to weeds we are talking about whoops we are talking hello everyone it has been 2 hours welcome back to weeds uh I have just welcome to wheats everyone it has been two hours since I consumed the punch combo peanut butter dark chocolate bar and I'm feeling pretty good I like this line a lot like its predecessor not necessarily saying one came before the other just in the way that I ate the minutes its predecessor it didn't taste super great but uh I feel pretty baked right now and it's such an impressive small little package I feel like you could just throw this in any bag you could take this with you just to anywhere maybe on your way to the airport super super discreet and it for being that potent it's just really really impressive so if you see the punch combo peanut butter dark chocolate at your dispensary near you and it's not too expensive there

any experiences with Stan or you know what's your your take on with like psychedelics like no yeah yeah tried it I've been like wanting to at least like at least rooms but like I just like heaven I think I think I had an opportunity to potentially cop some I went to this event a couple weekends ago that's just like something like kind of secret like cannabis event put on by this group like maybe multiple events like every month it's at least a little bit of month and like some of the vendors in addition to like we even dance and whatever and I was like damn truce and I didn't like I should have brought more money but I only brought like limited amount of money so like I had already copped a bunch of stuff and didn't have enough time like much money left over to splurge on some shrooms but like there's definitely something that I want to try like in the near future yeah madam potentially LSD but I'm a little bit worried about that well and I think that I think you you kind of like dipped a toe in when you took way too much but I don't that was a mistake bro haha wholeheartedly that was mistake but I'm just saying you could you could easily have a psychedelic experience within that oh yeah I believe and how much what like that yeah yeah yeah I like that okay okay so what happened with you with your situation yeah I was at the Korea bro and where'd you get this stuff from so so there's this company and I don't know if there it was this bud box company I'm gonna be heard of that but they like you the packages like this one Internet and you have to like I have a password to even access the side or whatever so I got the edible the munch box I think it was called and it just had a variety of edible was like it was a and they're like like officially like stuff on my Denver and stuff like officially package company like so I got home there's some brownie in there and it was a cookie there was this pretzel peanut butter at the [ __ ] there was some some Fruit Chews and then there was a she but she and I think I heard about Chiba Chu from from from Stan cuz like he had just you know he just knew about that like in like so I was like okay I got you so one day I'm with my girlfriend and we're just like let's try the Chi with you today I think it's a Saturday so we were like look at it I'm like man let's just take half like it we'll take half of it right we'll just take half so that's like one half she took one half this [ __ ] tastes like a 2-0 I'm like the and it's the most like good taste and edible that I've had I don't really taste any you know we oh so we're chillin bro the stuff starts to hit some type of way like where I'm just like damn like you see damn and like we're like I remember what we were watching believe we are like having a [ __ ] good time bro like we are laughing hard and like just like making some type of clever connections and like we was also sort of waving bro for like 30 to 45 minutes brother was having some good as fun and then it just went south bro just it's just declined like like quickly it's in there and I think like when we were having a good ass time I like we had already like eaten food like a lot and then I like I just had some Ben and Jerry's in the fridge a pint I'm next on it I finished it and like that was the one that was the second mistake first thing was taken she would shoot the second one thing was eating the whole [ __ ] pint of ice cream as it was not so we're on the couch bro and we just start feeling like for lack of a better word just just crazy bro like that was just like what's going on right now like an end and the feeling I had was just like something's happening but I don't I think I don't like it the thing and I think is it's gonna get worse so like of course yes it got worse so like I just start like getting intense knowledge it broke stupid intense Nos and I'm like and I told my girlfriend I was like I got it I gotta go upstairs cuz I'm thinking I got a naked the bathrooms upstairs i room was upstairs I'm just throw up and I go to the bathroom on stairs bro and I'm just over the sink like contemplating everything everything in my life I was just like thinking like God please help me please and it was some sort of thought process where like my mind was racing so ridiculously but I was also it was also like time was going slow but in reality like time was moving fast for like so I'm just I'm over the sink for like at least 30 to 45 minutes just like trying not to throw up like right I'm just like I'm trying and then I'm like I we'll myself I'm like I have us I have a stomach of Steel I'm good I'm good and I go downstairs so I'm like mink my girlfriend is downstairs like if I'm feeling like this I'm no she not something good either so like I gotta go check on her so like I go down the stairs mind you I take the stairs one at a time so I don't really know how long it took me to get down low but yeah and then when I say one at a time I mean like one foot second foot on the stair one foot second foot rest one foot second foot on the stair and go all the way down like hang on to the walls as I'm heading towards the living room and then I read my girlfriend's in the bathroom like down that's now stairs and like I'm just like are you okay and I'm just like okay I'm and then I just was like oh and again like I was rushing but I took them [ __ ] one at a time again to go up and I just did it a little bit quicker this time because I was just like the consternation bro was too much I was it was just like in stress went to the bathroom upstairs and I just I just hurled I just I just threw up and it pretty much was just that I scream that's what I would call the memory of just throwing up bad ice cream and being like oh my [ __ ] goodness what the [ __ ] and I'm still [ __ ] up bro I was [ __ ] up to the point where like I think I just had to lay in the bed I have a debilitating I just like curled and of like almost a fetal position in the bed and just was just there like praying there like my girlfriend like we'll be okay and come upstairs and like I think she came upstairs eventually because she was just like I guess in a better stage michaelis and she's just like I think just laid in the bed with me and then like we were like in and out of sleep some type of way or like I think I again like two or something tonight in the a.m. and I was just like [ __ ] I still don't feel this so I let me just go the [ __ ] back to sleep but I feel a little bit better than I did earlier but I still feel like [ __ ] like it's best to just go to sleep the next the next day both of us were like yeah this is we were like yeah we're gonna take a break anything we related like that just the smell of it's like was just like triggering a terrible feeling that I had like right dude like when I was trying not to throw up in the night right when I do it all of that I was just like oh my god and like took my girl we go you know and then also that following day like I told Stan about about this I think of the following day was it the following there sometimes and I was just like brother I tell you about what happened and like I asked him I still had like the package of the tuba shoe and like that's just said a hundred milligrams and I was like stand I was like this just say a hundred milligrams and he was like bro you guys took like terminal illness dosage levels of the deeper - that's why you were [ __ ] and I was like I used are you serious just like yeah bro like the regulation is like 10 15 maybe 20 y'all 50 and I was just like oh my god that makes a lot of sense oh okay because I was really mystified I was like growing like how can this small little thing half of this [ __ ] like finish me like this like it has to be something wrong okay well that's what was wrong and I'm over here thinking like damn so it's a freaking terminal illness patient like say stay will they be okay like that's how they'll be they'll just be okay like will they be good cuz like actually the way I was feeling I was like a damn like having cancer like that's a gotta be I mean I know it's trash but like for that bag that type of doses will like make it bearable yeah it's like well yeah and I feel like that was just like an introduction like when you were explaining like time going slow but fast at the same time I feel like that like distortion was like somewhat psychedelic and yeah yeah yeah cuz like one you mentioned and you said that like that level of edible like looks like kind of like you know similar to at least have some psychedelic qualities I thought about it and I was like yeah the way it the way my brain and head was feeling and I can't even recall like I know I texted all that [ __ ] I gotta look do I text just cuz I was describing this [ __ ] and it was like you know pretty close to the event so I was describing this [ __ ] how that she was feel me and right now like I remember but like not the same as like how I described it so like I can't capture it the same way but that [ __ ] was crazy and it was it was legitimately I will never do it again but like and then now I'm like wary about freaking edibles like I I'm just like man I'm definitely not trying to err on the side of taking too much so like if I don't know how much this [ __ ] is man I'm probably gonna take too little and it's probably not gonna do anything but like better than they did too much and for the national again the context it Oh", "VsO_DopZhSM": "Hi, I'm Dr. Tod Cooperman,  President and\nFounder of

Fortunately, we didn't find significant amounts of lead or other\nheavy metals. So why even bother eating any of these products? Well, first of all,\nit tastes great if you like chocolate. Second, these flavanols can\nhave health benefits -- modest health benefits. Basically, studies have shown\nthat the cocoa flavanols can relax blood vessels, slightly lower blood pressure,\nslightly improve certain aspects on a short-term basis of memory and cognition,\nvery mild benefits for the skin in terms of wrinkles, and\nsome other benefits as well.  So let me get into really what to look for when\nyou're choosing these products, and these are just some examples of products that\nwe just recently tested. We've tested many others and all this is in our\nreport on ConsumerLab.com where we show all the information, our Top Picks,\nand if you're a member of ConsumerLab you can certainly get those reports on\nmany other health foods and all types of dietary supplements which we've been\ntesting now since 1999. So, first, in terms of a dark chocolate and cocoa, when you\nlook at a product and it says say, you know, 90% cacao or cocoa, what that\nmeans is the amount of cocoa liquor that's in the product as well as cocoa\nbutter. These are the two things, kind of key components, of cocoa beans,\nBy the way, you can actually buy cocoa beans roasted and cracked as cocoa nibs\nas well, which we also tested. Here is what cocoa nibs look like.  The issue\nthough when you're looking at a label is that since they're combining the cocoa\nbutter -- which has no flavanols, with the cocoa liquor -- which contains\nflavanols, you can't tell from the percentage on a\nproduct really whether it's going to be high in flavanols or not. In fact, we have\nfound that products, say, that claimed to be 72% cacao may have more\nflavanols than, say, a product that's 90% cacao. In terms of the\ncocoa powders, people typically use about one tablespoon of cocoa powder -- five\ngrams -- per cup of cocoa, and what we found is there is a tremendous variation in\nthe amounts of flavanols, and one of the big determinants there is whether a\nproduct was Dutched, or treated with alkali or alkalinized, or not, and this is what\na cocoa powder looks like that has not been Dutched. It'll have much higher flavanols than, say, a product like that looks like this --\nvery rich dark chocolate color that has been Dutched tor alkaline treated because that reduces the flavanols; it can reduce it by as much as\n90%, you know sometimes this may be half as much, but we did find that the amount\nof flavanols in cocoa powders can vary tenfold even within a brand whether it's\nDutched or not. So if you're trying to get higher levels of flavanols, don't get a\nproduct that's Dutched. If you don't really care about the flavanols and you\ngo more for taste, the Dutched products are less bitter. When you're dealing with\ndark chocolates, you have the same issue: Products that are Dutched, again will have\nlower levels of flavanols. Now the good news is, in our most recent\ntesting in late 2019, we found at least one cocoa powder that had a\ndecent amount of flavanols and very little cadmium, which is a\nvery different case from some other products which might have had higher\nflavanols but much higher levels of cadmium. There is a limit as to how much\ncadmium you should get. Canada has set a limit -- for adults it's about 4.1\nmicrograms per day, for kids it's about 3 micrograms per day.\nCalifornia has a similar limit based on the the 4.1 limit. Many of the cocoa\npowders will exceed the limit for children -- nearly all of them, \nexcept for a couple that we we found this year. Some will also exceed it for\nadults, so, you know, if you're just buying something off the shelf, I wouldn't have\nmore than one cup of cocoa powder -- of cocoa -- per day, to play it safe. If you\nknow it's in there, you know, you look at our report, you can go a\nlittle higher. In terms of how much flavanol you actually want to get to get\ncardiovascular benefits, memory benefits, you need at least 200 milligrams per day,\n500 milligrams -- actually the memory benefits kind of kick in there, even up\nto 900 milligrams per day. It's hard to get that with some of these products. You\ncan turn to a cocoa supplement which is made from a cocoa extract where they've\nextracted the flavanols out, concentrated it, and put it into basically a powder\nwithin a pill. On the other hand, there are cocoa flavanol supplements that\nwe've tested that were virtually the same as cocoa powder -- they were not\nextracts and they really contained just a couple of milligrams of flavanols\nversus the hundreds of milligrams that you'll get from a capsule of a very good\ncocoa flavanol extract.  In terms of the cocoa nibs, unfortunately they are also\ncontaminated with with some cadmium, so, you know, you need to go easy with those.\nNone of them really passed our test because based on the suggested serving\nsizes they all exceeded the 4.1 micrograms per day, but there was one\nthat was better than the others, and, again, all that is in our report. \nSo that's about it for cocoa and chocolates. Again if you go to\nConsumerLab.com you will see the results for each of these products. We\nalso have price comparisons, information also about the calories that you'll get\nfrom eating each of these products. For example, if you choose one of the very\nhigh flavanol cocoa dark chocolate bars you can eat only, basically, about 1/3 or\nless than from another, you know, high percentage cacao dark chocolates to get\nthe same amount of flavanols -- and you'd obviously be reducing your calorie\nintake, you know, by 1/3 as well.

We put these videos out with every\nreview that we publish, so you may want to subscribe if you want to see our next\nvideo and be alerted to that.

Thank you for your time. Bye-bye.", "WvWyBEKcNkA": "is a cannabis infused chocolate bar the label claim on it says that it's a hundred milligrams of Delta 9 THC that my research is focused on cannabis infused chocolates specifically relating to trends in the sample prep and how it relates to the potency readings that we record just dusting I would say the takeaway is that the presence of chocolate in the vial can interfere with our ability to accurately test the amount of THC in that product and that can be a negative for the consumer and for the producer the chocolate bar might in reality have more cannabinoids than the lab finds and thus the product might actually be overdosed when it gets to the consumers hands there is a possibility that the customer might feel too high but on the whole the actual effect is probably not enough that it would make the difference between somebody having a good experience or needing to go to the emergency room lemon lilac cheese nectarine gelato 33 and strawberry banana I don't think that this causes a substantial health risk to consumers but I do think that it might affect their confidence they have in the legal market and thus this science is important to establish the the scientific legitimacy of the cannabis industry in its nascent days Keith roll the joint is rolled in Keith which pumps up the potency now I think it will bring confidence to the to the whole industry because we're starting to learn more about what's really going on and now we're testing chocolate the right way to get the right values out of the matrix so I'm more optimistic than pessimistic about it that's good there is some branding on this handle", "p6oKnG_sEwc": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much

Delta 9 this is why I decided to give capsules another chance Delta 9 is a company that I know from their chocolate I've reviewed three of their chocolate bars and have found them to be all amazing so I thought I would give their capsules a fair shake because I've never tried anything from gold capsule than there's one capsules and those were terrible so because this is from the trusty brand delta 9 or at least their chocolate is the trusty brand I thought let's give the capsules another chance who knows you might find some some gold here if not liquid gold so but I think I'm gonna do with these actually is I'm not going to eat them or take them all right off the bat I think I'm gonna do them in two batches 250 milligrams batches about 90 minutes apart so do all three of these over the course of the three hour span and come back to you guys two hours after the last time so this will take five hours in in totality to let you know how we're doing so I'm gonna take or four and a half hours I guess I don't know something like that so I'm going to do ten of these then come back to you guys in 90 minutes let you know how I'm feeling and then take the other ten and then come back to you guys two hours after that and lets you know how we're feeling with the whole batch so let's get started with this first half here let's open it up and just like you would expect this little bottle here oh and we've got our dastardly packaging which I opened nice and easy alright so here we go open open open here are what our capsules look like they're pretty handsome capsules white and green just like the packaging so let's grab five of these for now let's put the other five back in the model and let's take the five that we've got here and just uh I pressured that male life like I could choke okay [ __ ] it'd be funny did it choke thank you Ron Palmer love you alright well those pills tasted like plastic and amazing oh my god such rich complex flavors and those pills ooh still you know decoding all of the complex and just interesting tongue feel that I had with those pills of course I'm just [ __ ] with you who cares what they tasted like they tasted like pills I will see you guys in 90 minutes however to let you know how these first half of these pills are filling so I will see you guys in just a bit thanks for watching wheats and I will see you soon all right guys on back it has been about an hour and a half since I had the first five of the Delta nine capsules which is 150 milligrams of THC and I would say I'm already way higher than I was before when taking the gold caps 250 milligrams of THC definitely way higher than that but not outrageously high I'd say I'm at a four maybe a five somewhere in there so definitely feeling it which is a huge improvement but not you know this isn't like akarova 150 milligrams cookie um these excuse me these five pills um but we still have half the bottle to go so we'll see how much more these final five pills are how much farther they get us in the process all right so here we are we've got our final five these handsome little devils here we'll just do the same thing as before risk choking to death and take them all down in one go still alive that's got to be a sign of something so we've seen how it the first half go after about 90 minutes now let's see how the second half of the bottle goes and for that guys I will check back with you in about another 90 minutes and we will see if I am maybe at Delta nine instead of a delta for that kind of works all right guys I'll see you in about 90 minutes peace welcome back guys another 90 minutes has passed since I had the Delta nine capsules the remaining 150 milligrams and that seemed to do the trick put me from about a four to a straight linear about eight or so I'm quite high as you can tell from the eyes well no no no let's not say eight let's let's let's let's pump the brakes a little bit and go with a seven it's not let's not jump too far I think I'm maybe at about a seven but I'm pleasant with them I'm happy with where I'm at capsules I don't think are ultimately going to be for me these are a hell of a lot better I think than the gold caps the Delta nine capsules that's just on a sample size of one from both companies so you know take with that what you may but but my experience on these are a hell of a lot better than what I have with the gold caps and these were cheaper so that's a total win for Delta nine I don't think I'm gonna be purchasing them they're a little too expensive for me for what you get I do like the concept of them I do like the idea of capsules and just being able to like have something super super discreet that you don't even have to eat I just haven't found one yet that's as potent as I'd like them to be these are close these are close and if they were a little bit cheaper I would buy them on the regular for different occasions but as is I think I'm going to probably not be picking these up in the future but you know who knows maybe if they come out with different dosages or change the price or if I'm looking for something just to mix into a medicine bag or something maybe I'll maybe I'll still give these a chance and also let's give the wheats producer here round of applause for this back here oh my god isn't this amazing the wheats producer just which the they came in here the other day and they're like this place is a piece of [ __ ] we're whipping it into shape and I was terrified because if you ever met the wheats producer you would be you know mortified if something like that were to happen to you and look what happened you know a few days later we have this professional-looking thing in quotations thank you so much for watching wheat skies we will check you out on the next review Papa Papa peace great", "UIP7ILzyErA": "welcome to may produce TV one of our most common questions we get asked is how do I add a nicotine shot Nick shot have you want to call it so I thought I'll show you how we do it nice and simple on a video there's a couple of tricks and techniques we use depending on the type of bottle so you can join me at my desk in a second I'm going to show you exactly how you add an ink shot hi so you've joined me at my desk and you've got some Nick shots or a Nick shot and you're trying to work out how to light them so first things first don't you often get asked us how many Nick shots do I need so I've got here is a 100 milk short film and also a 50 mil short film now a 50 mil short fur that's called a short field because it's actually in a 60 ml bottle so it's short filled by 10 mil and the hundred mil short film is so called because you've guessed it it's short filled in 120 ml bottle to 100 mil which means 20 mil gap now when you have a hundred mils Eero liquid in order to get it up to 3 milligrams you need two of these 10 mil Nick shots it brings it around to about 3 milligram depends on whether or not that's 18 milligrams or 20 milligrams so you died - Nick shots - 100 ml 1 Nick shot - a 50 mil will not give you 3 mg 3 mg so there's a number of different ways to add a Nick show and it does depend on how the bottles made so here's an example this particular bottles cotton Council my wife thorn square it's a hazelnut tobacco so there are some promotion and how the bottle lid comes if you check out you can turn it around and voila you can unscrew the nib and you'll see a hole in the top and then that corresponds with let's get this box make a little bit easier down take this off because these things go around they're an annoying flavor in the world and you can just shove the nib in there like that and squeeze one of the little tips you can do because the bottle is under the new regulations are a little bit harder plastic they can be hard to squeeze so we suggest getting a set of scissors like so and you just cut the top off by that pick that off nice and easy got your white tip and then you can pour it into the juice like so take a couple seconds put it up put the lid back on if you haven't put up completely but you would screw it back on nice and tight put the lid back on and give it a wallop in good shake a rollicking good shake have you like to shake it shake out loads and you can let it sit for a while shake it and it actually looks like it's got lots of little tiny bubbles in it and then leave it for the best way to work it is to leave it for an hour two hours with a lid off but doesn't really matter you can vape it pretty much straight away we do suggest you leaving it for a little while once you've topped it off so that's one way of doing if you've got an unscrew a guitar check them first they don't all come either one but get or turn if you're on screws that's easy nice and easy okay so next up we've got black unicorn which is brand new liquid you can check out on our website bacon juice Telecom if you want to find out what what it's saying and this one's a bit different to the comic-con it stops the green men yeah so like always if you don't know you fossum you've got the bottle give it all twists if it turns it's not an unscrew one so what we're gonna do here is we'll get our Nick shot I've already cut it down with the tip bar gonna give it a bit of a wider cut and you might think why cut and this tip not that's it the reason is because if you cut some what you'll do now is in the cut tips so if we cut the tip of this off and shove the Nick shot down there and squeeze it it means your any ever gonna have a needle tip it's a it's about that high and about that wide it's gonna leak everywhere so we don't wanna do that what would do is we'll chop this off and we're going to marry these two up like so we start by squeezing out the air in this bottle so you get the nice things go everywhere so you squeeze it so you got no air left in the bottle which makes next stage a bit easier and then we just squeeze out now you see nothing blinking down the side takes a little while it's going don't figure out so far off the bottom so then you gain you squeeze the bottle again you can see there just squeeze it up so you get the air out bang that on top like so and then you just squeeze again that helps it pour out keep going to the run start do it again like so and you squeeze down again we're we're nearly at the end of the bottle so that's how you fill up see they're pretty much empty didn't take too long that's how you fill up a [ __ ] shot if you can't let screw the top lid back on give me good shake a couple mix up all the way you'll end up having areas with high nicotine in the liquid than others and sometimes you can pipe in it feels a bit stronger let that set for a while and the final one open up our box of Duty vapes give them a guy giving tried them fantastic liquids massive range this one here is their red berries berry blast and pushed on top unscrew it and you'll see here their lids a bit different again and these ones are nice and easy the actual lid goes over the top of the bottle and you can just using a processors clean the top off like so don't take a rocket scientist to guess how you'd fill that one up so that's how you fill up a Nick shop if you found that useful please share on to a friend and if you like these kind of videos come tutorial videos do subscribe to us we do a weekly prize drug where we pick out a name a random on the subscription list I send them out for free babe but should be coming up in the bottom that way I think or maybe that way speaking juice TV what you get soon you", "VpMpblAm-Nc": "hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time the wonka gummies instead of the wonka uh chocolate bars we looked at not last week i think the week before um anyway lab tested i don't know about that lab tested for quality inconsistency confused with solvent free cannabis distillate [Music] so these are like a black market edible pretty much they have a bunch of different flavors i guess or types of gummies these are peach rings i think um there's some a nice nice government warning for you don't mind my dog complaining um but i like to like i didn't even notice this before but the rainbow finish on it i don't know what exactly that is but it looks fire 500 milligrams no children's california wow if we take a look on the back there's an actual nutrition fact section um no serving size or anything just really all that's in here it's just really just sugar and a tiny bit of saturated fat um not a significant source of vitamin d calcium iron or potassium i was not planning on it ingredients cannabis oil sugar glucose fructose syrup wheat flour malic acid dextrose palm oil citric acid artificial flavor antioxidants sorbic acid dufferin artificial colors um and usually these are um hopefully if you ever get these they will be sealed but even if they are sealed you can kind of tell they've been like tampered with like heat sealed you know what i mean so it's always a risk when you get something like this um it could be very very good but also uh could be very bunk but these ones i got pretty lucky because these ones are actually pretty gas for what they are i saved one of them so we can take a look at it let me take this bad boy out and there we are your basic candy ring and says these are infused but uh you can really really taste it on like the outside so i'm assuming these are sprayed and not infused but if you're looking for a really cheap edible that you're willing to take a chance on i i would recommend these uh it comes with a good amount of them and i i ate a few and i was feeling very nice so they do work depending where you get them but wonkagumi's uh a classic company made into something very frowned upon but oh well i hope you guys enjoyed the video i got a ton of videos like this on my channel if you want to check it out and uh yeah later", "KNU4y_izoC4": "alright I'm here in the protein bar section of Costco now I wasn't planning on doing a video but I walked on this protein bar aisle and I see that holy cow there is just wall-to-wall protein bars and a lot of them are just total garbage so to be completely honest I wanted to do a video to help shed some light on what you can choose to be the best option for you now truth be told you really shouldn't be relying on a protein bar to get your protein in it's more of just a stopgap let's go ahead and let's take a look at some of the ingredients and some of these things and really try to find a clear winner so that when you go into Costco you can at least find that at least top to protein bars that are worthy of taking home for at least a protein emergency so let's go ahead and let's dive right in but first please do hit that red subscribe button and then hit that little bell icon so you never miss our daily videos all right where to start for those of you that are out there that like cereal and still want to be able to have

floating around I just want to throw it out there that they are the bomb when it comes down to a low carb high protein cereal okay these guys absolutely no sugar they're utilizing like a whey protein blend to actually make a protein cereal and you're gonna get a really good deal on this stuff by using the link that's down below so I just want to give them a big shout out because it's totally relevant when I'm talking about breakfast they've got chocolate they've got like a fruity flavor they've got a blueberry flavor they've got a frosted flavor you have to check them out you've probably seen them on Joe Rogan's podcasts all these guys that are reputable within the health industry talk about them so just because it's bright colored and it looks fun doesn't mean that it's unhealthy it's definitely a good way to be able to swap out your breakfast so highly highly highly new legitimately recommend that you try these guys at least give them a shot so the links down below in the description you can check it out after you watch this video and thank you magic spoon for making this channel possible and for helping out so many people with their health okay this first I'm going to start with is a nature valley quote protein bar now nature valley is just kind of a regular candy bar type of granola bar but it looks like they slap the label protein on it to try to capture the attention of well people that are looking for a high protein satiating snack so let's go ahead and let's take a quick look at the ingredients on this onebut flip the camera around okay so here's what the label looks like and then let's go ahead and let's look at the nutrition facts like roasted peanuts that's not too bad to start but soy protein isolate as the second ingredient that is pure adulterated soy okay pure phytoestrogens which is not exactly something that we want when you look at overall thyroid affect when you look at the effect in the body in general soy is not a good ingredient especially that high up on the list chicory root extract not the end of the world but again this high up on the list that's going to be a prebiotic fiber that is going to give you a lot of intestinal discomfort that should not be that high up on the ingredient list so this one's a little bit sketchy already but then the big scary one is the vegetable oils down there okay so in terms of the fats that we're adding to the mix here we've got palm kernel oil which isn't terrible then we've got canola and peanut oil definitely not something I want to have in there the bulk of the protein here it's coming from soy protein isolate which is just not going to be good quality stuff and not worth the paper it's really written on it so this one of course we also probably have some sugar added to it yep oh we're some sugar we have fructose okay remember fructose goes straight to the liver and doesn't really get stored in the muscle let me explain something so here's what happens with fructose and fructose gets in your body okay because fructose can only get metabolized by the liver you can only process like 30 to 40 grams at a time which means the excess fructose goes through what's called de novo lipid Genesis and gets converted into fat very easily but it's also very easy for it to contribute to a fatty liver it's very easy for it to cause all kinds of other effects especially in the world of viruses fructose directly feeds a virus so we have to be really careful with that kind of stuff just in general we're worried about health so this one's a no-go let's move on to the next frankly a lot of these aren't even protein bars so I don't want to waste the time these are just granola bars or peanut bars fruit and nut bars these grain free bars are kind of cool but they're not a protein bar once again in the world of bars though they're not that bad I just know for a fact almonds pecans and maple syrup organic honey okay we still have fructose coming from honey and maple syrup so you have to be careful with that still fructose still gonna go through that same de novo epigenesis thing but at least it's clean ingredients not something I would really feed my family but worst case scenario it's probably one of the cleaner ones now this next one is one that I just stumbled across now I haven't tasted it or anything so I can't really attest to to that price it seems a very expensive it's called a ratio bar and $17.99 for 16 of them ethyl I mean not the end of the world it's still pretty cheap but compared to like the Nature Valley bars right but those are garbage so let's take a look at what's in this one I actually was pretty pleased with the ingredients I'll spin the camera around and then I'll flip it back and explain some stuff in a minute so label looks like this okay let's go in ingredients here we got almonds pumpkin seeds soy protein isolate which is definitely not something we want as far as the protein goes coconut oil erythritol whey protein isolate sugary root extract okay so you remember how we talked about chicory root extract this is further on down the list okay which I appreciate that means it has less of the actual binding fiber that's going to give it sort of the texture but it's further down the list meaning at least prioritize that I like this stevia extract that's gonna be really solid I like that it's a river towel that's better than sugar okay the problem is once again soy protein isolate alright we have a big problem there we don't want to use that now let me explain something with whey protein isolate which I was pleased to see when you're looking for a whey protein you want whey protein isolate not concentrate it means they've taken the protein and they've isolate X Q Z they've taken the way and I've isolated the protein out of it so that means you don't have any to lactose you don't have any of the milk solids you just have pure protein now with soy you end up with a lot of the you know soy isoflavones you end up with a lot of the phytoestrogens and everything like that it's a different story what's funny is they go through the effort of having a high quality whey protein isolate but they have a high or zooming a low quality soy protein isolates it doesn't make any sense they go through might as well just use whey protein concentrate and just use the cruddy stuff point is if it wasn't for the soy protein isolate in that ratio bar I absolutely wouldn't use that I think it's a really clean one and I think it's low sugar so it's not the end of the world it's better than some of the other ones but it definitely doesn't make the top two this is one that people love all the time it's not even a protein bar it's a protein cookie now they've done an amazing job of marketing but we have to be real here for just a second because it's not a bar and it's still thing of the day just a cookie fun fact as I was filming this someone comes up to me says oh my gosh I follow you this is awesome and she's holding one of these and she says is this good or should I put it down I said put it down I could already tell I'm Keeley so we're gonna explain some stuff in here but it's actually quite simple the Linnaean Larry's cookies are not good to go but let's take a look at the ingredients just for the heck of it bad price $13.99 I mean price wise here's what we're looking at label and okay first ingredient enriched wheat flour okay every time you have gluten or wheat you are triggering the release of a protein called Zhong Yulin within your body Zhong Yulin causes a cross reaction that triggers what's called a leaky gut thus leaky gut makes it so that what are called lipopolysaccharides which are basically things that coat your bacteria can leach into your bloodstream compromising your immune system and making you ultimately feel sick okay it doesn't matter if you have a gluten allergy or not even those that are not gluten intolerant will have an issue when it comes down to week 12 Lam Ettore since we have simply over consumed it now additionally what's in there chicory root fiber as the second ingredient okay bloat City once again we don't like to go to bloat City look at the protein blend the lowest quality protein blend I've seen sorry I'm talking quiet so I don't be rude we gluten as a protein pea protein which is okay but then rice protein not even using a way not even using anything they're trying to be able to call it I don't even know how they going for plant-based I don't know what they're going for here point is very low quality stuff and then invert sugar vegetable glycerin which isn't that bad cane sugar peanuts palm fruit oil this stuff is garbage pure garbage honestly I would barely even consider that remotely healthy junk food and I'm not trying to bag on them I feel like their mission was good in the beginning but marketing just caught on anyhow that's not worth again the cardboard that it's on next one was another popular one the rx bar good clean bar but not really a protein bar once again more so just a snack bar so let's take a look at what's inside this one again I actually like the company as a whole I like what they've done with almond butters I like what they've done with some of the nut butters they obviously got their start more so with the bars so let's take a look at what's in here's again what the box looks like okay so 1999 for 16 again not a bad price but let's see what some clean ingredients I do like that dates egg whites cashews almonds chocolate cocoa natural flavors sea salt we have to be careful of natural flavors I don't say avoid natural flavors I'm just saying use caution the thing with natural flavors is there's no real regulation on them there's a hundred and fifty different ultimately chemical compounds that can go into natural flavors known as what are called incidental additives so Organic natural flavors is what you want to aim for it or a company that you know and trust okay our X bar is pretty clean so I'm not too worried about them because I know they have a good reputation so that part doesn't bother me but the protein is coming from a little bit of egg white which is straight albumin which isn't the highest quality protein in my opinion simply because it can trigger an inflammatory reaction let me explain what that means so the dates that are in an Rx bar are still pure fructose okay it's got to be careful with that but then when I was talking about what's with the egg whites so albumin it's a complete protein it's a good protein but the problem is you have to remember that's essentially the placenta for the yolk right so it's full of different immunoglobulins different things that are there to support the immune system of well growing a chicken that can trigger an inflammatory response in humans in fact if you look at like the AIP autoimmune Paleo protocols where they actually remove inflammatory foods eggs are one the first thing they remove however it's not the yolks they're bad it's the white that can be bad can be bad you just have to introduce them to make sure you don't get flushed make sure you don't feel bloated personally I feel bloated my egg whites but I eat a ton of egg yolks anyone just fun fact okay this is the big one this is the one that people ask about all the time so I would be doing it to service if I didn't talk about it the good old Kirkland protein bars people talk about how they taste really good I had on for the first time about three or four months ago surprisingly good taste but let's break down the ingredients I'm actually pleasantly surprised with this and price-wise pretty darn solid check this out can you get 20 of them for 18 bucks so less than a dollar a pop different flavors but anyhow I talked about this in another video check out the ingredient in this surprisingly not bad okay protein blend milk protein isolate remember we want to isolate isolating the protein then we have a whey protein isolate once again isolating the protein from the whey dietary fiber from tapioca starch okay so not using chicory root tapioca is a little bit better you just don't overdo tapioca because what we're finding right now is that people are starting to become sensitive to tapioca because of the overconsumption of it in a much similar way to wheat we developed a gluten intolerances later on in our generations because we've been consuming so much wheat since the 1950s with the fortification and also trying to reduce fat and adding more wheat in we're seeing the same thing with tapioca just be careful there erythritol peanut flour could be inflammatory natural flavors again questionable cocoa powder cocoa powder butter excuse me cocoa process with alkali which just means it's gonna have a higher potassium content sea salt sunflower lecithin not a big deal somewhat of an omega-6 but again this is not something you're trying to eat as a health food unsweetened chocolate so they're not using sweet and chocolate with sugar in it which is great and then we have stevia and Coleco sides which is just straight up here stevia okay that is clean in the world of a protein bar not gonna lie okay now what scares me a little bit 23 grams of carbs 15 of which are from fiber four of which are from our mr. tall that fiber is gonna send you to well you know it bloat City hashtag below city and we'll say though in the world of protein bars it's pretty clean the only thing I would have wanted to really see changed in there is instead of milk protein isolate just left it with whey protein isolate but it probably would have made it less of a creamy taste and they don't really want that so I totally did it that's a good price and that would definitely make the list so I highly recommend that one in the world of Costco protein bars oh one more thing to add to that don't eat more than one or you will definitely be in below city I promise you that making this a little quick here next one Robert Irvine's fit crunch okay these are the bright yellow ones and you can't miss I know from seeing these in other stores they're not the cleanest Robert Irvine should definitely stick to being on the Food Network because he's got a great personality on TV but I'm not sure if he's a good formulator let's take a look at this well maybe I'll meet my words this is what it looks like 18 count still a little under a buck protein blend alright wait hey I will say at least he starts with whey protein isolate not milk protein isolate but then we got whey protein concentrate okay that already kind of notifies it and then ooh soy protein isolate dang it vegetable glycerin vegetable oils palm and palm kernel that's not the end of the world he could be using canola he's using palm and palm kernel oil so he doesn't have to use anything hydrogenated which is great but sugar then sorbitol which is a sugar alcohol gelatin bovine gelatin brown rice flour maltitol talked about below city that's again that's a sugar alcohol that does not digest so basically what it does it causes something called passive diffusion okay it draws water into the gut let me explain this it draws water into the colon and it ferments it essentially rots in your gut but it doesn't digest so they can call it something that doesn't affect your blood sugar I've seen enough that ingredient list was really long that ingredient list was really dirty that one definitely does not make the gun another one that comes up in question all the time is pure protein I'll save you a lot of time and headache and just flip the camera around and get right to it but I think they're starting to get the gist about the common ingredients and a lot of these just inexpensive protein bars are so when I'm in a little bit under a buck once again oh here we go milk protein isolate not the end of the world whey protein isolate nothing up then it goes to concentrate hydrolyzed collagen so they're getting a protein from a little bit of collagen but once again we've got that maltitol in there fractionated palm kernel oil sugar again milk unsweetened chocolate and oh my gosh okay so if you're gonna put sugar in it you already have sugar and soy lecithin but you're gonna put sucralose in it too that doesn't make any sense let's give you the worst of both worlds let's give you sugar but let's also kill your gut microbiome with sucralose that's a little sketchy not make the cut unfortunately obviously the Kirkland bars were designed to kind of take them out and I would definitely recommend that one so there's an interesting study that found that in human subjects if they had any kind of artificial sweetener it would make them glucose intolerance okay and then when they took their gut bacteria after becoming glucose intolerant and transferred it into mice the mice became glucose intolerant what that means is artificial sweeteners actually have an effect on our gut microbiome which has an effect on our sugar and glucose metabolism meaning if you eat a bunch of artificial sweeteners you change your gut microbiome and sucralose has been shown in other studies to literally kill off up to 50% of your gut bacteria that is scary scary stuff so when I get upset about the fact that our dicas sugar we've already done the damage with sugar okay why do we also have to do damage with sucrose it's like one or the other pick your poison sugars gonna cause a bunch of metabolic distress sucralose is gonna cause a bunch of digestive and gut biome distress why have both so that definitely that's probably one of the worst ones here to say I hate to say it okay we're down to almost the last one here this one is one called smart for life which is a relatively new one let's take a look at the price once again they're all about the same but this is a new one so I haven't really investigated it let's see that's what the label looks like collagen infused gluten-free okay that's a plus $15.99 for 18 of them whoa that's a lot of ingredients okay so let's take just one of them protein blend soy protein nuggets okay which contains soy protein tapioca starch and salt then milk protein not even milk protein isolate so you're gonna you're gonna use soy protein as the protein source might as well try to make it a vegan bar but nope then they go straight to milk protein but again not even go protein isolate just straight milk protein collagen coming from egg and kosher bovine okay that's a plus tapioca syrup soluble corn fiber okay SCF is dangerous stuff soluble corn fiber ferments in the gut a soluble corn fiber is derived from heavy duty GMO corn starch okay bad bad bad news then canola oil oh man so omega-6 bomb that's smoked listen milk chocolate coating which has a riff through tall malt so again here's what I don't know scent you're using a river tall which is a pretty clean sugar alcohol and then you also use multi salt but then you also use sugar and sustainable for me I don't understand it the world the processed foods is so sketchy like there's so much just nasty stuff that they throwing things just to increase shelf life and the reality is if they just went a little bit cleaner they could probably sell a little bit more to be honest if people start educating themselves which they are we can make better decisions on this stuff now there's only one more that I want to show you and then we'll have our two clear winners the go macro bar but this isn't even a protein bar to be completely honest okay it's kind of another let's see here's what I like about it its organic ingredients it is vegan it's clean organic brown rice syrup organic almond butter organic protein blend which is sprouted brown rice protein organic pea protein very clean organic puffed rice organic fair trade and chocolate chips actually a very clean bar to be completely honest when it comes down to it this one is one that I would recommend it's just not the highest protein okay so we have proteins here let's see only 11 grams of protein but 36 grams of carbs okay and again the sugar is gonna be coming from brown rice syrup which is not going to be the best solution here for us so technically yes it's a protein bar but since they're using the brown rice syrup that's a again it's a syrup sugar that's being directly derived from a brown rice which is going to make it a little bit better than say I don't know like a corn fiber or corn syrup or something like that and at least it's organic so at least it's not going to be as bad so that probably does make the cut at least for the best plant-based options the go macro bar for the best plant-based non keto bar but the cleanest ones otherwise are gonna be these two I'll be say the ratio bar even though it does have some soy in it not the end of the world okay so the ratio bar does make the cut but I haven't tasted it now I just say keto friendly which I don't really buy that and sugar alcohol yeah not really kind of two differently calls itself a protein bar was not a protein bar basically a knock off of a kind bar so technically not a protein bar also not a protein bar just so you know okay protein cookie disguised in disguise our X bar not really a protein bar but at least clean go macro bar gonna be the cleanest plant-based option not Quito we got the kind bar minis which again are not a protein bar then we've got Z bars not a protein bar Clif bars not a protein bar and in the cliff builders I don't even want to touch them to be honest I already know at least they are gluten-free and low glycemic that's a plus but they don't make the cut so we had those ratio bars and then we have the Kirkland bars okay these are going to be the two that you should choose when it comes down to it plain and simple obviously I could go into a lot more depth but I want to be respectful of everybody's done so I do want to encourage everyone to keep watching my channel but also if you're interested in a video that I did on protein powders at Costco I'll link out to it below and YouTube will probably recommend it but I highly recommend that one cuz I break down a lot more of the detail of what goes into a protein powder not in just a protein bar anyhow please don't forget to hit that subscribe button don't forget to turn on that Bell to never ever miss a daily

someone who usually don't eat sweets oh it's a sweet tooth that they and I don't actually know what that means probably I think I probably give like an ATM of 10 stars just because I thought it's not bad I'm not giving a bad review I'm just saying that I thought that this was gonna be like kind of fruity like a blueberry it's those Reptar into ice so I thought the Barbican be like cold or something that's what I thought peace stop that smart bad also said your tongue blue roses holy Sh my tongue I'm freakin teeth or blue all right so that I don't know Ricky what do you what do you what are your appeal yeah yeah your name I might give it a ten plus like I said okay just because just because you're giving it that I'm going to give it a nine out of nine point five out of ten I'm still thinking it would have been really cool if they would have did chocolate inside of like a fruit or a fruity blueberry kind of like icy blueberry thing mix him with chocolate that would have been really cool for me that's why this thing is not an automatic it definitely turned your tongue blue I give this one this one this one's a yes for me so go to your local FYE this is this video is not

show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review if I seem a little giddy er than normal that's because we are doing another edible review and not just any other edible review we are doing another the folks a review de Paul say chocolate tears my favorite edibles in existence these guys are amazing there are chocolate these uh well these guys in Kanaka are my two favorites here the chocolate I have tried their mint chocolate and their white chocolate and both were incredible tasted delicious and as potent as any edible I have ever put into my body this is only a 90 milligram edible but it hits three times as hard easily and if it tastes like any of the others it is the best tasting chocolate I've ever had as well so uh default say chocolatier there's no way to say it without sending like an [ __ ] unfortunately they are distinctively different as you can see here on the back let's read their stupid text here captivate your senses with the exquisite bliss of the false a hand crafted from the finest cacao and a premium collection of California cannabis our artisanal chocolates redefine the world of edible confections they kind of do actually to be honest I you guys know me you know my favorite way of eating edible this is actually chocolates I think chocolates is just plain chocolates is the best way to go for edibles and if I'll say is my favorite of those um it's better than Kiva it's better than bang it's better than 420 bars it's better than it's better than what else what other chocolate bars are out there whenever ones are out there this is the best of them all so far now we have to give it a review before we can definitively say that the dark chocolate is the best amongst them so let's go ahead and get straight into it here now this is very expensive if you can see uh right there at the bottom not sure if it's gonna focus or not this actually cost me $25 a my dispensary for a 90 milligram which is insane but that is the highest I've ever seen this this is the the tax that you pay at my dispensary ignore that price it is still very expensive for what you for as what it's advertised as but it is worth the price so let's go ahead and open up this default hey dark give it a taste here so if you haven't seen any of our previous reviews the heat chocolate comes in a very strange shape and he's like trapezoidal shapes they're each at five milligrams that's what it gives you a little diagram there here's our chocolate and it's very foil or very fancy foil wrapper here and here my friends here is the good stuff the default say dark and all its weird triangles and trapezoids and whatnot five milligram pieces let's break some off give it a taste well I didn't get that perfectly square but that's okay oh good let me leave you be very honest about this this is not a good edible this is amazing chocolate this is not really good for an edible chocolate this is damn good chocolate that I am more than happy to eat and as a by-product I get [ __ ] stoned as hell this is incredible stuff this is incredible stuff mmm it's so good I like dark chocolate I'm a dark chocolate fan so I'm a little biased but yeah this is the best chocolate i've bes edible chocolate I've ever had and one of the best tasting chocolates flatout period I that I've ever had mmm well guys Devante has done it again in the taste department but for the more important aspect is it gonna hit in the potency department for that guys you're gonna have to wait a couple minutes or a couple seconds rather me however I'm gonna wait two hours come back to you guys in two hours as I just said and let you know exactly how I'm feeling so thanks for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace pink look how red I am so high right now guys and that's after only 90 milligrams ah duffau say works their magic yet again my god I love these guys Ayanna bash idli love them they are three for three the dark chocolate was exquisite I am at an eight eight and a half somewhere in there I could not be happier with that with with this product with these guys this is next-level stuff this is I struggling to come up with terms to describe it but I I absolutely love it I could not love it more if you guys I mean there's just there's there's no other way to describe at this point other than simply it's worth tracking down not only is it worth grabbing if you see at your dispensary it's worth researching to try to find to give it a try it's that good so guys go to weed Maps as much as I hate telling you to look at weed maps go to weed maps search for de pon say find out your closest dispensary make the trip it's worth it give it a shot DePaul's say the dark chocolate my favorite yet no the mid chocolate still my favorite I don't care they're all great give them a shot thanks so much for watching weeds guys over the moon with this one thank you so much for watching and we will see you guys on the next

premium MKX gold distillates the flavor is blazing blue raspberry I've had regular blue raspberry other companies like this magnet it's been tested by CSI labs got the transfer past testing batch production batch license facilitated worthlessness ill-advised that product date and use by all that I'll have picks up a note let's try to open because they're a pain in the ass not just like these things really don't know so there's like the little lips sealed down in there you take your nail any kind of like work into it just kind of break it free after a second and then you can break in [Music] nice little thick pieces [Music] cheers fans definitely got blueberry although that's amazing flavor really amazing flavor there so if you got a have tried MKX and they're coming let me know which ones you've tried what you thought of them flavor is on point really can't taste too much of a chain see on the back end definitely a lot of flavor from glue right there definitely high quality made there nice clean taste good pretty much I want to say I was not allergy free but there's pretty much very slim chance you're gonna be allergic to anything that's in this there's no milk eggs fish felt shellfish tree nuts peanuts wheat soy were used during production of this product so pretty much almost hit just about everything but thank you [Music] about six or seven ingredients to actually make it [Music] we've got your little scan codes for your testing results scan it right at your phone results from right over your phone you can make sure everything's legit with this company which they are great company I had the watermelon the other day and they were off the hook so I was like how I gotta try these grab some of the blue radish play some blue raspberry may definitely pop off tonight nice and strong which was resin so I'm gonna jump out of here maybe do a update and a dab let you know how I feel usually these I take to relax my body wind down I guess put the end of the night they're more of like a pain and the relaxer but I'm jumping out much love respect BAM later [Music]", "bssGLDvoBT8": "[Music] in two weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary I've got my trusty spatula and my trusty thing in Nutella why do I have these you might be asking if you have not tuned into one of these before it means I am reviewing gummies and the reason I have this Nutella is so that I can have a little bit of fact before I eat these gummies I find that having a little bit of fat in your system before consuming gummies enhances the high of that gumming so let's just take a little lick of Nutella here the best part about any edible review because who doesn't love just some freaking Nutella all right that should be that should do it for my fats now what kind of gummy are we reviewing we are reviewing lol edibles candy I have actually had a couple people asked me to review this I reviewed one lol edible product in the past that I did not like very much the Elwha edibles flamin hot cheetos this here is a candy it is blueberries our belts Meghnath be gorilla glue glue hybrid so you can see on the back they've got a plea to add them on social media they've got a missing lot ID batch number and best before date not on there so we don't know if we're gonna be doing okay says do not mix with alcohol first time I've ever seen that I don't exactly know why you shouldn't mix the two other than you don't like getting crunked but uh who cares I am really hoping this lol edibles redeems not only lol edibles which he's a really dumb name I mean it's just a colossal II stupid name I'm hoping it not only redeems them but also gummies in general if you've never really seen weeks before I have never been a huge fan of gummies or candies I finally get you less high than the confectionery edibles but maybe this will be the one that turns it around we shall see alright so let's open this up here these blueberries sour ropes alright that is a strong weed odor very strong you will smell that from a distance away as I think so be careful opening this somewhere in a closed area where you don't want people smoking weed because that has a very strong weed odor as do these ropes themselves these look a lot like the Buddhist hours which I've had in the past and reviewed hmm there's a considerable weed taste to them not overwhelming the sourness definitely helps not as sour as the Buddhist hours but still pretty sour with a stronger weed flavor so hopefully that means they're more potent than the the Voodoo sours Oh sure if I mention this this is a 300 milligram animal should should be pretty potent but then again gummies your mileage right back again fairly strong we taste but the sourness really helps them overcoming with it all right guys so I'm gonna finish these here off-camera I'm not gonna bore you to death eating you all these things here in front of you and I will be back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because as always that is the most important part of any edible review all right guys please please please wish me luck let's hope these are better than our gummies in the past and ll WA edibles in the past and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know the results thank you so much for watching weights we'll see you soon peace guys I am happy to report that while not perfect and while not my first choice in any of the categories lol edibles the candy blue ropes blue berry ropes blue gummi ropes are are a nice little revelation they are not the most powerful 300 milligram edible I've ever had they're not the most tasty gummy I've ever had but I would say they are probably my new favorite gummy I am I do feel quite high not as high as I would be on a 300 mm gram confectionery edible like say akarova for example but that's a comparing you know something with like the best of the best I guess it's substantially better than their flamin hot cheeto knockoff that I had a while ago so you know it might be a combination of lowered expectations I was also a little tired going to this review so that might also be contributing to like my feelings of being high but overall I'm I'm I'm pleasantly surprised I know I used that phrase a lot but this was a welcome surprise I I had two strikes going against it one being lol edibles which I had a bad experience with and being a gummy which I've mostly found to be disappointing and I found it to be okay so that's you know that's good that's good I would not probably buy this again but if you are a fan of gummy edibles or if you really like sour gummies this is certainly better than the Voodoo candies I've had which are 375 milligram anibal's you might want to go and pick this up but for me it's it's a nice little surprise so thank you so much for watching weeks guys that's my dog walking in and we will check you out on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you

order in i've been waiting waiting waiting for this package i have never tried it before but it is a cbd oil vape it's legal and i want to try it all right so cbd is totally not like thc it's different it has no thc if any very very very little bit and it's supposed to be to relax you supposed to be for depression or if you have some type of pain or ailments or anything i don't really have any of those i'm just trying it just to try it if anything i just get like a little achy achy breaky here and there but a good exercise or stretch will actually help that out i'm just like i just wanted to try it and this is it i'm just trying it there's no reason truly for me to use it it's just for trying purposes and let me let me show you so basically what i got first i ordered it from a specific site that i'll put all the information down below because i don't remember i've been ordering stuff online like crazy hotcakes i've been ordering online i have packages stacked upon stack so i don't remember exactly it's like cbd pure i don't know i'm gonna put the link down below from where i got these but they came in separate packaging from their own specific company like i bought it from this site but it came from the regular from like like koi this is what i got some cbd gummies it's six in a bag for ten dollars each zero thc sour tropical fruit gummies all right i got this i got two of them so this was twenty dollars and then i had gotten this i thought this was super interesting this is kaya organics 200 milligrams cbd vape in like a berry flavor and this was buy one get one free they have a buy one get one free right now and this came out to 39.99 so it's 20 for each of these and 10 dollars for each of these and i'm going to give one to each of my brothers so this is a gift that i'm going to be giving out so i'm not going to try this i'm not going to use this this is what i bought though i'm giving these as gifts and you know what if i was thinking i have

subscriber and everything 1000 subscribers please help me get there that'll be cool so on that note i have also this is what i got for myself this is a cbd vape pen this is a higher milligram dosage this was more money this was much more money okay so this is the vape pen i believe it says and this is the bubble gum honey bubble gum flavor pure and clear so i got this because it doesn't have like all those types of i don't know explain it it says no pg or vg that's a type of ingredient they use that's supposed to be not good for you and i heard so i don't know i just got this this is organic hemp slim and lightweight adjustable heap settings preheat functions vape pen hemp oil concentrate cannabis derived tested pure blah blah blah mind body spirit fast acting really so this is 250 milligrams and this is 200 milligrams this is not bad for 20 200 milligrams for like 500 puffs or something i said i don't know but this is 250 milligrams what does it mean to experience pure spectrum enlightenment intuition creativity compassion vitality relationships and grounding this is like chakra status guys this is chakra the promoting chakra status so let's open the vape pen it slides out i'm so excited to try this uh it's stuck here we go oh it's just a charger with a sleek pen all right see it looks like this all right and then this is the charger that goes with it a usb charger if you had any of this before you just screw that in i guess do i have to charge it now is there any instructions oh here we go has a little bit of instructions they gave me silver i don't know if i chose silver specifically but on off settings push button five times change heat settings push button three times preheating set settings push button two times charging up to four hours or when light turns green okay so i don't know if it's charged yet doesn't say and this is my oil it looks like this they had this one that was called fruit fruity loops i was gonna try but i didn't know if this fit inside the thing i wanted to use but look it looks like this and the top is rounded and the oil is in there i don't know if you've seen that but um the oil's in there in the reservoir it's pretty cool all right let's stop this cheddar chatter and try it hopefully it's charged i really hope so i'm gonna go ahead and screw this in 0.5 ml that's how much okay okay i don't know how tight i'm supposed to why is it crooked is it crooked this is weird all right okay so what is it how do you do this charging press button two times i hope it's on oh on off one two three four five oh look it was red now one two it's preheating now it's preheating pictures of products are not to scale cartridge not included how come this tip is different from the other tips the other tips look like they're like more not not as rounded is it done now what do you do i don't know how to do this you have to hold the pen you have to hold the button i mean so bubble gum tastes like a weird light version of medicine let me try again it's like i don't know what it's supposed to do at the moment this is just interesting it's like i feel like it's something supposed to happen like right away it's light i taste a little tint of bubble gum but it's very subtle very subtle i don't see no nothing as of now but it's pretty cool i don't know let's try one more that's cool though maybe i'll feel an effect later i feel like i feel like i don't know if it's the placebo effect but i feel like a calmness settling or i could just be bugging out i don't know but this is cool i guess i'll do an update on another video to see my thoughts on it like some vlog type stuff so that's it that's all i have for you today i'm gonna do some more videos so check those out i'll see you next time bye you", "OAKdvn5p5Q8": "what's up and Anisha Peter Brown Pandey here here I showed you something try one of them today you know these Amrita healthy snacks and the one I wanted to really try is this one chocolate maca who doesn't love chocolate so you know I was pretty excited about getting these things because they're hoping theoretically plant-based nutrition this is four grams of protein 60 calories three grams of sugar each they have these little like cookies kind of in them gluten free dairy free soy free and high in fiber so they are like let's call them in energy food a health food and you can get them in these little packages right so that's what kind of makes some interesting you know because if you're going to your pantry looking for a little snack in the evening you know it's kind of easy to grab kind of a not so healthy one check it out at Emory to help boots calm but I wanted to open this one up three ounces and I think we just scare the top because you get this little Ziploc like bag so you can seal up what you don't eat haha there we go and inside we have these little bite-sized treats and you see if I can tell you how many we got in here uh eight I'm guessing kinda looks like that so here's one looks like a little tiny cookie smells like a granola raisin brownie so let's see what chocolate kind of soft about the texture of a Fig Newton I'm pretty good this one tastes like dark chocolate raisins and nuts I mean so how can you go wrong with that looks a little dry has a little bit of like a cocoa powder flavor or aftertaste to it maybe but pretty good it's kosher so you could pop a few of these and not necessarily feel guilty about it I think damn because that makes so many different types I'm sure you can find something that you know floats your boat so we'll draw some of the other ones but that's pretty good lean dry so you might need a little something to wash down with but still don't know what maca is but pretty good this dude is running so not sure if maybe this isn't a late-night snack and it's more about something you should carry in your backpack or a hydration pack so that when you're out it's like high energy but I just had one so I hope I don't need like melatonin to go to sleep tonight we'll find out anyway amrita health foods i'll put a link to in the description Peter Brown Band out", "DKyoJGC4krs": "what's going on ladies and gentlemen in YouTube I'm here to do an unboxing of cushy punch it's a cannabis infused gummy ok so at first glance you'll see that the dose is clearly stated what it's made from full-spectrum cannabis oil on the side you can see that they are allergen free and kosher so if you have a lot of dietary restrictions this might be the product for you also has ingredients organic cane sugar organic just kidding Oh probably is I don't know the whole thing is 10 doses altogether 100 milligrams and one milligram a CBD ok well let's see let's just open this bad boy up and see what we got alright oh this is upside down alright it looks like it comes in a blister pack and it is in fact 10 gummy pieces single dose is recommended as you can see this gummy does not come separated it's a little oily I'm actually getting a lot of oil on me and honestly I since I only paid ten dollars for this I am gonna eat the whole thing and get back to you guys in an hour Bon Appetit and let's get into it hey guys I'm back it's been an hour and I'm here to do a review of the cushy punch gummy this is the 100 milligram okay so yeah not even an hour in and it hit me man I am [ __ ] stoned definitely something that's worth $10 at bottom $20 edibles that I've split in half and like they haven't gotten me this high before a lot of $10 edibles themselves from other companies haven't gotten hi before another thing I didn't mention was the taste this actually doesn't taste too bad for being as small as it is usually the small candies taste like absolute [ __ ] this one was actually pretty good I will say I am actually very impressed because I smoke every day and this this has got me really faded you know there really isn't much else to say this product is pretty good I will be reviewing more in the future but if you want to check this out they're cushy punch calm I've got this in Southern California so yeah look forward to seeing you guys in the next one let me know in the comments why I sucked or you know just roast me for whatever let me know how I can do this [ __ ] better so I can do in the next video alright peace out guys", "fHlIHqkl21U": "[Music] welcome back two weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary our job is to help you guys determine which edibles at your dispensary when you see that big glass case there that refrigerator full of a bunch of different products full but then bunch of different expensive prices and you're not sure which ones are worth your money which ones are actually gonna get you high and which ones are a bunch of duds that's what we're here for and today we are going to look at a brand new product a product that says it's been around since 2008 and we are taking a look at hubby's edibles their milk chocolate bar in this sparkly iridescent packaging here it claims that it's three doses with a minimum of a hundred and thirty group milligrams of THC in there so pretty clean packaging this cost $12 at the dispensary but I believe I got it for a $2 discount so got it only for 10 bucks so you know about average for 130 milligram an\u00edbal and it came highly recommended from the bartender they said they sell a lot of these so let's take a look and see how it fits I do like on the back that the nutrition information says that the serving size is one full bar yet over here it says it's three doses hmm curious I'm gonna follow the nutrition information and not the doses information but as always you guys should consult with your bud tender and with whatever the dosage recommendation is if you are not a seasoned edible eater make sure that you do not overdo it and always stick with whatever the dosage suggestion is me I'm a pro and my job is to make sure you get the whole product and know that how it's all gonna taste and how it's all gonna feel so here we go a pretty plain looking chocolate bar there comes in a bunch of different little rivulets let's uh Milty and the sparkly package is sparkly on the inside as well let's give it a taste that's not bad that's not bad at all there's definitely a slight weed taste to it um especially when you first bite into it but the chocolate is rich its creamy it sort of overpowers that weed taste we can give another bite here but that first bite was certainly far from bad even verging on on okay passes the taste test again not wonderful but for an edible pretty good however guys however gonna taste does not really matter in the grand scheme of things the most important part when it comes to the a DeBoer of you is its how is its gonna make me feel and for that you're gonna have to wait two hours or you're not gonna have to wait two hours you're just gonna have to wait a couple seconds I'll have to wait two hours and I'll come back to you guys and let you know how I'm feeling thank you so much for watching and see you in just a bit [Music] hi guys welcome back two weeks it's been Oh two hours here since I had the puppies edibles 130 milligrams no chocolate bar and it's right about in that sweet spot right about what I hope for it to be not too high you know not outrageously high but definitely noticeably high maybe about a six on the high scale and it feels like it's just about peach or peak maybe a couple of minutes ago so I'm pretty pleased with the experience so far again it was affordable at twelve dollars but I got a discount for ten so in that regard it's great as well right about in the price you would want it to be I definitely think I'll be picking up some more hobbies in the future to give them some reviews just because this first one seemed to be right about what I would hope for it to be again not out not incredible about about a six after about two hours so right in the ballpark of where you would hope it would be and that's going to do it for this review here on weeds guys we will see you on the next one peace", "xoDYHfKn23g": "welcome to wheat skies the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and if you're a long time then you know that I often talk about going to the moon products taking me to the moon going to the moon and back being over the moon moon moon moon moon moon moon moon well today guys we are actually going to be visiting the Moon Moon cosmic cappuccino that is 250 milligrams of THC we've got it right here the first time we are reviewing anything from this brand the Moon whoops again the Moon brand the cosmic cappuccino I'm not even really sure what this is to be honest I'm not even really sure what this thing is maybe it's some kind of cappuccino flavored wafer I I don't know I don't know it's gonna be a mystery for us all we're all gonna find out at the same time and I hope that like the product says it does take me to the moon and back it's Moon megadose chocolate bars is the name of the company and it's been cosmic cappuccino and on the back it says intergalactic milligram \u00e4j-- that's fun so uh if you've never tuned in to wait weeks before the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this product and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review all right guys I can grab some scissors real quick I'll be right back we'll open it up and give it a taste all right here we go trying to get it out all right here we go here is our wafer or what I assume is a wafer there is a strong weed odor to it let's give it a bite not a wafer just a long skinny chocolate bar with a cup of key no flavor on my cappuccino I mean cappuccino thank you Arrested Development it's good good quality chocolate liked it quite a bit perfect melting point it had a strong cannabis scent but well there is a cannabis taste to it it's really not that strong it's not that bad at all quite like it in fact well guys I'm gonna finish off this cosmic cappuccino looking forward to it and then I will come back to you guys in just two hours selecting a homegoing but for you guys will just be a couple seconds see you then peace [Music] welcome back guys it's been two hours since I had the moon mega dose chocolate bars with their intergalactic milligram \u00e4j-- and I gotta say unfortunately I am not at the moon I am more like at the you know sort of the International Space Station somewhere in the stratosphere definitely not on the moon certainly not on the moon and back it's not terrible I don't want to suggest it's terrible I'm at probably a for me maybe a 5 somewhere between a 4 and a 5 you know like that kind of level of high this was a $15.00 edible so you know you can't complain too much for that price that's a little worse than average but not substantially so I did like how it tasted tasted great there was just like cannabis taste but the rest of the chocolate was nice and smooth and creamy and had a great cappuccino flavor but I'm just not as high as I was hoping to be with the moon megadose chocolate bars here I was I was certainly hoping to be you know somewhere in outer space but yet I am still terrestrial what can you do alright guys thank you so much for watching wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on the later view peace", "dET2NXhLt1g": "[Music] howdy friends welcome the week's the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we really help you determine which products there and your dispensaries vast library of edibles is actually worth your money which ones are a bunch of [ __ ] and which ones are actually gonna get you high so today we're taking all our second look at a product from Miss Mary Jane's edibles we're gonna review our second cakepop from them if you missed my first review I quite liked it it got me pretty high not outrageously height but it tasted amazing so I really quite enjoyed it so yeah we for the first time reviewed the cookies and cream today we are taking a look at Miss Mary Jane's chocolate turtle cake pop so you can see right here 100 milligrams as rated by the fine folks at SC labs which I can always love to see on my packaging anytime I see that lab verification I feel a little bit more encouraged that it's going to be as potent as advertised um I love the packaging on this the nice little box here packaging nice it's got all the great information right it's got nutrition information ingredients everything you could want on the packaging and as for price ten bucks there at the bottom but I bought these two for 15 which is a pretty good value for a hundred milligram edible especially for one that tastes so goddamn good so I'm gonna shut up now I'm gonna open up this cake pop I give it a taste let you guys know how it tastes how it smells all that fun stuff and then like all our weeks reviews I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the Edward with you alright so just like the other one packaging a little bag in there can be a little tough to open but we'll get it maybe uh-huh uh-oh party foul my cake pop is no longer a cake pop it is now just a little candy ball so there it is sans pop sans stick but a little ball of cake with some peanuts at top or not peanuts what kind of walnuts right that's what's on turtle let's give it a taste very cool very [ __ ] well well that's good there's just as good as the just as good as the cookies and cream cake pop really like the taste really like oh man delicious no cannabis taste whatsoever so in terms of taste we got two for two here for the cake pops now we just have to wait two hours to see if it's gonna get me just as high so guys that's gonna do it for this first half of this week's review I'll see you in two hours peace in two hours since I had the chocolate turtle cake pop from Miss Mary Jane's edibles and just like the cookies and cream cake pop I like it quite a bit this is two for two both in terms of taste and and potency again it's not an overwhelmingly potent edible it's a hundred milligrams and sort of right at that hundred milligram line for sure so if you like them a little bit lower dose store if you're looking for something a little bit more mellow this is a great thing to try again it tastes so good I can't emphasize enough how I mean there's just I I detected no cannabis taste on either one I mean again how sort of pleasantly buzzed they got me these are a good value especially if you can find out at the two for fifteen price that's a pretty good value I think it don't think you're gonna be disappointed with that with that price and the taste and results from them so I was pretty pleased with my little detour and to Miss Mary Jane Miss Mary Jane's edibles I hope Miss Mary Jane's sticks around after the an apocalypse here and comes back with some good products in the future because these these are winners I think and guys that is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a later review peace okay", "CpV7wPw6edU": "it's going on human so sapped out of my spaceship

from becky bay on facebook and y'all let me tell y'all i hit them up on messenger facebook and they came through they reply back so quick and they delivered for three dollar extra fee they delivered it to my door they just texted and said delivered on the mat and i looked outside and it was there y'all fast delivery like they literally took 15 minutes like for them so make sure i go shop with them and yeah like julia i'm basically going to tell y'all how it tastes and if it actually do work for me this video is not sponsored by them but you feel me so yeah if i can get into this video make sure y'all like comment subscribe go ahead and tell a friend tell a friend turn that bell post notification on because who wouldn't want to be notified when we catch mother's videos and that's all who your mama and that's all so yeah i don't know which one is what one of them is the chocolate fudge which i think is this one and the other one is a reesey cup or something like that you already see the other one is arisa i don't know which one is what so look like i don't have the things both of them i think this one is the chocolate fudge i want a chocolate fudge one um i did i have i did i have i've eaten a brownie before but it's been a minute since i ate one probably since last april of last year sometime when i did eat an edible before so it's been a minute so i don't know how this is going you know take off my body but yeah always smell just like we oh smell this oh they pet a bit this one just like yeah i think this one yours i think this one is here so i'm gonna put this to the side but not telling that saying he probably not gonna eat this i'm gonna be eating and yeah but while we're in this video i'm gonna be chit chatting with y'all girl talk we're gonna be talking about the first time that i ever smoked ever ever ever ever ever it's gonna be like a story time chit chat type talk and i posted on my social media told y'all to ask me some questions so i did get a few questions that was in so probably gonna start in with that while i'm eating it and then when i'm probably done eating it i'm gonna go into my story time to tell y'all to like you know boost a little video or whatever like that so first question first let me see oh i just posted a picture on instagram so if y'all don't follow me on instagram at all like i'm gonna go do that right now everything's gonna be in the description below and like period i told you i asked it to participate with me and ask questions but half y'all [ __ ] be acting like y'all want to participate with your girl but it's okay though keep that same up so i told y'all to ask me some questions let me go to them okay so somebody said all these are kind of like similar tied to each other so i'm just gonna go down the list that i got i told y'all on the post that it would be very annoying i'm not anonymously there you go it will be very anonymously so nobody would know who asked me these questions but my first question was have you ever thought about starting the only fans i just put a bit with my mouth like this is just not just weed like this is not just about to sneak up on me tasty uh i'm trying to eat the whole thing because i don't really do chocolate like that first question was have you ever thought about starting the only face i have had an only fan before yes um i started my only fans probably like around my birthday yeah like around my birthday i started i was doing it ever since up until maybe november i was only doing it for two months you feel me it just went me no more i just couldn't do it no more i was making a little bit of money like probably like 700 to 800 not consistently but like and i was kind of slacking but the most i made it was probably like 700 800 door only fans but then it wasn't me no more you feel me your girl kind of slowed down backed away from it i do still have my account because people do still be like renewing their subscriptions on there even though i haven't posted in about three months people still do renew their subscription when they know they restrict prescription subscriptions damn when they renew their subscriptions i still get paid for it so money's still going into that account so i i'm not going to activate it i'm just not going to post anything on there you feel me so yeah next question is it's real good i like she had lemonade i think i'm gonna try lemonade next in my next video because i do want to do these videos like not consistently but i do want to do more in the video but next video is what's the meaning behind the name cash um i didn't come up with the name i was in texas for about three years and a group of friends that i was hanging around with they just started calling me cash i don't know where they got the name from i don't know where they just started calling me cash who got a [ __ ] thick so yeah and they just started calling me cash and i actually liked the name because you know you told me like i felt like if it it went with me um i was just very much feeling it and um yeah so every time next year they were just like cash guess what [ __ ] or cashes cash at some of my friends actually now pastor texas gave me that name shout out to y'all and that's so period next question is what made you want to start scripting um i like to dance i really don't consider myself a scripter i said i consider myself an exotic dancer i don't want to be scripted but i don't really consider myself a scripture yeah with the scriptures the script clothes and stuff but no no i consider myself an exotic dancer we gonna leave it at that because i've been dancing a minute but still your girl just went out there and start dancing but i love to dance i love to be naked if y'all can't tell i just feel like i have a nice body i just love to shut my body off like it's just like just me i don't know why and then on top of that it's like i'm making money like very much making money while doing it so it was very much a plus for me um i said in my previous videos i did not plan on doing like dancing for the longest time it's just for like a build up to get me back you know up there up there you feel me just like about subtype level so i don't plan on dancing for too long oh this [ __ ] think it's [ __ ] you ain't yours huh but i don't plan on destined for too long so um but really what made me start scripting was just seeing other people that influenced me on youtube watching scripted vlogs it's like damn like they're making a lot of money so i decided to try it just to say eventually like yeah i used the shrimp y'all did it just to see how it was so that was that next question was or is were you shy when you first started stripping yeah but no i weren't really shy because i knew what to expect because i like i said i was watching scripted vlogs like people telling scripture stories they're weird scripted stories the most crazy scripted stories like i was watching artists so it's like i was kind of prepared on what to expect but at the same time i was mostly nervous i'm like damn do i gotta get naked like what if i have to get negative from all these people like that was mostly like my big thing i'm okay with wearing just like you know boot cover-ups or like little crop top shirts or some those i'm okay with doing that but in a club completely naked yeah girl i think your girl can do that like at all and i had a club no maybe a house party because i feel i don't know why i feel more safer at a house party than another club maybe at a house party but don't get me wrong i haven't did it before only a house party i never did it when i was that club um i wasn't really shy i was more nervous you know when you get that that butterfly stomach that butter how you say it that butterfly filling in your stomach and you know and it's like after once you start dancing or getting up there on stage or getting her down to pose just like all this [ __ ] go away it's just like okay take a few shots you go smoke and do whatever you got to do to get your mother going so i went shy i felt like i was kind of used to the butterfly filling because it's just around the same thing with cheering i used to do outside cheerleading so it was like i had to perform in front get on stage and perform in front of like thousands of [ __ ] people and i always got that but if i'm feeling my stomach like oh my gosh i'm gonna mess up what if i don't do this right or what if i don't know how to do this but then once i start dancing it's just like oh i'm good i got this let me collect my coins so yeah wasn't shy maybe nervous okay next question was what's the meaning behind the name brett head damn a [ __ ] can't talk the meeting the meaning behind bread was it ties to my name cash so after my friends gave me that name oh [ __ ] after my friends gave me that name i was one i was one day i don't know what the [ __ ] going on i don't know what the [ __ ] going on but one day but one day i was in like my house thinking like damn like i want to come up with a clothing line like but it got to be something hard like when i do something i feel like everything i do got to tie into my life like anything i do it got to tie into my life like i don't want to be living something that i'm not living or whatever like i feel like everything has to tie into me where god that's my personal life or what i do on the daily or whatever like that so i was just like damn like i want to come up with a club line but it has to be something dealing with money it has to be something to do with money because my name was already cast they gave me that name so i'm like it gotta be something like up there with that name so i was just thinking think of thinking thinking and i finally came up with bread head and i'm just like okay like i'm [ __ ] with dad like and i told my mom about it i put her on i told my sister put it on and it was actually like [ __ ] with it so i'm like okay like i think that's gonna be the one i'm gonna do the name that i'm gonna stick with but too bad i can't stick with that so now i watch that video that i posted on why i can't see where that makes y'all go watch that period it is tell y'all why i can't see that i'm gonna put the names but yeah that was the name behind pretty head y'all this [ __ ] is thick and too much chocolate it might but yeah another question was what the [ __ ] um oh he's giving me the question was how did you start feeling comfortable with taking like new photo shoots um my very first new photo shoot was 2017 no 2018 i like a purple hair purple hair i'm gonna upload a picture actually i might not be able to upload a picture but if i can because you know it's very nude but i probably upload on the side to show y'all but i have purple hair and it was a shower theme i did a new photo shoot um i always wanted to do one of those and 2018 was the year that i actually finally did a new photo shoot and it was very much i don't know i went uncomfortable i didn't feel like i wasn't in a safe area because i was at a hotel when i did my very first one i don't know i just i don't even i don't know i just i don't know when i want to do something like this go for it i just like you know take off them and be like like i mean i'll be kind of nervous like i always sometimes i always have someone there with me when if i do nude photo shoots but so happened the very first time i did a nude photo shoot i had no one there with me um besides the makeup artist the makeup artist was there doing my makeup and then eventually she ended up leaving stop moving over but eventually she ended up leaving so ah no one really taken get the [ __ ] away bye y'all see i gotta do this bootleg ass um like because you're gonna be like bro so yeah first time i did my photo shoot it was a dude taking my picture but i didn't feel uncomfortable being nude it was just like i'm doing you get your money do what you're supposed to do and go from there so yeah i always keep my taste on me though just in case a [ __ ] asked because you know i'll be ready to take a [ __ ] i keep the [ __ ] in my car but i started ringing another question this is kind of like a outdoor one if your body count was a price what would you be able to buy um um if my body count was a price i would be able to buy maybe some damn y'all really trying to get in my business without getting my business let me see how much pillows cost how much pillows come i don't know hmm we're gonna say i don't [ __ ] know what about sixteen dollars [Music] boy get the [ __ ] i'll probably be able to buy some candles candles at one more i'll be back five i cracked myself up maybe like five six dollars maybe somewhere right now but yeah okay another one oh oh i can't eat too much chocolate what's some things that you want to do that you haven't done before um travel i never really actually traveled travel like as vacation wise if i did travel before it was probably like a while ago cheerleading or when i was in the military and stuff like that so i actually didn't like go on vacation before as i went to las vegas one time in california but i wouldn't really consider those as trips trips to actually enjoy because yeah a [ __ ] got in the fight going to california well leave me out for him so i really want to consider that a trip and the people that i went with was never to like get him and then las vegas i went to las vegas um before it was it was very much sweet so i would consider that's probably like the only place i actually traveled so i want to travel um that i haven't done before i want to jump on a plane i'm going to do that one day i want to play with it um what else that's all i can pick up right now oh yeah excuse me what's um what's some beginner tips for scripters um confidence you gotta have confidence you gotta have so much confidence you gotta be in love with yourself in love with your body every [ __ ] day no matter your size your race nothing you gotta be confident in everything that you must do and don't let [ __ ] tell you what you can't do and cannot do and that's not who you finish it period so don't let nobody tell you what you can and cannot do because they feel like scripting is downgrading your life or dismissing this but yeah you gotta have confidence um don't let anybody tell you what you can and cannot do y'all just how much time so really as right now we just plan to wait in game while i finish answering these questions i'm gonna answer probably about three more and then i'm gonna come back with y'all come back to y'all once i feel like it's kicking in and i'm gonna come into telling the story time my very first time smoking smoking so y'all confidence never tell nobody never let anybody tell you what you can and cannot do um you know just always just be yourself don't try too hard don't do too much just be yourself uh what's another thing where you're getting tips for school don't put on no glitter y'all no [ __ ] glitter oh and if you put no oil put on oil before you go to the [ __ ] strip club because if you plan on getting on the pole yes i'll be slipping the slide um that's really it but it's really it was funny so yeah that's really it so i'm gonna ask a few more questions that y'all asked my questions was have you ever ever ever ever six news yes i all right my camera is about to click outside to restart that [ __ ] so that question was have you ever seen nudes yes i have yes yes yes yes yes i have um i feel like this is like a because i feel like y'all should know this have i ever dated a female before yes i have yes i have to have female before very much have dated [ __ ] female befo in that song that's fine i have been your female before okay um we're gonna do two more we'll pick a juicy one because at this point oh yeah we don't need another this way that'll be the last question we made i found him in a dumpster i found him in the dumpster i was walking by in my hometown y'all like walking y'all april and april i ain't gonna consider him a sneaky link because i went sneaky she lied to you i ain't gonna say it was a big leap because i wasn't sneaking got him on here he was speaking but i was doing what i wanted but i was just saying if you i feel like i wasn't doing this i felt like i was doing what i wanted to do but if you got caught about probably about two months yeah to april to june we were sneaking later for about two months um at my sister house my god brother actually put me on or put us on with each other and ever since then because like you could it was a vile though anyway we couldn't stop [ __ ] with each other like i probably cut him off i probably cut him off for like maybe two to three weeks stop talking to him trying to get him off my mind go do whatever [ __ ] i do and then next thing you know i'm back to his ass and the crazy thing is this is how i learned how to be quiet because i always just tell my sister like i'm done [ __ ] that like he ain't doing this business with my daughter back with his ass and another time i stopped talking to him we stopped talking for like a month or two and then went back to my sister's just talking [ __ ] i'm so tired of my ass this [ __ ] and they just like you didn't you know i like the sister do you feel me like i always have your bet but i learned to be the [ __ ] quiet because i knew i was gonna go back to his ass i just had to let him know that i'm not that [ __ ] to play with and that's his mama yo mama and everybody else so i just need it so yeah that's it for all these questions do you feel me i might let this kick in for a little bit because i know tell her how long it's gonna take yeah don't kick it within like next 15 to 30 minutes i'm gonna eat max because he's not gonna eat it i just know it's not this is all i have left in these little crumbs i'm gonna finish this up and i'll come back to y'all thank y'all for the ones who did participate in the questions i come back on this [ __ ] let me eat this too i got the munchies right after the first video the first half of the video and they gave me some chips y'all y'all want to do a smoke session with me in my car and we just chit chat y'all need to talk about i was definitely gonna do that for my bread babies here we are so ain't no long story just to serve my very first time i'm smoking get high y'all so i'm at school and i think i was going there yeah i think yeah i was in 11th grade oh hello 11 grand at the school one day it was me this dude i was talking to his friend one of my sisters no two of my sisters who was them and y'all this was my first time smoking i think my one of my sister's first time smoking but my other sister that's older than all of us it wasn't her first time smoking and the other ones that was with us not smoking so many watsons decided to try one day to see how the [ __ ] we gonna feel like what the [ __ ] the hype about likes so y'all don't judge me we went behind a [ __ ] church y'all we were behind my [ __ ] church and smoked on the back of one of our friends a truck he ended up down his truck done and we ended up smoking on the back of that but behind the church like and then near to near the school i dumbasses so we do that and like i'm just i don't know if i at the time i didn't know if i was inhaling it right i didn't know how to inhale out i ain't no [ __ ] y'all i was just doing something honestly but someway somehow their [ __ ] got down my throat and i started feeling like i got to sit down i thought i feel like i just gotta sit down so after that i'm just like you know how like i don't know now that i know that how what i feel like is like it was one of those feels like damn like i'm really hot like i feel like i'm floating and that's when i realized like okay like i don't know if i'm feeling like this like i felt like i was moving slow y'all like in slow motion everything so after we smoked the first well we only smoked one blood so after we did that we hop back in the car how we gonna check whatever like that and then we was about to get ready to drop each everybody off home so it was my turn to get dropped out first after we left there because my house was the closest or whatever like that so my job this was the week before prom yeah a week before prom so this had to be in 12th grade [Music] i don't know i love what's wrong well but it was probably the week before prom and i didn't get my prom dress from like a store nut and my mama ended up ordering it online and i be [ __ ] damn the day that she that it decided to come in was they that i smoked like i just got through smoking y'all so i'm at the point on high i'm headed to the house we're in the bed seat my friends is just like in the car driving i feel like they're dropping reckless i feel like they're just doing a whole bunch of extra [ __ ] y'all like when my sister laughing one of us is laughing then i'm over there panicking it was just too much for me so i finally made it to the house and i'm like okay the everybody tells me just becomes be cool when i go in the house i'm like all right that's who i'm going there y'all don't know my little brother he won't be a police officer so bad so mind you like going in the house and my mama didn't well this this is my first time smoking weed so of course my mom and i are gonna thank god i'm coming in the house high because i don't usually come in the house high like you feel so she called me i'll try hair up and go upstairs go to go in the dog go upstairs and just lay down like i want this [ __ ] to wear off of me i'm that's it like i don't like this feeling on me it got come off so i go in there lay down i lay down for a few seconds and i hear somebody just like calling my name and i don't know i don't know if i would like dreaming or something but it still happens with my mama called my name so she like yeah kiana come down here your dress came in come try your dress you know i had all thinking like oh [ __ ] i'm about to find out hi my mom about to find out i am high so i was just like all right whatever so i go downstairs try to act normal try to act normal it wasn't working i felt like i was a little bit in slow motion y'all like slow [ __ ] motion so she finally get me to go try my dress you know i go change and so she asked me kiana why [ __ ] you moving so slow and i'm like what are you talking about ain't nobody moving slow she was like why the [ __ ] you're moving slow like you acting weird so she couldn't really figure out what how i well why i was acting like that but i kind of think she kind of knew but didn't take time i don't know but my brother i really kind of knew i was high because he come up to me do his hair like this in front of me and do like that that's how i'm like this dude tell on me i'm just like got my very first time smoking so my dad he didn't really think that i was smoking at the time but then he kind of got an idea that i started smoking and so after that very first time that i smoked i didn't really like how it made me feel i guess because i was kind of paranoid at the time i don't know but i think graduation was two weeks after that or something like that and i ended up smoking again but i didn't feel that type of way maybe because i don't know but i didn't feel that type of way like i was very much more relaxed and just vibing type stuff so ever since then hey girl been smoking i've been trying to quit sometimes though but you know sometimes it just makes you feel so good [ __ ] about nothing yeah this one is so good that's the reese one might have as good as [ __ ] oh i shoulda did a thumbnail i couldn't do one now [Music] i can't do one time oh wait hold on like sitting yeah i'll be trying to edit all these damn thumbnails let's see i just rather just everything always falling on movies like she just i'm so shocked i'm sorry baby anyway but that was my very first time smoking that was my story time hold on that was my story time on my very very very very very first time smoking i had to try my prom dress the day that i decided to smoke thinking i was gonna be slick and grown just go upstairs you know do what it do and then she heart was racing so fast it was just like i remember that [ __ ] like it was yesterday because i just knew like the feeling every time i get happy like damn that's how i was feeling last night when i was but yeah but that's it for this video if y'all like this video want

Colorado has become the Wild West for weed don't tell the people who live there I personally don't feel less safe there are so laws like you can't do it in the parks and so just like you can't drink outside six years since Colorado became the first state to legalize recreational marijuana we traveled there to find out what's changed you've got coffee beans gummies chocolate bars suckers mints lotions yes most of the people we talked to said not much it's very well controlled I think most people will be surprised at who goes in and purchases recreational marijuana a lot of people in my generation actually maybe the best news of all say marijuana proponents there are fewer people going to jail or prison for low-level drug crimes the number of marijuana related arrests have plummeted since legalization instead of putting people in jail we're saying look go go home you use this as you will we'll leave you alone you're not creating problems and while there are a few of people being locked up there seemed to be more living on Colorado's streets Liz Gilardi has been covering marijuana legalization for our station in Denver we do have a rising homeless population there is that statistics that's been thrown out there about that it's tied to marijuana at the st. Francis Center in Denver Tom Lewis and his team helped more than 700 homeless men women and children every day are some of those people who came to town just because they needed marijuana we think so a recent survey of seven city and county jails in Colorado showed that a third of homeless inmates reported coming to Colorado at least in part for legal marijuana and then there are the health risks much of the pot being produced in Colorado is more potent than marijuana from only a few years ago THC marijuana psychoactive component may have averaged four percent in the 90s today some products contain as much as ninety percent eighty four percent of the marijuana in Colorado has been consumed by 20% of the consumers those are problems users been court libs in Boulder Colorado and used to abuse alcohol and marijuana since the 1990s he's been sober and says big businesses made marijuana more than ever this stuff is so new that we don't really know how it's affecting people's brains and bodies and that's scary just this month a study in the American Journal of Psychiatry found that marijuana use is more damaging to teens brains than alcohol with significant negative effects on problem-solving short and long-term memory the brain really doesn't start maturing until like early 20s and to mid twenties and so when we expose it to any kind of substances there always can be changes so with all that being said six years later would voters approve legalization again most polling says absolutely everyone that comes to Denver thinks we're going to have all these horrible things with people smoking pot and doing crime up and down the 16th Street Mall and as you see that is not the case at all", "AZynhX-qcc4": "it's been a nice two hours of high getting a little bit progressively stronger i'm back you guys i hope you missed me i'm finally moved into the new home i'm so excited to be here expect to see videos from me regularly again now that i've moved in i have no excuse if you're not already subscribed make sure you subscribe right now so you can see all my new videos in your sub box but today isn't going to be my typical smoking video i'm going to do something a little different i have 500 milligrams of rso capsules in here there are 10 capsules and they're 50 milligrams each actually looking at this many pills is pretty intimidating i'm not gonna lie i'm pretty much just going to film the aftermath of this so i hope you guys enjoy that this is a little bit of a different video for me but i think this is going to be a lot of fun got a nice tough glass of water to wash these down here's number one here's number two here's number three number four this is the point in our return at this point i'm getting [ __ ] lit number five all right halfway there number six i'm so scared my body like didn't want to swallow that one it was like dude don't do it i'm gonna start a timer right now before i forget so we can tell how long it takes for this to actually kick in i've never actually consumed rso before so i have no idea and i'm stone sober right now so it's gonna hit me like a brick wall all right number seven number eight number nine and last but not least number ten the point of no return wish me luck you guys this is gonna be a long day well it has been an entire minute and i'm not high at all yet i can confirm that honestly i'm a little nervous i've read online that rso can take up to 15 hours to kick in i don't think it's gonna take me that long but that's some of my brief googling told me and before this kicks in i'll explain to you what rso is for those of you who don't know it stands for rick simpson oil it's a cannabis extract but it's not meant to be dabbed like most cannabis extracts let me reiterate please do not dab this it tastes like [ __ ] it is not a fun experience it's much better to be consumed orally like through a pill or through some food it really doesn't have a nice consistency to it or taste so honestly the pill form that i just did is the best way to consume it so you don't have any of that weird flavor rso offers a lot of medical benefits when you're doing what i'm doing not really but it actually does especially for people who can't smoke but as i said this was a super [ __ ] high dose so i'm really curious about what's gonna happen to me i'm really not a huge edible guy like i said even when i've done 150 and 250 milligrams i really just don't enjoy the high i get so i'm really curious what this 500 milligram high is going to be like all right guys we just passed the 45 minute mark and i'm still not high i feel like this is gonna take as long as an edible to kick in so within the next 45 minutes i'm expecting to feel pretty rocked i was just going through my snapchats and somebody messaged me though and said that it took four hours for theirs to kick in so i'm really hoping i don't have to sit here for four hours waiting for this to kick in straight up it has been over an hour and a half and i'm really not that high like i might feel a little something but i honestly think it's all in my own head ultimately i don't think i'm high yet i hope this isn't a fail because i'm gonna be really pissed if this bottle just does nothing to me there's the stats for you as you can see 500 milligrams pack of 10 thc terpenes all that all right let's kick it oh my god i feel like edibles here you're talking [ __ ] bro it's starting to kick in i can like start to feel it in my chest and in my head a little bit it hasn't hit me like a brick yet i just thought this is gonna hit me way harder it's definitely a gradual high i'm actually feeling now it straight up took two hours and 13 minutes for me to feel anything but i'm feeling pretty hopeful right now finally my eyes are getting pretty heavy my whole body's getting that like slow feeling that you get on edibles so i have a feeling it's about to kick in all right well i'm bored i'm gonna go play with my dog or something paper paper high piper you're a dog dog oh my god you're a dog oh my god come here i'm so high oh my god oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] i'm piper sit high five oh i'm too high yeah shake my hand good job piper you guys want to see something kind of funny my dog is an overbite i honestly feel like i'm just melting at this point like oh my god these edibles kicked in pretty strong my entire body just feels heavy i'm gonna try to catch a quick dub on fall guys let's see how this goes bruh i've never felt like i've been running this low in this game i think like time's been slower for me no bruh bruh right i got this i can do this i can do this i can do this oh yes i'm going to qualify let's [ __ ] go bro i'm in like the top three right now [ __ ] okay that [ __ ] me [ __ ] let's do it let's do it let's do it yeah [ __ ] i was gonna be the next one all right [ __ ] this game i need to just like listen to music it's kind of like vibe and [ __ ] [Music] [Applause] i need more water i'm so [ __ ] thirsty if you have the option to get crushed ice and you don't just don't text me back anymore because we're not friends that makes a [ __ ] mess all right let's hydrate before we die drink oh my god that was like the kiss of life all right as you can see we are approaching the four hour point and as you can see my eyes are very heavy i'm not gonna lie man i'm getting higher and higher and higher which is cool i guess but do you really want to pop some rso caps and have to be like still getting higher in four hours like maybe at like certain situations but ultimately dabbing and smoking weed are still my preferred ways to consume cannabis but yeah these aren't so cascade hidden i don't know what it is but i have like a little double vision right now i'm like super foggy it's a different type of high for sure it's definitely more like a foggier body high than like a typical dab high or a typical weed high which more focuses on like the head i feel like this is mainly the body and then like the head is secondary like the head high is there but the body height is so intense that you don't even really notice the head high almost but i think i need a nap like that's not out of their own possibility for me today i'm so [ __ ] high i was really worried like i was talking a lot of [ __ ] on these for a minute there like it was two and a half hours before i really felt anything and it's been another hour and a half and i'm so much higher than i was then so i'm curious when this is gonna like cap so it's gonna be a long day you guys i hope you're down for the ride i'm sorry if this video isn't interesting i know i'm typically smoking and [ __ ] more but i'm just riding this high out dude like this is [ __ ] nuts i low-key just want to keep smoking on top of this to see what happens kind of see if it evens out the head high with the body height a little bit but i don't know if that's the wisest idea but i'm not here to make wise decisions that's nice it's [ __ ] nice i just stabbed on some white widow from calypso big fan of their concentrates they're a little bit on the more expensive side but the terpene profile is just unreal that dab actually made me feel a little bit better i feel like the body height was just too intense now that i got a nice little head high there too i'm like all right all right i'm back in this how long has it been oh how about that 420 blazing four and a half hours in and i'm still feeling very [ __ ] good the cotton mouth is just not going away no matter how much water i drink it just will not stop she's gotta pee and then we're gonna make some wings in the airfryer popcorn turns to food porn the other side hope you are liking this [ __ ] high as [ __ ] home style vlog because this is what you're getting hope you missed me now we are going to turn the air dude do you hear me i'm so [ __ ] big we're gonna turn the airfryer on um boom if you smoke weed and do not have an air fryer i really hope that you can take one thing out of this video and go buy one because it will truly save your life especially when you're high and you want some fire food now we're just gonna drop them in and oh yeah those are done all right food porn is in full effect you guys i'm so [ __ ] high let's determine how one of these is that looks fire oh yeah i think these need some buffalo sauce all right my high i should not have used hot sauce because my dumbass spilled it all over my shirt but i found one that's pretty much the same color to keep the aesthetic piper's pissed off she didn't get any chicken wings saved a couple for later but i honestly think i hit the peak of this high you guys it's really not as bad as i thought it was gonna be for some reason i just thought it was gonna be super intense i've had a lot of 100 to 200 milligram doses before but this is the first time i ever had a 500 milligram dose and for some reason i just figured it was gonna be like two or three times the intensity but i honestly don't think it is i think there's like a peak high you get when you smoke and probably even with edibles and probably just with how much i consume cannabis right now my tolerance is so high that this just wasn't too intense for me like i definitely couldn't drive or anything and i definitely wouldn't recommend anyone try consuming this much you should definitely ask your doctor before consuming any amount of thc don't ask me and don't go off my uh experience probably should have said that earlier in the video but yeah i'm really just [ __ ] tired at this point i'm high as [ __ ] i feel like i've had like all the phases of the edible at this point i feel like i had the giggles i feel like i had the like just chill high part i feel like i had the munchies and now i'm just at the like chill slumped part of the edible like i'm exhausted that's really all i have to say right now i'm gonna have a good night's sleep i'm pretty sure i just confirmed you can't overdose on weed we've been doing this just under six hours and ten minutes it'll be six hours but you know the high only kicked in three and a half hours ago if i did my math right but still being high as [ __ ] three and a half hours later that's not too bad i still don't think that this is the way i would like to consume most of the time like i feel like this is really just for people that can't smoke or like really just don't want to for whatever reason but like this just isn't as fun for me because i hate waiting for the high i like it to just come pretty much instantly it probably will come out quicker if you have a low tolerance but that's not the situation for me you know you really just don't know what how you're gonna get and i'd rather like find out right away when i rip a bong if it like got me high or not then like find out four hours later if you got high or not you know i'm just kind of rambling at this point you guys but that's the video click like if you enjoyed thank you so much for watching i really appreciate it make sure you subscribe i got a lot more videos on the way in my lovely new house with my adorable little pup leave a comment let me know what's the biggest edible you've ever had i'd like to know but it's time i take a nap thank you guys so much for watching i'm glad to be back on youtube i've missed you guys many more videos to come just you

the North Dakota Association of counties in the county employer group and I want to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules to attend our mandatory training today we're going to be training on our claims management program and drug-free workplace this is mandatory training that we have to conduct as part of our safety program with workforce safety and insurance so if you're a veteran employee the claims management portion is a refresher and the drug-free workplace training we will cover some issues there so we'll get started today with our claims management portion of our training and we'll talk about incidents in the workplace and incidents or any time an employee has an injury maybe some type of an accident - in the workplace may be an exposure to blood-borne pathogens or to chemicals but it's not bad enough that you need to go see a doctor we need to document that with workforce safety and insurance so that if in the future at some point your injury doesn't get any better and you need to go see a doctor we've got the documentation that something's happened at work it's a very easy process and in most cases it's just a matter of contacting your risk manager and your supervisor and between them they will get the proper paperwork filed online with workforce safety and insurance it's a very easy process so basically you just need to either text call or email your supervisor and risk manager and let them know that you'd been injured in some way but it's not bad enough that you need to go see a doc doctor that way we've got documentation on file that something did happen to you in the workplace and now should you need to go seek medical attention at some point in time in the future we have that documentation on file with workforce safety and insurance if we don't do now the burden of proof becomes placed on you to prove that something happened at work a lot of times you have county employees who work by themselves and there aren't always witnesses to accidents in the workplace so if you don't report that an incident has occurred and you come back two weeks later and you say you know two weeks ago I was by myself I slipped and fell and I twisted my knee and I thought it would be better and it's not and now I'd like to go see a doctor first and foremost your employers are gonna be skeptical that that did happen at work and even more skeptical will be work for safety insurance because after all they are an insurance company and one of the first priorities of any insurance company is a look for a way to deny a claim when it comes into their office and so if you don't have proof that something happened at work or if you didn't report it then it's a basis for workers comp to deny your claim so what should you report is incidents in the workplace we say nothing is too minor to report we would rather have a lot of incidents on file and documented than none at all even down as low as cuts and lacerations and our Road department people kind of chuckle when they tell them that because they say well that can happen on a weekly basis maybe even daily and if that's the case we still need to document those incidents just in case that cut or laceration turns into an infection and we did have a situation in one of our counties where one of our Road department employees did tell us that he said I cut my finger I thought it would be okay I really didn't take care of it probably the way I should have been in about five days later I had an infection in my finger and we went to file a worker's comp claim but it was denied because I couldn't prove that that actually happened at work and I didn't have any witnesses to that accident so we want to avoid that from happening to you and that's the importance of filing an incident report when something does happen to you strains and sprains to your back your neck your knee those type of things exposure to blood-borne pathogen they're chemicals we have a lot of exposures to blood-borne pathogens in our social service department and our law enforcement areas yet we have very little warning of incidents and so we've ran into problems in the past where people of may have contracted a blood-borne pathogen disease and now we have to determine did that happen at work or did that happen maybe when you grab the grocery cart handle at the grocery store or department store and there were still live antibodies on there and you contracted a blood-borne pathogen disease that way so what worked for safety insurance does they'll go and they'll look at your past history and they will look and say well this person's worked for the county for the past five years or ten years and there are no incident reports of any exposures to blood-borne pathogens so how could have this possibly happen at work versus looking at your file and saying well this person's had multiple exposures to blood-borne pathogens there's a high likelihood that this person contracted the blood-borne pathogen disease at work and so that's why it's very critical to file these incident reports even though it may not turn into anything in the future we still have that documentation on file that something did happen to you in the workplace and then we need to do it within 24 hours of that incident occurring so don't hesitate to report incidents and remember nothing is too minor to report we'd rather have a hundred incidents reported than none at all Mel will talk about when an injury occurs and you go do need to go seek medical treatment maybe it's as a result of this incident that happened a week ago to you and it hasn't gotten any better and now you do need to go see a doctor or maybe it's something that just happens to you today and you need to go see a doctor first you need to contact your risk manager and your supervisor to let them know that you've been injured at work and that you are going to seek medical attention make sure you do this if it's not an emergency situation that you're being taken to a medical facility let them know while you're on the way going there and we will get the paperwork started to process that claim with work for safety and insurance we have to report all injuries within 24 hours to work for safety and insurance and if we don't your county can be penalized up to 350 dot dollars for not reporting that injury within 24 hours so make sure that you contact your risk manager and supervisor and let them know that you're going to the doctor and they will probably have that form filed for you online with workforce safety and insurance by the time you're out of the doctor's office so we want to do that so that we can get that on file and that when bills come in and medical notes come in they have a file to go to it work for safety in insurance and it just eliminates the delay in payment of benefits on your behalf if you're working in a shift or weekend work we have until Monday morning to report incidents and injuries and Tuesday if Monday is a holiday so if you get hurt anytime after five o'clock on Friday during the course of the weekend and you get hurt at two o'clock in the afternoon let's say on a Saturday you need to contact your supervisor and risk manager to let them know that you've been injured and the nature and severity of that injury that will determine whether we need to file that paperwork for you right away or if it's a non-emergency situation we could file that paperwork for you on Monday but also notifies your supervisor and risk manager to the to the fact that you have been injured and we may need to make some accommodations throughout the course of the weekend to make sure that you don't injure yourself any further we also need to complete an accident investigation after every workplace injury where you seek medical attention and generally the supervisor in the department where the injury occurred is responsible for completing that accident investigation report and we have to do that within four days if not then that falls under the 350 dollar penalty that your county can be assessed for not filing that accident investigation form it's a pretty easy process we determine the root cause of that injury why did that in happen how did it happen and what can we do to prevent that injury from ever happening again to either you or maybe a co-worker and depending upon the injury we've shared information with other counties let's say if equipment was involved in that injury occurring we will share information with other counties to hopefully prevent their employees from being injured as well so we'll talk about the designated medical provider program it's a program that we participate through workforce safety and insurance a mandatory program where the employer has to choose medical providers that employees must go see for their initial treatment if they're injured at work so it's very critical that you know who your designated medical providers are because we don't want any problems to occur if you don't go to your designated medical provider for initial treatment for a way workplace accident and that has happened in the past we've had county employees who have not gone to the designated medical provider and as a result workers comp has denied their claims so this is very important part of our program to make sure that employees understand who their designated medical providers are if there's emergency care or a referral the designated medical provider program doesn't come into effect we're more concerned about getting you the treatment that you need immediately for your workplace accidents and what kind of designated medical providers would appear on a form probably your clinics and hospitals will definitely be on there those that are probably within your County also may be chiropractors however a lot of counties do not designate a chiropractor because there are several chiropractors within the county it's hard to choose just one so if your county has not selected a chiropractor as a designated medical provider and you've had chiropractic care in the past and you're satisfied with your chiropractor and the care you've received you do have the option of adding the chiropractor to your designated medical provider form here's the designated medical provider form on the top the county will list the providers that they've selected as designated medical providers you may look at that form and say well I go somewhere different than where the county has selected if you go somewhere different or if you want to add a chiropractor or another medical facility you can do that you're not locked in to what the county selects you also have the option to select your additional designated medical providers and it's going to provide you more options to seek your initial treatment if you are ever hurt at work when we talk about eye doctors your ophthalmologists and optometrists and dentists I don't think you need to list your eye doctors and dentists on your designated medical provider form I'm not saying you can't you certainly can but we've not seen any claims denied by workforce safety and insurance when somebody go sees an eye doctor or maybe a dentist for initial treatment because they're considering that as emergency care so if you have a chipped tooth it doesn't make sense for you to go see a medical doctor who's just gonna send you to a dentist because there's nothing the medical doctor can do for you so make sure that you understand who the designated medical providers are you have to sign off on this form once per year depending upon when your risk manager gets these forms to you to sign off on now just because you sign off on a specific day of the year doesn't mean you're locked into those designated medical providers for the remainder of the year so let's say you've never had chiropractic care in the past and you got hurt away from work and saw a chiropractor for the first time and you said you know what that chiropractor did a pretty good job for me if I ever get injured at work I would like to add that designated medical provider to my designated medical provider form so you just go back to your risk manager and say I'd like to add my chiropractor to my designated medical provider form and you can do that anytime throughout the course of the year as long as it's before you're injured so it could be a month from the time you sign your form three months six months nine months it doesn't matter you can add additional designated medical providers to this form anytime throughout the course of the year and if you're unsure when you're injured make sure you contact your risk manager to make sure you know who those designated medical providers are and so adding designated medical providers is just giving you additional options and that way we can make sure you're getting treated by a designated medical provider and not jeopardizing the denial of your claim now we'll talk about the doctors report of injury the c3 form it's a capability assessment report that the doctor fills out every time you go see the doctor and this is a form that we need to have after your workplace accident and after every follow-up visit so we can determine what restrictions the doctors has placed on you and technically if we don't get this form after your medical appointments we cannot let you come back to work and the reason we can't let you come back to work is that if we don't know what restrictions the doctors placed on you we don't want you to come back to work and take the risk of injuring yourself further so if the doctors placed a 25 pound lifting restriction on you for the next two weeks we need to know about that so that we can make accommodations in the workplace to make sure that you don't do that and I'll be honest with you this is not an easy process to get it from the doctors doctors get paid to see patients they don't get paid to fill out paperwork and so they might tell you we'll file it online will fax it over we will send it in and they will certainly do that but that might take two or three days to do and if we have to wait two or three days for this report to come in now you have to take two or three days of vacation or sick leave and personally we think you can utilize your vacation and sick leave better than waiting for a doctor to send in a report so when you come back from your doctor's visit you let your supervisor and risk manager know that you weren't able to get this form from the doctor if the risk manager knows you're at a doctor's appointment I guarantee you they'll be asking you for this after your appointment so if you don't get it between the risk manager and our internal claims manager Jennifer Mormon they will get that form for you and I guarantee it probably 99% of the time they get that the same day so we can determine what your restrictions are so we can develop a viable return to work plan for you so that you don't jeopardize yourself being injured any further and it's very critical that you understand the restrictions the doctors placed on you and that you need to follow those both on and off the job 24 hours a day seven days a week a lot of people think well I got hurt at work so I just have to have to follow the restrictions the doctors placed me under while I'm at work and when I'm away from work I can do anything I want but that's not the case if the doctor is placed a twenty five pound lifting restriction on you for the next two weeks the last thing you should do when you go home is lift up your 45 pound child or grandchild because if you hurt yourself further by doing that then you are putting yourself in jeopardy of having your claim denied because you've exceeded the restrictions that the doctors placed you under so very critical that you know and understand what those restrictions are and as I mentioned we need this every time you go for a follow-up visit until the doctor releases you to a hundred percent work with no restrictions talk a little bit about our transitional return to work program we have probably one of the most comprehensive transitional return to work programs in the state of North Dakota very successful program that we have in place we've trained other employers throughout the state of North Dakota on our program because they've heard of our successes and they want to implement programs like like we've done and a transitional return to work program is a program we've designed that we bring people back to work as quickly and as safely as possible in pre defined work jobs okay so transitional work generally means that you've been hurt bad enough that you can't come back to do a hundred percent of your duties for a specified amount of time and generally transitional work is designed for maybe a two to four week time period and it certainly could be longer depending upon the severity of the injury but we work very closely with the doctor the employee the supervisor in determining and planning a viable return to work plan for you we've done our homework up front we have a big manual of with hundreds of transitional return to work jobs that we can show the doctor and work with the doctor and show them that we've done our homework and device in developing credible return to work opportunities for people our job descriptions talk about standing sitting bending stooping lifting temperature extremes you might be exposed to and it lends a lot of credibility with a doctor when they release you to do a transitional job because that transitional job fits within the restrictions that the doctors placed you under and generally we start in your own department if we have a road department employee who's been injured and can't drive his road grader for the next two weeks we're gonna say is there something in the shop that that employee could do that falls under the restrictions that the doctors placed on you and when we talk about transitional work and people returning to work the only person that decides when and how you come back to work is your doctor no one else makes that decision other than the doctor based on the information that we provide as far as the transitional job descriptions go if we can't play somebody in their own department for transitional work then we will look at placing them in another department and there again we work very closely with the employee to make sure that we're developing a viable return to work plan if we have someone in the county who's not comfortable working on computers the last thing we're going to do is put them in the auditor's office having them do data entry all day so we're going to work with that employee to find something that's viable for that employee to develop that return to work plan and a lot of people say why are you rushing me back to work I got hurt at work shouldn't I sit at home and recover until I'm better and then I come back to work doctors will be the first people to tell you that work is therapy doing something is better than not doing something at all and sitting at home and not doing anything isn't getting you back to work any quicker and with transitional work you will transition back to your regular job much more quickly and so the reason our program is successful is because we're focusing on people's capabilities rather than their disabilities what can you do rather than what can't you do and a lot of employers say and tell doctors that they have returned to work programs and you know what their return to work programs are hey come on get back to work we need you and they're not concerned about the health and safety and well-being of their employers and that's why we've developed this comprehensive transitional work program for you and you say what what's in it for me to do transitional work and here's the biggest basis and benefit of providing transitional work to an employee who's been injured at work we want to prevent you from going on workers comp disability benefits if you go on workers comp disability benefits they only pay 66 and 2/3 percent of your weekly wage in disability benefits so now if you've been injured at work and you can't return to work and you go on workers comp disability benefits you've just taken an automatic one-third pay cut and that causes financial hardships for people and that's exactly what we want to avoid for people plus work for safety and insurance has a benefit cap depending upon the amount of money an employee earns and a lot of our county employees make enough money in salary that they're also affected by the benefit cap that WSI places on their benefits that they pay so now we were seeing county employees taking up to a 50% pay cut by going on workers comp disability benefits and that certainly causes financial hardships for people who may been an injured at work by no fault of their own so by having a transitional work program designed you come back to work in a transitional job and no matter what pay scale that transitional job is you continue to earn a hundred percent of your salary and you maintain your health insurance and other benefits job security retirement plans a lot of private employers tell them our employees we're not paying your health insurance and other benefits when you're off the job you're not working why should we pay those and then a lot of times people don't even know if they have jobs to go back to in the private sector employers fill their jobs and then when they've recovered from their workplace accident now there's not a job to go back to so this has been a very successful program personally I hope you never have to use this program because if it does it means you've been injured at work to a point of severity that we need to implement this program and our goal first and foremost is to prevent people from getting injured at work but in the event that something should happen to you it's good for you to know that we've got programs and policies and procedures in place to help you through the injury process should you be injured at work talk a little bit about personal protective equipment if you have the personal protective equipment you need to perform your job please please please utilize it it doesn't do any good to have it sitting on the shelf someplace not being utilized and using personal protective equipment starts at the department head and supervisory level and if department heads and supervisors don't think that utilizing personal protective equipment and they're your job is important how in the world can we expect our employees to think that utilizing personal protective equipment is important but you have to take the initiative no one in your county is responsible for your safety other than you you're 100% responsible for your own safety so if other people aren't where latex gloves they're not wearing safety glasses are not wearing safety gloves gowns masks that doesn't mean you shouldn't it means that you need to take the initiative and you need to do that and protect yourself especially in today's world with all the potential hazards out there especially with blood-borne pathogen issues you need to take it upon yourself to utilize personal protective equipment so if you don't have it make sure you let us know because we'll do whatever we can to get it for you even if we have to buy it for you ourselves through the ceg and if it is there please use it because we've seen several cases where people have been injured or exposed to blood-borne pathogens because they didn't use their personal protective equipment and on the flip side we can tell people several situations where because people wore their personal protective equipment it prevented them from being injured at work okay we'll move on to our drug-free workplace we're going to talk a little bit about marijuana and opioids again we have a crisis with with both of those in today's world I don't think you can open a newspaper or listen to a news report that doesn't cover issues on on opioids and first of all we talked a little bit about our Employee Assistance Programs counties either out formal programs or informal formal or where they're contracted services with an EAP professional so it's a benefit that the county provides for you you need to check with your county to make sure that this is a paid benefit for you if it's not then it means that the county has made arrangements with an EAP professional for employees to go to should they need those services in any event posted on the bulletin board in the courthouses and outlying areas should be the EAP provider that your county has selected and their phone number and so that is posted on the bulletin board for you to get that information should you need to seek services from them and it's not only for drugs and alcohol but it's also for personal family related issues that you can use EAP services and all of those are confidential should you need to utilize those services we work really closely with counties and developing workplace drug testing policies and when I work with counties it's like working with 53 different employers really because every county is different they have different Commission's they have different falafels ASSA fees on what they think may be important in in a policy manual and especially drug testing policies but these are the areas that we think are the most critical and most important and having in a drug testing policy starting with pre-employment drug testing if we can screen people and prevent people from coming into our workplaces who have drug and alcohol issues we've just done a great service to all our other employees in our county and we tend to think that in our counties were tight knit groups of people and that there are not drug and alcohol issues in county government but believe me there are and we deal with drug and alcohol issues in the workplace with county personnel and that's why we need the proper policies and procedures in place to protect our employees so we have several examples where counties call us and tell us that because of their pre-employment testing they prevented somebody from coming into their workplace with a drug or alcohol issue and a lot of times those people are offered jobs and the counties tell them now the only final process is for you to pass a drug and alcohol screening and guess what happens those people don't even show up for the screening and so we've done a great service to our employees post-accident testing or post incident testing in moving vehicle violations especially is very critical when employers are injured in accidents related to drugs and alcohol in the workplace a lot of those tend to be very high dollar cost claims they can cost tens thousands of dollars or up to hundreds of thousands of dollars depending upon the severity of those injuries so it's critical that we know whether somebody's under the influence of drugs or alcohol when an accident occurs at work and a lot of counties do not have post accident testing we're getting better in that area but we can prevent a lot of unnecessary payment of workers comp dollars by determining whether people are under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of an accident and we've had several counties who now have implemented post accident policies because they were basically saved by law enforcement personnel when an injury occurred because even if you don't have a post accident testing policy in your County if law enforcement responds to the accident scene and they have any suspicion so if any of our sheriff's deputies our city police our Highway Patrol respond to an accident they have any suspicion that alcohol or drugs were involved in that accident they can order a blood or alcohol screening and as a result of their alertness in multiple cases involving county employees it has been determined that County employees were under the influence of drugs or alcohol and as a result work for safety and insurance denied their claim and as a result save that County literally thousands of dollars in workers compensation costs every county has to have a reasonable suspicion as a minimum in their policy reasonable suspicion sometimes is harder to implement when you don't have pre-employment post-accident or random testing because you need to document actions of people and and and it's tough for people to come forward and ask someone to go in for a drug and alcohol screening so but if you have any reasonable suspicion that somebody is under the influence of drugs or alcohol please don't hesitate to to do that and then random testing some counties have random testing for all employees our Road department employees ask me all the time how come we have to be tested randomly consistent basis but nobody else in the county has to be and that's because the road department employees are randomly tested as a federal mandate through the federal d-o-t and it's not a county mandate but more and more counties again are starting to do random testing on all employees making it fair across the board for all employees in county government and so that lends a lot of credibility to the county and their persistence to make sure that they're keeping their workplaces drug and alcohol free so we'll talk a little bit about marijuana and opioids as well as I mentioned you can hardly open the newspaper or listen to a news report and hear stories about marijuana or opioids in today's world and marijuana is probably the most commonly used drug in the United States in states that have legalized marijuana you talked to people from those states and those states are in chaos socially and economically in chaos and the social service needs for people are starting to skyrocket people are overdosing at a high rate because of that and it's not always because of smoking marijuana probably the biggest problem for states with legalized marijuana is the dangers of edible marijuana and edible marijuana is more dangerous than smoking marijuana because the onset of the high from eating animal marijuana's takes longer to kick in than it does for people who smoke marijuana so if you ingest marijuana edibles it could take up to a half hour or 45 minutes for that high to kick in where if you smoke marijuana it's almost instantaneously so people have a tendency to over indulge with a medical the edible marijuana is because they're not getting that immediate high from them so they ingest more and more and that's what leads to the toxic overdoses for people too I was at a training session recently where a lady from Colorado said that back in the 1960s Woodstock joints had about two milligrams of THC and if they found joints with five milligrams of THC that was considered to be high and in today's world the marijuana has an average of 15 milligrams of THC in an average joint so it's gotten much stronger over the years here's some of the edible marijuana's from Colorado it's in pop and sodas it's in gummy bears you know these these people who are selling this are gearing things toward young people and making it appealing to young people to get hooked on marijuana and so you've got a KitKat bar that looks like a candy bar right it even says nests it says nest e on it instead of Nestle and you'd think there'd be a lawsuit with something like that being that close to a KitKat bar but these are some of them edible marijuana's here's some of the top edible marijuana is in Colorado pot chips are one of the big things it's very hard to guess the exact dose you're taking per chip now this is a bag that you would buy let's say in a convenience store one of those smaller bags of chip maybe a 1 to 2 ounce bag of chips in a convenience store and how many times have you bought a bag of those chips you eat one or two of those chips and then you roll the bag up you can see I'm gonna save the rest for later that doesn't really ever happen those are usually one serving size bags of chips so people eat the entire bag well with pot chips people tend to eat the whole bag of these chips and then this bag of pot chips has 300 milligrams of THC in it that's the equivalent of smoking 20 joints ok so a great example of people having a tendency to over indulge and then they get the toxic overdose of as a result of that there's a lot of chocolate and candy bars these candy bars probably look bigger than they are in real life but have a lot of potency the keema bar with a hundred and eighty milligrams of THC their sour straws there's chocolate powders you can put in drinks or to sprinkle on food there's the gummy bear as we talked about about you can buy brownies at these retail places and you can choose how much THC is in them ranging from 100 milligrams to a thousand milligrams so again very easy to overindulge there are SERPs you can put into soda milk water coffee whatever the case may be and then there's a punch chocolate bar that's probably the most popular they say in Colorado 225 milligrams of THC in one square so if people tend to eat more in that leading to toxic overdose again so very very dangerous the animal portions of marijuana and as I mentioned those states that have legalized the marijuana are seeing a lot of problems in their states as a result of that and it's not going to get any better it's only going to get worse as time goes on talk a little bit about illicit drug use opioids in today's world opioids are very dangerous and very addictive approximately 15 people died or one person dies every 15 minutes as a result of an opioid overdose okay a lot of the opioid overdose results in people starting out by using and misusing prescription drugs 80% of heroin users started out using prescription drugs and then they switched to heroin after that and the reason that they switched to heroin which is an opioid after their prescription drugs is because their prescriptions have run out and they can't get them refilled or they find out that the prescription drugs are really expensive compared to the cost of heroin so heroin is a much cheaper option for opioid narcotic users now the problem with heroin is that drug dealers are lacing heroin with fentanyl to increase the high that people get from heroin fentanyl is a very dangerous drug and it's 50 times more powerful than heroin okay so dealers are mixing fentanyl into heroin and the problem with people overdosing then is that the dealers may not be mixing it equally and evenly and so you're getting a lethal dose of fentanyl in a dose of heroin and that's where people are dying and overdosing as a result of fentanyl being mixed into heroin there is a medication out there called narcan that's approved to reverse the effects of an overdose of heroin and if you just go in Google on YouTube in the search box on YouTube heroin overdoses and narcan you can see real-life first responders responding to people who have overdosed and are virtually dead to the world they are a hundred percent non-coherent and passed out and on the verge of death and they show people administering this narcan spraying and in their nose and within about 10 seconds these people are up and they're back in their coherent and talking again just like nothing ever happened and you listen to these first responders talking about these people coming out of that overdose and they say you know in most cases you'd think people would be thanking you for saving their life but a lot of times it's the complete opposite these people become very combative because you just ruin the best high that they ever had and so a lot of people are on the fence with narcan of whether it's a benefit or not of course it's a benefit if you just saved someone's life and if you saved a friend's life and family members life or even a stranger's life that is a benefit but in these youtube videos people who are addicted to heroin say you know what now that narc hands out there's really no incentive for me to get off of heroin because in today's world a lot of people are equipped with narc and the chances of someone showing up and saving my life by administering a narcan is a high probability so what is my incentive to get off of heroin if I know there's an outside chance that somebody's gonna come and save my life so if there's a downside to narcan that would probably be it here's an example showing heroin fentanyl and car fentanyl the dealers are now mixing into heroin and car fentanyl is a hundred times more powerful than fentanyl okay and so two milligrams of fentanyl the size of four grains of salt will kill you so these are lethal doses if you took that much heroin alone it would kill you if you took that much Fenton all by itself it would kill you and carve into no car fentanyl is used a lot of times as a tranquilizer for elephants so that's how lethal that is how is it a training session where they gave a demonstration of drug dealers may be mixing fentanyl in with heroin then they took a hundred parts of heroin and one part of fentanyl and they mix it up in both our white powders and so they took a white sugar and then they took a blue sugar and for the example purposes and both are white and in real life and so they mix those and put those together and put them in a blender and they blended it up through a electric blender and then they spread it out onto a table that were they were gonna go and start cutting that into sellable doses of heroin and that's where the danger comes in two people were buying heroin laced with fentanyl because you just don't know how much you're getting and here's two examples on the bottom of the screen where it shows that in some of these samples there's no Fenton all in all some there is some fentanyl and in the screen on the bottom right that section that was thought to be mixed up well is laced with a lot of fentanyl and those would all be lethal doses of fentanyl if somebody got a hold of and remember when they cut these into their sellable packets they can't see this because both powders are white so they can't determine how much fentanyl is in one dose versus the other here's some of the most addictive prescription drugs that are being prescribed by doctors there they're prescribed on a daily basis to people all very highly addictive for people who take them and don't take them properly we do have some strains on those exposed to fentanyl and other drugs in our counties and and that would be mostly our social service people and our law enforcement people and here again is where it really becomes important to wear your personal protective equipment if you get fentanyl on your skin pores you do not have to ingest fentanyl if you get it on your skin and it gets into your pores it will give you the same reaction overdose reaction as if you ingested it so our our County law enforcement personnel people that are going into houses for social services that's where you need to wear latex gloves double glove you're working gown safety glasses long sleeves just to do whatever you can to protect yourself from having fentanyl come into contact with your skin it hasn't happened in North Dakota yet but in the United States and has where drug sniffing dogs have come into contact with fentanyl and they have had an adverse reaction overdose reaction as a result of coming into contact with fentanyl we should be preventive when it comes to opioids first and foremost you need to ask your doctor for non opioid pain medication alternatives and they're out there you just need to ask we need to ask and we should always be asking for non addictive pain medication alternatives rather than taking the chance to become becoming addicted on opioids so we need to ask make sure that you ask because a doctor will prescribe you an opioid over a non-addictive first and foremost if you do have the medications try to lock them up if you are prescribed them and you do need them for some reason monitor how much medication your take and how much you've been prescribed so you're not overtaking that a lot of people build up an immunity to the opioids and that's where they start taking more than the prescribed dosage and so if the dis prescribed dosage is one pill every four to six hours now people are taking two and they increase that to three and that's when people become addicted to them there are take back programs for opioids that you don't use if you have been prescribed them law enforcement is a good Avenue and there are other programs med safe and steri cycle that you can mail them back to all counties in North Dakota except billing slope and grant counties have some formal types of drug take-back programs and when you dispose of your rx bottles your prescription bottles make sure you're destroying your name and information off of that to prevent anyone from getting your identity and trying to get those refilled by by a pharmacy the National Safety Council has come out with these stickers that you can put on on your insurance cards and the North Dakota and the National Safety Council says that you should show this to your pharmacist when you're getting your prescription filled and I kind of disagree with that I think you should be showing and talking to your doctor about opioids before he even prescribes him it's a little late once you get to the pharmacist and the doctors already prescribed you an opioid and you don't want to take that opioid now you have to go back to your doctor set up another appointment see your doctor get to get prescribed a non-addictive pain medication so really that's where it's important to talk to your doctor about opioids before they even prescribe them and unfortunately sometimes they are over prescribed by doctors I've had two instances where County employees have told us that they've gone to the dentist and yes dentists can even prescribe opioids for pain relief from dental work being done and I've had two people one just a week ago when I was doing training that said the dentist prescribed 100 hydrocodone pills to that person after just having some basic dental work and so it's no no wonder why people are getting addicted to opioids especially if they think they have to continue taking the medication even though their pain is gone here's some opioid drug statistics nationally in a lot of states home burglaries are up against the elderly and why is that because elderly people are being prescribed a lot of medications and people are breaking into the elderly's homes and stealing medications that a lot of time include opioids and other stimulants that they can get high off of some North Dakota statistics 54 people died in 2016 in North Dakota from opioid overdoses four hundred and sixty-six thousand hope you had prescriptions were written in North Dakota in 2015 that's an amazing number and probably much higher than that today deaths in Cass County on the number of doses in Cass County administered in 2007 115 a sad statistic 17 people last year were born addicted babies were born addicted to opioids in Cass County alone and there was just a story on the news this past week in Bismarck that narcan has been administered 49 times in the Bismarck Mandan area in the past year a Grand Forks has seen an opioid problem in the past several years and they've applied for and received grants to try to combat the opioid problem in Grand Forks and Grand Forks County and they're doing a lot of great things and some of these statistics come from only those that are reported to medical facilities and in 2016 and 2017 there were 63 and 53 opioid overdoses but those are only the ones that were reported because those are ones that reported to Altru or that all true responded through so there are probably much more than that so they're doing a lot of good things they've seen an increase by 130 percent of HIV cases in North Dakota between 2012 and 2017 because of opioid drug abuse hepatitis C of 52 percent as well because of opioid overdoses and drug abuse in North Dakota and they're doing a lot of good things training wise in Grand Forks they've distributed 242 narcan kits they trained 488 people they're giving narcan to pharmacies through this grant at no cost to distribute and now even in Fargo Grand Forks in Bismarck I believe the hospitals are now giving training classes on how to administer narcan because virtually anybody can get narcan now family members can get it if they know their loved ones have opioid addictions and so anybody can basically get it nowadays so they're doing training classes for that so what would you do if you had a co-worker who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the workplace would you ignore it would you report it a lot of times people have a tendency to ignore it it's easier to do that we don't think it's our problem but if we are we're just ignoring the problem as well and maybe asking for serious trouble a lot of times we see not only the people under the influence of drugs or alcohol getting injured but also coworkers so you are at risk as well for injury when you're working around someone who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol and we're not doing it to get people in trouble we're doing it to help people we want to help people we want to protect people we want to protect co-workers so please don't ignore it do what you need to do if you don't feel comfortable reporting it let us know we'll do what we can to help you from an anonymous standpoint as well we've helped counties in situations just like that it's your responsibility to talk to management about it when when there's risks out there because it's somebody under the influence of drugs or alcohol a good manager will take the initiative and pick up the issue and address that issue from there but unfortunately there's managers that won't do that either and that's where we may need to come into play and help you and where you can contact us anonymously and we'll do what we can to help address that situation in your County so with that that's all I have for training today once again I'd like to thank you very much for taking time out of your busy schedule to attend this training session if you ever have any questions on our program you can time contact your risk manager in your county or you can also contact myself or Jennifer Mormon and our information is on the screen there and we would be more than happy to help assist you in any way that we can so once again thank you very much and have a great rest of your day thank you", "xHOvVWtkMmM": "so what's up YouTube man I just wanted to do a real quick review on this real quick this is the Kiva brand of edibles 180 milligram boxes was the website so I'm just gonna put this out there this week this is pretty cool this is like comes to church with the doses or bubble off so you could do that but here's what I'm doing the review I got they gave them give you the samples it gave me samples through my coop these are freaking delicious if you have the opportunity to try them try them I'm not even kidding and then potency please these it says on the back it says this is intended for strong medicine for people that would have a high tolerance they mean it so for me being somebody the high tolerance pub law I started with one of the section and then another section and I first like finished one whole bar of the vanilla chai cream which was freaking delicious to little tiny bit of cannabis taste but not much this is something that definitely I would highly recommend above the too much so for my two favorite chocolate bars as far proposed seeing taste have been the bang and these guys they have different all different kinds they got a dark tangerine which are stuff is so delicious however their chocolate makers Bravo my friend so if you want to find something that's got a good taste to it not good potency this is definitely a brand to check out so so they're theirs as their website was on the back of them and it is keeper confessions calm anyways thanks for the review walks interview and love peace and shares of Greece", "tzvQiKUCyII": "today I'm here I'm going to talk about three more points that will help you to ease into a ketogenic lifestyle so today I want to talk about hoping help you with your ketogenic diet who can help you with your health all right number two I want to talk about your personal carbohydrate threshold number three I want to talk about the about applying the 80/20 principle at this point in the journey okay so number one last week I talked about conventional medicine right I talked about how amazing doctors and nurses are at monitoring and stabilizing the body how they save lives when we get into situations of trauma and this is amazing and something to be very very grateful for I also talked about the limitation and how with in conventional medicine when you present symptoms to a doctor the treatment plan is a pharmaceutical treatment plan and it's a plan that's going to address those symptoms that you're presenting okay it does not look at root cause well then it sort of begs the question if you're interested in finding out what the root causes is what do you do well there's another arm of medicine that has become quite popular it's called functional medicine it means exactly what it says so it is an area within medicine in which medical professionals are looking at the way the body functions and trying to understand the root cause of what's happening at any given time so there is also the functional medicine Institute here in America and this is an institute that provides certification to medical professionals who want to be certified in this manner to work with patients in this manner on root causes and so this could be medical doctors going back for the certification it could be internal medicine doctors family physicians doctors of osteopathic medicine you know a lot of white variety any kind of doctor could go back and nurse practitioners could go back and get this certification in functional medicine and there is a way to find out what fun functional medicine certified physicians might be near you so I'm going to put a link in the notes on that so you can just put in your zip code and a list of doctors and nurses that have received this certification will come up and then you can search them so I did this here in Pittsburgh and I though was looking for a functional medicine doctor who had experience with the ketogenic lifestyle and fasting someone who uses that in their practice and so I found a keto cardiologist and I found a keto oncologist and I found a keto doctor of Osteopathic Medicine who I visited once so I can't really say you know too much at this point but but there is this whole other sort of arm of medicine and the Cleveland Clinic has set up and I believe it was in 2015 set up an arm of functional medicine a clinic there and when I read an article I want to say it was about a year ago they had a three year waiting list so it is really a big deal people want to know what the root cause is of their situation and they want to treat that so I really think this is the future of medicine it's a huge bright spot so I wanted to say that and so look for that in the show notes if you're interested and then number two I want to talk about your personal carbohydrate threshold what I'm really talking about here is insulin but I find that people kind of like blanked out when you talk about insulin resistance I don't know what it is about it but it's like it goes in one air and it sort of like goes out the other it just doesn't seem to stick so I'm going to try to talk about it in more practical terms and see if that might be helpful I will leave in the notes a video that would kind of get go into more depth on it so that you can also listen to that as well but I want to talk about today is a threshold that that everyone has in terms of carbohydrates so number one I just want to say for many doctors say that there is a percentage of the population that can live successfully and happily on a higher carbohydrate diet and I've heard anywhere from 10% of the population can do this 225 so I'll just fade it like that that 10 to 25% of a population can actually thrive on a higher carbohydrate diet and there are three signs that that someone might be able to do that so the first sign would be so you're eating a high carbohydrate diet and you don't have any metabolic syndrome issues so you have no symptoms your symptom three number two would be that you have normal body weight so you've fallen the parameters of normal for your height and your gender and you also do not have a protruding abdomen which can often sort of set off the sign of fatty liver disease and there is a such thing as skinny fat so someone can be very thin and have a protruding abdomen and so that wouldn't work so there's that and then the third sign is that an individual is eating a higher carbohydrate diet and thriving in their mental health so in other words they're not experiencing anxiety they're not experiencing any depression or any other areas ADHD those kinds of within mental health so there is this population that can thrive on a higher carbohydrate diet but we all have a carbohydrate sort of feeling or threshold is the way I like to think of it so if you think about your blood and homeostasis of the blood so within the blood you you need a balanced amount of sodium right and you need a you need healthy fats right and you need one teaspoon of glucose that's homeostasis in the blood so when you consider that Americans are averaging 31 teaspoons of sugar consumption on a daily basis you can see how insulin insulin resistance can get stirred up and stirred into process right so so homeostasis though is one teaspoon of glucose in the body so and what happens is so say you're at homeostasis you know things are looking good and you have kind of this buffer area where you have carbohydrates and your body is able to deal with them fine you know and and bring it back down to homeostasis okay so but as you consume more and more carbohydrates you get above this threshold you start eating more than your body can handle so let's imagine you have heimi homeostasis and I'm little Lin five-year five-year-old Lin who loves candy bars okay so I have a candy bar and I back candy bar is going to spike up my glucose so now I don't have one teaspoon of glucose in my blood I have a lot more and that sort of sets off an emergency so what happens is is then insulin spikes up a pain insulin is going to try to drive that glucose back down to a balanced level back down to homeostasis so the first thing it's going to do is put some that glucose into my muscle storage and it'll do as much as it can of that but there's a limited amount so with excess glucose we know that insulin is the fat storing hormone so it's going to start storing fat fat cells are going to get bigger it's going to start storing that excess in fact and so you know and then so you can imagine that's just one candy bar with little Lin whose organs and cells were working fine but then you think about a whole lifetime years and years of candy bars and chips and bread new pasta so I'm talking mostly about grains and sugars for these carbohydrates and so we have we're playing this game of spiking glucose spiking insulin right think that storing fat and what happens is homeostasis finally gets out okay and then we could be in a situation we are in a situation of insulin resistance possibly pre-diabetic possibly diabetic so then we have a cellular problem see because then the cells are starting to shut down okay they can't handle it anymore and when they shut down to that to exit the excess insulin they're also shutting down two nutrients so now you have cells that are nutrient deficient so this really sets all kinds of stuff into motion the metabolic syndrome issues that we are seeing today in our society so this is what I'm talking about when I say you have a carbohydrate threshold your body works very diligently trying to bring homeostasis or your body back into homeostasis when too many cards have come into the system it has this protection but even that can only go for so long and this is what happened so here I am on 48 and I had candy bars and bread and pasta and whatever else I've lived above my threshold for dealing you know very proficiently effectively and efficiently with carbs okay I lived above that you know and I dictate I mention my body so I come in to like 48 49 years old and I am gaining weight and I'm not able to do anything about it but a little tricks that I would do before are not working you know and I'm noticing other things I've said in other videos whether it's my hearing or my sight or my brain fault you know all these little these symptoms okay so this is kind of what happens is that we have and this was a little bit different for everyone and so this is what you want to try to find out is where is your threshold and consider the fact that you may have been eating above your carbohydrate threshold for quite a while you know where are you right now and what I love about the ketogenic weight eating is it pretty quickly can help you get back to homeostasis bring cuz you're gonna bring sugar way down and it you can start stabilizing the blood which is going to start stabilizing the cells and it's just going to you know bring a lot of stability to the body and this is an amazing thing so I absolutely love talking about this because it has the possibility of so much benefit which I've talked about in other videos okay so I just wanted to get to bring that up and get you started to think about when you look at food and you think about your health that you have this threshold you have this carbohydrate threshold that really is going to affect yourselves it's going to affect your organs and has a big impact and how keto can really help you with that and really rather quickly so it's pretty amazing the last thing I want to talk about today is at this point so we're in week 3 applying the 80/20 principle now I tend to be a little bit anal so I have to admit I'm more like ninety ten but I want to bring this up because it's a very good principle nobody's perfect that's the first thing I want to say no one is perfect we live in the world we live in we want to celebrate you know things that need to be celebrated you know so the idea is for this third week is to eat all pedo meals and I've already talked about trying to have that first meal of the day be predominantly protein because it just helps you to avoid cravings it sets you up for a good day so now what I'm suggesting is that Monday through Friday you you hit the keto road pretty hard you know you're eating from your food list you're making meals from your recipe book that you're working on or recipe kiyo recipe book that you purchased and Monday through Friday you're being really diligent and then on the weekend on Saturday and Sunday you relax a little bit now I wouldn't suggest going way off the rails it'll just be harder to get back on and you'll lose some of the benefit that you've achieved in that Monday through Friday so you don't want to go home while but you can certainly relax there's some room for that to do that so yeah so I just want it so with that you just want to make sure that you have happy keto foods in your refrigerator that you have some in pantry never throw out good keto leftovers those can be your friend and help you in a pinch you know so so there's that I just wanted to mention this principle and try this for week number three and we'll see how that goes I'm gonna leave I'd mentioned the the websites that have a ton of recipes before last week well there are 11 websites that I put in last week's video I'm going to put those again down in the notes of this video there are so many recipes it's very very exciting to begin looking at these and maybe creating your recipe book so that's it if you have any questions you can leave those down below the notes of this video and I would be happy to answer them thanks so much for watching today hanging out with me and considering ketogenic lifestyle and how it might really help you to achieve your health goals so thanks so much for watching and I'll you in next video I [Music]", "EI2FrKdifbk": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I've got a fresh look at that ooh that is pretty to look at a fresh jar of Nutella and pancakes love Nutella if you didn't know a fresh jar to tell us and that means we are gonna be reviewing some gummies that's right guys we're back with more gummies I always know I'm telling you to be wary of gummies I'm weary of gummies and I'm wary of these gummies so this was a 500 milligrams worth of gummies don't worry I'm not eating all 500 milligrams today we're just gonna do a test to see if there any potent whatsoever I picked these up for 30 bucks at my dispensary so a very good deal if these are in fact 500 milligrams worth of gummies I doubt that that is gonna be the case this is the canna MX brand taste innovation only the finest quality there are 50 gummy bears in here in total with 10 milligrams per gummy bear so we are going to do 20 in total for 200 milligrams and we're gonna do our review on 200 milligrams of the canon mix in total canna MX canna mix I'm gonna go with canna mix is how you say that it's spelled canna MX all one word unless so again 30 bucks for 500 milligram gummy edible is a great deal if in fact it works but there are a lot of red flags chiefly the price you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles second the packaging this isn't cheap easy to make packaging it's just a sticker on a ziplock bag always a bad sign to we're almost always a bad sign I've had a couple of good things come in cheap packaging like this but not a lot um and just the fact they're gummies that's also usually a bad sign I have bad luck with gummies there are a lot of people unscrupulous folks out there making gummies that aren't worth they're a damn and I'm hoping that isn't gonna be the kids that can of MX we're gonna give him a totally fair shot so I have Nutella just to uh turley completely boost my of getting any kind of tolerance she's taking a little bit of extra fat with the gummies just to help process that THC so here we go let's open them up give the taste test the smell test all that fun stuff so you can see the gummies in there they look like pretty plain gummies they don't have any coating on them they don't have anything additional on them it smells both intensely fruity and intensely cannabis ewwww so here we go nothing on the outside they're not sticky or anything like that I'm just gonna grossly dip it right in Nutella get some fat going here there we go mm hmm well I didn't really taste any cannabis but that might be because I've got the Nutella on it but Wow okay a little bit of cannabis taste on that one okay let's just try one clean here there's a slight cannabis taste to them but really these are on the less cannabis II and of gummy taste that I for gummies or less cannabis II tasting gummies that I've had also a bad sign this is not gross tasting like the etta pure infused creations which I find really hard to stomach although I don't find those to be any good whatsoever so I'm hoping that doesn't mean that these are gonna be bad but we'll have to find out so I've eaten four already I'm gonna do sixteen more and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review you don't really care about how these can be Bears tastes you want to know if Kanna MX is something you should be buying in the future so guys I'll see you in two hours to let you know for sure thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I had the canna mx-5s quality 500 milligram gummies I only had 200 milligrams of them but there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there i am i high at all i'm like a - maybe somewhere in there don't feel pleasantly stoned I feel like I had to join an hour ago yeah [ __ ] Ken MX and their gummy bears it's a load of [ __ ] these aren't potent at all another crappy gummy and another crappy gummy company all the telltale signs were there that she priced the sticker the she packaging oh and all kin of MX no do not spend your money on these guys if you see them stay far far away I do have some of their chocolate bars to review maybe they'll be good I have seen where chocolate bars are still good and the gummy brands are bad where when people have both like um we get a flavor ex their chocolate isn't bad but their gummies are terrible so we'll see but as right now just pass on the gummy bears don't waste your money and [ __ ] these guys for you know where's the lab tested result where's the nutrition information where's all that good stuff it's not here because they don't want you to know because it's just gummy bears they bought off the shelf and infused maybe some cannabis in there possibly who knows maybe I'm just high because I smoked like two hours ago and that's what I'm still feeling not feeling anything most boy I this is like our sixth dud review in a row or something maybe we've had a string up they might not all come out in the order of duds in a row but I have reviewed a bunch of doodoo back to back to back I am really looking for a diamond in the rough a pleasant surprise I was hoping Kevin MX was it gonna be it I gave him a fair shot but definitely do not gonna be the gummy bears from them so final conclusion if you see Kanna mx4 now avoid everything I'll review their chocolate if their chocolates good I'll be sure to let you know we'll assess them fairly but for right now there's no reason to buy any of their products because if they're gonna rip you off with this it's more than likely they're gonna rip you off with other things so sorry to be a bummer guys I really wish we could have had something more fun for you but at least we know not to mix it up with Kanna MX or something so guys thank you so much for watching this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see on the next review peace", "QByhEg-mc0Q": "so YouTube so I'm back again with another edible review this time I picked up something called punch bar never heard of this it look pretty good so I just picked it up it was $18 pretty pricey 225 milligrams of cannabis in it it's a chocolate so again it's going to be pretty potent and as the name suggests as well so I have Adam here sorry about the steady we're just on our way to the [ __ ] City Walk and I thought it'd be a great time to do a review so I'm only going to about 1/4 this is packaging ended pretty nice graphic design on there I'm open it this is the inside right here like without jeans pretty nice and a times divided so into 90 little pieces each piece has 25 milligram of cannabis in it Oh am I amita for it that's about I'm family guy ah so that's 35 milligrams right there then we'll be eating Adam is only if any and five milligrams as well so we're going to split this or we might have to do have to have one footed so this is what it looks like on the inside it's the divided into nine pieces 25 milligrams each piece it looks three nice and it has the graphic on the chocolate smells like chocolate no weed so we'll see what the taste is like and we'll tune back in and in about 30 minutes 45 minutes or whenever we hit the free night shelters by the way so here's the chocolate again we divide it into three pieces already I'm late one of these three pieces so let me be ingesting 75 milligrams it takes a lot like we so everyone like edibles that is like weed this wouldn't be the right edible for you like I said before you shouldn't be eating edibles if you don't like to take the weeds but yeah this tastes a lot like we listen in and like 30 to 45 minutes we'll be back see you guys later thank you so YouTube so I'm chillin as you can see I'm pretty stable the facts I would rate them like a 10 nah not it's not even 10 for the monitor well maybe a 10 yeah the time is it got me pretty good more like it was 50 wise very potent as you can see am i dead give away the fruits on here my boy Adam a chair sitting so I would recommend this like a 10 for beginners like a little square would be good maybe even half of that square for beginners intermediate it's like a square and a half and expert like Adams already would realize maybe six of the square is maybe pretty expensive in my opinion $18.00 but it will give you three doses 81 and okay hi so I rate this instead based on the amounts I ate not on not on us too high I experienced the pretty potent hires I'm saying for the mountain ight so I'm a pretty guy 135 pounds by 5 so 5 5 so pretty yeah just not dropped in the comments below which you want me to review next any edibles anything you want to read in a dropper in the comments below and I'll be glad to his real as soon as I can subscribe like my channel and I'll be back soon", "B-ENA-uSDTg": "hello my name is King silverback I hope you're having a fantastic day today is an incredibly beautiful day and today boy oh boy do I have something for you I'm really close but that's okay you know I'm saying it's okay to be close as long as you you know are respectful but if you're in person probably not but you know whatever so today I'm gonna be again speaking on something that I deal with every single day just about at a constant so I'm actually gonna go get a prop another prop for this video one second okay so my other prop for this video it's going to be this right here this is CBD oil right here and a teacher don't worry about my nails I'm about to cut them today I promise because I sometimes I forget like I don't look at my nails every single day I don't know if that's a normal thing I just don't look at and especially because I wash my hand soft and I don't they don't really catch my eye because if you don't wash your hands often then yeah okay just straight up if you see people with dirty fingernails that means that they don't wash their hands very often that also means that they probably don't drink enough water and if they do drink a lot of water and their hands are dirty that's nasty because you know they ain't washed in their hands cuz I wash my hands a lot I'm not gonna show my nails but they're the color they're supposed to be basically I'm sorry that's beside the point but this is CBD oil right here in a container that's how most people may be used to it some people I don't have that other thing some people may be used to like a vape pen thing that people use or a they actually have CBD joints at the CBD shop that I I frequent but today we went in my sister and I and we got something else there but you know whoa that was some gas for my tummy but like for my side tummy I don't know it's weird but it's not my business tell what was gotten but something was gotten and something was gotten for and that is this right here that's why I like CBD shops because they just have good or I'll do it I'll do it like this so my nails aren't you know creeping people out this is what it looks like this is what is called this is CBD chocolate bar is dark chocolate which in this case actually does mean that it's vegan and what I really really like about this is believe there's only five ingredients so there's sugar chocolate liquor which is cocoa mass I don't know what mass means but yeah I looked at every single one of these ingredients up specific and then cannabidiol cocoa butter and soy legend which both of those are vegan and then vanilla vanilla vegan so what I can say is this is wait but it has cholesterol in it that's what's weird wait why would this have cholesterol in it okay so I guess the dark chocolate or the chocolate liqueur is where the cholesterol is from I had no idea that chocolate had or like dark chocolate had that in it but literally all this is is sugar chocolate liquor cannabidiol which is I'm sorry I'm saying that wrong can I bid to you all I figured how they say it they say weird because I saw it on like a or I heard it said correctly whatever but cocoa butter soy legend and then vanilla which all those things are vegan that's all I was confused when I saw the yeah I was weird so this is at least plant-based I'm reading all this and I've looked up all the ingredients so I don't really know but this is vegans but her plant-based I should say plant-based because there's nothing on here saying that it wasn't okay now I'm confused because it says kosher dairy on it okay now I need to figure out what this is I'm so tired of things like this it's like why not just say on there this is vegan this is not vegan but then it says kosher dairy there's no dairy in this oh well I got it for free so I'm gonna keep looking this up because this is weird okay so I looked it up as far as I know this is vegan I've had I believe I've had products before I'm sorry I believe this is plant-based I have had products before where it says kosher dairy on it when there's literally no dairy in it at all like if you I'm showing the the I don't know if you can see it very well but the ingredients are literally right there there's no dairy but then it has the kosher dairy thing right here so I I I downloaded an app to see if it was vegan and they've never heard of it so they didn't say it was vegan but as far as I know it is vegan there's no reason it wouldn't be with these ingredients sometimes it angers me because it's like is it or is it not and in this case I'm going to assume that it is plant-based because I did look at the all the other ones the other ones that they have and they had them at the store at the CBD shop that was that they all have milk in them all those had milk in them that make sense because there one was milk chocolate and the other one was white chocolate that this is dark chocolate very very rarely does dark chocolate have any milk in it any animal milk in it of any sort so and I smelled it as well and it didn't smell and I can't really remember what non-vegan so smell like so I'm gonna try this if it doesn't taste vegan I'm going to just spit it out and move on from that because this was free I didn't buy it because I don't buy things that aren't that I'm not a hundred percent sure aren't vegan like even like my dad will ask me to go get something for my mom or him and I'm not gonna pay for it if it's not vegan so that's that's just me I don't I don't actually pay for anything that's not vegan so you know that's me though this sort of looks like each of these squares is supposedly it's what the lady said 15 milligrams of CBD oil or 50 milligrams of CBD now what's interesting about that is this it's $55 okay for $55 each time you fill up an entire I'll pull it out and kind of show it a little bit better each come on there we go wait do I get it there we go okay each time you fill up an entire one of these things right here wait to that pour over the side now okay each one of these things that you fill up it's 16 milligrams of CBD oil okay this whole entire container contains 500 milligrams of CBD oil okay you understand that right now if you multiply 50 by 8 what are you going to get 100 200 300 400 400 milligrams of CBD oil or CBD whatever for $6.99 in 55 dollars that's not how that works my friend that's not how logic works that it's not how anything works it doesn't make any sense something on my sister got today was 450 milligrams of CBD and guess what it was $12.99 so this was free so I it's it's incredible to me makes sense my dad was kind of like well yeah this is gonna last you a lot longer than this is because you know this isn't gonna last you a month and now they say well I don't know I've had it for three or four days and you can't really tell but I've used a lot of it but it's crazy how much I've used and how like I've used it for the past so it's about Sunday or Monday something like that yeah so I'm just gonna try this right now I'm gonna break off piece of it and see how that works and let's see what it what it tastes like and we're gonna see if it works because as of right now I'm not like really really anxious or anything I'm actually probably the calmest I've been all day let's see it smells weird this is tiny look how tiny that thing is that has a taste to it it tastes like all the dark chocolate that I've ever had it actually doesn't taste as good as a dark chocolate that I have but and I'm comparing it to the Trader Joe's one yeah that's interesting so what I'm gonna do with this is I'm gonna just continue doing what I'm doing come back talk about it if it you know works very well and I'm very calm I'll talk about it um excuse me the help that was inside that I was talking and then it happened you know whatever but regardless excuse me for that but was what was interesting is so I'm vegan and everything but the woman said that people buy this for their children all the time so they'll give their children this piece of chocolate that doesn't taste very good tastes ok but it has that that heavy heavy marijuana taste to it now I've never had marijuana before but I've smelled it before that's what it smells like and when your smell is similar to your taste that was so weird sorry but with the smell similar to the taste I presume so when I taste it that's what I smell when I smelled it before because I don't I don't do any drugs or anything like that and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that but this is CBD and what is it derived from so obviously it's gonna add that smell to it and yeah if they say they give it to their the lady there was saying that they give it to their kids and she gave this to me for free because when I told her that this 500 milligrams wasn't strong enough for me she was I oh ok and then gave me the chocolate to see how that works so because she said it one time or that she basically was saying that just about everybody that comes in with anxiety says that the 500 milligrams works for him so if I didn't already say it I learned that they have a 2,000 milligram one of the CBD oil that I do like cuz I like this kind I may try others in the future but probably not this one's vegan this one actually is V and it has the no animal tested or it's not been tested on animals but you can read all that yeah it's not been tested on animals or anything like that and that's what you want with this kind of stuff and yeah so that's basically how that is I'll be back if when this kicks in or if it's already kicked in I don't really now horrible taste has been left in my mouth I'm not a fan of the taste but uh yeah we'll see yeah it's all for now I'll be back in just a second this CBD oil stuff does work it's all about getting the right one for you because like as I was saying this is 500 milligrams and the lady was like this just about works for everybody that comes in here saying that they have anxiety and it works but I need to take a lot more of it if I want it to work work so yeah that's my experience it's my opinion of this stuff and yeah I definitely definitely would say that I recommend this I can't say that it's vegan because I'm not a hundred percent sure about 98 percent sure even though it has the kosher dairy on the back of it yeah it doesn't taste not vegan it tastes like all the vegan chocolate that I've had over the past year and a half two years or whatever so yeah that's all I'm gonna say but yeah that's all for this video hope you enjoyed my name is King silverback hope you have a fantastic day and I'll see you later", "Vsgsh5emN3U": "[Music] where have I been for years now it's been three years since our latest food review let's do another one here right now by popular demand I've had so many people over the past couple years Sam God man what are you bringing back the food review and the answer is right now item number one today this is the new Red Bull coconut can you see that Red Bull coconut berry is actually what it's called the Red Bull Company founded in 1987 in Australia and they are the leaders in the energy drink sector they sell around seven million cans of Red Bull every year and so without further ado let's crack her open I love coconut been to the Caribbean a number of times it's one of my favorite flavors of anything and so I'm really excited to try this definitely has a smell of coconut when you open up the can that aroma just smells delicious let me give a little nutritional content here 110 calories per small can so really that's not that bad 200 check this up 280 percent of your recommended daily intake of vitamin b6 sounds good to me here we go Cheers Red Bull I got one thing to say to you where's the coconut like it tastes Albury I don't even think I taste coconut in there it smells like coconut but I sure can't taste it it's Albury redbull coconut berry me item number two here it is brand new in Canada it is the new coffee crisp thins why why do they do this I have no idea 180 calories sorry hundred and ninety calories per 36 gram bar but unlike the regular coffee crisp it is thin let's try it out check it out oh so it comes in it comes in four all right so it comes in four let's try them up Cheers [Music] mmm it's okay again I don't get the point copy crisp is one of the best selling candy bars in all of Canada they sell a ton of them and there's a number different kinds of them they've got macchiato and they've got like what are some of the other flavors the coffee really there's a lot of them anyway this one it's okay this just like coffee Chris no reason to rush up and get

excited cannabis infused chocolate i've never had mazapan no idea what this is going to taste like it says it's white chocolate it's in a beautiful packaging we had the other chocolates from them and la familia they were all delicious um this product it says literally producto they lost so i'm excited i've had martha pam which is something similar right yeah something similar in europe but i've never had the latin version of it so i'll read the box you dive into the actual what it looks like here okay so serving size one piece there's 10 servings total fat 27 grams sodium 10 milligrams total carb 73 and sugar 60 grams so there's a lot of sugar in this roughly six grams of bar the ingredients are though sugar palm kernel and palm oils peanuts whey non-fat milk titanium dioxide color sunflower lesser than natural flavor vanilla and cannabis extract it does contain peanuts and milk it smells like sweet white chocolate i'm pretty i'm excited there is a 101.32 milligrams of total

a really well branded package a super good quote we're going to do a one byte review talk about it cheers two bytes score out of ten it's white chocolate and you know what i hate white chocolate i despise it no you don't like milk chocolate i don't like white chocolate i just like dark chocolate but this is good when i think of a flavor-wise it's smooth it's not too sweet it's like a little nutty i get a nutty white chocolate flavor the packaging and the experience is wonderful in regards to this whole how it's done i love the color scheme and it tastes delicious really good for holidays yeah it's coming up yeah yeah yeah i need another piece gift idea for me i'm thinking okay i would even melt this yeah same you just melt melted over or something super fire i don't want to stop eating it but i need to because that'll come to sleep let's go out of town this is easy for me 9.8 and that's only because i i really hate white chocolate but this is decent to me if this was made with milk chocolate i'd love i'd give it a ten because that's my favorite like hershey's more chocolate hershey's gonna talk about this would be delicious dark chocolate for me but this this being white chocolate and like how it says la familia on the actual chocolate bar i'm loving it i think if you like white chocolate this is a perfect 10 score you will love it i think for someone that doesn't like chocolate or white chocolate as much maybe dock them because you don't personally like it as much but i'm going to give it i'm going to give it a 10 out of 10. i'm going to go i'm going

peace", "uw5HBXBA7jE": "[Music] hi guys welcome to week two the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our third look at chill the highest chocolate medical cannabis this time we are taking a look at their cookie jar what I assume can only be white chocolate and cookies and cream perhaps as I said this is a hundred and eighty milligram edible and our third time reviewing them in the past twice I have found them to be good if not great they're really good for an edible but not the best chocolate out there as I've had in the past they're equivalent to about a bang bar but not quite as good as say a kiva or a default say or I'm trying to think of some other of those great great brands but it is still a good good product and a pretty decent value at my dispensary only comes out to about 17 dollars for the 180 milligrams which is a very good deal for Long Beach so I always have trouble opening the package oh but I think I got it just fine this time and yes it is it is cookies and cream guys a little bit more comfortable for everyone they're a little less sexy sorry ladies or men or men or freaks of nature so here we go here is our cookies and cream bar with our little chill logo and weed on it looks exactly like a Hershey's cookies and cream bar break off a couple squares there give it a taste hmm-hmm-hmm guys I'm pretty sure you know how this is gonna taste it's gonna taste like an okay cookies and cream bar with this like cannabis taste and that's exactly what it tastes like not good I mean not not terrible bordering on good even but just not as good as some of the best tasting chocolate or cannabis chocolate out there but more than serviceable and certainly far from gross so in terms of taste us I'm not even a white chocolate fan but I actually like the cookies and cream this might be my favorite tasting of the chill products I've tried so far but for the most important part which again is not the taste it's about how it makes you feel for that guys you're gonna have to wait a couple of seconds and I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two and a half hours or so on my way to go see I love dogs which I'm very excited about and as soon as look I said dogs and one popped up um and as soon as I get out of that movie I'm gonna come back to you guys and let you know exactly how I'm feeling so thank you for watching weeds guys and I will see you in just a bit peace welcome back to weeds it's been two hours 45 minutes since I last checked in with you and I am pleased to report that chill white chocolate excuse me chill the highest chocolate cookie jar white chocolate is my favorite of the chilled products both in terms of taste and I think maybe this one ended up being slightly more potent than the others if so just by a matter of degrees it could just be a stronger badge but I ended up liking it quite a bit so this is my favorite of the of the chilled brand so far but I think that's going to conclude our chill reviews as this is our third one we kind of know exactly where they fall on the spectrum at this point if you see them at your dispensary and they don't have the best of the best they don't have Kiva they don't have ponse Chile's chose a great product you're not gonna be disappointed with it but it's of course not the zenith of the chocolate tier um but before I guy go guys that's what I want to say that I want to share with you my little cherry on top something that isn't necessarily weed related but something that can be enjoyed with or without marijuana and that is the movie I just got out of and that is Wes Anderson's new movie I love dogs and it is so wonderful it is the most visually stunning movie I have seen since Kubo and the two strings it's probably my favorite Wes Anderson movie since the fantastic mr. Fox and I love the grand Budapest hotel it's just it's a it's a wonderful wonderful movie it is just a incredible story that they tell just a really really novel creative story highly highly recommended I saw it under the influence of chill if you happen to have a chill bar beforehand I think you'll enjoy it even more so guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on weeks thank you so much for watching and we will see you on the next review peace", "Tz8jDIPJvd4": "hey guys it's Tammy and guess what I am bringing you a dessert but I like when you're doing keto there are tons of desserts out there and of course you get chocolate cravings up the wazoo but I'm lazy I can't do a 20 ingredient keto friendly dessert I'm not a baker I don't know if you guys remember those cookie sheets that came out and said you can't burn your cookies on this cookie sheet well I do so I love this recipe that I'm about to bring to you um it is chocolate-covered macadamia nuts now you can use any kind of nuts you want for this I like macadamia nuts and piquant um what it is it's 100% cacao it's four squares and two tablespoons of butter it is two tablespoons of a swerve what you do is you melt it into a bowl you can use the microwave if you want to um yeah me and the microwave don't get along with melting chocolate um I tend to burn chocolate I'm not a baker you guys I am NOT I am NOT a baker but man you give me protein and some vegetables and whoa I can whip me up a recipe like no tomorrow so it's really easy I just have water in the bottom of this pan I have all the ingredients in a glass bowl and I just wait till it's melted and when the chocolate is melted the butters melted the sugar the baked sugar is melted you take your macadamia nuts now I got these have women's these are life like $3.59 per package there's three and a half servings in each bag so I got two bags and - and use my teeth but I look and what you want to do is you want to dump it into the chocolate let's turn the burner off here dump it into the chocolate I'll use the scissors for this one dump it in mix it around so that way all the macadamia nuts are covered Oh God and you want to mix and you want to get all that chocolate on those nuts let me tell you mm-hmm oh so good oh good and what you want to do is you want to take a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper okay now if you're at all mixed you want a spoon and you want to spoon it onto that / - hey / now if you want you can spread out each individual macadamia nut or you can leave it in clumps if you want - you got to remember there are seven serving sizes in this so you want you want to divvy it up seven serving size or seven servings of this what you want to do is you want to put it all on the parchment paper and oh my god these are so good you guys you don't even know now if you want to I have to watch my sodium so I do not put any salt on these but you can if you want to just sprinkle some pink Himalayan salt on there so that way you have that nice you know salty chocolate thing going on make sure you get all that chocolate covered on them nuts put it on there yummy clusters or individual if you want to Oh you know and it's it's nice that I'm Kido you don't have to deprive yourself of chocolate there are other alternatives out there so now that we got this we want to pop this in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes to let the chocolate set and through the power of video I'll check you out in a bit so after they were in the freezer for 10-15 minutes boom you got yourself a nice sweet treat I will talk with you guys later I hope you guys enjoy this mmm these are so good", "tiyFM_7aHm8": "[Music] do do [Music] you", "ORCdvawQ69w": "but now I hope

pleasant to eat I'm sorry [ __ ] it's so [ __ ] sugary like halfway there it's all in my teeth gonna be tasting this [ __ ] for like an hour bought some blackberry Kush mostly endicott [ __ ] within because if you guys ever wondering if I have like a strain preference I mean I guess it's based on whatever I want to do like if I had like a whole day planned out where I wanted to get stoned but I had to go do things I'd pick a sativa but what the [ __ ] but most of the time I smoked to relax so I do enjoy like in the car better more often doesn't taste like weed at all that's not what I mean when I say it tastes bad it's just so [ __ ] sweet it's like early [ __ ] I took a shot of whiskey like it was like a little bit of whiskey and like a glass of my my throat's been like getting sore if you ever like feel like your throats getting sore and you take like a shot of alcohol or something for like an hour I'll just start to feel better but so I have that like sitting in my stomach a little bit and it's [ __ ] tangent well I'm sorry I from choosing if I'm chewing my mouth or talking on my mouth shooting with my mouth open I might already be stoned I don't even know fully last little bite here the video and see how this 400 milligram edible hits me etc ear actually I miss that but I guess it's supposed to work in 60 minutes I don't think that's a hundred percent if that's not represent accurate everybody obviously everyone's metabolism is [ __ ] different through it you'll make it hopefully I'm making it I'll check that few guys in a little bit all right so checking

like I want to have either like a few 500 milligram edible doses all at once I'm just see what that's like because I really want to see if y'all got if you all remember my own the first time I ever took edibles story - it was crazy we don't really know what the dosing was but there's a slight chance there might have also been acid in it which if you eat that with edibles just makes it like way more I'm trying to think of the word like it just enhances the effects of like both highs I think and but yeah I know I want to see if that was like if that was the case or if that feeling is like 1500 milligrams worth of edibles because if it is I'm trying to [ __ ] get there - yeah that was such it was a good day but it was like a terrible day at the same time cuz like I wasn't expecting it is there I don't know there were times I was like worried there's a long [ __ ] story you guys should go back and watch that video if you haven't thought was a [ __ ] it was a banger oh [ __ ] well

everybody it's me shutter Scott and welcome back to Baker madness it is Munchie Monday and so you know what that means it means that I've gone out to my dispensary I picked up some edibles that are infused with cannabis that are industry available professional I suppose not homemade because that's what we're here to do today today I picked up Thank You Rex I picked up a little bag of saints and sinners and eaten most of this bag that's why the top is opened up I just want to talk about our package today some of our packaging sometimes they try to save money wherever they can these companies so the saints and sinners these are real generic white bag this back piece is just a sticker it has all of their flavors on here and the ingredients the front also is just a sticker it's just a sticker so they can put them on the ones and on this one you'll see that we have a hundred milligrams of THC new formula they saved this bag the candies inside are 10 ml are 100 milligrams of THC 10 milligrams each and then they've where they put new formula is actually a sticker over 10 milligrams of CBD so these were originally what they call a one-to-one which is same parts THC to CBD but if you remember that I talked to you last week the more CBD that you take with your THC can lower the high or the psychoactive effect that's because the CBD attaches itself to the same receptors that THC uses so and THC can't go can't bind to a receptor that has CBD vice versa and let's talk about this not for kids stick or two there is a poison controlled number on here so it's not just not for kids but if you if you have a bad trip you can McCallum they'll tell you what to do which is gonna be lie down try to sleep have something to eat to have something to drink to this day yet no one has died as a direct result of cannabis there is no overdosing on cannabis you might feel weird you might feel like you're gonna die you might feel like you're gonna have to lie down I know for me when I get overloaded I get crazy inside I get real jittery and it's like it's kind of like having too much caffeine and here's what our candy looks like also these saints and sinners have decided to label the actual candy itself marijuana marijuana marijuana not for kids not for kids not for kids which is you know I mean it's okay but it really cuts into you discreetly get getting rid of these baggies you know you'd find these little baggies are you kidding me right now okay okay when I went rinsed it off this is the strawberry saints and sinners this is a pebbles this is my favorite candy this is a runner-up strawberry [Music] it's really good oh my god the strawberry sub it's so juicy much so juicing well alright well I saved two saints and sinners I do like the name the flavors really good you have the second one [Applause] well that's two down now set your timers and I'll see you in a couple hours let you know how I feel hi everybody we are back it's been a couple of hours and I'd say that they worked pretty good pretty good I'm not gonna complain about it I wanted to cover off on a couple of things that's good for me it's good for you and good for the companies that make these candies and these edible products first of all the name of this company is called evergreen herbal you can reach them on the web at their website at for evergreen herbal calm for evergreen herbal calm as I spell that our ingredients today are granulated sugar citric acid corn syrup coconut oil cannabis oil artificial color and artificial flavor that's not great although they are using neem oil for our pesticide which is nice 27 calories per candy seven point five grams of sugar I'm gonna tell you that these candies are pretty good I'm gonna give them on a scale of ten for flavor I give them an 8 a seven seven and a half let's give him a set of and a half for flavor and for efficacy [Music] let me give them a six they are not as potent as some of the other ones that I've had and I know that it seems strange that everything is supposed to have 10 milligrams of THC but you can't control the quality of the THC that is in the product so I don't know what they're using they don't tell me what strain they're using probably many but if you know this bag of candies compared to some other bags of candy this was only $12 pebbles run at 15 some of the other candies are going as high as you know sometimes $30 for 10 candies so for price I'm giving them eight for efficacy and giving them a six and for flavor at seven and a half so these are worth it get some lets see you next time oh but wait I had mentioned that we were gonna make some actual food I'm gonna start my Baker madness back at it so I've been sent some recipes by some of you guys which is really great I'm gonna I've got a I've got three people send me the same banana recipe so I'm gonna do that one so if you sent me the banana bread recipe we're gonna do that and I'm also I think the next thing I'm going to do is infused candied bacon not everybody can get candies at a dispensary I would say that almost everybody out there can find cannabis flower somewhere so we'll talk about that in the weeks coming up I love you guys thanks for tuning in and we'll see you next time on Baker madness [Music]", "WUaSrjjG1Gw": "a review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another product from the fine fine folks at G Pharma labs and their liquid gold bars this time we are reviewing their 210 milligram ultimate milk chocolate bar this will be the third or fourth liquid gold product we've reviewed in the past I've enjoyed all of their bars both in terms of taste and potency they're never quite as good as like a kiva bar or maybe like duffel se but they are a good chocolate there's a little bit of cannabis taste to all the ones in the past but it's good quality chocolate and it always gets me nice and high this cost 15 bucks in my dispensary but I got a discount for two for 25 which is actually a pretty good deal 1250 for a 210 milligram chocolate bar that's a good deal you can't find much better than that so if you guys have never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work are pretty simple I'm gonna eat this chocolate bar it's not necessarily the whole thing in front of you but I'm gonna eat this chocolate bar up and then I'll actually come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review process so right behind me here guys is beautiful beautiful Long Beach I'm up here in Signal Hill California Long Beach I was gonna try to get some nice drone footage for you but apparently this is a no-fly zone according to the FAA and I can't fly my drone right beautiful aerial shots so bummer you guys are just gonna have to look at me face to face sorry I know that say so here we go we've got our bar here in hand opening up this foil maybe you know you would think after all of these reviews I would be an expert and opening up packaging but I still still suck at it all righty here we go here is our liquid gold bar six different pieces you can see the name written on it they're a liquid gold liquid gold liquid gold break1 off of this ultimate milk chocolate and give it a taste hmm well let's eat chocolate a little bit of a cannabis taste good again you're not gonna hate it the quality of chocolate really helps match that cannabis flavor it's not it's not huge it's just not as good it's like a keep a bar or some of the premier high-end chocolates um but it is good and guys in terms of taste just fine the most important thing though is how it's gonna make me feel for that guys you have to wait a couple of seconds me two hours and I'll come back to you guys and let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you guys in just a bit two hours later welcome back to weed skies it has been two hours since I have enjoyed the liquid gold bar 210 milligrams ultimate milk chocolate seductive I don't know what makes it ultimate I'm guessing they don't have a regular milk chocolate doesn't matter just a solid product guys I mean just a damn solid product it's a good value it's good workhorse edible I have no problem recommending it you know it's um if you find it for like 15 bucks you're not gonna be disappointed with it you're gonna get nice and high you're not gonna hate the taste you know it's a good solid workhorse edible I've really enjoyed all the liquid gold I've reviewed I might do one more just to make sure but at this point it's pretty pretty pretty apparent that these guys know what they're doing and that you can grab a liquid gold bar and feel pretty satisfied with it so the ultimate milk chocolate you know which one's my favorite I don't know you know it's really there yeah they are all the chocolates pretty much consistent it's whatever flavor you think we would like the best from their lineup grab it grab it and go liquid gold as I said I might review one more maybe somewhere down the line but for now I think we're pretty consistent we know these guys know how to make a chocolate bar I would say I'm at a solid 7 right now somewhere right there so again I've only paid 1250 for this to 425 and that I mean it's just a good deal it's a good deal it's a good chocolate bar it's again a good it's not it's not the best that it's neither the best value and were the best tasting the edible out there but it's on the you know upper echelon its above average in in in each and in each realm so it's just a really good value I like it a lot that's the liquid gold bar ultimate milk chocolate 210 milligrams of THC I'm a fan of their stuff I'm a fan of their their chocolate bars been rambling enough thank you so much for watching wheats guys if you would do me a favor if you liked this video uh you know give me one of those little thumb yuppies subscribe if you haven't already and you know follow me on Twitter a tweets reviews and give me a like on the old Facebook also a tweets reviews that would that would help a lot thank you so much for watching wheats guys and we will check you out on a later review peace there's okay bye I see a lot of like farewells and goodbyes before I actually leave you but this time I really am gone see", "WY9-IUxck8g": "hello, my friends, it's Dani and today\nI'm showing you how to make my clean and delicious lemon bars these lemon bars\nhave a biscuit like whole-wheat crust with a light bright lemon curd over the\ntop which is firm and creamy it's the perfect consistency they're so good and\nthey're so easy to make Margo first I'd like to take a moment to thank Bob's Red\nMill for partnering with me on this video for over three decades Bob's has\nbeen committed to providing people everywhere with the best quality foods\navailable and helping their customers live a healthier life through better\nnutrition they have one of the largest lines of organic whole-grain foods in\nthe country all of their products are certified Kosher and made from\ningredients grown from non-gmo seeds I am a huge fan of Bob's I've been using\ntheir products for years I highly recommend them and if you guys want to\nlearn more about them or check out any of their ingredients I will leave a link\ndown in the description box below so to get started I've got my oven preheating\nat 350 degrees Fahrenheit and I'm gonna start by making my crust so I've got a\nnice big bowl and the first thing going in is 3/4 of a cup of Bob's stone ground\nwhole wheat flour now unlike refined flours Bob's whole wheat flour includes\nthe wheat germ the brand and the endosperm so it still contains all of\nits nutrients plus it's a great source of fiber and it has 6 grams of protein\nper serving then I have 1/3 of a cup coconut oil 1/4 cup maple syrup and a\nquarter teaspoon of kosher salt then I'm just gonna begin to gently mix this all\ntogether now I really love the whole wheat flour for the crust but if you\nwant a texture that was a little bit lighter then I would recommend doing\nhalf of Bob's stone ground whole wheat flour and half of their fine pastry\nflour that will get you a texture that's a little bit layer both completely\ndelicious but as always you've got options\nonce your batter looks just like this it's gonna be thick and a little bit\nshiny you want to transfer it into an 8x8 ceramic baking dish that's lined\nwith some parchment paper this just makes it a lot easier to get the bar\nout of the dish once they're done cooking now the parchment paper doesn't\njust lay there so what you have to do is you just need to kind of hold it in\nplace get the dough into the center just like this and then use your hands to\nstart to Pat the dough down getting it as flat and even as you can\nremembering to get it along the sides and into the corners as well don't get\nfanatic about it it doesn't need to be perfect as a matter of fact I find when\nit doesn't look perfect it gives it a little bit of a rustic homemade made\nwith love kind of feel so just have some fun with it\nonce you've got the dough in the pan just the way you want it pop it into\nyour oven for 20 minutes or until it's fragrant lightly browned and set through\nthen I'm just gonna let that cool on the counter while I make the filling so I've\ngot 6 eggs in a nice large bowl into that I'm gonna be adding the zest from\none large lemon which is about 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon of lemon zest\nthen I have half a cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice 1/3 cup of honey 1/4\nteaspoon of kosher salt that's just gonna make all the flavors pop and 4\nteaspoons of coconut flour now the coconut flour helps to thicken up the\ncurd just a little bit so we get that creamy firm texture if you didn't have\nthe coconut flour you could also sub in some arrowroot or some tapioca flour all\nof these ingredients Bob's also carries so if you want to check them out the\nlink will be down in the description box below then I like to mix this using a\nhand mixer so you're just gonna get it low and slow get everything going and\nonce you see all of the ingredients come together you are on your way now do know\nthat the filling is gonna look very loose you're gonna think that it's too\nliquidy but it's not this is exactly the way it's supposed to be so when it's all\ndone and it's all mixed together this is the consistency you're looking for and\nthen you'll see that it thickens up as it cooks so I'm gonna take the lemon\nmixture pour it over my cooled crust so then I'm gonna just pop this pan back\ninto that 350 degree oven for 30 minutes or until it's set through with a little\njiggle you don't want it to be loose in the middle but you're gonna see that it\nstill has a little jiggle to it then it comes out of the oven and you got to let\nthis cool on the counter it's completely cooled so I usually let\nit sit on the counter for about an hour then I transfer it into the refrigerator\nwhere it sits for another 4 hours or until it's totally chilled that's when\nyou know your lemon bars are done and ready to go from here you want to use a\nnice sharp knife to cut it into 16 squares and then I like to give it a\nlittle sprinkle of powdered sugar right over the top it's just so pretty and it\nreally brings the lemon bars to life now if you weren't planning on eating them\nright away they would last in your fridge covered tightly with some plastic\nwrap up to three days and now for my friends who want these for the longer\nhaul if you wanted to make these ahead of time they also freeze really well so\nyou can make the bars and then either freeze it\nin one big square or cut them into squares ahead of time and freeze them\nindividually these lemon bars would be perfect for any time you're wanting a\nclean and delicious bright sweet bite mmm Marlo that sweet creamy bright lemon\ncurd with the Hardy holy crust is the perfect combination they play off each\nother so well I cannot wait for y'all to give this recipe a try and when you do\ndon't forget to snap a picture and tag me on instagram and on facebook so i can\nsee all of the clean and deliciousness you're whipping up in your very own\nkitchens thank you once again to Bob's Red Mill for partnering with me on this\nvideo if you guys want to learn more about them or check any of their\nproducts out I've got a link for you down in the description box below thank\nyou all so much for watching I'm Danny's fees and I'll see you back here next\ntime with some more clean and deliciousness Cheers you", "MZrK0P33TWI": "what does Arkana fam and welcome back to another product review video just for you guys so check it out for this video right here I have some more edibles alright so these are the drops these are lime drops and these are 50 milligrams of THC each I got two of them so we got 100 milligrams total which I already know I already know some of you me be viewing this like hundred grams as [ __ ] that's just done a lot that's weak sauce yeah okay I agree with you but really quick just to let everybody know 50 grams is the limit here on our edibles in the state of Oregon okay so if your recreational 21 and up you have a limit of 50 milligrams now you can buy multiple you can buy you know five six seven of these you know what I mean but you're still limited to 50 milligrams and it's kind of rather expensive to be honest for just 50 okay I mean these were like 6 or 7 bucks a box for just 50 milligrams you know what I mean so you can see how that kind of adds up alright but anyway so these are a lime jelly okay both of these are a lime jelly and I believe they're just bite size let's see here a point or 0.8 percent or whatever 0.8 grams percent grams of sugar and no fats no no cool all right lime essential oil oil and cannabis extract and cannabis deprived terpenes okay okay this is balanced okay so right here let's see if I can show you guys this better right there they tell you the so if you just take one of those little slivers out of this that's five milligrams so if you're trying to dose yourself out they got a little dosage chart right there as soon as you open it up so you can get ten servings you can cut out of this five milligrams each serving okay for a total of 50 milligrams all right I don't know why I keep saying balanced on there it says balanced balanced like what the [ __ ] okay great you're balanced I'm not at least I'll try not to be here we go [Music] [Music] super line like super lime like holy [ __ ] that is a rush of lime flavor it's very nice it's got this covered in sugar so the code of sugar really adds to it it tastes great it nice and soft it's not like a hard gummy I like it this is a vegan product it does say vegan right there so if you are somebody that is vegan this is going to work perfect for you okay [Music] hmm you kind of get that taste of cannabis right there at the end the aftertaste you can you definitely taste a little smidgen of weed in there but overall it's got a nice flavor it tastes really good it tastes just like a candy I mean it tastes like a lime gummy candy and it's really good it's not bad um I actually like this product I actually like it I'll give it a thumbs up I give it a definite thumbs up I would definitely recommend it and the reason I recommend it is because you here in Oregon since it's 50 milligrams for each meaning if you want more you got to buy more so when you're buying more if you're buying ones that are like huge chunks of candy or huge chunks of chocolate or whatever the [ __ ] that's a lot of sugar that you have to [ __ ] intake just to get the milligrams that you need okay or what that's crazy okay I'm not trying to be diabetic so the fact that it's bite-sized the fact that it's just one little quick all right and I got my full 50 milligrams that's awesome I love that alright so let me know about your guys's opinions on the drop here let me I dropped it let me pick up the drop on the drop alright drops cannabis jellies that's that's the name of this company be sure to check out the drops cannabis jellies if you've ever had this product let me know your thoughts and opinions in the comment section below if you like this

show where we review edibles and help you make sense of your dispensary showing you which animals are worth your hard-earned dollars today we're looking at a new brand TK over edibles there are 200 milligram Bharani they proclaim it to be an award winner but don't tell us what award day one say award-winning best edible right there on the package no ingredients and no nutrition information very small brownie square tiny little thing very basic packaging so TKOs and they call it that because they sing it's going to knock me out but TV sends for technical so that is a very boring looking square ass browning smells like weed has a pretty high we'd smell or a pretty potent D weed smell I'm not optimistic to tell you the truth this nothing about the screams this is gonna be a good one it smells bad looks funky it's kind of hard but I'm willing to the doubt and it was affordable this was seven dollars at my dispensary for a what they say is a 200 milligram edibles so we shall see but let's give a taste no wait okay not good not good aroma yuck it's no koruba salted caramel or brownie but in this case guys looks we're not to see them it looks it tastes as bad as it looked there's a lot like weed there's a pretty great flavor very dry kind of stale taste in people it's not very big so yeah okay pepin back up here I have got to polish this off which is something I'm not looking forward to once I polish this bad boy off that's customary with our weeks many reviews I will come back to you guys in two hours and let you know how we're feeling and let's cross our fingers that work feeling pretty good because otherwise man I go in through some nasty food for no reason okay well with that I will see you guys in two hours and wish me luck I hope hope his ropes see you then hi guys I am back it has been 2 hours since I had the TK hoe edibles award-winner brownie and I gotta say it has been a pleasant surprise pleasant surprise it tasted pretty awful admittedly and while not quite a TKO it still packs a pretty good punch for a 200 milligram edible I'm pretty high right now I was not expecting this so maybe the awful taste was due to its onion advertised potency potent delicious every time is their catchphrase I can tell you at least one of those is true and at least one of those is false the third one I don't know so with that being said if you see a TKO edibles brownie in the dispensary near you it's affordable this cost me seven bucks and as long as you are not particular about taste as long as you are okay with the foul tasting edible give it a shot it's a potent edible for a fair price but if you're really really conscious about a flavor that's gonna be a hard pass so that's it for this review of weeks we will check you guys out on the next episode and thank you so much for watching", "XxaalOYGIqc": "what's up guys this is Sarah cows from dhf DNS comm and today I'm gonna show you guys how to make my tiramisu protein oatmeal it only takes a few minutes so let's get to it take out a microwavable safe Bowl and the first ingredient you're gonna add in is 1/2 a cup or 40 grams of rolled oats 1/2 a cup or 4 ounces of unsweetened vanilla coconut milk if you don't like or can't find coconut milk you could use regular milk or any other milk substitute and then 1 ounce of water go ahead and microwave your oatmeal for around 2 minutes the most important part of this recipe is to make sure you add in the rest of your ingredients while your oatmeal is so hot starting with 1/4 TSP of butter extract and then 1/2 a teaspoon of rum extract 1/2 a teaspoon of ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon of instant coffee the coffee's gonna give it some flavor and you a boost as well since every teaspoon of instant coffee usually has around 75 to 100 milligrams of caffeine in it one scoop or 30 grams of chocolate protein powder 1 tablespoon or 5 grams of cocoa powder and then half a container which is 2.6 5 ounces or 75 grams of any coffee or mocha fat-free Greek yogurt you can find I'm using a caramel macchiato one mix everything together this is optional but I like to top mine with the other half of the Greek yogurt we didn't use and then a little cocoa powder and there is your tiramisu protein oatmeal as you guys saw the whole meal is done so now I'm just gonna try it bite alright so if you guys didn't already know tiramisu is one of my favourite desserts ever it's probably one of the hardest flavors to replicate my opinion but this recipe is more on point then Michael Jordan was in his prime that's how good it is one quick tip if you throw it in the fridge for a bit it'll thicken up and taste even more like tiramisu as far as the calories go in the whole recipe there's 358 6 grams of fat 38 grams of carbs and 38 grams of protein alright guys I just want to thank you for watching if you like this recipe please go ahead and give me a thumbs up it motivates me to keep making these if you haven't already subscribed and you'd like to you can click right there on the screen coming up by subscribing you'll get email every week telling you at below to a new video comments or suggestions go down below I do try and respond to everybody thank you guys again for watching I got some oatmeal to finish stay healthy", "kGoQovjQWZ8": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are talking about one of my favorite brands again we are talking about punch bar punch bar key lime pie this time I've reviewed I believe three punch bar products in the past I've liked them all they're an impressive little package this cost me $12 the dispensary know we're thinking $12 for something so small but as the name suggests it does hit hard and it tastes pretty good too or the ones I have had in the past have I've not had the key lime pie before but I am looking forward to it and hoping it is just as good as the punch bars we have reviewed here on wheats in the past so we opened up we can see a little chart there telling you different 25 milligram breakdowns but of course we're going to ignore that and eat the whole thing and if you've never tuned in to weights before and you don't know how this works what I'm gonna do is I'm going to open this up eat this bad boy or at least a portion of it here in front of the camera for ya and then I'm gonna come back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the most important part of any edible review okay so the key lime pie is white chocolate which is not my favorite kind of chocolate but you know could still be good has a slightly donor and a lime motor for short you can smell both weed and lime break it apart there ignore all those 25 milligram little break ups you can see it's fancy little printing there this little fist printed right into the chocolate pretty cool just give it a taste that's interesting um not my favorite thing I've tasted from punch bar but it definitely tastes like white chocolate with a hint of lime in it um it's good nobody like my chocolate I do like one so it's uh it's okay oh and there is I take it back there is some actual like a cookie crunch in there as well for the philip for the crust of the pie it's a little bit but you guys pretty much you're gonna know exactly how this tastes imagine white chocolate with a slight lime taste and a slight cookie crunch and also a slight weed taste that's the fudge bar uh uh just trying it here is not the most important part and the most important part is what happens in two hours from now which is when I'm gonna come back to you guys to let you know how we're feeling and hopefully it'll be just like the other punch bars in the past and it'll hit pretty hard and we'll be singing their praises so guys I will see you in two hours to let you know if this punch bar continues on with the positive legacy thanks for watching well we hit the two-hour mark guys and I am pleased to tell you that the punch bar key lime pie does not disappoint it's just a star strong as its brethren love it love punch bar the only problem is they're a little expensive at my dispensary this warrants 12 bucks which probably is a value for a lot of you but for my dispensary runs a little high but it is uh again such a little a nice package it's so small you know for a small thing you would expect you to have a heavy weed taste there is a weak taste it's not overpowering but it's easy to transport easy to get down and it really does hit hard it does so man this might be the last punch bar I do of the 225 milligram variety they have a whole bunch of flavors I don't think I need to do them all for you guys but I even more happy to have done the ones that I have done so far uh yeah so guys punch bar gets the highest seal of approval from us here at wheats thank you so much for watching and we will check you out on the next review bye hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "uY2eXh4gwoo": "what's up everybody Cubans here and today we're gonna do an edible mukbang I'm like over 2,000 milligrams of THC edibles that we're gonna try to eat there's a lot of stuff there so I don't know if I'm gonna be able to make you through all of it but we're gonna eat a bunch of [ __ ] and see if we can get super [ __ ] high let's see what we got alright let's take a look at everything we got here this is definitely one of my most expensive videos edibles just cost a lot I just I don't get them so we've been collecting them for a while but there's a lot of variety here we have candy bars and drinks and cookies and there's caramel waffles in there there's capsules is achieve the chew in there I got sweet tarts more gummies I got the flask which I did in the drinks video that we're gonna probably put in the drink here peanut butter lollipops just more in gummies there's a lot of stuff here I'm definitely not gonna be able to eat all this but I'm gonna add up the doses as I go like her piece I'll calculate them just so we get an idea exactly how many milligrams they eat but this is gonna be fun I definitely should have got more capsules because that's that's my favorite way to get the milligrams in yeah let's let's start eating I hope God it's so much sugar alright let's [ __ ] get started I have the pine mango Suns a sativa I'm gonna pour it in the cup and I'm gonna try to give an accurate representation of how many milligrams we're consuming but this bottle is about half a Stu hundred milligrams so we're gonna say it's 100 let's add this flask I think so this is gonna be 150 here it's definitely more than half okay all right 150 milligrams so when I finish this that'll be 150 but I'm gonna be drinking that small time oh it's not bad all right let's get started here I don't want to eat anything all at once because I want to try to eat as much of it as I can and honestly I'm like my stomach is already hurting thinking about consuming all of this but this bars a thousand milligrams I believe it has ten pieces hundred milligrams per piece I'll just and as we go 100 and 200 they have a lot of candy bars Oh to this size and 200 milligrams and it's 10 milligrams per piece up that trip gonna take a long time let's go for dose get another another 400 milligrams here excuse me another 200 x-ray undertow that's another 100 400 total [Music] [Music] mint chocolate is really good but alright let's just try some of these gummies so these ones 500 milligrams there's 10 pieces so it's 50 per piece just get one of these that's 50 over at 450 maybe I'll that a month I'm gonna add 150 from this these wanna gummies are 20 milligrams per piece [Music] [Music] it's about the same size gummy but 20 milligrams the other ones are 50 I love 24/7 be 2190 I mean just for the walls you have this to round us out of 500 where 500 now oh my god [Music] how much [ __ ] sugar [Music] i'ma going trick-or-treating as a kid and then just having a [ __ ] bag full of candy for days like day five you're just like I [ __ ] hate candy bro what did I do oh this feels like days hmm we're at 500 I think I'm just gonna take knees alright and there's four capsules in here for 350 oh 175 for two [Music] washing it down will we've rings anyway I had another one 75 this is another this will make 350 total from the capsules put us at 850 yeah I definitely should have got more of the capsules stupid alright so at 8:50 oh god I'm gonna get some of this this koala bar gone I think it has like ten hundred milligram pieces like the other one I'm just gonna have a couple here [Music] I'll hold this up it's a little weird but it's four pieces here it's like missing one a little bit on the corner here it's got things on the corner here these are 100 milligrams each this bar is just a little higher but this is a you don't think that's four please well there's another 400 milligrams Oh God I [Music] won't good and I'm trying to save some for my girlfriend she really likes it but he's sick and I don't think I'm going you know this is so much so much sugar [Music] we're at twelve fifty milligrams down mo and samosa I'm done in the video and the most I personally ever done that I can recall was like 1750 and the reason is I just I prefer Devon I get way more bang for my buck when I my Deb's and edibles like this is like hundreds of dollars of edibles and kidding I got discounts on on my bottom of coupons and stuff over time I didn't spend that much I got deals on most of this stuff but I went to go get this haul in one go to story look cost me a lot and I [ __ ] can't afford that [ __ ] [Music] just to get high

bit they don't think I love you in my experience I might be feeling that but a little bit here I mean I don't know how high I'm gonna get from two thousand milligrams I took 1100 milligrams of capsules not too long ago I was pretty high I mean I wasn't like super [ __ ] blitz i streamed on Twitch the whole night after I just I think I did like a nice eight hour stream or something I can't

here back again with probably my favorite video to date every day the videos get better and better and better and today today i got in a package from sumo heat and we got our second batch of edibles and this time there's a special edible in here you guys so i'm gonna be unboxing this we'll see what's inside here we're gonna open it up look at it together let's get right into this video i'm sorry [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] all right you guys i made the intro to this video so long ago probably over a week ago and i'm finally getting around to eating this thousand milligram willow g 1g edible right now it is 8 21 pm about a munch it i got a flight tomorrow probably at like four in the morning so it's gonna be interesting if i can get up in time let's see but here it is you guys pretty sweet my favorite color is green and it has green sprinkles so that was a nice touch but first bite [Music] cheers [Music] that tastes hella good all right we got some water so we're not just eating this by itself you know [Music] so in this edible there's supposed to be five different chocolates in there and i just took a fat ass bite of one of the chocolate chips and it didn't taste anything like weed because of it so in that case this might be nice [Music] the one thing i've realized already and i'm already like halfway through this edible is this tastes so much better than any thousand milligram edible or even like 500 mg edible i've i've ever had the cinnamon rolls that i ate for 2k which i may not even post anymore because it was kind of a lame video but i ate 2 000 milligrams of cinnamon rolls they tasted so shitty and um then the brownie the brownies on this channel that [ __ ] tasted like anus that if you look at the blooper video all these videos i'm gonna link them when i'm talking about them if you look at that blooper video and the end of the year video it is so [ __ ] funny the blooper reel at the end yeah next bite this tastes just like a good cookie it's pretty lit because after this i'm gonna play some switch just chill at the hotel room and for the next like two three hours just see how this is gonna kick because i really am excited to see if just like i go into a weed coma because of this edible and the craziest thing is is he can do an edible this big and he can taste good as [ __ ] what the [ __ ] it's been six minutes and i'm

that's just like insane because i just went and refilled my water and looked at how long it's been recording last time i had like two to three bites left of the thousand milligram edible it was

today I'm gonna be talking about one of my first favorite goodies that I came across were these Teva bars they're chocolate I don't even have any less guys I don't have anything to even show you I can open these boxes and talk about the product and talk about the boxes um and everything but there's nothing at home guys they're empty they're empty cuz I ate them all they're empty cuz I like them um which goes to show that you know they're good I'm a cheap person so I try to spend my money wisely and I don't really like spending on things that you know if I noticed they're not good or effective or if they don't do what I like then I don't continue to purchase them um so Kiva is a great brand they have a lot of good products um today we're just gonna talk a little bit about these um Kiva bars these Kiva chocolate bars oh my gosh they're delicious um the dispensary that I like the most because I try to go to the same one all the time they kind of stop selling them um and I remember when they went on sale I think they were buy two get one free or something like that but I've seen them ranging from about 20 bucks maybe 25 bucks to almost like 30 bucks per bar maybe 28 bucks 27 so somewhere between 20 and 30 I don't think I've really seen them actually at 30 dollars I've seen about like 27-inch but they might be that much I'm not sure um so if you look at the box here it shows you the flavor so this one is tangerine dark chocolate so it tastes like tangerine dark chocolate it's got that kind of citrusy dark chocolate flavor this one is some one to the other box this one's 100 milligrams THC flavor it says tangerine cannabis infused dark chocolate contents five milligrams THC each but the whole box is 100 milligrams of THC and there are twenty pieces it was broken up into twenty pieces right if you need to screenshot this at all or pause and check out the ingredient list the extra information nutritional panel whatever it is you want to call it the box the book I let the Payette end into the boxes guys to me these are kind of important because like we're in the middle of like cannabis evolution going on here um look at these boxes so this one is vanilla chai chocolate milk chocolate right um you already noticed some differences right away right when you're looking at the box they're not there's subtle differences but they're not like too different from one another right so the outside of the box you notice here on the tangerine dark it's marked 45 45 45 um these chocolate bars on the inside are you know cut into little teeny pieces um there are five milligram doses each piece but this is what the box looks like for the tangerine dark it's just got these notches on the outside explaining open it I'll be happy to see if there's something in it but there's not because I ate it um this is what the container looks like it's kind of this a nice quality kind of a foil that's kind of coated on the outside it's got some information on here so let's read through it it starts off saying there's a five milligram piece so the way these are cut is just one big chocolate bar similar like if you looked at a Hershey's right there already it's just one big bar that's it's kind of like separated into chunks and then you just break them off you know and then they just kind of come off into a chunk so one chunk is about the size of this little square here that says milligrams um where's that diamond mind shows you about the size of this where says five milligram piece again like I'm saying guys the size of these doesn't really matter you can have the smallest piece that's super potent but sometimes people like to get like a size reference if you're carrying stuff in your purse or your pocket whatnot this is how big these boxes are they're pretty large I'd say it's a it's about the size of a dude I'm not too familiar with candy that's not edible but um if you want to look at this skittles case it's about the size of the skittles home that's as best as I can describe inside the box for you guys um so basically the inside of this box that this box has this bag that contains your chocolates um each piece contains five milligrams of THC which I said already told you too much about it already um it says two hours is the estimated time so consume one piece at a time and wait so consume one of those five milligram pieces at a time and then wait two hours for the full effect so if you're not feeling it after like five or ten minutes that means you know don't go and keep popping like oh let me pop another oh let me pop another by this point you're at 15 milligrams guys um unless you really intended for that 15 milligram effect to happen when that 15 milligram hits you it's gonna be a lot stronger than that just five would have been and it's a it's a it's a it's a pretty high ride guys um the very potent they're very evenly distributed as far as flavor um as far as potency you get the same similar effect every time with the same dosage I'm not sure if this little picture is but it's kind of cute it says tolerance to THC varies greatly from user to user made that the truth um go ahead and look at these warnings on the side back part says here thank you for choosing Kiva if I open this up there's nothing in it because I ate it all but you know the inside portal is just a regular foil wrapper but this is pretty heavy-duty if you listen to it got some heft to it open the other one just real quick so you can look at it and then we'll look at these boxes oh you see some of this like powdery old chocolate kind of came on out of here um so this bag on the inside looks just the same just different color this was a yellow flavor notice it that's our yellow color it kind of matches the flavor description tag there but yeah it's the same information I'm not gonna read it again you heard it the first time maybe um but let's look at some of these nutrition bags so if you want to actually look at them you can go ahead and pause and look at this here so I put all the shadows and movement we can glossy surfaces and one other here can read that looks pretty clear of me um let's play with these boxes son right cuz I find that fun um yes I'm weird I'm weird guys so look at this box you notice I kind of I was playing with these cuz I remember one of the first times I bought one of these kiva bars it was more than a hundred milligrams per box I want to say it was like well that's what that's what it was it was 45 45 45 45 per square um and I'm not fully sober so I can't really do masks [Music] let's see well I'm not an idiot I promise you Wow yeah 180 milligrams so it was a it was a 180 milligram box so I don't like defacing my property but you know this is an old box I can part with it and look at this oh look see look what you see underneath here see the sticker changed after a while so that's something I wanted to mention because this is this is some insight for people who weren't there at the beginning when the laws in California changed from legal to having recreational uses well I noticed the UM the dosage the dosage amounts went down so this new one was at 100 milligrams this old one was at 180 milligrams which is why it has these 45 milligram notches right because that doesn't make sense if you're looking at a whole box and you're like wait it's a hundred milligrams but each section about this size is 45 milligrams so what's going on so before um this 180 milligram box um it didn't have this information about the 5 milligram pieces so that was one thing because it wasn't dosed into 5 milligrams it was actually dosed into big 45 milligram pieces and then it had on the wrapping the inner wrapper it has the same knotch marks that we see here so had these similar notch mark details and with having these similar notch mark details it had it had them like in full squares so it had four pieces of 45 milligrams and then it showed on the packaging if you sliced it I think it was diagonally that was gonna be the half of the of the 45 milligrams right and so that's how they looked at it was like 22 and a half milligrams for one little diagonal part of one of the big squares so that's how it looked if you want to know some of the history from where I started that's how it looked before January in 2018 and this is what the box looked like notice they changed it this one this newer sticker here says cannabis infused dark chocolate whereas before it was medical cannabis right um because before there wasn't the recreational right um it wasn't here for recreational use not saying that people didn't use it recreationally but it wasn't marketed or provided for recreational use that wasn't legal but there was medical cannabis use and so it said medical cannabis right and then if you look down here um it says in this warning and the old side of the box it says this product contains a high level of THC not a food it says on the bottle bottle down here right but yeah that's what this looked like before so that's something to kind of keep in mind if you really want to know about it that I'm not I'm not I'm not intending to say or implying that this chocolate bar is actually potentially 180 milligrams and then underneath the packaging it says I mean on top of the packaging now it says it's a hundred milligrams whereas the original bar inside was supposed to be a hundred eighty milligrams that's not what I mean I'm just saying they changed the boxes and they put the stickers on top and then I think there there might have been a point where it was just printed like this new info was printed on the on the actual box I can't remember but I have a whole bunch of these old boxes I kept on just cuz this kind of kind of little keepsakes for me right now for some odd reason oh but I hope this is how full these taste delicious by the way it tastes like dark chocolate with tangerine in it like I said before this other one here the chai milk chocolate also tastes really good it's kind of nice to have two different flavors they're very affordable at five at five milligrams per piece with twenty pieces that's twenty days if you use one per day or twenty sessions or twenty times if you really do things by the dosage over five milligrams is a recommended dose for you but yeah that's that's pretty much what I have to say about this Kiva bar this Kiva edible bar the box is really cool um I really like this box it's it's really nice it's kind of easy they do melt I feel like it melts and it's not because of Kiva but I think just in general I feel like edibles whether they're gummies or chocolates I feel like they tend to melt faster than you know the typical store you know 7/11 or you know convenience store candies like skittles and stuff like that um I feel like edibles for some reason melt faster um I've kept these in the fridge I didn't notice any difference in the change of the potency or flavor or anything but I noticed when it was hot and I'd leave him in my room they'd be a little melty or if I had them definitely in my pockets they melt if I had them you know in the car they they melt same with the gummies - I'm not blaming it but isn't it maybe because they use more natural products they don't have so they don't have like like a lot of the edibles and things have a lot more natural products than the process kind of candies um so maybe that contributes to a lower point where they melt I don't know somebody tell me maybe you can let me know the science behind the melting of candy his games um but thanks for watching this review hopefully it's helpful sorry I didn't have any freaking candy in here um maybe I'll wait and see if I can get another one and if I can I'll maybe contribute more to this video with an actual piece of the candy so you can see what it looks like um I don't have one um I may have taken some actual shots of the candy pictures so if I have them I'll post them up with this video or maybe I'll just wait on this video not even posted at all guys cuz I feel kind of weird talking about a product that I ate all over and I can't find them where I usually go so also if you want to check out other things by Kiva they have the terabyte there use a chocolate covered blueberries umm what else do they have I know they have so many other products guys but I'm so blinking they have smaller chocolate chocolate pieces the little there's there's a chocolate square that I've seen I don't know the dosage on it or anything this one says THC um I didn't see any information on here about CBD at all I mean I'm not looking at it super closely yeah it says it right there I have 0 milligrams of CBD in them I don't know if there", "X4O60iQXJho": "[Music] 500 milligram lead cereal bars for 12 bucks 300 milligrams of bags of chips for 10 400 milligram breakfast cereals we breakfast cereals for $11 and not only that but all the products are pretty tasty too this is just a small sampling of the great value you can expect from lol edibles and nearly ubiquitous edible manufacturer here in Southern California sounds too good to be true right well that's because it is welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana edible review show where we do our damndest to help you make sense of your dispensary this is a show where we try to save you from throwing away your hard-earned money on dud ass edibles and speaking of gun ass edibles today we're going to take a deeper look at LOL edibles where LOL presumably stands for lies on lies we have reviewed a variety of LOL products on wheats and so far have found them to be all greatly exaggerating their potency LOL edibles conveniently does not have an independent tasting testing laboratory rate their product or if they do they do not display it anywhere on their products packaging or on its the website without an independent testing body there are seemingly free to make up whatever dosage they want to put on their packaging and while I certainly cannot prove at this time they are exaggerating their potency my extensive experience with high potency edibles leads me to believe that they are full of [ __ ] so one of the cardinal rules of edibles is you get what you pay for with a few exceptions and we pay $10 for an edible that claims to have 400 milligrams of THC unless you see that independent laboratory verifying those results I would be pretty skeptical of that claim and lol edibles is the king of these shitty shenanigans an another tip-off that they may be less than honest is the taste of their products they usually print is pretty great but a 500 milligram edible should taste at least a little terrible these don't why well most likely because they're lying about how much THC is actually in the product let's compare them to say a 500 milligram kuroh an\u00edbal the kirova product will likely cost and double the lol edible or more and it will taste far Wars and while this might sound weird to say that's very much a good thing two hours after eating an lol a 500 milligram lol edible I'm stone-cold sober like a lifetime lifetime teetotaler but two hours after a 500 milligram Korova edible and I'm [ __ ] over the moon and probably under my covers passed out asleep so let's go back and talk about their website again it's [ __ ] laughable and that's four tabs products about contact and order there order tab seems to it seemed seems to be in good working condition which makes sense because I see this [ __ ] everywhere everything else on their website though god damn what a [ __ ] show the products tab only Keynes contains a small sliver of their products and the pictures look like they were taken on a crusty iphone 3gs by some bored seven-year-old the contact tab of course doesn't do a goddamn thing it's a completely dead link no way to contact them on their contact me tab my guess never worked they don't really want you to contact them they know you're pissed at them why don't they want to hear from you and actually if you really really really do want to get ahold of them just look at the bottom of their page and there's a link to their email and Instagram so you can contact them there psyche those are dead links too they just want you to think that they're able to be contacted but they don't really want you to know they're your feedback because they know they [ __ ] you they know that they're lying to you and they know that you're pissed they don't want to hear from you and finally let's talk about that about page that shows up on their website here's what it says on I quote the medical cannabis industry needed a well respected brand of edibles that patients can rely on for quality and reliability while tasting great lol edibles aims to take the industry by storm by providing great customer service and amazing products you can find LOL edibles throughout the Los Angeles Orange County and San Diego regions at fine reputable medical dispensaries ask your dispensary for LOL edibles today what a load of [ __ ] horseshit let's take that sentence-by-sentence here so I agree that the medical cannabis industry needs a well respected brand but lol edibles sure as [ __ ] ain't it they have the audacity to say that patients can rely on their quality and reliability they also brag about their customer service you know the one you can't actually reach out to or get in contact with them in any way shape or form so guys ask your dispensary the opposite ask them to stop selling these products tell them they are inadvertently ripping off their customers or maybe intentionally ripping off their customers I don't know the only true thing about that sentence or excuse me about that about page is that you can find them throughout LA and Orange counties as unfortunate as that is so I've tried the majority of the Ella Buhl's products but not all I will confess I've never tried their boob cubes or G bars but you know what at this point I never will and I don't care if they're actually good these guys have taken enough money from the pocket of consumers wheats will never review any of their products again their name is lol edibles but the only one are laughs the only ones laughing are them and they're laughing all the way to the bank let me just be totally here to click totally totally clear here to wrap up do not buy any lol edibles products do not let your friends buy their [ __ ] tell your dispensary not to carry this [ __ ] garbage leave them a negative review on weed maps and let's all work together to put these scumbags out of business

one of my all-time favorites and we are looking at one of their hundred and twenty milligrams we are looking at the medical cannabis toffee chocolate honey toffee with smoked sea salt very excited about this one I've tried a few bang products in the past them and joined them all they all seem quite potent for the for the milligrams as listed I tried the 120 180 in 240 and I've been pleased with each of them so far and again this is another 120 and it is 200 excuse me 120 milligrams of THC the honey toffee with smoked sea salt so let's go ahead and cut into it here take a look give it a whiff alright so there you go so you can see on the front it's got its logo bang bang all that fun stuff some marijuana leaves and then on the back we've got our toffee smells good no wheat smell whatsoever break it off take a bite that is good mmm YUM as a fan of both toppy insulted dark chocolates this is delicious no we taste whatsoever perfect blend of chocolate and salt and that toffee is crunchy and crispy and sweet just on top of that very dark 70% dark chocolate delicious hmm I would just eat this point for sure roughly now friendos as we all know it's not about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel so what the most important part is coming back in two hours and letting you guys know whether or not this 120 milligram and a boil I has got the juice like all the other bang

I will see you in two hours thanks for watching [Music] it has been 2 hours guys welcome back to wheats boy bang has another winner on their hands with the perfection in cannabis convection their logo

taste whatsoever the chocolate was delicious the toffee topping was crunchy crispy and just delicious oh my god um wonderful um maybe my favorite bang bar yet in terms of taste and I think it only cost me $8 at the dispensary and again for a an edible with only 120 milligrams of THC I mean that is an incredibly incredibly potent 120 milligrams so if you see this at the dispensary and you're a fan of toffee grab it you will not be disappointed it's got the wheat seal of approval alright guys and with that thank you so much for watching and we will check you out on the next review bye bye

Back again, Nile Red is doing a caffeine extraction. This time though, the recovery should be a lot better because we're not targeting it in a natural source. Today we're going to be trying to target our caffeine in caffeine pills. This process should be a little bit\ncleaner than from a natural source and in the end we should have a nice pile of caffeine powder. Also, just as a final installment to my caffeine obsession, I do plan to synthesize it from scratch\nin the future. OK, so let's get started. For this extraction, I opted to use a hundred pills containing about a 100mg of caffeine each. Remember that different brands use different ingredients so your procedure might differ a little bit if you use a different brand. Besides the caffeine pills were also\ngoing to need an organic solvent and in my case I use dichloromethane. I started by opening the bottle and pouring the pills out into a beaker. This step is pretty redundant and I did\nit just so you can see how many pills we're working with. Anyway, what we want to do is you want to crush these pills up to a powder. So I add them to a mortar and I make sure not to add too many at a time because this can make it hard to crush them up. So I keep crushing the pills until I get a reasonably fine powder. When I'm decently satisfied, I poured the pills into an Erlenmeyer flask and I moved on to crushing more pills. So I add more and I repeat until all of the pills are crushed. If you're lazy you can optionally just\nuse a coffee grinder for this step. Unfortunately I didn't have a coffee grinder so I had to struggle through this using only my weak chemist arms. The final amount of pill powder was transferred to the Erlenmeyer and now we're ready to move on from this very\ntiring step. So before proceeding on, we drop in my trusty stir bar so I don't have to stir anything manually. Directly onto the powder, I then pour in 120mL of dichloromethane. According to the ingredients of the\ncaffeine pills, everything should be insoluble in DCM except for caffeine and\none other thing called povidone. This is okay though because we'll deal\nwith the povidone later. The funnel is removed and a watch glass\nis placed on top to limit the evaporation of the DCM. I let this stir for an hour and then I\nturned off the stirring to let the solid sink to the bottom. It's really important to wait long enough that the solid solidify at the bottom, otherwise the filtration step is going\nto be next to impossible. I then pour the murky liquid portion into a fritted filter. I attach my vacuum pump and I separate the liquid from the solids. You can see that the filter caught quite\na lot of the solids but the filtrate is still pretty murky. To the solids at the bottom of the flask,\nwe add further 15mL of dichloromethane and we do the exact same\nthing and we let it stir for about an hour. After the hour we let the solids collect\non the bottom and then we filter. So just like before we add it to the\nfilter flask and using vacuum we pull it through. Then, just to clean up things a little\nbit, I wash the sides of the filter flask using a little bit of\ndichloromethane. This is what was filtered through but\nyou can see that there's still quite a bit of solid in there. So to try to separate some more of the\nsolids out, we filter it again. This step is pretty optional because I\ndon't think that the filter actually caught too much of the solid. What we have to do now is remove the\ndichloromethane solvent and we do this by distillation. When all the DCM is gone, we're left with\nsome pinkish white powder at the bottom. Using a metal spatula, I break it up into\npieces. When the pieces were small enough, I\npoured them out of the round bottom flask and into a beaker. Once they're in the beaker, I broke them up more into a nice coarse powder. At this point is pretty easy to tell that\nthe caffeine isn't pure because of the vast amount of random pink stuff. To get rid of this stuff, we carry out a\nrecrystallization. For the recrystallization, we dissolve\nthe caffeine in a minimal amount of hot water. When we cool it down, the solubility of\nthe caffeine should drop and it should crystallize out of solution but the\nimpurity should remain quite soluble and stay in solution. This way we can filter off the liquid\nand we should be left with reasonably pure caffeine crystals. I keep adding hot water until the\nsolution more or less clears up and then I take it off the hot plate and let it\ncool to room temperature. Once at the room temperature, we can\nput it in the freezer to crystallize out as much caffeine as possible. After taking it out of the freezer, we're\nleft with something that looks almost exactly like cotton candy. I then added the cotton candy like\ncaffeine to a Buchner funnel. When I pull the vacuum, you can see it deflates a little and some of the pink color disappears. I turned off the vacuum and added some\ncold water. I mix it around using a spatula to try\nto wash it a little. I then pull the vacuum again and you\ncan see here that the caffeine is looking more white than before. I then repeat this washing step one\nlast time just to get the caffeine as pure as possible. I let the vacuum on a little bit\nlonger to dry the caffeine and we're left with some nice white caffeine at\nthe end. I transfer the nice white fluffy caffeine to a small crystallizing dish. To get rid of the water that's still present, I place it into an oven and heated it at a very low heat. When it was taken out of the oven, it was\npretty dry and I was able to crush it up into a nice fine powder. Instead of recrystallization, the other\noption of purification is sublimation. Caffeine is one of the special molecules that doesn't really have a liquid phase and instead when you heat it jumps\ndirectly from the solid to the gas phase. By placing it on a very hot hot plate, we can sublimate the caffeine and allow\nthe crystals to form on the side of the beaker and the bottom of the round\nbottom flask. On top of the beaker is placed a round\nbottom flask that's filled with cold water to try to limit the amount of\ncaffeine that escapes. When we feel like enough caffeine has\nsublimated and collected on the walls and the sides, we can take it off the hot\nplate and let it cool. It's really important not to remove the\nround bottom flask while the beaker is still hot. When the beakers turned upside down some, very nice white powdered caffeine falls out. This is a pretty efficient method of\npurifying caffeine and most of the impurities simply just burn or char on\nthe bottom of the beaker and stay there. You can see here the final nice white\ncaffeine powder that we got. The amount that I was able to recover\nwas about 8.5g which is pretty close to the theoretical 10.

sure that you are looking at that note frame and using the note frame and using these powerpoints so you're looking at the powerpoints and then either writing out or typing out into your note frame the different points there's lots of memorization in this unit and it's kind of heavy on material and terminology so having either that typing of information or writing information will really help you to remember things better so like I say this is the digestive system we're gonna start with this really great picture again I love this The awkward Yeti he's so good at making comics I say that this is good not only because I think it looks really good but this if you come back at the end of this unit you'll look at this and you'll be able to think oh yeah all of these parts we've talked about and it makes sense how what each of them are kind of doing so anyways we'll get started here with some important definitions so these are just words that are gonna come up fairly frequently throughout this unit so it's important for you to know what they are so we'll start with an enzyme it's an organic protein that speeds up a reaction in the body and more so we'll be talking about digestive enzymes so they break down macromolecules which means just larger molecules and are found in digestive juices in the saliva in the stomach and in the pancreas so anytime you're hearing a digestive enzyme that is an organic protein that's going to help with the breakdown of macromolecules or chunks of food so there's two types of Justin that we can have one is my cat mechanical digestion which is a physical breakdown of food and nutrients so that would be like actually chewing food churning in the stomach so it's some sort of physical breakdown as compared to chemical digestion which is the chemical breakdown of food so that's when we would have those digestive enzymes hydrochloric acid in the stomach working on breaking something down so that's a as compared to mechanical which would be say like chewing an apple or something like that the last is the term sphincter so that is a muscle that surrounds a tube and opens and closes that tube by contraction and relaxing so any time you hear the word sphincter there's some in the stomach's I mean the anus so you're thinking okay there's some sort of tube that doesn't move on its own it has a sphincter around it which is just a muscle that contracts and relaxes to open and close that tube so before we get into kind of the meat and potatoes punny of the digestive system we need to understand how or what nutrients our body actually means so there's six major classes that of nutrients that your body needs you have carbohydrates lipids proteins vitamins minerals and water so let's look at each of those individually carbohydrates this includes sugars starches and fiber so the quickest and most reliable sources of energy for our body is glucose and glucose comes from carbohydrates so carbohydrates are digested into simple sugars which can be converted into glucose glucose is then stored in the liver to be used when the body needs it you might have heard the term complex carbs before that's something like whole grains rice is a complex carb or brown rice bran wheat those sorts of things are complex carbs and those are recommended because they break down into sugars slowly they also contain fiber which we're going to talk about in a second but so those complex carbs they take energy to be broken down they take a longer time to be broken down which is healthier for the body so that you have a slow but consistent rate of sugar entering your bloodstream so you're not all of a sudden being inundated with tons of sugar at one time like you are with simple sugar carbs so candy or ice cream those carbs are broken down so quickly that they enter the bloodstream all at one time and gives you too much sugar so sugar is not a bad thing we need sugars it's that glue and it's basically powers everything in our body however when we have something like if you eat a bran muffin it's gonna take a long time for those sugars to be digested and your body slowly uses them as they kind of needs to use them whereas if you're eating a candy bar suddenly you're having all of those sugars into your body at one time which is not healthy for you so we'll just look at fiber really quickly here fiber can be insoluble or soluble fiber is really good for us fiber that is insoluble has a laxative like effect which means that wastes are more easily expelled from the end of the digestive system and soluble fiber combines with bile acid and cholesterol in the intestines so that they're not absorbed into the body so both of these are important to help make sure that your digestive system or digestive tract is running smoothly next we're gonna look at proteins so proteins are typically found in fish poultry legumes which are beans and peas nuts and red meat proteins are digested into amino acids which are the building blocks of muscles skin hair and nails they can also be used to create hormones enzymes and hemoglobin so protein is really really important into the building of our bodies so where our carbohydrates are giving us energy our proteins are kind of building our structures in our bodies it's like muscles and hormones enzymes those sorts of things so there are 20 types of amino acids and they can be broken down into two categories one category is essential amino acids and the second is non-essential so there are eight essential amino acids meaning they cannot be created by the body so they must be ingested from another food source or from a food source pardon me so basically when we're saying essential it means that it's essential that you take these in from somewhere else so there's certain amino acids that your body can't make 12 of them your body can make eight of them they can't so those are essential that you're eating those eight amino acids so that's why we have the term essential there and again non-essential your body for 12 of these amino since your body can just naturally create on its own but there are eight of those that you need to eat they are essential that you eat and amino acids are not stored in the body so we just talked about glucose being stored in the liver but amino acids are not stored in the body therefore they must be eaten daily so you could go a few days without having carbohydrates you might feel a little bit kind of groggy by the end not so energetic but proteins are something that we need every single day so that your body can keep rebuilding any muscles that you tear you can keep replenishing those hormones enzymes hemoglobin so again proteins are super important to eat every day carbs you have those stores in your body which you can use at other times or if you don't quite get enough carbohydrates one day you can have some another day in your stores will be replenished but proteins are not stored in the body so lipids our fats oils and cholesterol lipids are used to form the structures of cell membranes and store energy so lipids are a backup source of energy they're really important though in the structures of cell membranes so again really important for us to have these there's two major types of fats that we typically ingest they're saturated and non saturated so saturated means solid at room temperature those are like the bad fats so butter fat from meats palm oil coconut oil and then non saturated is liquid at room temperature and they're needed for the body to survive so non saturated fats are really really important for cell membranes that sort of stuff saturated fats we tend to eat those more so than we should so that's just something to be aware of so anything that's liquid at room temperature different sorts of oils avocado oil corn oil staff out safflower oil those are all good sorts of oils vitamins are organic compounds that the body uses for metabolic purposes but is not able to create enough of on its own so many are coenzymes so enzymes help to break down things Co enzymes help ends work faster so there's many different vitamins I've only included three here vitamin A is needed for eye health and it can be found in deep yellow orange and green leafy vegetables you might have heard of carrots being a really good source of vitamin A vitamin D is needed for developing bones and teeth it's found in fortified milk and made in the skin when exposed to natural sunlight so being outside and getting natural sunlight is really important that's why we just talked about vitamin D can be found in fortified milk because here when we don't have as much sunlight in the winter we still need to replenish that vitamin D in our systems so that's why we have vitamin D fortified milk vitamin K is needed to help with blood clotting and can be found in leafy green vegetables as well vegetables have a ton of vitamins for us so minerals minerals are required in the body as they help make up cell and body fluids and are also found in your tissues so there are six major minerals that you need a hundred milligrams per day of so these would be calcium phosphorus potassium sodium chloride and magnesium calcium build strong bones and teeth found in dairy and leafy green vegetables phosphorus builds bones and soft tissue it's found in meat dairy sunflower seeds potassium helps with nerve conduction and muscle contraction so sometimes if your nerves are or your muscles are twitching you may be lacking in potassium it just really helps your muscles to be able to fully contract at the right time your nurse field toward properly and founded fruits and vegetables sodium helps with nerve conduction and pH and water balance and it's found in table salt so we do actually need to have a hundred milligrams of salt a day or sodium a day we typically tend to as a society have way too much sodium in our diet chloride helps with water balance and again this found in table salt and magnesium helps enzyme enzymes function and is found in whole grains and leafy green vegetables so there are other lots of other minerals that you need that you have less than twenty milligrams of the day those are things like zinc iron copper iodine and selenium so again those trace minerals you need less of the six major minerals that you need though we just talked about the last thing we'll talk about today is water the body uses water in all of its cells organs and tissues it can be taken indirectly through drinking or through some water-based fruits and vegetables like watermelon cucumber or lettuce so obviously we know how we can take in water it's super important for all of your cell functioning all of your tissues to function properly keeps everything in your body moving you're made up of like 75% water or something like that so it's really important to always be drinking water throughout the day so that's where we're going to end off here we've talked about all the nutrients that you need and then we're going to get into how to break down those nutrients in the body", "OBk4blbdVr0": "[Music] if you feel like you're always hungry and constantly needing to snack it's probably a good idea to look at what you're eating on a daily basis it could be that you just aren't eating enough at breakfast lunch and or dinner another reason could be that it's actually what you're eating that is making you hungrier sooner so today we're going to talk about the top foods that make you hungry [Music] granola bars granola bars are sneaky because they are marketed as healthy yet most of them are loaded with carbs and sugar with a small amount of fiber this means that you will digest them very quickly which causes your blood sugar to plummet and then triggers your hunger hormones fix it instead of granola look for high fiber bars or cereal with less than 10 grams of sugar the less less the better more like 5 or lower but at least under 10 grams [Music] artificial sweeteners research has found that artificial sweeteners may actually cause you to become hungrier eat more and gain weight one of the proposed reasons for this is that artificial sweeteners bike insulin just like sugar does which leads to fat storage and hunger there is more research that needs to be done in this area and some artificial artificial sweeteners are likely to cause more issues than others so fix it look for products that don't have artificial sweeteners chips have you ever thought about why you're given chips and salsa at a restaurant perhaps to increase your appetite chips are one of the worst foods for your waistline because they are loaded with carbs and salt both of which make you hungrier and eat more and they certainly do not fill you up fix it ask your server to please not serve you chips and salsa or just take the salsa by itself [Music] alcohol okay i know alcohol isn't a food but it's worth mentioning because it can definitely make you feel hungrier this is because when you drink alcohol it causes a decrease in blood sugar and it also lowers your willpower when it comes to eating healthy foods or unhealthy foods really which is a bad combination when you're trying to watch your waistline fix it never drink on an empty stomach and even have a little fat before you do indulge in an alcoholic beverage cereal take a quick look at your cereal box if you see more than seven grams of sugar per serving and less than five grams of fiber then there's a good chance that the cereal is going to make you hungry pretty quickly that's because the sugar and low fiber content means you will digest this meal very quickly leaving you hungrier than what you started with in an hour or two fix it go for high fiber cereal and avoid any cereal that has over 10 grams of sugar per serving and again look for the lowest amount of sugar more like zero or one gram of sugar is best juice even juices marketed as being green or healthy can be loaded with sugar and can spike and then drop your blood sugar quickly which leads to hunger not too long after drinking fix it instead of juice have a smoothie which will have fiber from the pulp [Music] bread all bread products toast croissants bagels these all will leave you hungrier than with you started with that's because they are high in carbs and low in fiber low in fat and low in protein fix it if you're going to have a bread product product like toast add a tablespoon of nut butter [Music] fat-free yogurt have you ever looked at the nutritional value label of yogurt the sugar content is normally around 20 grams per serving that's an entire day's worth of sugar in just a few bites the worst defenders tend to be the fruit flavored yogurts but even plain or vanilla can have a ton of sugar as well also beware of the fat free yogurts because these tend to have the highest amounts of sugar because they take out the fat to make it taste better so they add sugar fix it look for yogurt that has less than 10 grams of sugar per serving and add some healthy fat and or fiber to it such as a handful of almonds or some high fiber cereal so the main takeaways for today if your meal or snack lacks fiber and or fat there is a good chance that in an hour or two you will be hungrier than you started always check the nutrition label when you can and look for foods that have the lowest amount of sugar per serving [Music] thanks have an awesome day [Music]", "mhAWDSN3BmE": "a company was considering launching a new chocolate

hypoglycemia glucose syrup is a body's main energy source hypoglycemia is not a disease in itself but usually an underlying issue causes a fabulous singer a commonly happens when I feel somewhat diabetes has taken too much insulin exercise without proper food intake at skipping meals lack of glucagon a whole not secreted from the pancreas and bruises broken loose levels excessive alcohol consumption of all complot the level for me since George Lucas what happens when a broken foot straps room hormones are released an app to deliver to restore goes produce new robots and produce schedules symptoms of hypoglycemia occur when blood glucose levels dropped between 3 and 4 millimoles per liter they include feelin hungry sweatin dizziness blurred vision irritability and confusion among many others if hypoglycemia is not treated promptly and blood glucose levels drop low enough you may become drowsy or even lose consciousness most people with insulin treat the diabetes notices symptoms of hyperglycemia change and become less obvious longer they live with the condition nocturnal hypoglycemia it is more common than people who treat diabetes with insulin all are some people find asleep is the same when they experience nocturnal hypoglycemia you're often only notice the symptoms when you wake up anymore symptoms can include headache and damp sheets caused by sweating I feel blood sugar continues to drop your behavior may change symptoms may include inability to concentrate confusion and irritability slurred speech muscle tension and personality changes severe symptoms of low blood sugar include seizure loss of consciousness stroke or even death you sure this is where me to vote for me summer radiation you do your body she should be him again yes special formula myself after she tell him about all the different things we need the booty iconic almeida they normally surgery so this has a special formula with a certain amount of sugar content so too much as a decoy their blood remarkable so this one as I just enough to make you feel better meeting with us of it well they saw what i have is the order gift and ice water bring sadhana maloom normalize have me as i get up or down Meek in it and I just bring in what I have I don't have no more anyway glucose is the main energy source for the brain and is obtained from carbohydrates when they are broken down glucose is absorbed in the bloodstream where it is transported throughout the body glucose that has not been used is stored in the liver as glycogen upon having a meal the complex food is broken down hence a great amount of glucose enters the bloodstream in order to balance the high level of glucose the hormone insulin comes into place the pancreas is responsible for signaling the release of insulin the role of insulin is the assist body cells in taking up glucose from the bloodstream so insulin causes the concentration of glucose levels to be decreased therefore if too much is secreted too much glucose leaves the blood this causes blood sugar to be lower than it should be now the body has little energy due to the fact that limited amount of glucose is present so here we have the body deprived of energy and therefore needs to find some alternative energy in order to function as a result muscle protein and fats are broken down the person needs to have a meal or snack to bring the glucose level to normal so you may be thinking that the fastest energy source is something that contains a lot of sugar this is not the case due to the fact that a high concentration of glucose will now be entering the bloodstream all at once the pancreas becomes overwhelmed and too much insulin is secreted and a blood sugar levels go even lower this is why having complex carbohydrates in such a situation is ideal complex carbohydrates deliver glucose as an optimum rate causing until production to occur at a steady week who def ago you can tell me what caused accident what did you have a good well actually I was too much Canadian Johnston for so long so that meant your blog to preserve it when we that's not honest with each other no no more that would that in fluffy feathers too much arrest for your condition and when if you continue until you too much about 1.9 staff happen sometimes I could even cause it to go to home bar so you shouldn't be back next time what you should do if you know you can't meet before like we'll see in long periods of time to treat four to six hours you should have some complex how it's like a sandwich or something I will sustain you how long period attack but if when you're probably at school or doing your studies or anything like that and you started experience symptoms you should have like on that time you search you should have fun like reasons or fruits or something on hand or something simple back to it all sustained you I'm cognizant you sugar true that spirit of that value when you can be able to eat much so next time you know right when treating hypoglycemia one should first determine your blood glucose level if glucose levels is not too low but symptoms are present the treatment administered should not elevate the blood glucose levels for treatment off' consumed 15 to 20 grams of glucose or simple carbohydrates retract your blood glucose after 15 minutes of hypoglycemia continues repeat 15 grams of simple carbohydrates commonly used to treat hypoglycemia include glucose tablets reasons or any of the other items listed why you think on these chocolate ice creams are not good treatment choices although it me someone has like a good idea to treat hypoglycemia with dietary tree sugar in the form of complex carbohydrate or sugar combined with fat or protein or much too slowly absorb to be useful for the acute treatment of hypoglycemia also these items contain fat which slows down the rate of glucose released into the blood I will not allow for rapid rise in blood glucose levels once our acute episode has been treated a long accent carbohydrate to maintain blood sugar in the appropriate range should be consumed using glucagon to treat hypoglycemia glucagon is a polypeptide hormones secreted by the alpha cells of the fun free ethical it stimulates the liver to release stored glucose into your bloodstream when your blood glucose levels are too low glucagon increases click on new license gluconeogenesis life processes ketogenesis and uptake of amino acid how to prevent hypoglycemia eat on time eat enough carbs that correlates with the amount of medication being taken take medication on time be prepared carry some form of carbs with you all the time mechanism to prevent or correct hypoglycemia hypoglycemia is a medical emergency because the central nervous system has an absolute requirement for the continuous supply of blood borne glucose to serve as fuels for energy metabolism the body has multiple overlapping mechanisms to prevent a correct hypoglycemia the most important hormone changes in combated hypoglycemia elevated glucagon and epinephrine combined with the diminished release of insulin glucose regulatory systems humans have to overlap in glucose regulation systems that are activated by hypoglycemia one the expletive longer has two receptors in the hypothalamus which respond to abnormally low concentration of blood glucose glucagon as epinephrine hypoglycemia is combated by decreased release of insulin and increased secretion of glucagon epinephrine cortisol and Roman Luca gonna epinephrine most important in acute short term regulation of blood glucose levels glucagon a stimulus hepatic glucose new license at gluconeogenesis epinephrine promotes glycogenolysis like pollicis inhibits insulin secretion and inhibits even mediated uptake of glucose by peripheral to see epinephrine is not normally essential in combating hypoglycemia but it can assume a critical role while glucagon secretion is deficient the prevention of Correction of hypoglycemia fails when this equation of blood glucose or an epinephrine is deficient blood glucose levels are monitored by glucose sensor neurons in the autonomic nervous system which is also involved in pancreatic and adrenal secretions when blood sugar levels for the nervous system responds by signal in their journals to release epinephrine or adrenaline growth hormone and cortisol while lowering the pancreatic secretion of insulin the nervous system is closely tied in witness system that secretive chemicals if the nervous system is compromised by span 0 dis damage and g secretions may well be out of balance cortisol and nick growth hormone these hormones are less important in the short term maintenance of blood glucose concentrations they do however play a role in

we'll close out with no music and", "rNf1pSO6rwI": "hello my beautiful Nicolette's welcome back to my channel or hello if you're new you are new it would mean so much if you guys click the subscribe button so you're part of the family and turn on the bow so you know when I upload every single week probably why you click this video is because you're here to try and lose belly fat tone it up and have a flat stomach I know when I first went into the gym and I started getting into fitness I really wanted to focus on my stomach and tone it and lose that belly fat and I learned a lot of tricks and tips along the way that have really helped my stomach and that is one part that I really learned how to tone so I hope that this is useful for you guys I will be sharing 5 mistakes that you may be making that is leading to belly fat and leading you to not losing that belly 5 these are gonna be no BS tips on how to get that flat stomach and I really believe that if you follow these tips to a tee you will notice such a big difference so I will link my fitness playlist also in the description box for you guys if you want to check it out because there's a lot of videos on fitness and if you guys ever want to talk to me about fitness or just you want to see kind of what I'm up to at the gym you can follow me at Nicoletta XO YT but let's just jump into the 5 no BS tips the first and biggest mistake that I really like to stress that you may be making is sugar so you are consuming too much sugar sugar is our culprit unfortunately if your diet consists of things such as sport drinks or sugar sweetened drinks or fizzy pops or even flavored waters or other things like sugary foods including cakes and chocolate and although a lot of us crave it and we want that all those things and more and make it super difficult to lose weight and lose that belly fat even having too many fruits can actually be a reason why you're not losing belly fat so of course I like to have my fruits fruits are really great for you and they have natural sugars so it's not the same like your typical chocolate bars or cakes that are made with sugar that is not natural sugar but if you do have too many fruits and having excess amount anything of X's is not good for you and it's not going to help you to lose that belly fat so you want to make sure whenever you're having stuff it's in moderation not about taking things out of your diet but it's just about moderation another little tip that I want to throw out there is a lot of us tend to go for foods and you see it's all but all over the grocery stores low-fat options so actually a lot of low fat food options actually have a lot in high amounts of sugar in them and that's kind of what they do so they may be a little bit lower in fats but they'll just add a lot more sugar into it so when you are my grocery shopping you really want to look at the labels and I know when I first started my fitness journey I was really into looking at calories and let me tell you calories is not important I really don't like to track calories and just focus on calories anymore because the number of calories doesn't really tell you anything when I look at a label the number one thing I like to really look at first especially when I'm focusing on my belly fat and really trying to tone my stomach is looking at how many grams of sugar is in that product that you're purchasing because sometimes calories don't really tell you something a healthier option might have more calories than a option that has no nutritional value to it something might have 80 calories and then something might have 300 calories and that 300 calorie could have a lot more nutritional value than that any calorie snack that you're just grabbing for and you're eating just because it says 80 calories as opposed to the actual healthier option that will do more and better things to your body so that's why I really like to not focus on calories as much because that's not going to tell you anything about what nutritional value is coming out of your food so really when you are going grocery shopping look at the sugars because sugar like I said is their number one culprit unfortunately and although a lot of us like to have a good piece of cake or a doughnut or chocolate bar I can go on for days it is important that you're not having too much sugar because sugar is a big reason why a lot of us gain belly fat and we only should be having a certain amount of sugar every day and a lot of things have crazy amounts of sugar in them sometimes you'll find things I have like 60 80 grams of sugar and that is literally so much sugar that is like three four times as much sugar we should be having every single day that is way too much sugar to even be having in one sitting and one day and should not be eaten because that's not going to help you to lose that weight and it's not healthy for you and that leads me to mistake number two is you're not eating enough protein protein is actually amazing for fat loss it helps build and preserve lean muscle and it can increase the amount of calories that are burned it also is a really great source of energy and can help you feel full for longer so you're less likely to be tempted to go and snack and eat a bunch of random stocks all day long because you're just super hungry so some really great sources of protein include things such as chicken breast eggs chickpeas and even your almond milk you get protein from that as well but when you are having protein you really want to look for lean protein because there's actually a lot of options where there's like certain meats and stuff like that that are protein but they're full of saturated fats which is not good for you and that leads me to mistake number three and that is you're eating too many saturated fats so there's actually it saturated fats and unsaturated fats and when you are at a store as well on the label it will show you the two different types of fats found in that food product or in that snack that you are purchasing or eating currently and that's gonna tell you a lot the saturated fats is the fats you want to kind of stay away from because those are the fats that have an impact on where the excess body fat is stored saturated fats turn on genes in fatty tissue that increase the storage around our stomach and our liver while the healthier polyunsaturated fats which are found from plant foods and oily fish do the opposite actually switch on the genes and fatty tissues that reduce fat storage so replace your saturated fats that are found in and certain meats and as well as in some pastries and things like that for unsaturated fats that are found in things such as nuts and avocado and olive oil and tuna and salmon those may have fats in them but they're good healthy fat mistake number four is your crash dieting and I know this is so popular in today's society and I have been victim to it spring when I was trying to get healthy I didn't know too much about let the health and nutrition side so I just assumed if I want to lose weight I should just cut my calories and not eat as much and I'll lose weight crash diets are when you significantly cut down how much you eat every single day in order to help you lose a few pounds and although you might see results at first and lose those few pounds it is not sustainable and it is not the healthiest route to go down also it's not going to help you to keep that weight off it might seem like it's a quick and easy option to do but actually eating too few of calories can do more harm than good if your calorie intake dips too low your body actually goes into starvation mode and this is going to slow down your estab ilysm it's all about making sensible healthy changes that you could stick to for your lifestyle as opposed to doing these fad diets so in the end you want this to be a lifestyle and not just a point in life and then you're just not gonna be able to sustain it throughout your life so it's just making these healthy changes mistake number five and the final mistake if you are doing the wrong type of cardio slash exercise so I feel like a lot of us and I know I've been victim to this where I think that if you want to lose belly fat then you just have to do a ton of cardio and just go on the treadmill for hours and do crunches if you want to get a flat stomach but it's actually better if you skip those hours of party on the treadmill or bike and you do hit exercises so hit exercises are just high-intensity interval training and this has been seen to be a lot more effective than going on the tremolo for hours upon hours in losing belly fat so a high intense interval training is just from going from low intensity to high intensity and switching back and forth from the two so if you're going to do the treadmill for example then going than just walking for a look for 30 seconds and then sprinting for 30 seconds and then walking and then sprinting and vice versa that is going to be a lot more effective than if you just walked on the Tremmel at the same speed for like an hour let's say and also if you're just doing exercises going from a lower intensity exercise to a high intensity exercise switching back and forth you're going to notice such a big difference in your body and your workouts are just gonna be a lot more effective so you don't have to just work out for hours upon hours in order to see results that is just going to waste your time and you're going to find the better results if you just did a shorter exercise with a with high intensity interval training but those are all the mistakes that you may be making right now so thumbs up if you guys enjoyed it and you learn something new and also I will link my fitness

having an amazing date and your night whenever you're watching this and I'll catch you guys in my next video bye e", "xUABSpA7LSM": "everybody so here's a quick video some ideas what to eat on a long ride I just got back from a ride in Santa Cruz Mountains is about a little over 60 miles 6,700 change feet of climbing for hours and 20 minutes of riding time so I want to show you in three parts exactly what I brought how many calories that was carbohydrates etc I'm going to show you the individual items and why I brought them and then I'll give you my rundown of what I ate and when and why and hopefully that's helpful to some so let's check it out so first of all you see here I got two bananas I brought two Clif bars I brought two fig bars and then these I think these used to be called cliff shot blocks but now they're just called cliff blocks and there's six of these in here they're just pure sugar a liter of coconut water and then a liter of water which I filled up twice so two liters of water okay so everything you see here on the table all this stuff over here this is this is what is good for so altogether this was one thousand seven hundred and fifty calories 200 grams of carbohydrates thirty two point six grams of protein 992 milligrams of sodium and three thousand three hundred and four milligrams of potassium most of which comes from the coconut water that's it that's everything I brought the coconut water was in a bottle like this am I on the bike and then the water I pour out one liter and then filled it up again a little more than halfway through you might have noticed there's a different variety of things from just straight-up plant food to pure sugary blocks to you know more like little bar type things I've tried all dates all bananas different clip products and different combinations and I found that having a variety of foods sits better in my stomach I feel less stomach cramps at the end and it also releases the sugars into your blood at different rates so you have a sustained release of energy okay that's pretty much why I brought these different things okay bananas the whole food they feel great in stomach you know nature's first athletes food these blocks right here they are super high glycemic they go right into your blood really quickly so I use these for racing even and at the bottom of climbs or hard efforts when I need an extra punch big bars just nice to have something in your body that feels like real food you know nice nice flavors and Clif bars and fig bars they're really similar the main difference is that Clif bars have a little bit more protein in them which you do not need while you're writing but it's good for recovery and Clif bars also have more potassium and sodium these are a little bit more of a doughy type texture so I like these ones they're a little bit more like that savory dessert II type thing there's also two little big bar things in a package so sometimes I'll just eat one at a time put it in my pocket and then take out the other one later okay and coconut water this is super awesome so coconut water is actually really high in potassium it has sodium and carbohydrates which is like everything you need in a sports drink okay all in one naturally forming thing so for another little tip you can take a pinch of a Himalayan salt and then put some type of natural sugar in there like maple syrup or pure cane sugar or even a ghave nectar put it in the bottle and then you have yourself all natural sports drinks so that's pretty cool okay so that's everything I brought if you check the description down below I'll give you the rundown of exactly what each one of these items is good for and calories carbohydrates protein potassium sodium stuff like that so do check the description so my nutritional strategy for this ride was actually just really easy and really straightforward so in the beginning as we're leaving I had a banana so I'll get rid of that and then pretty much I had a block plus a bigger item let's call this right here our so for each hour I started you know the fig bar block next our cook Clif Bar action then I had two blocks actually at that point because there was that was the open really sweaty section halfway through I had my banana block ok fig bar and then at the end you know the last part of your ride is really went recovery starts so I saved a Clif Bar I worked it out so that a Clif Bar would be my last thing because like I said you don't need protein while you're writing but it's a good idea for recovery so that's the last thing I had plus my last block as far as liquids this is also really simple pretty much you just you know if even if I'm not thirsty I'm just every few minutes I'd reach down and grab a drink ok so when it was really hot and exposed I made sure to sip a little bit extra coconut water so like I said I knew that I would be able to refill this in Big Basin so I kind of just you know I don't worry about it I just sip sip sip sip sip I think that's just really the best strategy overall is just you know even if you're not thirsty even if you're not hungry just constantly hydrate and constantly eat so that you have the fuel to get you from beginning to end no problems whatsoever so I put a top to bag for this ride and I was able to put two fig bars and a Clif Bar in this top tube bag as well as a map for the ride and that just no velcro's on right there on the top tube so it's right in front of me the whole time and if you can't fill up your water bottles bring a camel back man you know some of your friends might give you a hard time you know for bringing a camel back on a road bike but it's more important to stay hydrated so get yourself a camel back if if you can't refill on water while you're out there here's a little freebie bonus so dates are a great idea I did not bring any dates on this ride but I often will so just to kind of compare two of these little suckers here is almost the same nutrient as one banana okay now these ones have pits in them so what I'll do is I'll cut it open take the pits out roll them into like a little ball or something let me just kind of put this perspective so two dates have 130 calories 34 grams of carbohydrates 320 milligrams of potassium and only 10 milligrams of sodium so check out the description below you can kind of compare that to the banana so if space is an issue or if you're one of those people who are really concerned about weight two dates this is very similar to one banana well thanks so much for watching that wraps up this video if you liked it please give it a thumbs up motivate me to make some more videos like this put all your questions comments in the comment section below and I'm really curious if you have some ideas or what it is that you do on your rides put them down there and I'd love to read those and see exactly what other people do for their long rides but otherwise stay tuned check back out about some breakfast ideas and some other snack ideas for athletes and everything is vegan friendly so thanks again see you next time", "PJjJ-9Lr_Xw": "[Music] what up homies welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary classic episode today that means it is edible time guys and one that I am pretty intrigued about what a novel looking product we have here today and that product guys is blood man's edible nugs 250 milligrams which I picked up in a dispensary a gray market dispensary in Orange County for 20 bucks so 250 milligram bud man's edible nugs what the [ __ ] are animal drugs you might be asking yourself well here's what they are but man's edible nugs thin mints hybrids they look like nugs of wheat they look like little nuggets of or a little uh what do we call knucks weed nugs but they're not they're actually disguised uh they're not nugs at all there are little bits of chocolate Thin Mint hybrid actually so it looks like a nug of weed but it is in fact an edible how fun how fun so we are going to have an experiment with this we're gonna try these nugs here and hope that they are going to get us blasted because I would love to love these I love how fun they are that's a great price for a 250 milligram an\u00edbal um and I always like a novel product so let's go to smell here mmm most cannabis tea and mint tea as one might expect um so if you guys have never tuned in two weeks before and if you have I'm sorry you have to hear this for the trillionth and a half time where our reviews work is I'm gonna eat all these nugs these edible nugs here uh maybe not Alden on in front of you in camera but I will finish him over the next few minutes or so and then at the end of that two after two hours have passed after two hours of driver having consumed these I'll come back to you guys to let you know what I think because that's what you're really gonna for you don't care so much about how it tastes you wanna know if it's gonna get you high so for that guys you'll have to wait the two hours but first we got to do a taste test what am I talking about so here's our little edible nuggie there it is looking very much like an ugh smells like mitten weed mmm that's not bad and as the texture of like a Hershey's cookies and cream candy bar if you've ever had that sort of white chocolate with little bits of like crunchy bits of cookie in there with some mint taste let me see if I can get a cross-sectional here well you don't get a much better idea but you can see like the little cookie bits in there maybe um a little bit of cannabis toast but not too bad for a 250 milligram definitely not gonna dread finishing all of these off they're not bad at all um I wouldn't say they're pleasant but it's it's not going to upset me to have to eat this whole can here which is a nice plus so guys I've really got my fingers crossed for these I'm hoping these are gonna be a little a little nugget of gold how about that so guys to find out for sure if these are gonna work for us you have to do stick around for a couple of seconds otherwise I'll see you guys in just a couple of hours for me to let you know how I am feeling thanks for much for watching wheats and I will see you in just a bit it has not been two hours since I checked in it has not been three hours it's not even been four hours and I do apologize guys it's been closer to the 10 hours and why is that well that's because I think that bud man's edible nugs might be an really [ __ ] impressive product this put me out rarely do edibles get me sleeping anymore and this one got me sleeping on the couch last night that's why I'm here to you the next morning to check in with you guys cuz I fell asleep these hit me really hard I was super super impressed with them I would say they're definitely 250 milligrams I really enjoyed the taste the price was right it says 20 bucks but I think I got a discount for like 17 everything about this was a real win for me um just in case any time I find one of these products that seems to be just an anomalously good product I do like to double check make sure it's as good as I had thought initially so I wouldn't tell you to hesitate to pick these up I'd say you know if you seemed at your dispensary grab them but I will be reviewing another flavor in the future for sure just to make sure they're as good as I originally thought but for right now I can tell you guys bud man's edible nugs is is a true winner absolutely over the moon with it cute thumbs way up thank you guys uh really really happy with this one now I'm just repeating myself so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on the next review and hopefully it'll be as good as bud man's here thanks for watching", "54tb-t4EU3M": "[Music]", "x4t_d1Y4kfo": "[Music] he put Romanum migrant and up equally smart sharpen up my grain tilapia Nadi

review an edible product from a bakery here in Denver Colorado this bakery is called sweet grass kitchen and they manufacture all sorts of edibles and this edible I bought from the giving tree dispensary in Highland part of denver and it looks pretty tasty there is no description of what the THC is content or the CBD the cannabinoid content is in this product but remember them saying they said it was 50 or 60 milligrams I can't say to be sure and being then my dosage right now I pretty well in that 20 milligrams I will cut this into thirds and give it a try so the manufacturer makes this its well actually it says sixty eight milligrams of MMJ butter on the ingredients on the back so it's 68 milligrams so I better be careful with that the other ingredients are eggs sugar flour vanilla baking soda chocolate salt and that's it no preservatives or anything like that fries are consumed by September 14 2012 batch number 61 so let's open this thing up this is going to be like an unboxing video for you gadget you this is a this is a marijuana edible unboxing for all used marijuana geeks there you go so what do we got here it looks like a brownian looks kind of like a flat cupcake if you look at it smells just like a brownie I don't smell anything unusual seems a little bit dry and the taste you can taste a little bit of that bitterness of the can of butter in there and from their website the sweetgrass kitchen website they say they don't use hash or hash oil they use only cannabutter and their products so let's see I'm going to take about a third of this I think and give it a whirl let's see what they think that is I'd say that's about a third yeah I can taste it not bad but definitely that hint of bitterness or I don't know if he can tell you've tasted it you don't know that once you know that once you've tasted this once you recognize and instantly in any product that you eat but I don't think anybody that never had one before would recognize that this is a tainted brownie hopefully tastes quite good a little bit more for good measure here just a little bit so with with edibles it can take for me up to two hours to get to peak dosage and that's why I've talked a lot of people they don't like edibles for one for the reason it takes so long to take effect another reason is you don't know how much to take and if you've taken too much it's too late okay so I'm going to take I've taken this now it'll take probably between an hour to two hours for me to hit peak dosage I don't plan on getting online at that point and recording it because I'm probably very likely won't be very lucid that's you know very understandable with cannabis that's a very common in my case a side effect it's not an unenjoyable side effect but it is a side effect for the pain relief so for my reviews of edibles and if I move into vaporization on the different flower that I use their I plan on using a one to 10 rating for these products and there'll be several categories that all rank and then bunch together the first one is going to be simple taste is it edible or does it make you throw up hopefully not that but I mean that's hyperbole but if it's good or unpleasant to eat is it only taking cough syrup versus eating something enjoyable and that will be ranked 1 through 10 the two will be very important and this will be the most heavily weighted one is pain relief it's late afternoon here and usually that's when my back really starts to take and yes I'm my back is aching my pain down my left leg is definitely there some tingling so this will be a good test to see how this handle said so and again my pain relief I guess I'll we use that name smiley face scale and say I was at this pain level I'm right now at about a four or five and see where I go from there and at that point I will rank pain relief the quality of it based on a 1 through 10 that's highly subjective of course but that's a my review and 3 i'm going to rank it on side effects being that distant does not describe whether it's a sativa or indica brownie i don't know exactly how it's going to affect me so if i get some serious couch lock meaning for people don't know what that means it makes you very sedentary it locks you to the couch another another category of side effects is can i function in public what can I go out have a walk go to the grocery store not drive but just get out and function in public that I feel is important as well and third I consider drowsiness is a side effect I don't want to take this in an hour and a half later it's about 6pm here now I don't want to be asleep by eight at that point those are and the fourth criteria will be a price what is the bang for your buck and I'm going to do this very simply simple if it's 68 milligrams of THC components or active components relative the price these were five dollars each at members prices at the giving tree so you take sixty eight milligrams / 5 and that comes out to thirteen point six milligrams per dollar so that's going to be my rating and that I mean I don't know how can rate that one to ten but as I start doing this more and more we can see which ones give you the more bang for your buck so that's how I'm going to do the ranking so until next long until three to four hours from now I will say goodnight and I will be back with my assessment of how well does work for me until then happy chewy alright I'm back it's the next day decided not to try to do this review last night I was very fuzzy and very groggy so that's going to figure into my review significantly took the embryo and i've estimated the peak effect to hit it around seven fifteen so that was an hour and a half to an hour and 45 minutes after i ate the third of the brownie the pain relief was very very good very significant I think this was probably a heavy sativa it was more in the head to the body but I still had a really good pain relief possibly because I didn't care I don't know but it was a very good experience for that my ability to function in public was borderline at best I didn't feel comfortable going out I went for a walk but I wasn't comfortable so that is a negative hunger and munchies there was definitely a side effect there I definitely got hungry had a bowl of cereal I can try to control it but I definitely have that reptile imperative to consume food so final assessment based on my rating taste / aftertaste rating I gave it a seven not bad not great pain relief i'm going to give it a nine i think i took a little too much but i'm giving it the benefit of the doubt their side effects I've got to give it a five very very heavy feeling and made me very groggy for several hours after taking it so the side effects were pretty significant so this would be a great one for an evening like I did it edible something I should have taken if I'd taken it later it would have been better say around seven or eight o'clock at night and then you'd be ready for bed price ratio the milligrams per dollar I'd sit in my from yesterday was thirteen point six so I'm going to give that an eight I've got another edible that's comes in a lot higher than that but this is a pretty good ratio from things that I've consumed so far so you add the 725 the eight and the nine and you end up with a 7.2 rating for this sweetgrass brown of course reviews like this are highly subjective and your results may vary wildly do two variables such as your type of pain your mood and your body weight etc for this reason I would invite any user to submit feedback of your own experiences either in the comments section down below or you can actually post on information on your Google+ page or anything like that and some links to me lends to my Google+ page and my twitter feed are listed in

jj virgin nutrition and fitness expert of jjvirgin.com here today to talk to you about how to build muscle fast with diet but first i have to remind you that you can't build muscle fast with diet unless you're actually exercising right so make sure that you're lifting weights 8 to 12 repetitions of those big muscle groups repeated sets and giving yourself adequate rest and recovery between exercise bouts okay so we got that out of the way now let's talk about diet first thing is protein of course is very important here and you want to make sure you're eating protein every four hours so you'll have breakfast a lunch and afternoon snack and dinner every four hours and you want to eat about three fourths of a gram of protein per pound of lean body mass so get your body composition tested and then multiply 0.75 per your fat free mass and you'll get the amount of grams per day divided into four and there are your four meals that was a lot of math okay next thing is make sure you're also eating good carbohydrates because when you exercise you need to make sure that you have those carbohydrates to refuel your muscle stores of energy so you'll have something for the next workout so my favorite thing to do after a workout and it's really within the first hour after the workout the sooner the better is to have a high quality protein shake and i will use protein and either a banana or strawberries or a blend of both so i get that high quality protein and those carbohydrates we found of course the protein is going to help with muscle protein resynthesis and those carbohydrates are going to fuel inject right back into your muscles so you'll have more energy for next time now one more thing that i get asked all the time is should i eat before i work out the new studies are showing that if you eat a little bit before you work out not too much because remember you want the blood to be available go to working muscles not to be going to digestion if you have a little bit of something it actually allows you to get more energy out of your workout so i actually will usually do a little a protein carb energy bar before i go and that helps me get the most out of my workout i'm jj virgin of jjvirgin.com and that's how to build muscle fast with diet", "ULaV_ZP2b3Q": "[Music] hi friends welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another thing from canna candies there our first lollipop the grape medicated lollipop hundred milligrams of THC as rated by SC labs which is always great to get that little reminder that has been officially rated and it does have the THC as promised in there thanks the good folks at SC labs as I said this is my first lollipop not my first candy I've had hard candies from Canada candies before and in the grand scheme or scope of candies they're not bad I still wouldn't necessarily that wouldn't be my first choice for edibles I'd still stick with the confectionaries as always but the kind of candies are far from the worst types of candies so the lollipop I think cost me seven bucks at my dispensary which is a pretty affordable for a 100 milligram edible so let's just go ahead and open up and give it a and give it a taste here this is the first time you've ever tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this lollipop and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review not necessarily so much how it tastes so here we go we've got our big gourmet lollipop purpley black give it a lick how many to get to the center one to our you know things yep it tastes like a great bali pop without a lot of flavor and just a hint of weed exactly what I thought it was gonna be not great not terrible pretty much what you think it's gonna be as well think of a mild flavored grape lollipop with a bit of an earthy aftertaste except not as bad as sounding as that and that's what it's gonna taste like but guys without how hey how's this gonna make me feel for that you're gonna have to stay tuned and I will see you guys in two hours I'll be back right here to let you know how I'm feelin thank you so much for watching see you guys soon peace hi guys my dog squid here and I are back to talk to you about panic and ease Medicaid and lollipops the hundred milligram great flavor here I and I'm I'm kind of hi about what I would expect for a hundred milligram at all not a lot of red in the old I boss but again it's only 100 milligrams and I'm feeling about what I would think for that maybe a little bit lower probably just because it's a candy and those don't tend to hit me as hard as the confectionaries um but I don't I'm not dissatisfied with it it's again right in the sort of wheelhouse of what I was expecting didn't taste terrible I'm moderately high and for a candy it's it's one that I can recommend and it's pretty cheap bet like I said I think it cost me seven bucks so it's affordable it doesn't taste terrible and it got me pretty it got me a little high so it's what I was looking for what I was about what I was expecting if you're in the mood for a lower dose edible or if you're a new smoker and you want something a little bit higher dose that you can sort of media it out over time maybe give the lollipops a chance especially these ones from can of candies I can verify I and SC labs can verify you know they'll it will it will get you high and it doesn't taste too bad so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I really appreciate you tuning in as always we we'll see you on the next review and thank you so much for watching peace okay hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment

we're back with another cannabis edible review if you're not a subscriber hit that button so you can see the new videos we're dropping every single week yeah without further ado the Emerald Skyy licorice as you can see I've had some fun here with the Alpine strawberry there sativa it's 100 milligrams on the pack into 10 pieces and what I really like about this is they're individually wrapped which is great if you want to bring them with you anywhere or on the go because most of the times I'm putting my you know gummies or chocolate in a little container and bringing it with me but these are pre wrapped which is great and I just got in the grape new wore the indica let's see how this does strawberry tasted great I really liked it they got this cool thing here I open it up like I said individually wrapped now the price point is 22 dollars which is a little steep you know I understand that so they taste great the potency is there but the price points a little high but you know sometimes you get what you pay for and that's delicious too the greatly worn off very tasty so yeah pumps you their taste their price point I'd like to see it at 20 maybe even 18 but I think the Kiva's now the keep of chocolate bars now have gone up a price to around the same price point so as you can see I got sativa now that indica I'll Polly getting again because I really like Steve and I didn't like the strawberry and these taste really good too if you want to give these a shot and get $20 off if you want to use these for the first time I'll drop that link below solid and we're back it's been about an hour well actually 50 minutes but anyway it's got me chill definitely feel it potency is there and they're great and the beauty of these like I said they're individually packaged and it's great for micro dose you take ten milligrams cut it in half take five if you have a lower tolerance but let's wrap it up I'm gonna give these 4 out of 5 stars now why is that that's because the potency is great the taste is great but the price points not great hence the 4 out of 5 stars if you want to give these a shot and get $20 off your first order I'll drop an ease coupon code below

make sure you go check them out and you let chefs know okay okay and i think oh no no a couple other things all right so recently i have been on tick tock that's right tick tock diy or die over at tick-tock and i've been making waves baby my latest video which i posted yesterday has 52 000 views check this out there's literally a whole pack of cigarettes in just the little puff bar it's actually kind of a false equivalency but let's just entertain this idea um you're actually it's actually a good thing because you're getting this level of nicotine which is not the bad part of cigarettes or vapor products the bad part is with cigarettes you get all that combustion all that burning all those carcinogens that come from burning tobacco the tar that comes with it that's what's bad and with vapor products you don't get any of that and with high nicotine vapor products you're actually using them a lot less than a lower nicotine product so you're inhaling less pg less vg less flavorings which are not even really shown to be that detrimental but those are the more harmful aspects of vapor products so there you go all right and uh i'm i'm combating all the misinformation that's going on on tic tac i've had enough of all of the misinformation that's going on around about vaping specifically on tick tock so i took it upon myself to start correcting all these [ __ ] so head over to tiktok give me a follow and also let me know if there are any like vaping tick tock videos that you think are stupid or egregious let me know i will respond back and i'm just taking down anyone who's you know who's just lying about vaping these days that's my goal here um and honestly i didn't expect for this to really start like making you know views and stuff but it seems like uh it seems like it is so you know it looks like the people want to know more about vaping and the truth around vaping and i'm going to give it to them so diy or die over on tiktok and of course my instagram uh diy or die over on instagram i'm gonna start posting the same sort of stuff up here um you know they do have like a tick tock competitor on instagram so the same goes for instagrammer right all right everyone thank you all happy acs happy saint patty's day is that true is it saint patty's day is that actually true god damn leprechauns and four-leaf clue what is saint patty's day you know i never really understood what it was nor what it aims to accomplish hold on let's google this what is saint patrick's day so it is st patrick's day it's not saint patty's day uh st patrick uh st patrick's day or the feast of the saints or the feast of st patrick is a culture and religious celebration held on march 17th okay um interesting what's going on here so how did we get to this how did we get to this being about st pat like isn't it weird how we take these holidays or like these traditions and we just [ __ ] destroy them like what does it have to do with saint patrick's you know the leprechaun hats and the green and the [ __ ] beer drinking and i i don't know i know nothing about irish culture or st patrick's or catholic culture for that matter i know nothing about anything um okay well go drink some shamrock shakes go eat some green eggs and ham i don't know what you guys do on st patrick's day other than drink i know that a lot of people like drinking on st patrick's day stay off the road that's for sure don't be driving around on st paddy's day okay all right so we have three recipes here on the docket today first one by npa homemade banana milkshake utilizing flavor art fresh cream flavor art milk creamy vanilla by mullenberry and soft banana by mullenberry simple easy easy to understand i'm excited to try it npa has this is his second time his

fizzy sherbet capellas lemon lime polar blast and ws23 and then a new victim pro b420 with dolce de cheesecake cheesecake graham cross doji de leche graham cracker new york cheesecake and some sweetener i'm excited these are all very sort of simple easy to understand recipes they all look pretty decent i don't see anything wrong with them uh just from a glance so uh a nice easy understandable show here and um i'm gonna give out as many helpful tips and tricks as i can okay i'm gonna do my best on that matter all right cool dudes now i got in something i ordered my nicotine fridge okay so i'm going to show you guys what i ordered i didn't get this in yet i'm it should be here any any minute uh wine fridge i guess no no no wine no this is the one here so i ordered this okay i put an order in for this it should be here in the next uh few hours maybe the schmeck 12 bottle compressor wine cooler refrigerator with lock large freestanding wine cellar 41 degrees to 64 degrees fahrenheit digital temperature control wine fridge for red white champagne or sparkling wine now you might be like why would wayne buy a wine fridge wouldn't you rather buy a freezer not necessarily not necessarily kind of but not necessarily so the reason i went with this instead of like a freezer or a chest for one this is just nicer looking right you can lock it up you don't have to worry about anyone getting in there if they don't have the key to it you could do that with a chest of course but this is like a nice freestanding one but it's just cheap it's 200 bucks it ships to you in a couple days and it's got temperature stability i i will let you know how stable the temperature actually is with this you know i'm not exactly sure that that will be found out but if this is one of the selling points that's why so when we look at what carolina extract says over on their nicotine website okay when we go to their faq which is uh i don't know where how to find it let's see here let me see if i can find it carolina f extract q freezer maybe google that faq okay here it is all right so when we go to carolina extracts faq on their website they state here okay should i store nicotine products in the freezer and then it says if you know that your freezer will maintain temperature below 30 degrees fahrenheit or negative 1 degrees celsius then yes otherwise no damage can occur to 100 milligram per milliliter nicotine products when oxidized when oxides form during near freeze thaw cycles caused by a temperature caused by temperature fluctuations of some freezer units but not all such fluctuations are typically caused by opening the freezer door and outside weather affecting the efficiency of the unit typical refrigeration temperatures or even room temperatures are a much safer storage range because they are well away from freeze thaw potential so this is really where you kind of want to pay attention is with that freeze thaw i guess area because that can introduce oxides when that happens now if you can maintain most freezers should be able to maintain a freezing temperature but if you don't know that for certain then it's a good idea to maybe find a chest or a wine fridge that can do that where it can just maintain a temperature so that's what i'm planning on doing um i planned on i planned on this product here this is exactly what i what i want to do so i ordered a bunch more nicotine so i can fill this thing up and i also ordered here some little uh i believe these are two ounces i ordered a couple two ounces that i'm going to fill up and they're also going to go in there and i got in the art spray so now we're going to be able to once i get my my new nicotine batch because my other nicotine it it's crazy this feels like it's empty it feels like they sold me an empty bottle but um it comes with a nice little cork let's see if the cork fits on these i don't think they will huh nah uh polycone lids but once the other batch of nicotine comes to me i'm gonna break them down into these bottles okay so i'm gonna get the nicotine i'm gonna fill this up and then i'm gonna screw it down chuck that in the fridge and i'm not touching it ever until i need to touch it do you understand so each of these filled with 100 milligrams per milliliter i'm stuck baby i'm good to go are you good to go that's the question right are you good to go me and my family and all my friends who vape don't ever have to worry about nicotine ever again okay so that's kind of the point that i wanted to to get no i shouldn't have crushed this because i kind of want to store this uh we don't have to worry about it right this is the this is where you might want to position yourself so you just don't have to worry about it can you get in the future can you not get in the future can you get it shipped can you get it black market can can companies from china send it over and call it massage oils nothing like that is known right now it's just a wait and see game so if you have the funds it doesn't hurt to be prepared if you don't have the funds i i i feel bad for you honestly i feel bad for you it sucks but welcome to america where the politicians decide on things without any input from you know the constituents okay so once i get the fridge in we'll do a little video on like nice proper storage so would i love it if this could be a sub you know refrigerator or temperature refrigerator sure i would but um this was 200 bucks and it was shipped and i rather kind of do it this way it's the the cheapest easiest way to show all of you guys how i'm doing it just so we can maintain you know the cheapest way possible and just know that it will work okay so that's what's going on here um and you can see all here here are the other specs which you know it all of this stuff rewind goes for nicotine as well temperature stability it's uv resistant so any sort of light that shines on it you don't have to worry about it it's going to go through the you know the stained glass the uv light is not going to go through the stained glass nor is it gonna go through the stained glass and then through the amber bottle so you don't have to worry about that uh it's got like a nice look to it you can lock it up so no kids can get into there if you have children um and yeah and honestly the best sort of way maybe i'll do this in the future is put some sort of like battery system so this would instead of plugging straight into the wall would plug into like a battery generator and then have that generator plugged into the wall just in case if power goes out it doesn't sort of affect the temperature it just keeps it running you know what i mean um that's a little bit paranoid thinking but it is the best way to do it and if you are spending like a thousand dollars on nicotine maybe it is a good idea to go that route you know it's really up to you on uh how crazy you want to take it so there we go there we go that's my uh my uh vape apocalypse um what is it called uh what are those people prepping system that's my prep there's my my bunker my nicotine bunker if you will um and yeah i'll be making videos about all of this once it all gets here should be here today i got everything else i just need that stuff i need that stuff all right what's going on everyone you guys have any questions comments anything you want to ask before we start getting into some mixing here um chasing classes don't want to be a bummer but can my dad get some prayers we just found out he has a lymphoma cancer oh man uh sad to hear man sad to hear prayers shout out to some prayers to chasing clouds hopefully your dad can overcome it i know nothing about that does it have anything to do with your lymph nodes is that why it's called lymphoma i don't know sorry to hear man stay strong you should do a video on storing your nicotine with that gas stuff yeah we will be for sure i have a huge bottle of 100 stored under argon from years ago yeah we're definitely gonna do that and i'll let you know if one bottle is enough to fill i don't know how many 120s or or two ounces two ounces 120 right i bought a few liters of nick so hopefully it will get me by for a while yeah a few liters is is a lot a few liters is a lot you know um you know it kind of sucks for uh for those who aren't in the know right if you aren't watching this channel if you aren't you know in vaping it's hard to know about all of this stuff it really sucks how are you like how how are you going to get by are you going to go back to smoking seems like that's what the government wants you to do i did not get the vso apple and that's why you're not on today sorry buddy i had my weightless arg good deal had my weightless argon cannon bottles arrived last week now a little over two liters of nick to store wait have you got your one shots figured out for shipping well as far as i can tell they should ship just fine they should just ship just fine uh we'll see what's going on with liquid barn but the ones over at flavor jungle there's we have no issues with them it's not a nicotine product it's not a vaping product it's a flavor product from a flavoring company you know what i'm saying should ship just fine now with liquid barn things might get a little interesting we're going to see kind of where they're taking it are they going to continue being a nicotine company are they going to become a flavoring company are they going to separate the departments you know is liquibar nick a different department from liquid barn flavor we'll see uh we've talked about it a little bit but there are no concrete answers it's kind of a wait-and-see game for all of the nicotine companies nicotine river included stuff like that we kind of just need to see where the where the chips lay um but in terms of just the just the flavorings over at flavor jungle they're they're not vapor products and they're not vaping pro they're not vaping products and they're not nicotine products they're not tobacco products so don't have to worry about that now if the government says like i told you guys if the government says you can't ship flavorings anymore then where i'm out of here i'm not a us citizen anymore and i and i hope it really comes across as like i'm not kidding about that if the government tells you you can't buy flavorings or ship flavorings you now live in a communist country and i don't care what anyone says about that it's it that's out of the question so if we get to that point you'll know because i won't be here anymore we'll be streaming out of some i don't know shed in the uk or something but we're not there just yet technically we kind of are but we're not there just yet hello wayne i'm a canadian communist thanks for that bc has zero issues with nicotine and flavorings there's flavor bands hitting canada federally this year this bc has issues with zero nick and flavorings there's flavor bands hitting canada federally this year um do you mean like you can't they won't allow you to ship flavorings at all is that what you're trying to say i've been canada been bugging fusion flavors to bug you they carry your stuff but barely um yeah tell them to contact me for sure for sure they can pick up some stuff canada is on its way there uh health canada soon will be releasing a canada gazette to propose a federal flavor ban we now have credible information indicating that we may see the release of the gazette part one as early as may uh in my country politicians are surely waiting for what else to do in the u.s politicians are so useless that they don't even think for themselves but you know the third world country what country are you talking about bobby told me they were going to be just flavors when you say you're talking about liquid barn are you talking about liquid barn two ounces is six milliliters right so four ounces those are four ounce bottles thank you for that four ounces is 120 correct um canada's on its way there especially notice grocery restrictions here are [ __ ] so when you say like you can't ship flavorings like that's my question just flavorings from a flairing company not a vaping company that's my question if that happens i mean let me let me put it this way if the u.s says you can't ship flavorings or any anywhere that i live says you can't ship flavorings i'm not doing this whole thing anymore i'm i'm becoming an advocate or an activist against the government because there's no point in living in a country where they're restricting your access to flavor for no reason and i hope that makes sense like i hope the severity of that makes sense like it's not a joke imagine if the government for no reason for there's no benefit to it they're just doing it because they don't actually know the industry imagine the industry said you can't ship certain colors anymore you can't buy certain colors of paint because a kid might use them to draw a red swastika so you can't buy certain colors of paint everyone would go [ __ ] insane and you would be like this is crazy we're living in a crazy country right now living in a dictatorship you could do that for sounds right you can't make music with certain sounds you can't ship certain instruments because they make certain sounds because a kid might use it to make a sound of i don't know sex noises or whatever they would deem is bad right you'd be like what the [ __ ] is going that's this that's the same level of what's going on with flavorings if they do that with flavorings it's a bad we're in a bad we're no longer having fun vaping we are now revolting against the government a tyrannical government you know i like i might even consider like suing like i would might even consider suing taking it trying to take it to like the supreme [ __ ] chord on that it's [ __ ] outrageous it's outrageous maybe i don't know maybe no one else thinks of it that way maybe i'm the only one that thinks of it that way i see when i bring this up to people when we talk about flavor bands they kind of go oh yeah i guess that is kind of crazy like they don't think of like wait a second they're restricting access to to flavor let alone just vaping it just the the just the access to it alone you know we sell flavorings at our shop to mix with unflavored base marketed as water concentrates boss was saying they might change to a diy soap supply shop to get around the vape tax on the vgpg nick yeah okay well we'll see if that works uh now i understand not saying i agree with it but i understand a company saying if you ship this vape product with nicotine along with this flavoring product then of course you know can't do that you can't just you can't do that but in terms of like look this is a multi-purpose flavoring it's just a flavoring you can't ship it bad news bad [ __ ] news because there's no precedence for that there's no precedence for that they're limiting your access to a specific sense that's 1984 bad we're we're not having fun anymore this is not a joke anymore we're we're now living in a dictatorship if your country already does that they get the [ __ ] i mean you gotta do something because i don't know what to tell you i don't know what to tell you you're living in a you lit you're living in a prison you're not living in a country you're not living in a state you're living somewhere like a prison i feel the same way unjust laws need to be challenged on an individual level yeah that would be that would be where i would draw the line and say okay it's time to it's time to really fight for your rights you know what i mean now how to go about that i don't know i don't know the logistics of that i would happily figure out a way though i would dedicate my entire life to it or i would just move i mean that's the easiest thing i would just move to a different country that didn't have a dictatorship essentially but i have the means to do that not everyone has the means to do that you might just be screwed you just can't know what strawberry flavor tastes like um okay the supreme court won't do its job i have a lot of faith in the supreme court to be honest it's not a perfect system for sure but i do have faith in its uh i'm not that i'm not i'm not that i'm not uh i have more worry about like lower courts and how lower courts would rule on something like that than the supreme court sort of ruling on supreme court usually gets things pretty right maybe after some time but for the most part i have more faith in that than anything else in the justice system come to the uk wayne you know every day that goes by i think more and more about that for sure every day that goes by all right just order 2 liters cnt and watermelon hell yeah baby cesaro round of applause four boxes of samoas and some other ones are my brother all i care about are the most samoans right isn't that how you say sumo wins all right you need to live in a state where a governor tells the feds to stuff it yeah true that is true i don't have faith in governors though i mean pa is not too bad but we'll see you know when the when [ __ ] starts to hit the fan we'll see if they really care you say no samoas yeah but is it aren't multiple samoas samoans i don't know what i'm talking about florida should i come to florida it's too hot i lived in florida for a year i did enjoy my time in florida do you remember when that guy ate that dude's face on the uh highway uh that guy ate he was on basalt and ate that dude's face i lived right there that's where i lived in lantana florida right next to palm beach i did enjoy it florida was pretty cool but i don't know if i could live live live there it's a little wild all right well let's start mixing while we keep talking about florida and eating faces all right let's do the banan let's do the dolce de leche cheesecake first here it's from a new victim pro b420 okay looks good to me i don't see anything wrong with what i'm seeing here saying a 14 day steep okay not off to a good start we're not off to a good start but hey man i am uh i am alone on in my thoughts about steeping it doesn't seem like anyone else agrees what's going on with this all right sorry about that all right is that probie no we get the wrong bottle here i went and i labeled bottles for you guys today all right so we can see what we're doing alrighty then here we go here we go got governor cuomo here he's trustworthy oh yeah very nice i wish you all the best in your endeavors yeah it's a shame kind of how new new york is a beautiful state if you guys have never been to new york it's got great hiking it's got great like seasonal weather like if you like the seasons um you know upstate new york gets pretty cold but overall it's like a it's a great state that's just completely destroyed i hate to break it to you but like the constituents you know a lot of the people that live in new york just vote against their ins their their interests maybe it's new york city that does it um but for the most part it's like you know the governor's there the law is there it's such a nanny state it's a shame really you know pa is kind of a lot like new york except just a little i would say like a little bit more southern in its law making and it's uh you know it's a little bit redder of a state which is kind of what you want you want a more balanced approach to your legislatures and your laws in your state you know you don't want to you don't want you don't want either too far right or too far left it's policies you kind of want to smack in the middle there seems to be this anti-centrist movement going on also which i don't understand so he's using tfa sweetener i'm just gonna go a half a percent of super sweet normally i would do exactly the type of sweetener you tell me but here i just don't feel like digging it out i don't really use tfa sweeter i don't recommend tfa sweetener uh where's my base where did i put my piece what the [ __ ] yeah this cnt stuff has been uh sitting room temperature opened uh almost i mean pretty much daily i open and close this bottle you know multiple times a day and it's still spot on and i've had that for a few months now maybe maybe a year now maybe over a year it's still good like this stuff lasts pretty good if you just make sure you're closing it you're storing it away from any sort of light or heat don't have to worry too much about temperature i believe states need to have an electoral college most big cities rule the rest of the state yeah for sure for sure you know at least here in pa you know the laws that philadelphia imposes don't necessarily attract with the rest of the laws the state imposes you know you do have some sort of municipality separation but i don't know how that goes for other states and other cities like you can see like at least in the case of new york new york city definitely influences a lot of the rest of the state but i don't know like the ins and outs of new york law so don't quote me on that they said the city smell bad new york city come to philly it's all fake news it's phony stuff it didn't happen you're not alone on steeping sure i mag stir for a bit but after that i never see a difference in stuffing a bottle away for 50 years i believe uh all right i read that one all right dolce the cheesecake here here we go dolce de no that's not correct milk is leche dulce dulce dulce a sweet food or drinks it just means sweet what does it mean sweet sweet cheesecake does it mean like caramel or something i don't know it's got a good smell to it it definitely smells cheese cakey which is not you know not a obviously a bad thing it is sweet let's give it a rip not a lot of depth from the hand test pretty good not too bad i can see why you want to steep it for two weeks steeping would actually help in this situation i'm not gonna lie sleeping would help a little bit here um all right let's get to some points here your cheesecake is a a little coconutty and that's really just a product of the cheesecake that you're using the tfa cheesecake and new york cheesecake it's a little coconutty like you get a little bit of that coconut note i don't think it works very well in cheesecake it's hard to get around because it's so prominent in tfa cheesecake steeping does help that and that's why i really think you know this would benefit from a steep it doesn't get rid of it but it helps it a little bit four percent and then you have three and a half of cheesecake two i use cheesecake one i don't have cheesecake too they're not very different um and the dolce de leche gives it a kind of like a nice sort of nuttiness it gives a little bit of depth but that's kind of where i think this is really lacking the depth of the flavor we're not talking about volume here we're not talking about um you know uh width we're not talking about like uh flavor stage or anything like that just simple depth of flavor i pick up cheesecake pick up a little dairy and then i pick up like a touch of nuttiness sweetness and that's really it there's really not much to it i'm not really getting a big graham cracker note maybe a touch of it maybe a touch of it but i would like to see that improved in some way um tfa graham cracker might not be your best answer for that it seems to only accentuate the coconut note but it's not bad and i think you have a pretty good base here if you just continue working on it i think you can have something really good my tips would be figure out a way [Music] to um [Music] figure out a way to get your cheesecake a little bit more cheesy but i don't mean that in the way of like a yogurty cheese i mean it more in the way of like almost like texture try to get some sort of fluffiness going on here because that's really just going to kind of broaden your flavor stage a little bit and then maybe you can add a little bit more accent to the to your recipe to give it a little bit more depth so whether it's a little bit of caramel butterscotch um maybe it's another vanilla maybe you go brighter and you go with another vanilla it also help kind of separate out your graham cracker it's just not too much here to really get excited about you know what i mean like it tastes fine but it's not a very exciting mix which i'm assuming why you sent it in you want tips to how do i make this better how do i get this to that next level right white sweetener instead of tfa sure yeah flavor west sweetener at like .25.5 um tfa is not the best sweetener to use but that's not really the issue i don't think it's more so just the flavor really am i roboting oh no [Music] what the [ __ ] man are you kidding this is getting annoying if i'm robotic i have to literally reset my computer it stopped if it robots again it's gonna do it again i feel like aaron bieber [ __ ] man it's just so annoying it's been doing it the whole time on and off uh we'll just have to be quick then we'll just be quick [ __ ] no it's windows windows [ __ ] sucks some driver's messed up and when my computer goes to sleep and i don't reset it my drivers get roboty sometimes all right look we're just gonna have to be quick i apologize all right um i just have to remember to restart or just not use windows anymore um okay so going back to this going back to this not a very exciting recipe just off your score we're gonna give you a two and a half this is very average i think of being uh a little bit generous here with the two and a half out of five you caught me on a good day i kind of want to give it a 2 2.25 um i want to see more from it is really what i want to see i want to see i want to see this added with some added depth so try to figure out maybe accentuate some of the nuttiness that's going on with your recipe maybe try to add different accents such as like another caramel um another butterscotch something else you know what i mean throw something else in there like that try to figure out something to really kind of take this to the next level and then try to fluff up your cheesecake a bit you know what i'm saying try to get a little bit more fluffiness going on you could do that with you could try it with yogurts you could try it with like some sort of whipped cream some sort of fresh cream you could try it with different types of creams you could try with a different cheesecake maybe try mullenberry's panna cotta i've been having a lot of fun with that ingredient you could try there's a lot of different ways you can go down that route because what's that going to do it's going to give you a little separation it's going to allow you to infuse another accent or two in there and it's going to just give you a little bit it's going to be a little bit more forgiving um and yeah there's a little bit of like that coconut off note but overall i think it will steep out i don't think it's that much of an issue it's not bad though like i don't want to say it's a bad recipe it's got a good taste good flavor to it it's just not very exciting it's not something that excites there's no excitement to it you know if this was the first ever cheesecake maybe but it's not this is you know the millionth cheesecake here someone says hanks in italian cream yeah yeah you can go like that route you can go the vanilla pudding route you have a good base layer just need to figure out what to do with it okay two and a half out of five well i'll give you the average you're like again you're lucky you cut me on a good day i want to get to give it a two 2.25 but we'll keep it there for now all right let's do the banana milkshake another very simple mix here simple straightforward just how i like it i'm saying let's mix this up here so this includes fresh cream and a half let me adapt this before i make 70 mls of it oh yeah baby okay fresh cream half a percent just a touch just a drop not a lot what's that from is it from art class when you were in school anyone ever say that to you just a drop not a lot one percent creamy vanilla by mullenberry this skill seems better days hey i use my skills i put the work in on these scales all right if you see a clean scale don't trust a mixer with a clean scale that's what i say we got one and a half of flavor arts milk classic flavor art milk dap bonanza and the three percent soft banana by mullenberry which is possibly one of the best banana ingredients you can get very good stuff and a touch of sweet you know i saw a post on reddit that said is sweetener necessary they were talking about hey i see wayne when he mixes he uses a lot of sweetener well he uses sweetener in every recipe basically this is a conversation that comes up a lot but the the the let me put it this way if you are acclimated to commercial e-liquid then it's a good idea to get it it's a good idea to get it and use it at a half a percent super sweet um of course you know sucralose based sweetener but it's really what it does is that it increases it it cuts out a lot of development time it increases your presence of your recipe by like 10 times you know not even like 10 like 10 times increases the presence without having to need to go through that extreme amount of development time to replicate it without sweetener cause like you can do all of this stuff without sweetener it's just gonna take you a really long time to develop it and it's gonna you know you're gonna leave out a lot of profiles that you wouldn't otherwise be able to make as saturated so it's like a cheat code it is like a cheat code it can quickly become a crutch and that's something you have to watch out for but um you know if you want something that's very present very saturated very vivid sweetener just helps you get there without worrying about that extremely long development cycle so like some of my best work has been made without sweeteners it can be done it just you know those recipes took months to make for no real benefit other than like do you want a vape sweetener or not you know do you do you want to inhale sucralose or not that's really the that's really the uh where the contention comes into play so here's the recipe sorry also when you go sweetener it's very difficult to go back that's the other thing too so if you don't if you can vape and you're completely fine without sweetener just know when you start using sweetener it's hard to go back nothing is going to taste as saturated or as potent or i shouldn't say nothing but most recipes aren't because no one really that that mixes without sweetener takes the time to develop as if they're trying to replicate something with sweetener usually a mixer who mixes without sweetener mixes with that like they vape without sweetener they they want it less sweet they want it less present you know what i mean but there are some occasions where you know someone who can post up a recipe and it's vivid and bright and saturated without the sweetener included because they took the time to develop it that way just going back to the nicotine i would freeze the nick i think carolina extracts information is wrong i had in the freezer for five years just what i think i don't know if it's wrong i wouldn't say it's wrong it's just i think it's a i think they're being a little bit more overly cautious is what is how i read it they're basically saying like we don't know what type of freezer you're using if you're in that freeze thaw threshold a lot with your crappy home freezer then you know you could be ruining your product so they just say look there's really no detriment to putting it somewhere that maintains the same temperature obviously you don't want it in a hot environment but they were they were like you know a refrigerator is a better option because you're not getting to that freeze throt freeze thaw area so most freezers i would say probably can maintain a good freeze temperature but it really isn't about that it's really more so just oxygen heat and light you know oxygen heat and light is what's going to degrade your nicotine um not you know keeping it frozen slows that process down but ultimately if any of those attributes were added to the equation it's still going to the grade does that make sense did i say that in a way that made sense all right i use sweeter and all my mixes but i am concerned about diabetes you don't have to be uh i was in contact with someone with diabetes and they were concerned about sweetener and they said not an issue for them yeah so like going back to the nicotine that's why i'm going with this method with the wine refrigerator essentially um i don't have to worry about the freeze thaw cycle at all you know what i mean i could just pop out a bottle of nicotine let it sit and it's not going to go through a defrost it's going to just you know slightly come up to warm temperature which is only 10 20 degrees from whatever temperature i'm going to set it at and it's going to keep just as long you'll see you'll see once we put it in there you can certainly freeze it don't get me wrong you can absolutely freeze it but it does it does bring up more points of failure than not um you know i have multiple bottles that have just been sitting because i don't have room for them in my freezer that have just been sitting in my closet you know all right here we go homemade banana milk i'm very excited for this one i haven't had a banana milkshake flavor in a long long time smells good tastes a little runty on the hand okay not bad it's a little disappointing unfortunately i hate to break it to you let's read your notes here very simple profile it tastes like you put a banana and milk in a blender nothing artificial depending on how green you like your banana you can add some mb soft banana at four percent it's quite green at five percent it's mostly peel interesting testing haku vena okay thank you for your testing notes a round of applause for anyone who has their testing notes of course yeah let's just let let's sit on this person let's sit on this for a second oh slushy critique yes send in you submit your recipes man submit submit i'm roboting this is so annoying i didn't know it started to do it to my microphones okay well someone said robot alrighty then okay okay okay i have i have a few of your recipes slushie well i have like a mint chocolate chip one or something there might be another one too all right this is good this is simple that you you do say you wanted a very simple profile this is simple but it to me i'm going to be a stickler here to me it tastes as if it tastes like you just didn't the simplicity is missed in the profile your your flavorings that are are added are simple but the taste of it in my opinion the execution didn't quite work it's a it to me it tastes more like a banana cream with cream if that makes sense i'm not getting like a banana milkshake you're not really hitting that very simple profile um just because you developed it in a simple way doesn't mean it's a simple flavor right you know what i'm saying there it just kind of comes through like uh um just a bit lacking kind of like the last one a little bit lacking like the idea of simplicity shouldn't be about you making a simple recipe that the flavor itself could be simple you know yeah i apologize we're just gonna have to run through this i i'm gonna i would have to shut the whole [ __ ] thing down and restart we'll just go right through it whatever the last episode doesn't matter it won't happen again i'll just remember to reset every time i go live you do have a good base here the soft banana is a smart move three percent i think it works as well um i would like to see a little bit more of like a natural banana flavor to me there is a little bit of like a banana runt flavor like a candy banana banana cream flavor that could be worked out you know where it could be a little bit more natural maybe include some sort of like baked more baked banana flavor in there and i would really just like to see more of an emphasis on the milkshake part um i think that's where you could really let this recipe shine it just to me it's not shaky enough it's a little bit more like creamy less so milk shaky like i want something to kind of add some again like some sort of volume being included maybe a cheesecake in here for instance that that to really kind of give it some density some weight um maybe some sort of like richer cream you know all the creams that we were talking about in the cheesecake would apply here as well you know try to mess around with that to really see where you think this profile can go to meet that milkshake idea yeah i i i apologize it's pleasant you got a pleasant flavor here for sure it is pleasant i love banana i love but like my my the the flavor that got me into vaping was a banana it was epic vanilla which was a banana vanilla flavor very similar to this so there is some sort of like an underlying bias here yeah i i think we're gonna give you a three out of five a little above average here three out of five a little above average a little above average oh i see that's that explosion is probably louder than this explosion isn't it yeah see i got to change the volume on those things as well three out of five um i'm giving you a little above average mainly because i do think you have a nice sort of base layer going on like you've got a good start here but it's still kind of falling into the same trap as the other one where i just want to see a little bit more depth to it it does you don't have to make it more intricate you don't have to add more notes to it but give me something to hold on to something to bring my interest some sort of intrigue to the recipe whether that's making that milkshake super accurate that's the thing with simple profiles guys when you're doing something simple it doesn't just mean like a sim like they're simple in two ways you can make a simple recipe where it's just a couple ingredients or you can make a simple profile which is what this person which is what mpa is saying here right he wants a simple profile banana milkshake right well that doesn't mean your recipe has to also be simple okay um so like i said give me something to hold on to when you're doing something simple a simple profile you really want to sell it you really want to sell that through so strawberry you're just doing a strawberry make it the best [ __ ] shrubbery you've ever had that's what's really going to bring people to it don't just go okay this is a simple strawberry and it tastes like every other [ __ ] strawberry that we mixed up you know what i mean in this case you're on your way there but it does taste very very sort of like this is a banana cream with another cream added to it and they're not doing anything really new and you're not bringing any interest to the profile and i'm more partial to this because i do love like i said banana flavors so yeah um that's my big critique for you there you need to kind of think about where you want to take it do you want a better banana flavor do you want something to really bring that banana in or do you want to work more on like that milkshake base do you really want to make like a super accurate milkshake to bring people in that way you could try to do both um yeah that's it that's basically it so that there's my big sort of uh there's my big sort of uh lesson for the day simple when you do a simple profile not a simple recipe simple recipe is different a simple profile really try to sell it really really try to sell that thing make it the best blank that you could possibly do because it's only going to really further that idea like wow i love you know i have someone who really loves blueberry flavors like blow their mind right when you're making them a blueberry recipe or you're going down that simple route make it the best make it so vibrant or so accurate or so you know what i mean bring bring something to it bring something to it don't don't just say i'm making a simple blueberry and then you just give me flavor west blueberry because that's like okay well this is simple in the fact that like you didn't really work hard on it you know you mean you didn't really develop it you just said it's as simple because you just used one ingredient that's that that's a simple recipe that's a different story okay there's my big uh lesson for the day and it goes for both of those recipes it goes through both of those recipes the dulce de cheesecake and uh the homemade banana milkshake both are simple but they're like simple in the sense that it's like boring you know you submitted a different recipe all right from russia with love um you can send it to my email if you're not using twitch you could send through discord send it here oh just know that if you send it through twitch you're uh more likely to be on sooner i should say okay yeah we're gonna start opening them up a little bit more as it seems like i have to force you guys to send recipes all right cherry cheesecake i'm sorry cherry sprite cherry cheesecake cherry sprite cherry sprite very nice okay anywhere cherries one and a half i can't afford to pay for sending in recipes you don't have to pay you don't have to pay do you mean like the amount of watch time needed yeah i don't know maybe it's not calculating the points correctly maybe that's what's going on let's see how many points you have type in let me see how many points you have days for glory cherry extract at one and a half oh you have enough points what do you mean fizzy sherbet by vape train two percent so um the way you do it make sure you sign into your twitch name on stream elements so go to that link and make sure you're signed into your twitch name three percent lemon lime and then you do critique recipe which is a thousand points polar blast nws23 okay polar blast nws23 oh actually i don't know if i haven't i don't have any uh i don't have any we're gonna have to pretend like i use some [ __ ] i thought i totally forgot about it well let's see let's if it if if i feel like it's not good then we'll postpone this damn dude i don't have any ws23 i need to go to flavor jungle the lucy mint do i have to watch on twitch to get points yes but you can just submit through email if you want recipe straight from canada all right okay okay if you want seven up verse sprite check out this cherry up very similar to this kind of i'm waiting on a pie crust for your recipe one-on-one pie crust the one that you submitted i don't have any ws anything i have culada that's it it's okay it's whatever there's a little bit of a caveat here you know what's also really nice about soft banana it doesn't stick to your coil like other bananas you can drip on top of it and the banana goes away like like lorenz banana cream some other bananas too like like flavor art banana they do not leave your coil man all right here's cherry sprite by morency morrissey recently picked up a bunch of flavors i was really wanting a good cherry recipe i took the base from iutenti's one two three uh cranberry spring replaced the flavor cranberry with a combination of vinegar cherries and cherry extract didn't really know where to start with them so i kind of guessed this result is my cherry sprite recipe good shaking vape but after a couple days seeping it really shines doesn't have that medicinal cherry taste the cherries are definitely the forefront but the spread is there just enough in the background to give it a subtly uh fizzy lemon lime taste in the excellent i also added some polar blast at 3s23 to give it a chilled cool feel so it seems like the the coolant isn't really uh that necessary to the recipe test it on the citadel thank you for your testing notes 28 dads super fun what's that a bad bad bad that's dad here we go fantastic fantastic fantastic jello see ice that would involve me digging out my delusion i just have no i have no interest in doing so graham is such a delosie shill i need another i need a bigger shelf that's the thing i only bought a six a six six block shelf and i threw away my eight block shelf or no i threw away my uh i have a nine block shelf i threw it with my 16 block shelf which was a bad move the one that i had in my out my old office that might have been a 12 block show nonetheless i'm i'm out of blocks and i need more this tastes excellent this tastes like cherry sprite man this tastes excellent it's definitely um it's definitely like more along the lines of like a um how do you put it the pull the blast works actually really well i really i i really like it i really [ __ ] like it to me it's definitely like it keeps the vibe of sprite more than the cherry like to me like cherry sprite i don't even know if is cherry spread a thing there's a bottle here i don't know if i've ever had it but it definitely has like a sprite like a really good sprite vibe to it with like a nice sort of ride out on cherry i was a little afraid your uh cherry extract wasn't gonna bring much to the table but it seems like it does i don't know if it's really the anywhere cherries that's pulling that along every time i've used cherry extract i've been kind of not impressed by it it's kind of thin and light but i mean i'm getting a really good cherry note here but real i'm really impressed by is like that lime and lemon fizzy sherbet lemon lime and fizzy sugar i mean that's sprite that's [ __ ] sprite it's a very nice sprite flavor this is a fun vape too someone rated you three stars let's see why citadel rda uh one week light cherry comes first then astringent lemon quite thin with the predominance top notes that's interesting um might be good for your mouth something and that's interesting i actually think the opposite i actually think the opposite i think this works really well i think this works really well i don't get an astringent lemon maybe their lemon lime is bad or something or maybe too much fizzy sherbet we're gonna go 4 out of 5. [Applause] [Music] i just see my where i'm talking and then i see the red when i press that button i see the red bar just burn [Laughter] yeah vape train fizzy sherbet it's pretty [ __ ] good with the cap lemon lime really sells the sprite flavor i'm trying to give you some critiques here my critique is that i can't give you too much critiques i didn't do with the ws23 but my critique would be that when i think of like a cherry soda like that cherry is really prominent and like like it's like really a main aspect like it it's really there you know what i mean like the cherry is like all cherry this definitely seems more sprite flavored with like a nice cherry right out i don't know what cherry sprite tastes like but all the other cherry sodas i've had like that cherry is like the main thing and that's not here in this recipe to me the the winner is the sprite base and then you kind of color it in with a little bit of cherry on the finish you definitely get cherry in the top but it's i get that when you when you exhale you get that whole sort of note and that's where it really is nice but i wouldn't call this like a super like cherry recipe it's more like a cherry accent it's good though like that i like that um but that's my critique is if if uh if making this more cherried would make this closer to cherry sprite then maybe work on that maybe try to figure out a way to get a deeper cherry note in there i like wild cherry by mullenberry um who's saying uh rin is saying ssa juicy cherry yeah juicy cherry is great mainly mullenberry cherries are the best ones uh the inner cherries taste great maybe the cherry extract maybe it's not necessary maybe increase anywhere i don't know or maybe maybe i don't know maybe the cherry extract is doing a lot anytime i've used it i've not been impressed by cherry extract okay there is a little soapiness going on there is a touch of medicinal quality or chemical quality and i'm assuming that's from the fizzy sherbet every time i've mixed this up it's kind of had this weird sort of like artificial vitamin note um yeah that's definitely where it's coming from i can just smell it on there maybe that steeps out i'm not sure now it's definitely the fizzy sherbet so maybe try to work out that off note it's slightly there if you know if if you're someone with a less refined palette you might not pick it up sweetener will just cover it up anyway but i can i can pick it up you know that's something to knock points off right there um everything else is pretty good though everything else is pretty [ __ ] good good time to ask sent email chemnivatic fizzy ad or new fizzy ad version two what do you know i know i know about neither i don't know anything about fizzy ad or fizzy ad too i know nothing about them bob says indian mango liquid barns vanilla ice cream and fizzy sherbet amazing recipe just mix it without ws23 as well and it's indeed true to spite sprite beverage i like it and the cherry is there pro probably more cherry would kill the sprite yeah it's good thanks i love when you guys mix with me especially i know screwdriver you've been mixing with me a lot it's great to see when i get some sort of like outside reference to what i'm saying thank you for that um yeah that's the thing right if that's the thing that i mean that's kind of i i haven't tried a cherry sprite so i don't know but i know you know exactly what i'm talking about other cherry sodas the cherry is like such a deep part of the recipe so if you're looking for that then maybe try to figure out a better cherry a better way to add the cherry in here um you probably would kill the sprite but that's really where the the creativity or the you know the crafting would come into play try to how to how to figure out how to work that out and then i do get a touch of like that fizzy sherbet medicinal vitamin note that could be worked out overall though i think it is really nice i think it tastes great now when i look at sam's where is it i don't see it anymore where'd it go oh when i look at sam sent over his cherry sprite which kind of has the same base i can see this being a little bit more of like that deeper cherry flavor just because you're using the red cherry going a little crazy with the moscato and the sour lemon you are using a lemon lime soda instead of capella's lemon lime which might work i mean i don't see why that wouldn't work but you got the inner wear cherries with the fizzy sherbet yeah i'm curious as to i don't know about i don't know about the moscato but it seems like you're not trying to go for cherry spray well you're saying akin to 7up is a pretty finicky ingredient it's very vibrant cherry seven up is delicious cherry on top of the first sip and then it just kind of disappears that's kind of what you get with this recipe it's kind of what you get here the cherry is more of an accent the the sprite base is really where i think it and like with just the polar blast is good you know the ws-23 is just going to add a little bit more fizziness to the mix but just the polar blast works as well it cools it down and it adds a touch of fizz to it for sure that's stripping cherries with lemon lime you already know what it tastes like you already know what it tastes like mostly oh true yeah yeah yeah i forgot about that recipe yeah you could probably go cranberry you can probably go cranberry you could probably go with like a little bit of some sort of like boozy flavor if you wanted to do like a cranberry vodka sort of thing cranberry vodka soda maybe black tea tfa black tea for that vodka note i mean that's it you're the winner here morency is the winner let's give morenzy a round of applause [Applause] am 100 let's see yes he is 3 000. see once you start uh winning then you

time for Food Snot. Hi I'm Tom Cote and I am the Food Snot.  I'm here today with my lovely wife Renae. Hiiiii .... and\ntoday we want to talk about forgotten candy - and when I say forgotten candy - I mean candy that they used to make - that they no longer make - so this is not just forgotten candy - the whole list - this is my favorite forgotten candy\nthat is no longer available and sometimes I may get a little angry in\nthis video first on my list PBMax. Renae do you remember PBMax? No. PBMax stood for peanut butter max. It was released by the Mars\nM&M company back in 1989. It was a great candy bar. It was peanut butter, milk\nchocolate, and cookie pieces and here's the hysterical thing about why they stopped making it Renae. Why? Because the Mars family that owned Mars/M&M company didn't like peanut butter. Are you serious? They had a peanut butter bias. They just didn't like peanut butter. Don't they know that America has an obsession with peanut butter? I think they knew, in fact\nthey had fifty million dollars in sales when they pulled the PBMax back.\nI'll take it! According to an old executive who had\nretired, he said they did it because the family didn't like the taste of peanut butter. I don't like the taste of WD-40 but if it makes a good candy bar and it makes me fifty million? I'm gonna have WD-40 snack. Ewww. The next one I know you remember because it just went out a few years back The Mars bar - they're made all over the\nworld still - and it's the Mars company.  But they don't make them in the United States\nanymore. Mars bars? They don't make Mars Bars. The Mars bar was chocolate, almonds and nougat - that's it when they got rid of it they replaced it\nwith the Snickers one which is the Snickers Almond bar, which they threw some caramel in there too, and it changed. I miss the Mars bar. Bring it back now. Makes me want to try the Snickers bar. The Snickers one is good but it's not a Mars bar so you gotta like leave the country to get a Mars bar. Let's go.  The Mars bar Renae. I can still taste it . Renae - now we need to talk about the Nestle's Quik bar. Picture Laffy Taffy that tastes like milk chocolate and Nestles quick. It had that classic chocolatey, really creamy chocolatey taffy taste and it came out in 1993 and it only lasted a few years. I must have eaten a thousand of those things and I miss my Nestles Quick bars. You had a thousand and you didn't give me one? I didn't know you then. You were like a child. That's no excuse. So I guess when you love something like a Nestles Quick bar they shoot it like a horse. Renae dear? Yes?  Can we talk about the Bar None by Hershey? Okay. Alright show the people what it looked like. The Bar None was one of my all-time favorite candy bars. There's actually a Facebook\npage to try to get it back. It was made by Hershey and released in 1986 - I think you were a few years old or something or not? I was 4. So it was on the market from 1986 and it lasted eleven years in which\ntime I probably had about five thousand Bar Nones. I got them all the time - I love\nthem.  Picture a chocolate wafered KitKat with milk chocolate and peanuts. It was\nlike a KitKat on crack. Did you save one for me? No, I don't save old candies for you. Do you like white chocolate? I do but I liked it a lot more as a little girl. White chocolate lovers -  we always have a\nhard time finding the perfect white chocolate but Nestle had the Alpine White. Do you remember that .. with the almonds in it? I loved that one! They pulled that out of circulation. NOOOOOO!! It was made in the 1980s and that thing disappeared many years ago now. ohhh, I guess it wasn't that important if I didn't notice. Next on my list of forgotten out of circulation candies - Choco'Lite. Choco'Lite was in the seventies .. it had a lot of air in it, almost like the Aero is in Canada and Europe. It was like that but it also had these little\ncrunchy, almost like rice krispies or little crunchy pieces in it. It was so good and\nas a child I had so many of them and it just disappeared. I've never even heard of it. It debuted in 1971 and then sometime in the early eighties they yanked it. So much bad stuff has come from the 80s, they robbed us. I CAME OUT of the 80s!  I know you're the best thing that came out of the 80s -  you and Adam Ant. Wait. I really hope that you remember this one: Freshen-Up gum. Freshen-Up gum had like goo gel in it that would like explode in your mouth when you ate the gum ..  and it was very minty and it was made sometime in the eighties and it wasn't around that long - they yanked it - and there was some kind of murder investigation of the gum company\nbecause the gum company blew up or something. You'll have to Google that. Are you serious? I am serious. Freshen-Up gum was awesome and my\nmom - bet I never told you this - my mom always had gum in her pocketbook, in fact, in our\nchurch, she was known as the gum lady and my mom had Freshen-Up gum for like two years straight in her pocketbook at all times. I could request my Freshen-Up gum. I miss it and I miss my mom. Okay Renae so the farther I get down this list, the more emotional I\nget. It's getting harder for me because I put my absolute favorites at the bottom\nof this list. Thank you. I want you guys in the comments below to tell me which\nchocolate bars or candy bars or candy that you guys miss because they've yanked a lot of it over the years. I gotta talk about this one. This one really is upsetting to me.  The Wonka Bar. The Wonka Bar was milk chocolate with hunks of graham cracker\nin it and it was a good size. a good sized bar and me and my oldest daughter Becca, we used to get Wonka Bars when she was a kid all the time. it had gold wrapper and it had the Wonka logo. They were phenomenal and they just stopped making them back in 2010. I'm still mad about it. I loved my Wonka Bar. The last one I want to talk about Renae is the Marathon bar it was the long bar - it was caramel\ndipped in chocolate almost knotted like a rope. It had a ruler on the back of it. It was\neight inches long. The whole thing with Marathon bar was it took a long time to eat. It was so good and I had a lot of them as a child they yanked them -  they got rid of them - you can still get something called a Curly Wurly but not in the United States - but the\nCurly Wurly  is supposedly just like the Marathon, in fact people say that the\nchocolate on the Curly Wurly is even better than chocolate was on the\nMarathon bar and I think I've had one Curly Wurly and it was really good. So you\nguys that's all we got.  Let us know in the comments which candies you miss\nbecause I know a lot of you are younger viewers than I am and there's been a lot\nof candy that's been yanked in the last ten years.

it's gonna be good perfect some bacon jerky butter yawn when we add up all of the money we spend on buying food and groceries for the two of us to eat for the whole entire month it only cost [Music] us [Music] hey what's up you guys in this video i'm going to show you what i make for each of the two meals that i have for each day for a whole week right now bryce is cooking up three burger patties one and a half burgers for me and one and a half for him and then cooking with some us wellness meats pure beef tallow for our eggs and two eggs for me five eggs for brice i just turned around and saw that rice threw on some organ meat based seasoning so i guess we're having that too [Music] we're about to start making meal number two and i guess today is like a bit of a boring day because we are just having the exact same thing that we had already today so i am just having one and a half burgers plus two eggs but with this kefir i bought it at whole foods and i've just been having the tiniest little bit after my second meal of the day he's always got on the bacon apron and then just so you know what kind of eggs we're cooking with we have happy eggs they're free-range pasture-raised organic eggs and then this is their nutrition facts so five grams of fat and six grams of protein so these eggs are a little more expensive then i know you can get eggs for a carton for like a dollar but these ones are gonna be like the cheapest we can find is four dollars and eighty cents almost five dollars at walmart so it makes each egg about 40 cents an egg i finished eating and now like i said i'm gonna have a little bit of this kefir which if you've never had it before it smells like sour milk and it kind of tastes like sour milk but it has supposed to be really good for the gut i also feel like i should clarify this is my first bottle of kefir in my life i have never had it before but i've been hearing people talk about it so i figured you know i like trying new things so i figured i'd try it and the first day i had it the taste i was like yuck and now i've been having it for like a week ish now so i'm way more used to the taste i don't know if i'll keep buying it but right now i'm just drinking it until it's gone it's day two meal one i'm cooking up two slices of bacon love me some bacon and one burger patty and one ounce of cheese and two eggs for lilly yum yum wow these bacons look amazing it's like a bacon sunny-side up cheeseburger without the buns but there's cheese egg bacon yum [Music] so i figured i'd show you guys what kind of burger patties were eating would have 100 grass-fed beef patties from costco 30 grams of fat and 26 grams of protein which is why if you watched my i only eat meat and butter video you'll notice i have really calmed down on how much butter i'm eating in a day just because costco finally started carrying some grass-fed beef in the form of these burger patties and with this specific brand it does have that 30 grams of fat per burger and if i'm eating three in a day then that's 90 grams of fat right there so i'm having less butter but i love butter it is my favorite food which is why right now i'm gonna have some more eggs and have some less left beef just so i can have some more butter you can see the beautiful eggs cooking in the background it's day two meal two i have one burger patty four eggs and about a tablespoon of butter and then i'm going to have a little bit of that keeper at the end of the meal as well we are cooking up a 100 grass-fed beef ancestral blend i have here a half pound of heart liver mixture and then some oh my gouda moon cheese and then two tablespoons of butter here's the nutrition facts on the liver heart blend if you want to check it out [Music] one burger with four eggs all scrambled together with a tablespoon of butter and then two slices of bacon oh yeah the perfect bite right now we're cooking meal number one but today is our anniversary so we are going to have a special meal number two but for right now we're just making some burgers and eggs which at this point i'm sure is no surprise but i do just have to get a little bit of background and then also i want to tell you guys how much it costs to feed a lily in a day and how much it costs to feed a price per day and just overall how much money we spend on groceries for the month and so the background is we did just move to missouri about two months ago so before this we were eating more steak and eggs but at this costco they just don't have the steak that we like and these burger patties are actually a pretty killer deal it's only four dollars and fifty cents per pound for grass-fed beef which is really unheard of so yes in a typical day i do have three burger patties and four eggs and i will typically have that meal five out of seven days of the week so it costs about six dollars and 10 cents to feed a lily each day and as for bryce he eats the three burger patties so a pound of beef plus 10 eggs plus a little bit of butter plus he does have some ancestral beef liver supplements so it costs about let's just say ten dollars it's probably like nine dollars and fifty cents but for easy numbers we're gonna say it costs ten dollars to feed a price per day so in a month it's gonna cost me about 180 dollars to feed me and three hundred dollars to feed him so in total we're spending less than five hundred dollars per month for food for the whole month we don't typically go out to eat which is why again it's our anniversary and we're not going out to eat but it's mostly because i've been trying to find the best words to explain this but basically i don't want to throw restaurants under the bus but most of the time they are going to be cooking with vegetable oils or seed oils maybe they're adding different things into the meal or adding different seasonings and we just would rather know exactly what we're consuming so we would just rather cook at home [Music] this meal is about to be crazy and it's not carnivore by any means we are most days carnivore some days keto this is one of those days starting with sweet potatoes we're making sweet potato fries i cut up the chicken and then we put ghee all over our sweet potato fries and now we're loading them up with some pepper actually while we're cooking i thought i would just show you guys this is our relationship acknowledgement form bryce and i used to work together he used to be my manager and then once we told hr we had to sign this relationship agreement form which meant that we were never allowed to work together ever again even if we broke up we were never allowed to work together but i thought it was really funny so i hung it up on the wall and we signed and dated it on march 6th and that is why we celebrate our anniversary today we have some raw cheese ew bryce cut the cheese cooking with coconut oil [Music] in case you missed it i've said this before but i'll say it again i believe that chicken does not have as many nutrients as like red meat so we do put this organ meat based seasoning on top of our chicken so tasty we took sweet potato fries out and then we're just like flipping them around a little bit and then we're gonna put them back into the oven [Music] i know you've been seeing bryce do a lot of the cooking but i am in charge of the bacon and the eggs and then for the eggs i do something special where i make them like an egg soup so i do slow cooked eggs we add in half of that amount of raw cheese that you saw cut up and then we add in people's choices machaca which is just chopped up beef jerky and it's just a really delicious egg soup i'm so excited we have chicken and cheese bacon sweet potato fries with butter egg soup with cheese and shredded beef jerky butter town mostly excited for the butter oh this is going to be so good you think we're done no way there's more including more bacon [Music] a couple of bites of a rubble mint chip ice cream and a slice of bacon with some of lily's keto brownies and redmond's real salt it's a party but um seriously with the keto brownies they're actually in my opinion pretty clean they end up having only like three carbs so for the ingredients i did just use eggs and butter which i typically would eat and then the additional ingredients are going to be almond flour baking cacao and then some monk fruit sweetener but even still not that much for meal number one today i am doing half of a burger and then using some of that leftover chicken so i'm having three ounces of chicken and then two sunny-side up eggs and two tablespoons of butter which is why i like chicken just because it doesn't have as much fat which means i can have some butter [Music] the perfect bite some chicken beef egg and butter for meal number two i do have two eggs they're underneath my beef and then one burger patty usually i do a burger patty and a half so since i'm not having that extra half i did make two slices of bacon and then i still wanted a little more protein so i am going to have some beef and jerky and then i'm going to finish the meal with that tiny bit of kefir i finally finished the bottle of kefir and i still don't know if i'm going to buy it again and i did cook my chicken in the bacon grease it is monday meal number one and this is the only meal of the week where bryce and i don't eat together because he is off at logan university with the future doctors of chiropractic and he's taken blood pressure so every monday he is gone and you know he does all the cooking and i do all the cleaning so i don't make burgers and eggs i will have sardines because that's easy and then the leftover chicken from saturday and then because the chicken and the sardines are so lean i am having about two tablespoons of butter and then i do have bacon because i definitely know how to cook bacon so it's gonna be good [Music] what's cooking good looking one and a half burgers and two eggs surprise i'm actually not feeling this anymore so i'm going to give it to i'm going to be very transparent and honest with what happened yesterday for the past year i have been having sardines a couple times a week and even at one point i was having sardines every other day i was just craving them i was loving the taste of them bryce was getting sick and tired of eating sardines so often but i couldn't help it i was loving them and i think it's because my body was lacking something that the sardines have in them and that's why i was just craving them so much whereas the past six weeks to two months i just have not been digesting them very well at all basically yesterday after i finished eating i immediately was bloated my stomach hurt and two hours later i ran to the bathroom and had a liquid stool so my stomach hurt the rest of the day when we had the second meal i couldn't finish eating it all i was just in a lot of pain so i let bryce finish eating the rest of my beef and eggs and i might take a little chill pill on the sardines maybe start incorporating different fish but i just want to emphasize that the body changes what we crave changes even how we digest might change but i'm getting very hungry since i didn't have as much to eat yesterday so let's start cooking meal number one cooking the liver heart beef i have a quarter pound of the beef heart liver and then four ounces of chicken so finishing off the chicken from saturday and then two tablespoons of butter i'm having one burger two eggs some moon cheese and a tablespoon of butter this week we had a lot of meat and fat and that is pretty typical for us and i don't think that is going to change anytime soon but we do make slight alterations and adjustments to what we eat each week each month whether we're having more fat or more protein or reintroducing foods into the diet actually a couple weeks ago we tried some chicken bone broth and it made our hands very dry and crack and bleed but it could have just been the specific chicken bone broth product that we bought but that was just our experience this week we had a sweet potato and it was fine this upcoming week bryce is actually going to have less eggs and more beef i personally would like to have more organ meats but i just don't want to ever stick us in a box of this is what we eat every single day or every single week because we do make slight adjustments depending on how we're feeling and how we're digesting like i said about the sardines and i also did want to say too that i have been loving reading your guys's messages and

and sorry for the view change here we're doing some rearranging here in weeks HQ and things should look back to normal again pretty soon so what are we talking about today guys we are talking about another edible and we are talking about our third product from the folks at Chiba choose this time we have picked up their strongest product they make to see if it's gonna do us the business or not so this is Chiba choose deca dose extra strength 175 milligrams it's about as good as you can get for Chiba choo and I'm kind of excited I never really I've tried to cheap and choose in the past both hundred milligrams found them a little wanting they were okay both of them they just weren't as good as other hundred milligrams and there they were kind of expensive for what they were however this 175 milligram cost me 20 bucks which is a little expensive but not too much more expensive than say a hundred eighty milligram chocalate bar or whatever but this is obviously less substantial than that from what I understand she Batu's is one of the more popular edibles I think they exist not only here in California but they're also in Colorado Washington there are hugely popular brand and they've been around for a very long time so they probably have a lot of brand recognition which is why they're probably so popular so as I said this is the 175 milligram version I like the back here it's got all the stuff you want to see it's actually got the lab testing batch it's got the nutrition information the ingredients all that fun stuff always happy to see it on any packaging that's available out there alright guys so let's go ahead and tear this open and see how this tastes if I remember correctly last Chiba 2 I had was a hundred milligram ER and it was not very good tasting so I'm a little afraid that this one might also be a bit delicious if I could even open it well guys that's something to keep an eye out for it is this packaging is it does have little tear slits but done they don't really work and that'll do it will just rip it to pieces okay so we have gotten our 175 milligrams chocolate taffy out and that is crazy to believe that's a hundred and seventy five milligrams of THC right there it smells terrible it smells like chocolate and bitterness oh here we go this is the hundred and seventy-five milligram Chiba choose deca dose extra-strength chocolate taffy Oh Oh God oh my god Oh oh good I wish I had some water on me Oh whoo well after Jason oh holy [ __ ] wow that is up there with the kirova salted-caramel blondie or the enjoy goldfish in terms of the worst-tasting animals I'm a rat that was disgusting I knew it was repulsive oh it was a tiny little package and it does have me optimistic though that that a tiny little package producing that much of it tongue twisting tongue turning vile taste result might actually be as potent as advertised so on taste you don't get much worse than Sheba choose extra-strength deca dose but we'll see about the potency and for that guys I'm gonna come back to you in two hours as I do with all our reviews or for you just wait a couple of seconds and we'll catch you right after the break thanks for sticking around see you soon the BAM we're back guys it's been two hours since I had Chiba choose deca dose extra strength 175 milligrams and it's definitely more potent than a normal Chiba chew but it's not quite as good as say a kiva bar or the Jose or a 4:20 bar I did not find it to be as good as that I am pleasantly hi ants in like a 6 but not where I hoped to do it been especially for how bad it tasted oh my god it is awful tasting guys it is who it is Dukey licious [Music] but it is a very small little thing and I always say I love small potent edibles and it's small and reasonably potent so that's a win in its category however I think this one costs roughly double what a normal Chiba chew costs and I'm not sure it's I feel twice as high as and almost you at you maybe it's hard to say I don't think it charts linearly you know I find what I'm saying highs higher high as in a linear relationship it's uh it's exponential maybe I don't know actually I don't know what the what the shape of the curve of a high is boy um this is not chiba choose that's making me talk like this this is exhaustion i have been up for i was looking at my watch which i dont even fun yeah I've been up for 25 hours right now so that's part of the reason I'm acting a little crazy but I am looking forward to this Chiba choose ability to hopefully let me get some a salamba because that is where I am headed to next to fairyland dreamland yeah if not fairyland dreamland boy oh boy if I had it and if I ever edited these that would this would be quite a job but I'm not going to so I'm sorry you guys alright guys but before I go and maybe cuz I'm just feeling tired and making you know being tired makes you feel a little pessimistic I want to share with you guys my cherry on top which is a terrible way of pitching that idea let me tell you something's gonna you feel awful no I want to share with you something might my cherry on top which is sort of how I should have started saying this something that I love to watch or do or read or see or whatever the case may be that is unrelated to weed that I want to share with you guys just a little something extra that I can tack on these reviews that hopefully you guys will enjoy and this review I want to share with you and this is why I said it's gonna be a downer this is why I said being tired might have influenced this but I saw in the bookshelf and I it's it's phenomenal it's it's another it's another game changer it's another one that will shift your thinking and thinking and that is the sixth extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert not Colbert but Cole Burke I think it is a book about mass extinctions and how there have been five mass extinctions throughout life's history on earth five times where what life was nearly wiped out and evidence suggests we are currently in the sixth one of those it's really good and and really well-written and and just a gripping read and it's short to like 250 pages so get on it guys I normally I'm not that forceful and I'm not that forceful about this one but if you if it sounds interesting oh my god I've been going on for four minutes and 15 seconds sorry but that does sound interesting yeah give it a shot I think you guys think you're gonna enjoy it it is pessimistic however I don't know if there's I can't remember if there's any optimism if there's any light in that book what am I talking about oh I am looking forward to some sleep hopefully provided brought to you by wherever the G Batu's wrapper is all right guys I am so sorry it took so long to spit all that [ __ ] out to anybody who's out there still listening thank you so much you're really kind for making the end of this one I not even I want to make it to the end of this one and I'm the one speaking have a wonderful day guys we'll check you out on the next review thanks so much for watching weeds we'll see peace", "teL0aUfvv7w": "may the Den Bosch whey protein assay ft curry dim bun 30 hi I redeem

you we're not talking about Peter Barnes but I'm on camera one because they're good too because they're high in fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's hope against hope one last time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future reviews guys and I hope you will too should you stick around for future reviews and thank you so much for watching this episode we'll

T Tuesday on muscular development calm please welcome from Athens Greece dr. George Julie Otto's quarantine Edition how are you doctor I'm doing well at least I stay out in the champagne you know get some Sun because we're gonna get rusty staying indoors it's been 15 days without working out is the first time after six years I dropped down to 210 pounds Wow people sell used equipment there right like old wait benches and stuff have you have you looked into that because I'm like I'm actually starting to think about buying some more stuff for my house cuz we got 30 more days we're looking at here before anything opens up again yeah that's a cool point the point is are they available or they they sold amount everything yeah I mean if I had a weight bench and I was selling it right now I could probably ask a thousand dollars for it and somebody would buy it at this point you know yesterday was worth $30 on you know some some services anyway yeah you know you who shops are the you know yeah you know it's only your body weight but I'm gonna do chest today chest shoulders guys you can also take a gym you know behind your back vest or something I'm gonna have yes I'm gonna have my son sit on my back today for push-ups because he's about a hundred fifty pounds so it's better than nothing Lori you use the chairs for dips yeah no we'll figure it out I mean look at the guys in prison who have no weights they find all kinds of ways that's why they they can't afford living inside I mean they have to to lift in order to get rid of all their negative energy you mean a good just a few minutes ago on on Facebook or something about you know the the bodybuilding season the pro season it's it's gonna be in trouble in a way begin action I send that to Dan Solomon because dad told me I expect you to show up on September mmm because I asked him the Olympics are canceled postponed Council for next year and this is a time in the history of Olympic Games and the first time we're not gonna have a limit case every four years right so what about the olymbia and she said we have played the die we have five or six months or so but later I listen to Bob Carillo and he said claim was that if the gyms do not open until May you have to consider if they up in the mid of May then we have this quarantine of eight weeks two months that all these people who do not train they have to add these two months on their actual preparation for for the elite so my guess is that every show will be canceled before the Olympia because for instance if you want to get prepared for the Tampa Pro you're gonna need those two months class for instance another two months yeah so you need months it would be enough because the Tampa Pro is the last show before they leave it so I guess my claim is that maybe they're gonna move to the Olympia two weeks later by the end of September hmm the Olympia lineup will be exactly like the Arnold Classic why because our class was a last show before the covet yeah so those athletes were the most prepared you know it sounds reasonable to have the lineup now if there's any special permission by KY field or Sean I highly doubt it if those guys who can appear they didn't last year when we don't have this restriction so I guess then nobody can be a hotshot big name apart from those guys in the Olympia so I guess it's gonna be a repeat of last year and this woman and they say are no classic I'm sorry yeah you know the only the only thing that likes that changes that theory a little bit is I've been looking I've been looking at the Instagram stories of a lot of pros and a lot of them are still training at gyms somehow a lot of them are still training at gyms like they either know the owner or it's a private gym that they own okay anybody known so but yeah I'm sure that's not all pros that's only a certain amount of pros are still out of gym what about the shows yeah I mean you're pro won't one one take place there regular time you know right then I guess you have Indy Pro you have what else Dallas yeah there's a lot of shows me Boston pros has to be June 20th you know everything should be fine by you know hopefully by the early June for Toronto Pro and then Chicago pro all their all the shows that go through the summer but yeah I don't know what's gonna happen is those other shows are gonna be postponed I don't think they're so right yes so my advice is my suggestion would be why don't you take the top three from every show you know as a qualified yeah instead of the very first you know well we don't have to what else are they gonna do they're gonna have to do that yeah there's no other choice otherwise you have six guys in the Olympia so what no we have the top five of our classic that's how you're gonna be that's how it was for many years top five at the Arnold top five at the Olympia and it was like top top three at every other pro show for many many years so I don't they'll do that because they're not gonna Dan's not gonna skip the Olympia Jake Woods not gonna skip the Olympia and they want it to be they still want to be the best show it can possibly be so they'll do what needs to be done I have full confidence in Dan and Jake and Angelica and Tamara and that whole everybody that puts at Olympia together they're gonna do it they'll do a good job they'll figure it out well doctor we have a lot of people in quarantine with a lot of questions for us so let's get going here we go number one is there an effective muscle gaining and PP nandrolone phenol propionate dose that does most likely not cause any prolactin issues so no caber is needed a music matter also of lifestyle if you have stress if you don't sleep at night if you have low thyroid function if you take opiates but also it's a matter if your instruments are all very high I guess how do milligrams of MVP is pretty low in order to cause any serious blood Nemean um but you know it's it's also virus from those circumstances that I enlisted next one is high I'm 48 years old one year post heart attack he had a heart attack one year ago cardiologist says I'm doing great he's willing to sign off on TRT what she'd be my starting dose and maximum dose I think the doctors gonna tell you that guy I don't think you're gonna tell him that also can medications like a torva statin affect my natural production of testosterone so he wants to know what his starting dose of TRT in his maximum dose but I think he's confused about what TRT is yeah so we can't say that we blasting crews TFC because it's aesthetic dose and obviously it's not about gains but it's about living healthy under if you are considered hypokinetic so I guess I'm the cardiologist also has to be real conservative so I had a milligrams and we see what this is in values in the labs in the paper now about about studies they lower but as long as you're hyper girdling you are introduced into replacement therapy doesn't matter if you take statins Connor also does yeah yes somebody yelled at me they said I need to get off the statins they're killing me they're not killing me I'm fine next one I'm 38 years old and finished my first cycle on February 21st with 600 milligrams test at nan Tate 500 milligrams boldenone an ante per week for a total of 16 weeks I decided not to use anything for the next four to six weeks then I start with a trt dose of 100 milligrams tests and an Tate for another four to six weeks after that I run a new cycle with 600 milligrams test 600 milligrams boldenone 400 milligrams Master on and anavar haven't defined the amount yet for the last 30 days this sounds like a contest prep cycle my first question oh yeah he's got three questions so his first question it's four to six weeks off of steroids enough to clean this system well in terms of labs we have to show we have to see I mean I will have to check out lipid panel and liver panel yeah and now about HP ta I don't think it's enough and one month no yeah but mama you may consider that perhaps me the broad science a as long as you are in you have to get out for the receptors you know yeah so he has to be off in order to do to avoid the desensitization of steroid receptor genic receptor that was actually part to his question he says is it enough time over all the four to six years to reset my receptors in the weeks i have free plus the weeks with the trt dose before I start the next cycle so he thinks even on the trt dose his receptor is going to be refreshing themselves so yeah so he's on four to six weeks of T RT dose this is I'm sorry yeah four to six weeks after his sixteen week cycle of nothing then for sixteen weeks sixteen week yeah he was on sixteen weeks there's a lot of the enantiomer equipoise then he did was yes four to six weeks of nothing and then four to six weeks of 150 milligrams test he wanted know if that's enough time to refresh reset the receptors before he starts his next cycle so I guess all the time he's using the stone but he stopped for one half month to using diabolic steroids yeah yeah also in a May it's up to be abuse for though for those four months he he started you know he was using she had a button on he he was using also Hannah Vargas in primo no that's the one he wants to run after everything else mmm I think yeah after that it sounds it sounds like he's he's just asking you if he's got enough time in between to refresh his receptors so that they'll be receptive for this final cycle that he wants to run I think at least okay in his last question there was a three part question is half a milligram a tremor Dex every other day sufficient or can I take 25 milligrams Nova Dex every other day instead thanks best regards from Switzerland so half a milligram of Emma Dex or 25 milligrams nova de nova ducts and testosterone how much I assume this is when he I think he's asking if he should be using that during the off time I guess would that would that be his PCT I'm guessing for those who said help Suites tough question mmm maybe he wants to know if that's something he should run through the whole cycle I really should have asked him to clarify that well let's skip that because we don't know what he really was asking I want to get to this next guy you know this Eric Draven you've answered many questions from Eric does the name ring a bell it's Eric with a Rik anyway so you've answered many questions for him and I'm glad I did a work couple workout videos for MD I don't know if you had the pleasure of watching those I did one home workout chest shoulders triceps and he commented this is what his comment on my youtube video was in Eric garner you're gonna have to give me some kind of clarification or apology because he said Ron first set of push-ups you've got 18 second side 15 not bad only thing keep your head up and look forward it will help keep you in a proper position and go deeper now time to bag you bag on you a bit haha I laugh when I see belts wrist elbow knee gloves and wrist straps for the bar me I never ever used anything in my life because when I need to lift something in the real world I will not have any for that gear to use dude too many fluffin pump workouts over the years at the gym for 75 the 70 pound floor press crushed you and you only got nine reps you need to train with me I'm doing 30 reps with 60s Eric I used to do 150 pound dumbbells flat and incline for 10 reps 60s I could do those all day long you're not you're not stronger than I was dude I know he's 53 years old can you extend your arms fully guess you've been doing too many bodybuilding reps over the years that hold go deep with the weight and feel the stretch is not good first in that position you can rip your pack or cuff 10 to 90 degree to the floor so he's telling me how to do presses the 70 pound overhead press you got a big fat I need to extend the arms loved all the 1990 moves tricep kickback a chick move from the nineties hahaha oh here's really all I have is three sets of dumbbells one arm and two hand overhead tricep Wow I have not seen that since 1999 side laterals are waste of time in my book but bodybuilders seem to love them same thing with front and upright rows Diamond push-ups are better anyway so he's bagging on me for training like a bodybuilder because body builder bodybuilders don't know how to train and we'll the way we train is worthless I'm not asking you to comment I'm just saying this guy don't rip on me because I trained to look a certain way I trained to look good and got big and I was I was a national-level bodybuilder forget is you have nothing to prove you have competed I mean what's this guy what do you kids silly yeah athletics I think I think he's a bicycle racer I don't know Erik you can come so I have to rip on you work because you ripped on me because I trained for my to look a certain way I wasn't training for performance or anything else I don't even care how strong I was but I was very strong in my younger years trust me I did things everybody Remo some guys need 15 minutes of fame all right well now let's get to his question doctor now that I've ripped him a new haled a hole like he ripped me one ok so last year last last week he asked you a question we weren't sure about the value he was talking about was this hematocrit so he said yes I was talking about my hematocrit mine was 48.5% I did hear of TRT guys getting theirs up to 56 57 % I also heard anything over 54% hematocrit would increase the risk of stroke and heart attack what does the doctor think of my 403 total test for a 53 year old male is this average for my age I couldn't find any info online this is low or middle or high for my age I guess it's a reasonable I mean he's 53 he's around his mid-50s and he's the stars about 50% sounds reasonable to be over there at 400 the point is can you live with that is it the verbal do you have an active lifestyle do you live - you have sex so besides are you obesity have diabetes made up syndrome because in those cases yes you have to use testosterone also if you are an Emmy you know if you are still parodic is not just about lifting and getting late testosterone that's all I care about but uh interesting okay yes well I'm most among those guys who face a motto quit I mean hemoglobin between 18 and 19 or even 20 and my hematocrit range is always about 50 up to 60 and as a matter of fact I have to tell you that I have quick tea or tea for those two weeks mm-hmm sick of my hematocrit so of course my body weight goes down or lost muscle my appetite also is going down but today I had labs and I'm sure my hematocrit will approach to 50 which is very good for me okay and before I start tea or tea I guess in the follow mix there I can push my trt plus perhaps a little bit of deca and use also h HCG and in order to avoid you know repeat the phlebotomist because this is say this is an issue for me every four to six weeks every month or every two months the most I have to get rid of my black and my veins are getting you know toasted this so I don't miss now distortion because I don't live around I don't fairness and of sex you know no I'm not fat you know but on the other point I'm not anemic um I was on the other side so I have to take care of this I'm taking the HCA per minute on an HCG yeah and I keep my steroid profile a little bit good but distortion which is the main impact on your mother plate is often I don't miss it a lot you know because I don't work out that's why I don't feel I just do a little bit of cardio you know and that's all yeah I think anybody taking large amounts of steroids now and they can't work out as a [ __ ] what a waste of Oh steroids I have to tell you I have a patient in London who is a coronavirus page and who undergoes the flu she had a fever of 105 for ten days oh no his appetite dropped down to zero he was Cathy he had chest pain you know sort of the morning you know Bravo pneumonia maybe and he was also spitting and coughing and he was on testosterone and we stole the week before mmm ten days afterwards well one week after world is shut down the gyms he got infection obviously he was cultivating with it within him you know so I asked me yesterday to have some labs on the CRP CPC and his libertine sentence because I guess the winner he was taking 250 wastrel that's a long yeah injectable yes you know every week but it's five short week is not a little you know against the bodybuilders who strain their liver and also the kidneys they're more vulnerable besides the courtesan crash because the more anabolic said the city used cortisone goes down and if you train a lot weight blood cells also go down so immune system man drops and by overtraining also anyway and I don't see any reason to hold any gains with push-ups or a little bit of dumbbells you know so we said that before clear the system get healthier relieve the joints and just use the stone for the you know for the overall for the vitality you know to be you have to be physically just awesome that's all you don't need anabolic stairs to mess up with your organs we got a female a woman asking a question here I'm female I've completed my first eight-week end of our only cycle haven't used any other compounds I'm currently on a month's break and was planning to start another eight-week cycle after this break I was due to compete end of may now this is postponed just wondering if it would be beneficial to start another cycle I'm thinking more to preserve muscle in the current situation I do have some home gym equipment to keep me going but would continue with and of our help preserve what I have until I get back to proper training or so I'll just wait until I can get back to the gym and train properly hmm maybe she can use a little bit of clam utero DHEA but stay out over an hour ok it's no no there's no proper to Kate even ten or twenty milligrams because you don't training seriously right so and any bar is not cheap guys it was expensive why would you why would you just take care of our in a situation like this wait James open up and then push the gear speciate so you can take whey protein you know perhaps a little bit of creatine but stay away from from here in order to be healthier yeah I predict doctor when the gyms open up every steroid dealers phone is gonna be blowing up everyone's gonna be want to get gear again you said price to workout with fake six hours I might be there six hours I'm gonna be there all damn day kissing the ground and hugging every machine yeah it's gonna be awesome okay next question anabolic steroids suppressed HPT a catabolic steroids suppress either cortisol production or reduce sensitivity towards cortisol vitamin D is a steroid hormone what does exogenous intake of vitamin D suppress I heard it is immunosuppressive but also in regards to other things such as vitamin D production resistance to it etc so what happens if you take vitamin D it boosts the immune system actually last night I had ninety eight point eight temperature 37 Celsius so I had a cocktail of milligrams aspirin 10,000 IU's vitamin d3 k to five grams of vitamin C 2.5 grams of see 1.2 grams of glutathione and 50 milligrams of zing so I work out perfectly well with a hard-on so what do you think you were getting a fever well you think you were getting sick it's not so I had labs today but you know I'm perfectly well now I guess it was kind of a catch a cold because I let the door open for the cats going in the house you know so I don't think it's about the virus the other time I don't think you were that easily he is about the new response and also there was in there was a paper saying that those who were affected by coronavirus they developed later much later pneumonia when they're already stored so vitamin D they were already high first so it's not about getting a elevating the vitamin D when you are into the corner bars pneumonia but as a preventive rules before mmm okay it's not a treatment but it's a it's a precaution it's about prevention yeah the same clothes we pharmacy but because vitamin D is a program on a steroid molecules a steroid molecule it needs UV radiation so you give it light and also as a steroid molecule needs the cholesterol which is the manual steroid molecule so I guess endogenous production of cholesterol one be enough for vegans to synthesize the substantial levels of vitamin D so you need units almond you need for instance you need cheese you need this is this kind of dairy products also that contain vitamin D and also fatty fish yeah what sunlight sunlight but sunlight is a catalyst you need to have the you know the raw material which is cholesterol okay next question is from an older gentleman finally somebody older me I'm 60 years old I trained natural have never been on PD peds recently I got my testosterone result it was 438 for dekaliter so he's got a 4:38 free test I'm sorry total testosterone my DHEA so4 levels I don't even know what that is was 405 ug over deal I'm considering going on TRT I'm a type 2 diabetic I'm taking no medication only relying on a very good diet and my blood sugar is under control would being on TRT affect my blood sugar level or decrease self sensitivity to the insulin and what about taking DHEA and one iu of HGH every day so first of all trt what impact would that have on is his insulin level all has blood sugar it will improve this was acitivity by oxidizing a mental fat and building lean muscle tissue okay lean body mass which is muscle tissue so in the in the near future I guess that diabetic patients who receive insulin and not just insulin but also who are on metformin in our type 2 diabetic non insulin-dependent they will have to be evaluated for hyper-girl and is my HPA assessment in order to get introduced into testosterone and lower their insulin dose okay so but also if they are diabetic to type patients then they make it also rid of metformin because as you grow muscle you burn fat your instant resistance go down david improves hmm DHEA you've recommended that for many many people so DHEA is a it's also beneficial I guess because it's an opportunity can assist to fat burning she has to also take some it for me because she's a type-2 diabetic she can also take some chromium because nathan has to lift weights he has to load his carbs and use fiber fiber scarves which is shallot and lean animal protein you know okay cut off all the sugars cut off the the desserts and also fruits juices also okay now it's not recommended because growth hormone elevates insulin resistance unless he uses only one night you am/pm yeah that's what he said one eye you I've never heard of such a low dose but would you see any benefits at all from one eye you a growth hormone a day it's about rejuvenation okay next question and this is another multi-part question well actually only two parts so Jim says I'm currently doing tests it 100 milligrams Decca 50 milligrams primo 100 milligrams all done twice a week and probe ayran 25 milligrams every day I suffer with a bad back injury from 10 years ago I have an anterior bulge in the L 2 L 3 discs related to deadlifts back in the day I see a chiropractor every six weeks I'm usually okay but recently I go into spasm more often so he has two questions number one would human growth hormone make any difference to my discs other than potentially make me lighter by loss of weight and lower gravity stress on the discs no I don't think so now because also this includes the following answer so in the particular in the interventricular discs there consists of a nucleus and then an outer surface now there's inside there there's a liquid okay and it's filled up with hyaluronic acid so this is sort of hepatic surgeons do they inject shall donate when the discs get dry and the compressor Chadha and they you you minimize in height so neither growth hormone or he also mentions the above the estrogen production and the water retention I think it's irrelevant with this case so it doesn't mean that if you use GH or if you let your responses go up you're gonna minimize your problem with your vertebra you know in the in the discs so it's about injecting hyaluronic acid within them you know that this gel is called hydro hydro hydro white-collar Onate how to run a castle around against okay I should do that maybe taller so the second part of the question I guess you just sort of address could primo and provirus be low during my estrogen to the point that my disks are a dehydrated state a better question would be if I take aromatase inhibitor we didn't make it were sure Boris I don't think so next question you said last week the 250 milligrams of testosterone per week will get your test levels over 2,000 what do you think on average most people would need to get levels around 1,000 so personally when I hit 115 Sherman levels is up mm this is also relative to the body mass index how tall how big you are and also maybe your metabolism and your energetic receptors I have a patient who is 6 - and he's 260 mmm he uses 200 milligrams in his level clothes mm so it's a barrel so the surface the body mass index you know how tall if you are you probably remember this O'Connor talked about one patient that he had who metabolizes 6 he needed 600 milligrams a week just to get I think 800,000 range so we're all different you can't really say this amounts gonna get you here that amounts can get you there what about those big guys how there are no plastic did the giant say I mean I can only imagine I mean what what's the highest testosterone level you've ever seen on a lab for total of a man mm and he was shedding - mm no mm was his was his uh total testosterone yes but above this level limit they don't calculate it they don't measure this but he reached he reach 2,000 by injecting 250 of nf8 per week because I mean if a guy's some guy shooting three grams of test a week plus you know countable maybe it'd be like a hundred thousand who knows all right next question I was wondering if you have ever heard of oral steroids like d-ball anti draw land in of our dropping blood sugar the last few times using any of these about a weekend randomly throughout the day my blood sugar will drop and I have to eat sugar or carbs to feel better I get shaky sweating profusely cold sweats all bad is this a common problem to have what do you think could be causing this no injectables do this to me just orals now I had this discussion a long time ago with a brilliant scientist who passed away last year he's from Belgium which is called Peterborough he was nicknamed as the big cat he was a chemist and he was writing with bill whaling on long time ago for the bodybuilding.com yeah now she told me that when you suppress your cortisol by strong and anabolics like trembling winstrol stanozolol and now cortisol think about that is responsible for gluconeogenesis and elevated blood sugar so when you the mean is your cortisol like by abusing serious anabolics i mean mass i mean strong a potent anabolics then you may lack of these gluconeogenesis that elevates your serum glucose and may you have a drop in your glucose blood glucose levels so this is an explanation that okay so your blood sugar is this a common thing because I've never experienced that myself with orals with a blood sugar drop of you so Peter told me a long time ago the so if you inject for us in 200 milligrams of M balloon you may notice a little bit of drop on your blood sugar mmm yeah I just thought of a funny meme some one guy was saying coronavirus or trend cough that's bad joke you gotta laugh you gotta you know laugh at some of the stuff we're also just gonna cry alright last question doctor is this is this is that arturo gatti Corleone II whatever I believe our Toro aren't you only like 18 years old or 17 or something I keep asking you that and you won't answer me your mom knows you're watching this show I'm talking about all these steroids so he asks is 400 milligrams of test sip too much for a cruise is 200 milligrams tests it plus 100 milligram underground nandrolone one injection each five days enough for a cruise which problems should I be concerned about cruising at these dosages I'm never gonna blast with dangerous things like tremble ohm boldenone and dangerous [ __ ] I intend to stop when I hit 40 and then start T RT and HGH I don't want to have any side effects as soon as I see anything a little bit off my labs I hop on T RT as long as I eat clean train five minutes of five minutes of HIIT cardio dude you are lazy five minutes come on and never check my health with risk my health with potent stuff can i still live to a hundred years old I don't know maybe your dad coronavirus man but listen listen if you blast for life you gotta minimize you sperm production guarantee young kid the mean don't you consider you cannot be sterilized soon afterwards unless you don't care about having a family also in the long term another thing to worry about bills for cytosis estrogen production and sperm production so testicular shrink these are the concerns but when we mean when we say blast for how long for one month two months three months six months a year depends maturity is bla its cruising actually for life but it's not about it's not a cyclist is it it's a replacement because you cannot live without this toaster has nothing to do with lasting and cruising and stuff like this and the dose is very low so I don't think that it's a silver bullet you're gonna end up someday and you're gonna have the six-pack and they wonder body you dream of yeah I mean III would like you Arthur if you're listening to this I know you are because you ask the question just about every week give me give us your situation again give us your age are you hypogonadism right now why do you need to be on tests because you know as a as a dad and everything I'm very concerned with young very young men who aren't who don't need any steroids you should be training naturally for a while build a natural base of size and strength then later when you're a little older and your testosterone starts to come down naturally that's when it's time to think about adding a little bit in but man I don't like seeing 17 18 year-old kids on steroids it bothers me you know I have realize one before I trained for 30 years you know I'm into the gyms for so long and have this kind of best experience you know what I've realized is that the younger you are the more infatuated you are with steroids you know it's like a lease to the Wunderland you know so they have not matured enough with training they have not dyed it enough in order to much rule their mental status so they just want these candies you know the war you still destroyed bills and the injections because they they have not trained well and have not eaten well and if they use so young those drugs beside the side effects they won't get so much benefit because there's no the basis you know the basics they tell the people take your time and learn your body learn how to train take some years and really master your body learn what foods work best for you figure out how you need to eat how you need to Train how you need to recover when you got all that handled and you got a good you've got some sighs and got some strength then you put the steroids in it's much much more effective so much more effective that's why I try to tell these kids but they don't you know nobody listens I started using steroids after ten years of lifting thirteen here 13 years yeah 13 I was 30 I was 27 and I started training at 14 so 13 years natural training and I'm glad I waited I'm very glad because I got much more out of them I think that I would have I it made me learn my body it learned I had to learn how to do everything without drugs had a Matta sixth or I started using sir I got shredded I mean anybody can get that's the thing that bothers me is if you have the mentality that you can't build any muscle and you can't get lean without drugs that's in your head and you know that you never will because mentally you're gonna have that block anyway well doctor I think you need to look into getting some weights I don't think the ten pound dumbbells are gonna cut it for you much longer you're gonna go crazy and nobody wants that I need I need you here clear mind and answering questions for the world for after you know I know but man that's gonna be so this is like two weeks today two weeks ago is the last day I think my gym was open it's only been two weeks so now we're looking another four weeks six weeks without a gym oh my gosh people gonna be we're gonna be like not able to move can you imagine your first leg workout the day after your first leg workout back at the gym you're gonna be crippled anyway doctor yeah we're all in this together we're all trying to train with masks I'm getting the point now someone says I have a private gym you want to help you want to come over I'd be like mm-hmm maybe I'll just wear masks and bring some uh some Lysol with me and I'll be good maybe everything will be fine nobody's offered me so I'm just gonna stay home and do my dumbbells do my dumbbells my chin up bar I'll be okay all right doctor stay strong stay tough this is uh we'll get through this somehow

"[Music] good morning guys well I guess I could still say morning it is 11 a.m. I just woke up I was up super late editing the vlog and doing some online homework but I'm super excited I've been waiting about like a week and a half for this my bite meals order came I want to show you guys we've never tried to speed before let's see oh my gosh cute comes with um scratcher card also comes with reheating instructions show you a few of um what do you got like a chicken pasta so that was not really too much on there for me BBQ chicken red potatoes and green beans that's one of mine but yes I'm gonna try these out this is me and Cody's meals for the week and I will let you know how it tastes and how I like them I am NOT sponsored by this company I just really wanted to try it that is how I like my fridge to look Cody's are on the bottom mines on top I can't eat this here's my meal so it's a barbecued chicken red potatoes and some green beans up guys I am on pre-workout as you could probably tell I am going to workout with my sister right now we are going to her gym she works at me did the good look she works at u.s. fitness so we are gonna go there right now and get a lake and booty workout in so I think today I can officially say that I have started cutting and I just had my first meal um so I'm gonna ease back into it so I like I showed you guys I got my meals and I ate my first meal and it was super good oh my gosh I was like amazed at how good this was like with the nutrition backs and what I'm eating it just it tastes delicious so I don't think I'm gonna have to have a problem I will still allow like my cheat meal but I'm literally I'm gonna try so hard to stick to one cheat meal a week right now because this is operationally bought and I've been sucking at it lately like I told you guys and I want to get better at it I want to show you guys that I can do it and you guys can too you guys are definitely more my motivators um you make me feel like I can do this so we'll see how it goes yeah so what I want to do though is I to only eat like three times a day right now I'm doing intermediate fasting so I'll put the definition for it right here in the title box but basically I'm going to wake up every morning and I'm gonna do coffee and I'm just going to fast in the morning around like noon is what I'll have my first meal so that's rated today I feel pretty good I've got some carbs in me cuz I'm gonna go through Lakes but I am gonna go to the store I'll show you guys I'm gonna go and get some stuff because I don't want to eat for just three times a day so I'm going to be having my protein shakes in between meals I want to grab some protein bars honestly just like snacks that I can grab that are healthy so I don't have that temptation to  any crappy food so I'll show you guys kind of my grocery haul for just like snacks and stuff like that of what I snack on yeah I will show you guys all of that I will try to sell my workout we'll see how busy it is and I'll see you guys in the next clip [Music] doing make hi everybody the first workout we did were curtsy lunges these burn my butts so bad you want to make sure you are squatting into a deep lunge to really feel that burn I wasn't using any weight dumbbells are optional you can add them but you will feel that burn without the weight the next exercise that we did was ooh grabbed a BOSU ball and a kettlebell and we just were squatting on that that was making our legs shake like crazy and we were really feeling that burn in our quads so again you want to make sure you are going into a deep squat I swear I do this workout all the time but I really feel a great burn when I do this workout and I just love it so these are donkey kicks you want to make sure when you're kicking your leg back you want to make sure you're doing that muscle mind connection so make sure that you are squeezing your butt when you lift your leg up so you really get that activation and you really are working that muscle we then did fire hydrants these ones you want to make sure you are putting your leg up like a dog food going pee on a fire hydrant and you want to make sure to squeeze your butt that is gonna work your butt like crazy and you are gonna be so sore from this workout [Music] the next workout we did were just traditional lunges with dumbbells I am convinced this workout gets me sore every single time that I do it make sure again that you are squatting down low if you have to go a little slower to really get that movement that's completely okay I have to do this really slow and I first started [Music] we just wrapped up a late day oh my god you guys the lunges that you're gonna see in these clips killed me I was dying lunches are definitely like the exercise that kills me the most I could already feel it in my legs and now we are going to go eat right now I was kind of hesitant about going to eat because I have me bite meals but I only bought enough meals for just two meals a day and I do want to eat more than two meals a day I don't want to starve myself so I'm gonna stick to this healthy eating I just did like so I can have some carbs in me I'm gonna go to chick-fil-a is my favorite place ever and I always want to get like those fried chicken strips those are my favorite or the spicy chicken sandwich but I'm the ethic grilled chicken sandwich it is half the calories and it has a lot of salt but it is a healthier option and you know it is okay to have some sodium after you workout your body actually needs the sodium and it needs carbs so I'm gonna get a girl chicken sandwich I'm probably not gonna use any sauce because I'm gonna really try to keep clean and I'm gonna get water so I will see you guys at chick-fil-a waffle fries oh thank you thank you she's like everyone got she always eat the baby came everything I've seen his hot sauce I can't go back I want some bacon that turn here we know food intake has been working on the front so on get some food this is my favorite protein bars this is like essential for when I'm trying to diet and stick to it these are good snacks what guys so I got home and loaded all my groceries kind of relaxed for a little and I'm hungry again so I eat about like two hours ago so what I'm gonna do is I showed you guys I got my protein bars I always like stocked my house with protein bars almonds make sure I have all the milk for my protein shakes so that's kind of what I snack on throughout the day and I also got some fruit like I said make fruit intake has been lacking like crazy so here's my protein - no I just got to figure out what flavor I want you guys as you can tell I'm obsessed with protein milkshake these are all the protein milkshakes I have I'm gonna go back here - seriously I love it but I think I'm gonna try I haven't tried vanilla caramel in a while so I think I'm gonna have this one so macros for this is 22 grams of protein 115 calories and 3 grams of carbs and this one is so good - and these are like a more description of the macros but I love this so much this one's really good so I'm gonna make this for my meal before dinner basically so what I do is I like to blend it up with almond milk so my blender I was soaking it we use it so much it's like always either in the dishwasher or getting rinsed out so we can use it again so I just rinsed it out so yeah I'm gonna make that and fill up and I'm doing chores today so housework I've got laundry going on so I love laundry we've got like a load here I gotta fold and I've also got a load over there watch and then make any pigs I have to clean that cage like once a week and give him a bath so that's on the agenda too now we go and drink it big scoop of it and then I put it in this big like soup cup so there it is I'm gonna get a straw and drink that that is one cup of almond milk with one scoop of vanilla caramel it's like crazy you can't even really see it delicious alright so I replaced the bedding in their cage so super clean they live in like a mansion and here they hi [Music] [Music] [Music] it's not me [Music] [Music] real clean huh you are clean baby girl yeah all right yes that is all I have for you today thank you so much for watching this video if you liked it please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel and I will talk to you guys in the next video", "QImpKpJ-QZE": "[Music] what's up poopypants is welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review is a bit of a classic which means edibles and today we are taking a look at spacejam cannabis infused sour gummy space drops and their handmade vegan cannabis treats so the box here is about all the information you want to see on it we've got lab tested results right there made then batch number all that good stuff and at the front we've got our milligram each eight point seven to perserve per serving for eighty seven point seven two milligrams total it was advertised as a hundred milligram edible but it looks like it only has eighty seven point seven two milligrams of THC oh this is a gummy of some kind but I'm not really sure exactly what they are sour gummy space drops let's find out together guys elevate your being with Space Jam okay so here we go inmate oh [ __ ] [ __ ] there are little drops just in a thing that looks just like this some paper Hana in there there's not much to it there as you can see the drops are in there let's give them a taste it was a pretty sour definitely definitely some cannabis taste to it gummies usually do not too bad it's better factious sour flavor and this sort of sugary salary crystals you can see there do a very good job of masking this THC I like the flavors quite a bit um it's pretty good they're a little chewy a little sour but all things considered this is a pretty fine tasting little gummy edible maybe it's the fact that it's made with premium ice hash water hash whatever the hell that is so guys I'm about to go see a movie this new one with Melissa McCarthy that doesn't look like a Melissa McCarthy movie as soon as that movie's over with and don't worry guys with all our reviews I'm gonna finish all ten of these drops gonna go see this movie gonna come out about two hours or so let you know what I think of the movie and more importantly what I think of these space jims cannabis infused sour gummy space drops I think I got all those nouns and adjectives there alright guys I will see in about two hours thanks for watching weeks and I'll see you in just a bit [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I whoa no that's a lie it has been actually closer to four hours since I've had a space gem cannabis infused sour gummy space drops uh I finished up my movie and the title of that by the way was can you ever forgive me with Melissa McCarthy true story weird movie but what you're really here for space gems they're pretty good guys I actually really like the taste of them for gummies they tasted pretty good uh they have an excellent sour sort of snap that really matched the cannabis flavor and then most importantly they got me pretty high um this isn't the top tier gummy brand out there right now this isn't like Plus which is truly amazing but this does proclaim to have a little bit less milligram \u00e4j-- however and I neglected to mention in the first half it is actually a little bit more expensive this time uh this one cost me 20 something dollars whereas the Plus usually run about 15 pre-tax so this was a little bit more expensive for a little bit less of a high and I actually really like the way the Plus tastes as well so my recommendation to you is if your dispensary has both plus gummies and space gem try with the bullet stick with the plus but if you're looking for something a little different and this is the only gummy they've got I'd still recommend space gems again it's got a great flavor not a lot to eat not so much of a fan of the packaging as they almost all spilled out on me but they are a little pricey and they're not gonna get you quite as high I don't think it's the plus but still pretty good so before I bounce with you guys today I actually want to share with you a little cherry on top a little something and not weed related that you can enjoy throughout your week and this week I actually want to share with you the camera I'm using I picked up a GoPro Hero 7 black I've been using it to shoots in these videos finally got a better microphone on it and I love it it's great it's actually worked really well just as a little point and shoot camera for me for shooting reats videos and it's the hyperlapse stuff there are the hyper smoothing whatever they call it has been fantastic I've loved shooting some montages with it really cool really like the GoPro Hero 7 black and very strangely I was as I was deciding to do this as an endorsement billboard right up there so you know maybe that's what they were asking me to do I don't know all right guys well that's gonna do it for this cherry on top that's the GoPro Hero 7 black and that's gonna do it for this review the space gem handmade vegan and cannabis treats thank you so much for watching guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "LajdW9P0yHM": "[Music] hello everyone welcome two weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this episode we are looking at the similarly titled and similarly logoed we dose that's right we were taking a look at we dose we toes crunchy I think the name of the company is we dose we can see back here they really like you to know that name we chose we dose we chose loses all meaning when you say it enough we chose Medicaid his deck and the products name is we nose crunchy they make other products as well that aren't also called we dose you would think they wouldn't name their thing the same name they name their company but whatever I traditionally haven't really liked chips I haven't really found one that hits that sweet spot from me that's perfect I kind of like some of the original baked goods I kind of like some of them in Gooch and I found that those goldfish from enjoy edibles we're actually quite potent but they tasted so disgusting I couldn't ever imagine eating them again so I'm hoping that these we toast crunchy will be the pot chip for me going forward so if you've never turned in two weeks before the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this product I'm gonna eventually eat the whole thing not necessary for you to death do a lot of Cheetos in here excuse me we knows but they don't come back to you guys in precisely two hours to let you know how I'm feeling how high I am because I consider that the most important part of any edible review not so much how it tastes but how it makes you feel alright so let's go ahead and open it up see what this products all about how it tastes how it smells and then two hours from now most importantly how its gonna make this feel my guess it's gonna taste kind of like stale Cheetos with a little bit of wheat taste the weed odor is quite strong coming from the bag you can see we've got a lot of Cheetos in there look like regular ass Cheetos nothing too surprising let's go ahead and give them one a bite here not too still that's good what not bad um definitely a little bit of a wee taste to it nothing that's gonna prevent you from wanting to eat the the whole thing work that's gonna make you gag certainly um just a little bit of a pair at the end but mostly just tastes like Cheetos and not even that stale so they got a leg up on the competition um well so you know how they taste if you like she knows you're gonna like these there is a substantial amount in this bag certainly more than your typical like grab bag and she is so it's gonna take me a while get through these bad boys oh [ __ ] I said bad boys um these sons of [ __ ] how about that it's gonna take me a while you spend some [ __ ] why they're all male I don't know why I use masculine not sure but let's go ahead and I'm gonna finish these sons of [ __ ] off and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds and I'll see you guys soon peace Wow guys I am rusty it has been I'm coming up with my big tolerance break here I boosted my tolerance back up but I'm rusty I realized that I forgot to tell you two very key important facts about we dose from two hours earlier one how potent it's supposed to be this is a hundred and fifty milligram product although it's hard to find that on here you have to do a little bit of math it says oh there it is at the very bottom one hundred and fifty milligrams per bag should probably be a little bit more prominently display than that a little weird that it's that small but so this is one hundred and fifty milligram animal and it cost me traditionally it cost ten dollars but I got it on a discount for eight bucks so an affordable edible so again hundred and fifty milligrams for eight dollars affordable and bulb and I would describe we dose as it's alright it's alright um I'm not outrageously high I'm pretty high I would say I'm at whatever my tolerance was about the same as it was before equivalent to about a 5 maybe maybe about a 5 and a half or so me not to get that weirdly specifically granular because what's the difference between a 5 and a 5 and a half nothing um but but yeah they tasted I mean just like Cheetos so if you like Cheetos you're gonna like these they weren't stale the we taste wasn't that bad and I'm moderately high for an affordable edible so I've nothing bad to say about we dose and it's not really gonna change my opinion on on the chips sort of edibles I still I'm not gonna reach for these first but if I was looking for something a little bit if I was looking for something salty and this was at the dispensary and you know just was looking for not confectionery this time around maybe I grabbed a bag of weed oohs but for the most part I'm gonna stick with the confectionery you stick with the candies just I think they're a little bit more potent that's a better vector for THC but if you uh you know like the salty stuff you might want to give widows a chance because again it's it's not gonna set you back too much at 8 bucks a bag here so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you all in the next review peace that was okay and I I'm not a practice on throwing those two alright guys see you later", "wDEe9C5786s": "[Music] you show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our fourth look third look at a syrup lien that is I think the kids are calling it lien these days which i think is a take-off of when you used to do scissor with codeine in it this is not codeine this is just weed just good old-fashioned THC straight from the earth the good stuff none of that none of those opiates or opioids or anything to get you addicted so this is a pro methylene liquid syrup two fluid ounces watermelon flavored and it proclaims to be 600 milligrams of indica THC I guess they're saying it has 1200 milligrams of syrup total and half of it is indica of course we're gonna be doing the entire bottle 600 milligrams is a dot I'm not gonna do 600 milligrams right from the get-go although I'm pretty sure this might be another scam so I picked this up very cheaply I think it was 35 bucks for a 600 milligram syrup which is a very good deal if in fact is true but let's take a look at this bottle and just see what kind of red red flags just sort of pop off look how cheap it looks just a gross little cheap sticker poured out on there you can barely read what is you know what's on there because the printing is pretty awful shake well every use it's very muddy muddy is the adjective they use fair enough in THC We Trust so again this little bottle it proclaims that 600 milligrams hc' but I am skeptical because of the price because of the size because of the packaging all of that leads me to believe that this might actually be a another scam but I am certainly hoping to get quite high off of it and I realize I probably should have brought something to drink with me in case this thing tastes truly wretched which it might very well so let's go ahead and take a look at this Pro methylene liquid syrup let's shake it very well because it's muddy now it suggests that for a beginner to do half a teaspoon it says for an expert to do 2 to 3 teaspoons or 4 Club meanies whatever the hell that means 4 to 7 teaspoons which is what we're gonna be doing I have no idea what Club MIM is is maybe you guys can help me figure that out come on let's focus camera there it is 4 to 7 teaspoons tablespoons rather Club em I am eyes II don't know all right so our muddy stuff is shooken oh it smells really bad and it looks really gross look at the top there ah oh it is muddy as they said it is muddy well maybe I should go get something to mix it with [ __ ] it here we go 3 2 1 down the hatch see how much we can get down ooh ooh we got a lot of it down we got most of it there yak it's actually not super super gross it's not good tasting by any stretch but I'm gonna finish it off I'm gonna give my second self a second to let that percolate through my stomach and then I will be back to you guys like all of our reviews I'm coming back to you guys in two hours to let you know how this promy Faline what a dumb name is actually hitting because that's the most important part of this edible review you don't really care how it tastes because you're gonna CAC it down no matter what it does if it gets you high so we'll find out soon guys I will see you in just a bit thanks for watching wheats see you soon welcome back to wheats guys it has been two hours since I had the pro me feeling whatever it's called I don't need to say their name anymore because I don't need to give them any advertising it is a bunch of gar [ __ ] 600 milligrams my booty look at those eyeballs white as the winters snow I fell feel roughly infinity more times hi doing a cannabis 100 milligram syrup than that six hundred milligram syrup from Pro methylene and my buddy squids here to join us hey squiddy so yeah do not give them any money just like I thought it was a total total scam an absolute trying to fleece you for your money there's nothing in there it tasted terrible at the bottom because there was a lot of like ground-up plant matter or whatever in there it was disgusting I don't know what it was probably wasn't actually weeds I certainly don't feel hi disgusting I at the very bottom tasting does didn't get me high at all an absolute it's like I took $35 and lit it on fire an absolute travesty of a product do not buy it if you see it at a dispensary tell them not to carry it because they're just doing their customers a disservice by carrying this [ __ ] that is Pro methylene I think I'm not going to look again because I don't want to if I have it wrong great they don't need the they don't need the endorsement they don't need the free advertising but I wanted to share with you some little message of positivity something something something to look forward to so I even though normally in these quick short bad reviews they don't come with the cherry on top this time I think I'm gonna go with a give you guys a little cherry on top a little something that you can take with you uh something to enjoy over the next week or so just that can be enjoyed with or without weed something that will just bring a little bit of a joy or a smile to your face so on this cherry on top I want to just recommend a youtube channel that I like quite a bit and that is PBS is eons PBS's eons PBS has a bunch of really great like science channels that all range from about seven to fifteen minute videos and all kinds of different topics Aeons is a great one talking a mixture between geology archaeology paleontology and a bunch of other cool subjects and topics all sort of rolled into one giant eon uh I think that's that's right alright so yeah check that out PBS is eons ye ons and just search for that on YouTube you'll find it it's a great thing to watch well hi just let the videos rule and and learn some cool stuff and that guys is gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats sorry it was such a shitty one we've had a real run of losers in a row here but good things ahead I'm so guys thank you so much for watching weeds and we will see you on the next review peace", "UMVFbNtMvog": "[Music] all the wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at not inedible and not a cartridge we're taking a look at a drink bowl that's right we're taking a look at yet another drink today our first look at the oft requested agua de Fleur I hope I'm saying that correctly here it is a product of Los Angeles on the back you've got your nutrition information looks like to's eight ounce servings a hundred and ten milligrams in total of THC not sure exactly how that's flying in the modern era here with hundred milligram limits probably still an illegal product would be my guess so this is a mango flavored I believe they have a sort of awful font that's hard to read um oh let's read some of their ostentatious texts here agua de Fleur water of the flower agua frescas or fresh waters date back to the early 15th century when Aztec farmers would crush their fruit and mix it with water for refreshment with culture and tradition in mind we present you with medicated aqua Aguas Fresca's and joy shake well drink cold I would say it definitely doesn't need to be shaken well if you can see there it has a lot of stuff settled at the bottom so let's give it a good shake although there's not a lot of room to shake in there they leave a lot of empty space making shaking more difficult but we'll do our best to make this a homogenous mixture right Oh genius I can't remember so here we go in terms of drinks um drinks I usually find it be okay I usually like drinks there's some that I like better than others I still haven't found one that's as good as ASP that's the best I've ever had um cannabis quencher I like quite a bit the G drinks I like their double strength one's a whole lot so I am quite excited about this and I picked this up for a very affordable twelve bucks at black market dispensary and Wilmington at California right next door to Long Beach so let's one last shake open up this mango flavor and son of a [ __ ] give it a sip smells like mango and weed so if you've never seen a week's review before or if you just need a refresher guys the way all of these work is I'm gonna drink some bit of this product in front of you here just enough to let you know how it tastes all that good stuff but rest assured I'm actually gonna drink all of this and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours after I finish it to let you know how I'm actually feeling because that's what you really care about um you want to know if it tastes terrible but you really want to know if it's gonna get you high so guys let's go ahead and shut me up and give us a taste that's not too bad um a very sort of mellow Mingo II taste not overpowering yeah it's more of an agua agua frescas kind of fruit water taste there is a cannabis aftertaste a relatively strong one but not one of those ones that makes you want to you know run rub your tongue on sandpaper but if you are very sensitive the cannabis tastes you're not gonna like this but if you can handle a little it's it's totally fine and actually for the drinks it's it's on the lower end usually the drinks are among the strongest edibles for cannabis taste for having that cannabis taste this is not that bad so yeah I'm not too displeased with the taste I'm gonna go ahead and drink all 16 fluid ounces of this guy here and then I will see you guys in two hours to let you know if this odd wood floor is agua duh more gore OGG would if you should get this at the \u00e1gueda store yes all right guys see you in two hours bye [Music] because it mentions them there on the back boy this ain't no aqua just snore you should run to the Aqua to store to pick up as much aqua de Flor and perhaps even a little aqua d'amour I think it's pretty good guys I think I'm pretty happy with this one [Music] in the sort of six range which is not bad for a hundred and ten milligram edible or drinkable in this case a pretty affordable at $12 taste wasn't bad as actually for a drink all in all I think this is a one to keep your eye out for some people have recommended it to me I can see why if you see at a dispensary near you and you are interested in drinks I think you're gonna want to give this one a shot especially if you're really sensitive to the weed taste this one is probably the least offensive tasting of any of the weed drinks I've had it's not good tasting by any means but it's not it's not gonna make you wretch so this thumbs up for me I'm quite pleased with this one a agua de Flore mango flavor before I give it the ultimate run out and buy it recommendation if always when I get something that I I quite like I like to do a follow-up review just to make sure and I've got another flavor I think maybe pineapple OTO review so look for that as well and hopefully that one will be another home run and guys before I bounce I want to share with you a little cherry on top or on this case a little mango on top another one of those movie films one of those cinematic experiences that the kids go to and and and [ __ ] whatever and that is the movie that came out last year got a little bit of buzz called the Florida project holy moly from the director of tangerine don't let if you haven't seen that movie don't worry this movie movie stars basically a couple of six year old kids and a couple of six year old kids who live in a motel a shitty shitty shitty motel right outside of Disney World in Orlando and it just follows their lives basically over the course of a summer and it also has willem dafoe as sort of the supervisor of this this building the project manager whatever you call that the person who does all the maintenance and stuff a bad description really really great film on something very different that was about as much story as the movie has to be honest there is a story to follow there but that's not what it was going for the movie packs in quite a lot especially with such small main characters but it's got quite a bit to say and it is absolutely beautiful the Florida Project I know it is currently streaming on Amazon Prime check it out Willem Dafoe is not creepy in this one so that's good maybe anyways a major major major thumbs up for the Florida project and a pretty big thumbs up for aqua agua de Flor I almost forgot the name and there 110 milligram mango thanks for sticking around to the very end of this cherry on top guys I'm never sure if you do but I really appreciate it if you do and that is gonna do it for this video that's gonna do it for this review that's gonna do it for this cherry on top that's gonna do it for pretty much everything wow what a ride we've had together bye guys peace", "KiRy4hC_bOo": "[Music] the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking another look at a cartridge yes this time we are taking a look at the elite select cannabis oil vape cartridge half gram so this is a again the elite select cannabis oil vape cartridge it comes highly recommended from the bud tender at show grow here in Long Beach on the back we've got all the information you could ever want there the strain which is a hybrid white widow they do not have my typical jack herer and that gives you a whoops right down of all of the THC and CBD and most importantly it shows you that was tested by SC labs there gives you the ID the date all that great stuff so you know that this is actually as potent as advertised this claims to be eighty four point two five percent THC which is about the highest I've seen that's about ten percent higher than most cartridges out there that is a lot and so I'm super excited about this and it wasn't that much either it cost me twenty eight dollars at my dispensary pre crazy Orange County Los Angeles County taxes so not too expensive for a half gram cartridge especially for one that proclaims to have eighty four point two five percent THC so without further ado let's go ahead and open it up and talk a little bit about the cartridge the packaging all that stuff so here's our packaging it's quite nice it's a lot of packaging for such a small product as you can see there's just a lot of empty space in there but you know they've got to sell it somehow so now we'll find out if we can see if we can get this actually get this thing out looks easier said than done come on little guy there we go whoa okay this is a new design to me not seen one that looks like this just yet a little plastic stopper on the bottom like all the others now it has a plastic tip that you can see through I've seen glass I've seen metal and I've seen opaque plastic but this is the first time I've seen a see-through plastic tip and you can see the little chamber that the vapor will go through there and then it's got its little logo on there select and then it looks like it has about five intake chambers there so hopefully going to be able to get nice big drawers off of it the oil it looks great itself a nice gold color more viscous than some of the more shattering oil out there and this is just a standard 510 vape pen just the normal bottom there so we'll screw it into our battery here and give it a taste excuse me I'm a cougher well first things I don't really like the plastic tip it's just not a fun thing to stick in your mouth that's what you said it's just leaves kind of an unsavory taste in your mouth just this plastic and softer plastic it's not as hardest like the qurbana plastic tips but yeah I would prefer it to be like aluminum or or glass or something then the sort of plastic this sort of softer plastic than it is um the taste is not my favorite which is uh who excuse me making me sneeze in addition to making me caught I'm making another taste of it yeah it's not my favorite taste of any of the cartridges that just might be the strain I'm never actually had white widow before this but it's kind of kind of an earthy err taste to it then some of the other cartridges as I've been doing and it's a little hotter coming in now that being said I like how much how big of a draw you can get from this with very little effort you don't have to pull hard that was a soft easy draw and I got a nice big big hit off of that and this it's heart this uh definitely feels like 80 4.25 percent THC because this is Landon pretty hard for five pups in and I'm feeling right where I want to be I don't really want to take any more right now maybe I'll do one more puff but man I'm pretty pleased with the potency on this one if the cartridge design and the taste aren't my favorite in terms of potency and in terms of how big of a draw you can get I'm really liking it yeah Wow alright guys so I think that's gonna do it for this initial part of this review so far pretty favorable again I don't like the plastic tip and I don't love the taste sort of earthy air hotter taste it does burn a little bit hotter or seemingly than some of the others um but I really really really like how easy it is to draw and I like how seemingly quite potent it is so you know take that into account and again pretty affordable at 28 bucks at my dispensary so a good value for something with that is that potent but guys as always I'm gonna finish this cartridge off I'm not gonna leave it as is do a couple puffs and leave you with just these first impressions I'm gonna do the whole cartridge and then I will come back to you in the next couple of days however long it takes me to get through this and let you know my wrap-up thoughts see if my thoughts have changed at all see if maybe you know it started to burn really really hot at some point in got unpleasant or maybe the potency sort of degrades over time whatever the case may be I will come back to you guys and let you know exactly what I think of this when I finish it but for now thumbs up so guys I will see you in just a bit thanks for watching weeks and we'll see you soon [Music] Oh only 24 hours since I last checked in with you talking about select white widow here select white widow and guys there are some things I really like about this cartridge and some and one big flaw that I have with this cartridge alright let's talk about the things that I like one you can clear that entire chamber no problem that thing is easy to clear clear at every last little drop of it and it was all pretty potent it all got me pretty high it's definitely as potent as advertised at that eighty four point two five percent or at least it felt that way to me um the taste was okay the taste wasn't my favorite I blend that more on the strain than on the cartridge itself it just had it more of an earthy sort of taste than I then I quite liked but but I don't blame the just its white widow if you like the taste of White Widow you're probably gonna like the taste of this I do not like the plastic tip which I brought up before it just kind of leaves a bad taste in your mouth but overall in terms of potency and cartridge design I really really liked this one as I said it was easy to take nice big clouds from easy never got hot never burned hot and was never difficult to to draw from so I like the cartridge design up in the plastic tip but the one big thing the one thing that I am a little concerned with is I'm not sure that this was actually a half grand as I came back to you guys I said it only took me 24 hours it actually took me less than 24 hours to finish this thing off and that was not with that heavy of usage that was with moderate usage of this cartridge every other cartridge with that kind of usage has lasted me two to three days and this lasted me less than 24 hours in total well and I noticed it just depleting very very quickly now that being said it did allow you to take huge huge draws from it but there are other cartridges out there that allow you to take huge draws from it that still lasted longer so I'm not really certain that this was the half gram as advertised it could be less I think I might have even said that when I first saw it like oh this doesn't look like a half gram I noticed the cartridge had a couple of huge bubbles in it and not my been part of the problem on that they had some air bubbles in it and when they weigh it out they weigh it by volume not necessarily by weight so they just saw that the volume was what it should be with those huge air bubbles but yeah that was a problem I really don't think that there was a half gram in here which really deems that review for me that this only lasted a day on I think I will try select again to see if maybe this was just a cartridge that did have less in it because I liked it well enough to to warrant the second review but that really that it's it's long like it's a long lasting 'no sits uh it's it's longevity that's the word I'm looking for longevity is a real issue this is it was 28 bucks pre-tax for this and it lasted you know as I said less than 24 hours that's not good so I will take a look at select again in the future because there were enough positive aspects to warrant that second review but right now this is gonna be I'm gonna I'm gonna advise passing on it for the time being um just because I want you to make sure you get your money's worth and I'm not sure that you do with this select I don't think you get everything as advertised in there but we will come back to them on a future review and give them the fair shake again and see if maybe this was just a one-off or if there really is some kind of reason that their cartridges deplete so quickly so guys that is gonna do it for this review here on weeks before I bounce however I want to share with you my little cherry on top and that week and this cherry on top excuse me is going to be something that is weed related and something that is a delight to watch whether high or not high and that is HBO's / vimeos high maintenance I don't think I've cherry on top this one before if you've never seen the show high maintenance it is a was originally a web series created by a brilliant husband and wife pairing and it is a show about New York City as told through the eyes sort of through the eyes of one pot dealer in New York City and the many people he run in he runs into during the course of his day job it is fantastic I the vignettes that they post about people in New York City make you jealous make you want to live there it's beautiful it's optimistic it's charming it will make you feel better about your day instead of worse I cannot recommend highly enough that is high maintenance which you can find on HBO and the original web series I think is still on Vimeo you must check it out it is a brilliant show and it's one of the few STONER recommendations I've thrown your way so be sure to watch that one again it's enjoyable high or not high high maintenance check it out and thanks for sticking around to the very end of this cherry on top and thanks for sticking around to the end of the review I appreciate it as always guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "1sf4R6q1Ano": "[Music] the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at a brand new product one that I'm not even a hundred percent sure what it is just yet uh and that is a new edible I think maybe a lozenge I'm not sure what is in here but what I'm talking today about is a level blends pro tab hybrid so I think the company's name is level or level blends all these things have really obscure names there's something that says level there and then it says level blends on the back calm and then it also says Pro tab hybrid I believe it is level blends and I think the product is there Pro tab hybrid something very curious about this is I picked this up at a legal now recreational dispensary here in Long Beach where I live uh but this is not a hundred milligram edible this is actually a 250 milligram a table it is 10 pro tabs whatever those are we're gonna find out together at 25 milligrams each I'm not sure exactly how they are getting away with this I I don't know it if this product is considered compliant with the regulations uh traditionally you can only have at most or at minimum ten servings and a hundred milligrams maximum so this again has 25 milligram servings and 250 milligrams total so I'm not sure how they're getting away with it I know there is a caveat for tinctures tinctures can go up to a thousand milligrams but this is not a tincture so I'm not really sure what they're doing to to bypass the law but I was excited to see it because I like high potency edibles and uh I like things that are small and discreet as well and this appears to be that in spades whatever it is so let's find out it's got a weird way to open it it's got kind of like an old-school like a CD sticker ething on it I'm gonna peel that oh cool it kind of peels in a interesting little pattern so that I'm gonna pull this down and did I do something yes ah okay batch numbers made numbers expires packed on a bunch of cool stuff there on the back okay it says a swallow Pro tab with liquid effects should be felt within 30 to 60 minutes so you know what that means guys it means I'm gonna pause I'll be right back I'm gonna go get some liquid I didn't know that requires I'm gonna go grab a cup of water see in a second I'm back I've got myself some water I am ready to find out what Pro tabs are if I can figure out how to open them I see two arrows pointing in opposite directions it's not really a good indication of how to open it okay wait there we go that's something whoa here we go they are little tabs they look like pills but they're not let's let's take one out uh yeah here they are they're like little aspirin II looking things don't really have an odor to speak of but they're little tablets not what I was expecting I was expecting maybe like one of those Lawson jizz or things that dissolve in your tongue not little pill things interesting so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna eat every one of these or swallow or whatever it is that you end up doing what Beast all 250 milligrams and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how I'm feeling I'm really excited about this one I am very hopeful that this is gonna be a slam-dunk product because I would love love love for to finally have a pill form of THC that that works because all the capsules I've tried so far have been dog [ __ ] so we shall try the pro tabs from level blends here we go I just swallowed it I'm not sure if that's what I'm supposed to do um we're not swallow Pro tab with liquid effect should be felt within 30 to 60 minutes fair enough okay well I will swallow a couple more of these and then I'll wait a half an hour and swallow the rest of them there we go you have three more no case look there's kind of a wee taste when they go your tongue it is all very quickly I found out as soon as it that one hit my tongue it started to disintegrate and get kind of powdery and weedy tasting okay well pro tabs guys I am very very very hopeful that these are going to be a new product that I would love because I've been looking for something like this for a very long time so again this is the pro tab hybrid bi-level blends fingers crossed that this one is gonna be the pill that we've all been waiting for alright guys I will check back with you in two hours and rest assured I will finish these off between now and then and I'll let you know exactly how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeks see you soon I [Music] am indigestion let's start over that's bad let's do that more Jeff [Music] welcome to the Future guys the future of actually about three hours later just got out of a movie wild ass movie that knew Paul Feig comedy thriller thing I can't even remember the title the title of movies terrible a simple favor I think there might be a terrible title man what a weird movie that is I can't believe that's a major block a major motion picture almost that that somebody let that those movie stars in that movie happen no judgement what I am here to pass judgment on however is Pro tab hybrid a classic high amplifies your body and mind right there there 250 milligram Pro tabs and again the pro tabs and we're just little capsules just tiny little pill size excuse me not capsules just um the flattened pills I have no idea what that term is I know there's specific terms for each of the shapes and sizes but forgive me for not knowing this is not a oilfield thing and the verdict is gavel bang bang bang bang bang the verdict is this is without a doubt the best pill form of THC I have found yet that is not to say it is perfect I don't think it's a it doesn't feel as equivalent as some other 250 milligram anibal's maybe like it's you know but that's it's it's still good it's it's on the good and for a 215 milligram edible or I on the end of acceptable too good but in the form of having something that you can take in a pill form especially if you're taking lower doses than I am in being able to just pop one or two before a concert and before a lecture for all you kids in college you know whatever the case may be I quite like the pro tab I am I'm pretty pleased with it to be honest it's the first one that I will buy again I would buy this again for certain occasions again when I'm looking to take something maybe in a smaller dosage and something very discrete you could certainly just stick this at any kind of like pill bottle take it on an airplane don't take that advice for me never heard that but yeah it is just a little bit pricier than other edibles but that is in line with capsules although it's not as expensive nearly as expensive as some of the other capsules on this was 30 bucks at my dispensary there about plus or minus taxes which can be substantial in Long Beach but I did not feel at all ripped off by this not in the slightest again this is a pretty positive one for me I'm pretty happy with I [ __ ] I think I got the name wrong the whole time again I think it's level blends pro tab I'll look that up and the title will be right so that is gonna do it for this review here on weeds I don't think I'm gonna share with you guys a cherry on top I you know what I'm just gonna say that little rant I had about whatever the shitty title of that weird Paul Feig movie is a simple plan oh wait no no this is what I do that yeah this is the second part of the video well I'm higher than I thought yeah I don't have a cherry on top for you I I didn't I feel like you guys didn't deserve it this time um step it up you know you need to step up your game I'll step up mine I love you though peace from wheats booty love", "HLSejK469YU": "[Music] you show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our third look at a tincture product today and our second one from the folks at yummy karma today we are taking a look at their mood magic 240 milligrams tincture here and as you can see I picked this up at my dispensary for 25 bones which is a really good price for a 240 ml of gram a tincture although it is a little bit more expensive than their drift away tincture their 300 milligram er which I've seen as low as twenty dollars now this one here is designed for as it says on their website and is designed for menstrual cramps and menstrual pain which it is my time of the month I'm feeling a little bloated a little sore a little cramped so I'm really hoping that this mood magic relieves my menstrual pain and cramping I'll be sure to let you know for sure so uh what we're gonna do here what we've done for our previous tinctures is I'm gonna do about the same amount that I did with the original tinker the drift away I'm gonna try to do about a hundred milligrams and they say that one full dropper is about eight milligrams of THC so I'm going to try to do about 12 ish in total I'll do a couple here on camera just to kind of let you know how it tastes how it feels all that good stuff and then I'll come back to you guys two hours later to let you know how this mood magic is landing so if you hadn't tuned in to my first yummy karma review where we did the drift away the one that helps you fall asleep I was surprised by several things from the yummy karma folks whoops oh the dropper is not in there to start with oh it's a different kind of bottle than the other one so there were a couple things that I was surprised by one was how affordable it was tincture is usually quite expensive and this is quite affordable in two I was by how inoffensive it tasted this one does say I as I had assumed that it is a coconut oil base I assumed the last one was as well tasted vaguely of coconut so I was very surprised at how awful it tasted so if we can figure out how to get this little wrapper off we'd be in business and we would start the review proper let's see what we have to do here with the teeth that looks like that was the trick okay childproof lid mood magic package genes nice packaging is fine like it like the bottle everything's it's got all the directions that you need on there this one is actually packaged a little bit better the other one the other one was just a pure bottle there was no stunning wrapper on the outside it was much harder to read I think it was printed right on the bottle as opposed to in a wrapper so this is a lot easier to read a lot easier to get the information from and I like it quite a bit so let's open this childproof lid here smells fruity and coconutty and let's get ourselves a dropper so here is the liquid it looks cutter Li putrid it's green gross vile looking stuff but it really doesn't taste that bad if it tastes like the drift away so the way we take our tincture is sublingually which means under the tongue we leave it there for about 30 seconds I do a couple of drops at a time leave it there for about 30 seconds and then come back to you guys and I'll let you know how it tastes and all that fun stuff so here we go all right accusing our Brewer air yeah Bob not bad that is even a more neutral taste than the other one even a less coconut base it almost tastes like nothing at all I don't feel like I've done a gag or nothing nothing I it's it's it's really it's really quite wonderful I mean it doesn't taste wonderful but it's just it's kind of magic how moon magic even how I'm neutral that tastes well guys I have about three I have to do another two of those and buy two of those I mean to not just droppers but another two mouthfuls and then I will not gonna do that all on camera because it'll just be boring but I will do another eight drops and then I will come back to you guys in two ish hours or so let you know how long it's been and give you my thoughts once I'm nice and high so guys I'll see you in just a bit thanks for watching wheats see you soon all my menstrual cramps pains and discomforts disappeared thanks mood magic well guys I can't really speak to that aspect of the mood magic product I can speak to the aspect of does it still get you high and the answer is yes this guy is high um I'm probably at like six and a half and climbing it's actually a little bit early coming into you guys I'm coming at you guys really only about an hour and 15 minutes in but I have some things to do and I can feel it escalating and that's with about the same amount of tincture that I took roughly equivalent to the drift away I might not feel as high just yet but I am taking a little bit earlier and this is 50 milligrams less than the drift away but I'm still gonna recommend it I still think this is a great product I still think as far as tinctures go this is the best how Hugh bar in a way that's out there for tinctures except looking at you house brand tincture that is the worst value and tincture even though it should be the best its advertises at the best but it's the worst value see rambling usually pretty good sign that I'm high so yes I really like this an another winner from Yummie Carmen they're really starting to grow on me have like their popcorn and I've liked their tinctures I'm starting to really root for these guys the yummy karma mood magic 240 milligram THC tincture another winner from them and guys before I balance here on this review I want to share with you a little cherry on top something that's not necessarily weed relator something that could be enjoyed with or without weed but just something that I love that I want to share with you guys so in another life and this is a great for possible cherry on top of it cherry on top sin the future and another life I was an avid avid board gamer I had hundreds of board games and a collection loved it played them every weekend obsessed over them I I have not played board games in a very long time well in several years I've kind of quit that hobby cold turkey but there are some games that I would love to recommend to you guys the first one I'm going to recommend is so simple you can learn this game in literally I think the the rules come on like less than an index card sized piece of paper you can learn it in 30 seconds but I have probably played this card game called no thanks exclamation mark sorry a little indigestion there so again the name is no thanks it is a very quick card game played with some poker chips cards numbered by fate 3 to 35 or something like that and a bunch of poker chips and it is a super fun game that you can play with 3 to 7 players takes about 15 minutes to play and as I said about 30 seconds to explain I'm not even gonna bother to explain it here you can pick it up for $11 on Amazon that is a perfect game to play you know when you've got friends over when you got family over when you're going on vacation wherever the case may be it plays great with 3 it plays great with 7 and as I said it's 11 bucks on Amazon you have no excuse for picking it up if you have any inclination towards playing board or card games or anything like again that is no thanks exclamation mark on Amazon 11 bucks pick it up you'll thank me later and that guy's is gonna do it for this cherry on top and for this review here on weeds I appreciate you guys watching as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "CT8BcG8489c": "why you shouldn't microdose magic mushrooms every single day hello guys my name is Jeff from neural growth dot CA be sure to click on that bell and we're here today to talk about tolerance resets and why you should not be taking magic mushrooms every single day so first of all we got to kind of clear the air on some of the research that's been done here so you know some people say and we've had some commenters like you cannot microdose even two or three days in a row your tolerance builds way too quickly well that's true and it's kind of not true and again most of the research that's been done in this area has been done on the macro dose scale like John Hopkins where they give somebody four grams you know 4,000 milligrams of a psilocybin I think that's like probably 30 days worth of micro dosing and then they give them that same 4 grams the next day and very little happens so they established that we do build tolerance we build it very quickly and we also lose the tolerance very quickly which is a good thing so what this means is you're gonna have to do some experimenting on yourself and you definitely need to be taking certain resets certain break periods and if you haven't seen some of our earlier videos be sure to check them out you know we talked about you know doing five days on two days off or four days on three days off and some people do really enjoy the one day on one day off and the whole reason that we recommend these things is to avoid a very important condition and this condition is you know serotonin burnout syndrome and again you know the oscilloscope and mimics serotonin it plays right on the serotonin receptor sites and if you don't give yourself an opportunity to clear out these receptor sites clear out the oscilloscope and then you're gonna note those receptor sites and they're not going to be able to receive the normal natural serotonin that your brain and body create and this can lead to mild depression and just overall lack of focus lack of energy pretty much all the things that we're trying to make better by micro dosing and the other very important factor is we don't want this to be a crutch for everyone it's not about having to be addicted to a new pill or a new supplement it's about showing yourself that you can get some amazing benefit from micro dosing and then when you take an off day or when you come off of them those can still be amazing days as well in fact I often find and those in my close circle as well that some of our best days are actually the off days when we're not taking it and I think partially that's because you know when you take an off day you're thinking you know it's almost like you're telling yourself I need to eat healthy today and you're like darn it you know can't have pizza can't do this and it comes with you know a sense of you know negativity so you kind of go into the day with that energy but then you realize oh my gosh I'm still feeling awesome I'm still focused still productive and that just makes you realize wow like I can do this all on my own I'm truly building and repairing my brain and body and it just leads to overall feeling so much more confident so don't fear the brakes and the resets take days off take weeks off if you feel like you need to you can always come back to it whereas if you start getting burnt out this can lead into just more stress and again you're just undoing a lot of the progress that you've made so again so important take your breaks take your resets and experiment with it you know I always recommend the five days on two days off it's been my ultimate favorite although I play around with it too sometimes after four days I feel like you know time to take a few days off here and see how it goes so just listen to your intuition and just be very honest with yourself you know you know mark it on the calendar on your on days and so you're keeping track of it this all ties back into intense and of course you can check out our video on how to set intense and you just want to make this a truly healing experience now if you have not checked out our complete beginners guide to micro dosing check it out in the link below so much information especially if this is the first video you've seen from neuro growth that is one of the go-to places it's an excellent resource and of course if you

stuff and yeah I will check out in this episode which one of these is the best and I guess I'm starting with this the sky bar so here we go okay so for all my American viewers you must know them let me know which one is your favorite and sky bar comes on such a tray and looks like this and I cut it I always cut stuff okay and as caramel and tight this is always yeah sometimes caramel and sometimes some sort of chocolate feeling and I taste it no I think it's two different types of caramel okay very deep um yeah so that's even white I need to search for the white stuff here we go ah so it's an interesting thing home there is no first place because it was the first product to try let's go for this what some are call it oh they try to be very funny and stuff what should I call it um yeah this looks good here we go I always cut stuff a ham they add some sort of syria's inside and yeah let's bite off mmm it's definitely nice this is good stuff nice texture um crispy yeah manga food so this is a new first place whatchamacallit and yeah let's do some name dropping very famous Butterfinger oh here we go yeah I'm sorry I can't show you all the nutrition packed and ingredients would be far too long everybody like the other part of the viewership which don't want to know it I don't care which tune out so it's pride don't very brutal it is brutal basically um nice but not as nice as a whatchamacallit what is this so this is a new second place um let's continue so here comes something called oh Henry let's check out what Henry can offer ok let's try it and it's actually two powered and I'm just by that Oh Carl or I'll just completely like Snickers or don't have Snickers in the mix now I'm wrong so I think young cert place I like the Butterfinger a little bit more now so this like the nest live version of Snickers to tell you to tell there's a texture and asana for the behavior the taste of snicker would you agree or not have to try it oh Henry yeah so new cert plays let's continue with arm yeah take five five layer bound to certain strings is sort of cutting there we go on there yeah they are Germans if you ask yourself why as a German stickers on it's because like I bought an import storm and they have to put on the ingredients and German here we go I always cover okay so is it really five layers so we got a pretzel at the bottom chocolate pretzel yeah it's wife layers nice okay tasted great to practice them um stocked or hang these two things ah and salty a little bit sour also okay arm I guess I read just a new short place yeah okay now I try zero and zero is white obviously and that's happen okay water fish power cuts off or hard it was an efficient but chaste wash I don't know tastes funky no I don't like it's interesting but I don't like it too much so I rated a rigid last place I think okay I think now I flush so much stuff okay here comes baby root and this protein for Gwen's protein this is a lot on what I don't know five I check it out and this is definitely the most institution look at one I break it up so here breaking up is also interesting so I seem to be love peanuts and this looks very sophisticated so your inner core is a soft core no I always cut up you know soft core oh I knew I liked to oh Henry more actually um so maybe root comes in here okay two more to go so I actually got Snickers but not the normal one Snickers peanut butter also squared okay all right this was look like let's cut it here again I always cut that this looks interesting let's have it okay I think I've been too much shopping now but I'm try to rate it tastes like nothing the sweets our team substance which tastes there's nothing so I think this is last place snicker squared nice place and out comes her she and this make chocolate almond and yeah let's have it okay oh yeah nice branding big Hershey's pressed in as a Spartan concept let's try how good it is on gone that's pretty much the most straightforward um I like it short play ground it simpler than it effective so so here we go my rating is finished and on first page he got the whatchamacallit I like the texture with the stroke of genius I think what what was he has remains and what wasn't whatchamacallit I was a long thing I remember here no this was so I'm confused now yeah looked like this yeah this was a whatchamacallit very nice texture a nice flavor I liked it second place Butterfinger it's a nice done brittle nice texture there is a sugar bomb very sweet but it's okay it's just one then comes her shame and yeah then take five from the salty snacks I like this the most tasty stuff then oh Henry which is the Snickers clone or Snickers oppa Henry what was what was before what was the first product oh Henry or sneakers and a name this is totally Snickers clone I still kind of like it and a baby would is sophisticated but for my taste turns I didn't liked it too much then the super sweet and creamy sky bar which is I think for caramel lover lovers then I didn't really got the sense of the zero it was sophisticated but the taste was not that great again in the last place I completely not get it as a Snickers peanut butter squared or sweet salty undefined strange substance okay and then now it's not good so this is the range I would say I would say until here win then this sweet draw and this is a fail for me it's a fail so have you tried one of these what'd you think about it what's your favorite one would you agree the writing or not it's even a better one than whatchamacallit would you say and yeah thanks for your attention and Su Su", "462zIfmmZIo": "[Music] well no eat skies we are talking t K o edibles again today this is the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and as I said we are talking the fine folks at t KO one of their hundred milligrams today the peanut butter and jelly crispy that's right the peanut butter and jelly crispy from TKO we've reviewed a variety of products from TKO and I think on the whole they're pretty good I've liked them all pretty much they all seem to be as potent as advertised and they usually taste at the bare minimum okay and sometimes even verging on good so I'm not actually sure what makes it a peanut butter and jelly crispy what what the jelly part is or the peanut butter in this don't know but looking forward to try it sounds good to me it sounds like flavorful and good it's a pretty affordable edible only cost me seven bucks in my dispensary as the packaging sort of indicates it's an affordable edible but in this case or than the previous TKO edibles does not mean it's they skimp out on the potency just means that you've got some less than fancy packaging which it's fine with me as long as you know they if they're saving that are passing the savings on to you that's great so let's go ahead and open this up and give you a little taste test then I'll finish it off and I will come back to you guys in two hours or two hours from me just a couple seconds from you guys just to let you know how I'm feeling so here we go open it up there you can smell the peanut butter smell to it for sure it smells a lot like peanut butter let's give it a taste mm I don't know how they do it there is a peanut butter and jelly taste to it what peanut better than jelly but there's definitely that fruity jelly sort of taste to it as well it's good I like it quite a bit this might be my second favorite tasting one behind the s'mores which I had but this one's pretty good I like the cereal like rice krispie treats and this one is not bad so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I will come back to you in two hours to actually let you know how it's feeling and for you it'll just be right after this break thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace hungry YUM got me some munchies um welcome back sweets guys sorry about that it's been two hours since I had the TKO 100 milligram peanut butter and jelly krispies and I gotta say I like it a lot I'm gonna solid five five and a half somewhere like that which is a pretty good value for a seven dollar edible I'm about as high as I you know I'm happy with where I'm with my high and not really wish it was any higher I really like the taste of it too one of the better tasting TKOs just all around a good product for another winner from TKO certainly one of my favorites from them and a surprising potency from just a hundred milligram edible so if you see this one out of the dispensary near you and you're okay with the lower dose edibles do not hesitate to grab the peanut butter and jelly krispies I don't think you'll be upset that you did and guys I'm gonna eat some more of this food I'm really looking forward to that and I will see you on the next review thanks for watching peace", "nRT-wE3gbAA": "[Music] this b.width the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary when I'm feeling pretty tingly feeling good it's a cartridge review today one that I've had a lot of people request and one that I see mentioned a pretty often in terms of best oh the best and that is bloom Farms we're taking a look at bloom farms highlighter they're relaxed single origin 1/2 gram indica the kryptonite strain so the Kryptonite from bloom farms handsome packaging here nothing too ostentatious and we've got our all-natural cannabis oil full-spectrum a only 61% THC in there which seems a little low but we'll see if it still hits on the back we've got date of manufacture if the camera will focus we've got all the good pertinent information you'd like to see let's read a little bit of the [ __ ] here before we give it our taste test at bloom Farms our mission is to help millions of people find relief relaxation creativity and happiness millions that is an ambitious goal for any cannabis product right now all of our cannabis is California grown by responsible family farmers like us who care about the land the environment the plant and you our products are made using pure co2 free of petroleum-based solvents gently refined and meticulously lab tested la-dee-da so let's open this guy up and take a looks we've got an extra packaging inside of our fancy packaging here so just a slip little box there just slips right out and then on the inside you've got a little foil bag here hopefully that'll be easy to open I would be pretty steamed if this was not easy to open and I just picked this up and was going somewhere let's see well looks like this is going to require some scissors I've learned my lesson I've gotten close by now but that's a strike I should have some easy to tear thing there but I don't know okay pretty pretty pretty that is a very dark oil much darker than I'm used to definitely looks only like the half gram there uh it is a plastic tip unfortunately but it is a handsomely colored blue plastic tip generally not a fan of the plastic tips this one is also not that durable of a plastic I've had some ones with like almost that really tough plastic before that I didn't mind too much that even kind of liked this doesn't seem to be as robust but hasn't been in my mouth yet so can't really say again darker oil standard 510 all that good stuff I've got my vape battery here standard 510 looks a little different because it's designed to look like a keychain or a car fob for your keys so let's go ahead and screw this on there's the tip let's see how it reacts in heat uh and give it a taste test all that stuff and guys before I do it here let's just explain the way my reviews work I'm sorry if you've seen this a million times but we'll get through it pretty quickly so the way our reviews work for cartridges is I'm gonna test this out here let you know how it tastes how high it gets me how hard it hits how it burns hot all that stuff and then I will actually finish this whole half gram off and I will come back to you at the very end as soon as I finished it and let you know about my wrap-up thoughts because as you all know if you do cartridges the experience changes throughout the cartridge and it can be a very different experience at the end than at the so I like to make sure I talk about it at the beginning and at the end so you get the full experience so here we go Wow don't worry that is on me not on the product I'm sorry for making you all this in my crops I've gotten better about it about coughing but I'm still bad especially when it comes to vaping but one more and one more that is incredibly smooth oh my god Wow that it's like that actually it's like a dream ignore my coughing seriously that is silky smooth um this is my first time trying the kryptonite strain and I really really enjoy that taste yeah um it's kind of a more earthy sort of piney taste and I normally like the fruitier flavors or the fruity or tasting strains but this this is really good it has a very just kind of clean very clean taste to it I'm really enjoying it um taste is great smoothness is great in terms of how high I am uh about average for a cartridge I'm not as high as I would be if this I'm not as high as like a heavy hitter or a Orkin or something like that but I'm I'm sufficiently high I'm happy with how high I am and I picked this up for the too expensive costs of 30 bucks in Long Beach which is not bad for Long Beach and not too bad I I don't think these are the most expensive cartridges it definitely seems to hit harder than the 61 percent THC that's listed there it seems to hit as hard as some the cartridges that list you know 75 plus or whatever um yeah I love the taste love how smooth it is I'm not a big fan of the plastic tip but it's not it's not a super cheap quality it's it's it's it's actually it's it's it's fine I wish it were a different material but it's it's not as egregious as some of the earlier plastic tips it's like a dream super smooth tastes great and it gets you high enough I'm really quite digging this one so far I also really like the packaging just a handsome package so bloom farms so far so good the Kryptonite strain at this point gets a thumbs up but be sure to stick around for the second half of this review where I give you my wrap-up thoughts let's just make sure this is good all the way through and then I will give up that hardy recommendation that it may or may not deserve thanks for sticking to sticking around guys and we will see you on the back half of this review piece [Music] two and a half days or so since I checked in with you last talking bloom Farms if it'll show up they're there relax single origin kryptonite indica half gram cartridge here she is finished out as you can see just about every drop of that oil is free and clear of that cartridge and the verdict I'm gonna give it a thumbs up I liked it quite a bit it is a qualified thumbs up however there are some caveats on let's get the bat out of the way first and that is this is not the most potent cartridge I've ever had this one definitely will not get you to the same levels of high as like a brass knuckle or a heavy hitter or a steezy something like that it's not it's not gonna get you to that level what it does however offer is an incredibly smooth hit I love how silky this thing hits it's really quite something nice and it is delicious this is an incredibly good tasting cartridge I actually just enjoyed just hitting it just for the flavor to be honest it was just one of the best tasting cartridges I've ever had and I believe it's all from terpenes alone so that is really cool really a really enjoyed this one but if you're in the market if you're just going straight dollars to doughnuts you want to get the cartridge this will give you the best bang for your buck at 30 bucks for a half gram for Long Beach that's not bad but you can find better values out there this is a little bit higher end probably of a product and you are gonna play a little bit of a premium for that but it does taste like a premium product so I am overall quite pleased with it and before I bounce guys uh because that's gonna do it for this review here for the bloom farms kryptonite indica a half gram but before I bounce I want to share with you guys a little cherry on top something you can enjoy throughout your week that is or is not weed related or that can be enjoyed with or without weed but I might recommend this one with weed and that is if you haven't ever had the experience or the the opportunity somehow on this earth to watch king of the hill you need to go and sit down and just start watching yourself some some king of the hill one of the greatest animated programs of all time one of the greatest sitcoms of all time in my opinion and some of the greatest character writing in TV history Mike judge total genius beavis and butthead guy the office space guide idiocracy guy and most recently Silicon Valley but I still think his finest work ever is on king of the hill streaming on a bunch of different things google it you can find it watch king of the hill light up you're gonna have a blast I promise you so guys that's gonna do it for this review for the bloom Farms highlighter again that's a thumbs up and the cherry on top this review was king of the hill check it out if you haven't already what are you waiting for so guys I appreciate you sticking around to the very end of this cherry on top and I appreciate you sticking around at the very end of this review thank you so much for watching guys and we will see you on the next review", "Ycpkm2BjNb8": "oh [ __ ] coding my name agile welcome to dab gaming TV I'm your host vory and in this video I have a very special edible for you guys personal favorite of mine I'm so glad we found a box of these hiding out my work because these things are [ __ ] fire you guys heard a keep Cola yet if you have it keep an eye out for these products look them up check them out I mean look at [ __ ] color come on this sells itself people are like what is that I want to I want to know more about that item all the time all day long so this to the best of my knowledge it's like some sort of like blue cotton candy blue berry something whatever I don't know I don't know what the [ __ ] flavor it's supposed to be it's delicious it's really really good you guys a lot of cannabis drinks have a heavy flavor in the background this does not this is super enjoyable I've had their their Cola I've had the root beer I've had the orange cush they're all awesome this is the best one so I bought for today it's like that I just I had to swoop I'm not gonna miss out again and neither are you guys so let's get a little poor upshot here hopefully my camera's gonna focus fire guys be one sec let me check the camera here oh yeah we are in focus and let's go in for this poor now I know it's gonna throw up like a ditch but at the same time I just you know I wanted this shot look at that color that's a [ __ ] trip uh-huh it's just screaming blue right looks like something out of Fallout right let's get you a cola or some [ __ ] it's too cool so my favorite thing about this product is not how it tastes but how it hits it says on the bottle 100 milligrams of THC that's like did I I don't know according to whose standards but this [ __ ] hits like a 150 160 even like a 180 would you know if you guys have had a lot of edibles in the industry right now you know they vary greatly 100 milligrams in one brand is nothing and then 100 milligrams in another is really [ __ ] intense this is one of those heavy ones this is one of this ones it's gonna [ __ ] hit you I'm really really impressed so had one earlier off-camera starting to feel it now we're gonna go ahead and consume two more um um I'm getting set to have a great night yeah so let me finish this one with liquid because I think the cold ones gonna be harder to drink but it'll be more pleasant so trade offs Cheers yeah warmer you definitely taste the canvas isn't it but it's still good it's still really really good Cheers mmm that is the [ __ ] spot oh yeah so I wanted to make this one more of like an official review because of how I feel about this product you guys it's really just super nice it's price point and I don't really want to say well we sell it out if you want to check it out we're on weed maps you know check out some stats a dispensaries would keep colas and it's just one of those things where I feel like you get a lot of bang for your buck a lot of canvas drinks are they're pretty expensive this is one of the more affordable ones I found and it just just works and normally doesn't work but it's really enjoyable to consume and that that for me is just a huge win because there's so many edibles out there that you just kind of have to get through or get through it and then it gives you bubbly guts you know like nasty just feeling like it's just too much so much [ __ ] you know it's just cheers to keep Cola you guys are doing it right much respect from dad even just shits fire seriously super fire so you guys can check out the bottle you can see it's a lot of information on it got this story there it says born in Colorado Keith's Cola and all of its products are intended to provide a breath of fresh air into the world of Medicine we infuse each of our products with premium California cannabis we hope you enjoy oh damn you know [ __ ] anybody from Keith Cola sees this small chance of that but you know if anybody sees this you guys as far as I'm concerned you guys have succeeded in what you set out to do this is truly a breath of fresh air to me it's so enjoyable I love selling it love having hot in the sales room just to show people especially people who dab because they have a higher tolerance and they're not that ain't a bull's a lot of times because they're a flavor person and then I can show them this and honestly say hey you're gonna really enjoy the [ __ ] out of it and it's gonna step very high up to a whole other level you know you're gonna feel like you just dab for the first time again or whatever you're not really even gonna smoke that much and they'll be like what I'm like no really for real come back and tell me what you think and they always come back and in life clock you got any more of this one or whatever it's just like it's just one of those things I love I love it it's so [ __ ] good you guys pop this second one shake it up because if you notice stuff does kind of tend to settle on the bottom I've seen that in like all candidates drinks I don't know what's up with that it's just something into the process and how they infuse it it tends to settle out huh but anyway I had to give these guys a rating out of 10 they're getting a solid nine like not to be [ __ ] with I haven't really had anything on their level and when it comes to a cannabis beverage in terms of like like this is this is dangerously good type [ __ ] like I should say that on the pond start slow dangerously good you know it's these are fire so [ __ ] it's something where if we have them in stock it's this gonna be like god dammit here take my money it's one of those situations for me where I like it I like it so much I like it a little too much dangerous Cheers yeah look at that [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna take a quick death because I just got home from work I'm ready to [ __ ] have a dad all right hopefully I can make this little duct work taking a rip out of that Otis today stuff so [ __ ] good there's just not a lot of edibles out there that I can truly truly enjoy yes you guys I understand you feel me let me know down below in the comments maybe there maybe there's something else I need to try tell me what's up my dad you know kind of awkward but is how we do it purity pure THC a dabs Cheers well that hits the spot after a long day alright so I'm gonna save this last one for my day off tomorrow not tomorrow next day for work tomorrow it's been a long week tomorrow is my Friday so at least there's that huh I look forward to having this one I'm gonna finish this one off camera you guys sigh don't rush it too much but [ __ ] this is this is so far I get if you see them anywhere do not hesitate pick this [ __ ] up it's gonna knock you on your ass and she's really just [ __ ] good my name is vory and I'm the dad demon thanks for watching peace [Music] you",

it out these are the ingredients you're gonna need place right here we got a cure seed oil will open and the sec that's haunt your culture in the cup it's coming in a seventy seven and a half percent THC so we got a camp just spray the mold Nestle Tollhouse the chocolate morsels we have our finalists yeah yeah this is an optional ingredient that last minute anyway you also got like a little pie [Music] kappa chocolate chips [Music] [Music] okay so now puron THC oil [Music] Simon goes next tutorials chocolate chips I'm gonna use about a cup of a cup of chocolate chips 1/2 of a milliliter oh no leader walk around so he's my super super strong super super powerful it was a lot so I wind up doing three quarters of a cup instead of a full cup anyway down [Music] [Music] [Music] oh yeah okay so now [Music] okay so now you're gonna add a little drop on the best thing you could measure me but I would say like I have half a milliliter a half a capful Oh quickest drug that you can do because this stuff is just make sure you don't want no more than that that's the perfect amount stir that in there mix in there first before you put your concentrating in writing down turn down the heat all the way too low make sure we're making this you be patient because you want to make sure you strike you know concentrate in chocolate at the right temperature so it can go into the mold and a perfect temperature so you're concentrating don't it's like they're so careful two minutes okay so now I think this is at the right temperature and we have our concentration different prices different purities [Music] the glass is not everybody is D car now let's say you can you guys can your shadow because just the way you can use wax butter whatever make this stuff we could use rising chips now and don't make the boy yourself with MCT oil but you got to make sure that when you make it you just come decarboxylate whatever type of format [Music] start blowing the molds okay it's filling up there [Music] they see me I don't have patience for this it's easier to pour chocolate into the mold so the chocolate doesn't start stiffening up on I don't know how many chocolates wasn't gonna get starts in the next one we got it like those settle down let's see what we got there it's making more than me expected you really use the rest of this to make sure [Music] [Music] you take this some - off and added something - so this is like the neatest job do you know what made me think that is is because everybody likes camisa so why the gummies was very like such a hick like a big hick when you get this right when you get the edibles right data almost like the best ways [Music] so so cuz I'm out of that big one over there anyone that means we should be the main thing guys is you wanna make sure [Music] even now we still have some leftover chocolate so you scrape that in last one this is how it looks out the freezer so like I told you guys the oil would go away and we definitely needed it things in a condo so let's get our chocolates out face [Music] [Music] hmm goodness gracious its taste so good I would not believe it so all together we got one two three four five six seven eight nine so I got twenty-one chocolates each chocolate is about 70 milligrams apiece [Music] [Music]", "EL43NmsfKWw": "what is up my fellow earthlings i am the duke of dabs here just to bring you some more cannabis related content in regards to my channel this channel is dedicated to medical patients and people 21 years old to recreationally smoke thank you for joining me today today we're just going to be doing a little bit of a review session a I know it's Monday but I've been kind of throwing around a couple of ideas maybe but for right now I'm just gonna do a impromptu kind of review on this now as you can see here I the true infusion brand here these guys are gonna be gummies tinctures you name it they come in both indica sativa they have some hybrids they have one two ones which means it has a little bit of THC and CBD in it this one is purely THC there are ten milligrams per gummy the nice thing about these the gluten free they're also gonna be very low on all of your daily stuff it's like sixteen calories per so the entire bag is about a hundred calories yada yada the people who are concerned with that kind of thing dosage on those is very very steady I would say I've eaten eight whole bags of these and even at just like 50 milligrams you're feeling like you're you feeling some of the effects definitely coming on in regards to having a gummy gummies digest a little bit differently then I'd say like chocolate or a soda in that regards gummies kind of have a little bit of a longer digest time to them but once they start taking effect it's pretty golden this particular batch that I had here on both of them they're gonna be banana cream flavored and blueberry flavored but the strain that goes into it is going to be purple Bubba so it's a definite high THC indica that will definitely bring about more of a body pain relief kind of feel to it versus a more cerebral uplift that a sativa would give this would be more for pain management rest you name it that kind of deal just relaxing true fusion has been one of my favorite brands so far they're one of my definite go twos when it comes to Arizona medical they are an Arizona company they originally started out doing mostly the CBD infusions and then they kind of started dabbling with the THC and yeah they really come a long ways in regards to the products they've always had pretty good products but now they've just surpassed pretty much what they were doing originally so without further ado I'm gonna go ahead and get one of these guys opened up here just to kind of give us a nice clear view upon opening the bag you have a very strong banana flavored it's not gonna be very big here for comparison sizes I'll show ya the that's a quarter golden quarter it's about a little larger than a quarter so the thickness on it it's like a Lego in brick the smell of it instantly you can tell it's banana flavored first taste of it tastes like banana runs nimma jaw a little tingly there that one was the banana now I've tried the banana before I've always liked blueberries a brand new flavor this is the first time for both of us here oh yeah it's got a very blueberry hint to it these have a nice resealable bag to them so you can keep your products fresh blueberry same size same shape consistency same fruit smell okay it almost tastes like a blue otter pop so the taste on these guys there is a little bit of a weedy taste to it which it's not too bad it's not gonna be like other edibles that I've eaten before that chocolate bar that I had in the previous videos more weedy than this is but these guys are nice little 10 milligram doses here so two of these bags 200 milligrams at our location they're only $12 a bag for a hundred milligrams I mean it's a pretty good deal it's need a couple more cuz I'm gonna have a aftermath do what these guys do go ahead and take another blueberry we're sitting at about 30 milligrams now 40 50 six day we're going to go for about 80 seventy very gives you dry Josh they're like I'm very gelatinous consistency they're not gonna be like a super hard gummy but they're not like super stretchy either you can see it final 180 let's go bigger girl let's just add 20 more milligrams on buy big or go home I mean 100 milligrams it's not too terribly large or the dose but still large enough to make your average edible use your 100 milligram Cheers all right so we got those edibles down pretty pretty fast I'd say I see that we're only about nine minutes into this video here and we've eaten about a hundred milligrams so I'm gonna give it probably another 40 minutes or so I'll snap back over here to this video section once again I'm do cubed ABS just medical patient video channel thing if you're new here please mash that subscribe button we want to be a fellow earthling not a peasant to poop soup so yeah I'll be coming back to make a follow-up video after math video to this one I've really got to go to the bathroom right now and trying to kind of contain myself so that I can make a nice outro here but once again guys if you are in the Arizona area and you're a medical patient please try out some true infusion gunman's if you've never tried them try out their tinctures I personally give it the Duke seal of approval so I mean I've been in the industry for nearly three years now and I can tell you I like to sample out my products and you know what I'm telling my patients so that I'm not giving them you know false hopes or anything along that lines once again I'm not and when I say patients I don't mean I'm a doctor or anything I I never claim that I'm a doctor I'm just basically your friendly neighborhood naturopathic pharmacist essentially that's all I do is I dispense it out to the public who have medical cards so it's about it anyways we'll be coming back in about an hour or so with a follow-up to these bad boys and the 100 milligrams and how we're feeling in the effects and I'll catch you then peace", "UWbeqGgSyOE": "welcome back once again to how to cook great food calm nothing cooking today we're looking at some classic old British chocolate sweets we call them you call them candy I think in America yeah chocolate sweets that we add as as as kids really had quite a few emails about this there are quite a few of these I don't think you can get in the States for some reason I'm not really

wafer I got like a biscuit little caramel toffee I'm not sure covered in chocolate really popular kids that they were really popular still tastes great Cadbury's flake I mean another one that's really been around for years it's just really flaky milk chocolate again had a massive advert of early is the corporates one of the adverts only the crumbly is flaky it's chocolate tastes like chocolate never tasted before sorry about that listeners well yeah lovely little chocolate also used in what we call the ninety nine so from the ice cream guy ice cream man you'd get a cone with some ice cream on and it plot one of these straight in that's called a ninety nine topic still available and you know been around for years and years this is milk chocolate hazelnuts nuga and a caramel sort of toffee cents app really quite popular again let me just break one up so you can see that really popular as kids and had a great theme tune as well what a days and that in every bite topic Cadbury's fudge another one that's been around years years and years so I've aimed at the younger market is quite small and it's basically that it's just chocolate with some fudge in it no mucking about great theme shoe though I think we're fudge is just enough to give your kids a treat a finger of fudge is just enough until this time to eat its food look I'm very good and it's some very small and neat a finger of fur jeez just enough enough of that anyway let's move on the Yuki now I remember when this came out so this is not one those ones that's been around forever I remember when it come out was quite new was that oh wow it's basically just a milk chocolate it's just meant to be a bit chunky manly I feeling kind of advertised it as a kind of truck drivers kind of snack um that's the plain one that's a raisin and biscuit one well there were some other ones but I couldn't find any but there you go that's the Yorkie the double decker from Cadbury's like this one I really still actually like a double-decker every now and then take a look in there it's uh muga with some crunchy Seng on the bottom so double-decker kind of meaning like a double-decker bus I suppose soft at the top crunchy at the bottom that's the double-decker again from Nestle munchies they're coming up packing now never used to happen like that when I was younger only in this tube the stick they're basically a little bit of biscuit or cookie as you call it tiny little bit of caramel then covered over with some chocolate quite nice there was as I remember a very similar one to this it looked exactly the same in the packaging size and the chocolate was the same so they were called mint olace they were dark chocolate with a bit of mint in a little bit posh they were anyway there you go I couldn't find them there's munchies Smarties these are fantastic as a kid I just tried to buy a packet of these they used to come in a kind of nice hard cardboard tube with a plastic top and the plastic top used to have a letter of the alphabet underneath you never knew which one you were gonna get basically they repackage it now I've got a kind of thin cardboard hexagon type box multicolored little sweets chocolate inside with a kind of hard sweet candy shell very popular still I think they're the smartest okay the Tabriz whisper I don't really know a lot about these I think these are not that are they're not like classic classics I mean old but not classic it's an aerated milk chocolate bar so unlike a um an arrow which has got kind of large bubbles in it this is kind of quite tightly packed tastes alright not a big fan there's also a whisper gold it's the same sort of things got a bit of caramel in it there you go these two are made by galaxies they're minstrels in the big packet and the ripple the ripples are kind of layered fin layered kind of rolled chocolate galaxies minstrels are the collection chokolate in the center we have a kind of hard shot a candy shell a lot of people don't like galaxies well they haven't really liked it or don't like it that much I love galaxies they make a few different product products they've also got got their regular galaxy bar minstrels yeah they were a bit of a treat for me when I was a bit younger still love them can't be as crunchy real classic this one is so basically it's the kind of honeycomb covered in chocolate persona you can see that in there that will really get in your teeth it kind of melts as it goes in your mouth gets in your teeth gets stuck but really delicious no I'd one of those for years that's the crunchy for Nestle again the walnut whip they're a bit special knives of kids that are alive enough money to get a walnut whip so as you can see they're kind of similar the walnut on the top just a singular worn out I eat now and this kind of quite large and there's a kid that be quite much chocolate well we break it open it's got this really kind of soft gooey very sweet like a kind of marshmallow I suppose that sort of thing well there you go walnut with the mikvah cheese club really really classic biscuit this is so especially biscuit we have a kind of chocolate covering comes in a couple of different flavors mint the green one they obviously that's my favorite there's a fruit one as you can see there and also an orange one I couldn't get the orange one they are available just wasn't in the shop when I went there really really classic little kind of snacky biscuit for your pack lunch if you like a learner chuckling on your biscuit join our club if you're British you'll know that the wagon will these seems huge when I was a kid I mean they're quite small now I think it's because you have little hands when your tiny little tops there you go that's what it looks like it's a biscuit covered in chocolate with a kind of marshmallow Center they were quite a treat as I remember yeah I think they were but I do remember them they like they were really huge that's the wagon wheel Cadbury's Bournville classic dark chocolate still available no child ever ever bought this no kids bought this at all ever dark chocolate really for adults really still available of course but yeah no little kid would ever ever part with their money for one of those no chance the milky way I mean again this has been around I mean I'm getting quite old now so I mean they've been around forever as far as I'm concerned little bit of chocolate of a kind of just very soft light kind of new Garr in their choice okay they tasted great as a kid that's the Milky Way Cadbury's eclairs these are individually this is a packet here they're individually wrapped sweets there are caramel with a chocolate inside weren't a big favorite for me but I know a lot of people did like them and obviously they do because they keep making them there you go this the eclairs the Cadbury's Dairy Milk I mean this is their classic straight-ahead bar similar in a way to galaxy galaxy I've got their kind of chocolates and their kind of regular bar and peppers have got their dairy milk which is meant to be a glass and a half of milk or something like that they come in much bigger bars than that I mean that's quite a small little one they also can we have nuts and raisins and death at that there and that they've made loads of them but yeah that's the classic Dairy Milk this is the Nestle Crunch a chocolate bar milk chocolate we've kind of I think rice in it I kind of rice krispies kind of things you can see there let's break one open it yeah chopped up kind of poppy that wasn't massively popular as a kid but um as far as I remember she's pretty good though the Terry's chocolate orange a ball of chocolate that breaks into segments with a orange wrapper on it like an like an actual war inch delicious I really like it these were really popular for me as a kid at Christmas these are kind of a more of a Christmas kind of thing I mean they're available all year but Christmas did sort of show their face quite a lot that's the cherries chocolate orange tap it unwrapped it so there you go that's a little trip down memory lane of chocolates that we had as kids and are still available today of course I've missed out loads a vinay lion bar and Kit Kat and bounty and there's gonna be loads more let us know what ones you really love or miss and yeah that's it see you soon take it bye bye", "zoshAm3-szc": "good afternoon everyone as you know I have the best superintendent in the entire United States with me today Jacqui bird and we're here together once again to talk about the great response from the school board and what happened because 12-year olds did things that they shouldn't have done and here's what it amounts to yep this is marijuana it's gummies it comes in a block it's about a hundred milligram block and this hundred milligram block is supposed to be torn in two Tim individual doses of THC laced gummies now once again I'm not gonna elaborate on the fact that I warned all of this was coming these gummies are produced in California and they're sold online and Leviticus Jones who's 12 years old came into possession of this package of gummies which is about so big Leviticus has told us a couple of different stories about how he can't became involved with possessing this but be that as it may we're working with him his parents are totally cooperating and understand the gravity of the situation so Leviticus comes to school today claiming that he got these this gummy that he tore in two pieces from someone else on a school bus that's still to be determined during second period which is gym class he presented this to a total of six other children in seventh grade I'm told that there were two boys 12 years of age and four girls of the six of them that received a piece of this gummy five of them were transported to the hospital because of an overdose it's easy to figure out six kids a hundred milligram bar that should be into ten separate doses of legal use in California of THC is now distributed the ten dosage between six children we rush them to the hospital with EMS where that are being treated the last child was taken by her parents to the hospital Leviticus will be charged with one count of possession of THC our marijuana resin six counts of distribution of THC within a thousand foot of a school and possession of paraphernalia so it would be seven felony charges and a misdemeanor charge we're fortunate in that the children are all gonna make a great recovery you're going to be all right there's no long term injury or illness here as we understand but obviously we're concerned we're concerned as to one how did a 12 year old ever come to be in possession of this drug this illegal drug in the state of Florida and - why did he offer it to these six kids which quite frankly with the exception of one little corner have apparently devoured this bar they're in gym class so the investigation goes on at this time and we will report the results of that to you let me turn it over to our superintendent and she will give you details about what they did and I just want to brag on the school system their response was remarkable to this emergency whenever it manifested itself at about ten o'clock this morning superintendent Burton Thank You sheriff good afternoon everyone you know again I applaud the staff for what they did when they learned of something happening well students they responded immediately they went by classrooms to check on children they went by and they made sure that they got the children and make sure they make contact and contact it the EM has to come out and take those children to the hospital for you know to make sure they are safe and to make sure they're going to be okay they're all okay but you know the sad part of this is again we could have been here with a different outcome if someone did not respond so I applaud the staff for what they did they follow through with the procedures and the protocols that we have in place and making sure we keep our children safe what I want to say to our parents is that everyone at school today is still safe they'll be safe again tomorrow they're gonna be safe throughout because we do have procedures in place to keep children safe but parents I ask you please talk to your children please make sure we're looking at their online social media if they're buying and purchasing see what it is and then parents talk to your children say if someone is offering you something something that's going on at school that's not normal please let them talk to you and notify us immediately notify the sheriff's office immediately if there's something wrong we want to make sure that everyone is safe when they come to school each and every day so again I applaud not only just our school staff I applaud the Sheriff's Office for making sure that they follow through and making sure that they do what they need to do to protect our children the sheriff and I have a partnership and we have a commitment to keeping our campuses and our children safe at all times you know I can't I don't know the exact symptoms because when they heard about it they they actually went to got the children and they had them transported you know so I don't know the exact symptoms or what they're you know exhibiting at that time because they responded very quickly when they learned of it this is the first time that I'm aware of right now that they can consumed it yes it is legal in California for adults it is not legal it is not legal in the state of Florida in in any way so any possession of this is illegal in the state of Florida and as to their symptoms they had stomachaches they were nauseous dizzy one of them was all but passed out and took obviously way more than the recommended illegal dose by the way fine I'm surprised that I'm finding myself have to talk like that but the bottom line is it's all illegal in Florida and even in California it's illegal for a child habit but when you can go online you know Green Hornet's becomes something that'll sting you and it stung all those kids today I know that Leviticus has it I don't know that he bought it online he's told us at least two different stories of how he came to possess it and we are working through that now so excuse me his parents were totally cooperating with us but obviously they will be working with us on the investigation we're focused on Leviticus at this time we don't have any indication that his parents contributed to this if we determine that then obviously there would be other criminal charges but we don't see that at this time in the investigation his parents have been forthright totally cooperative they they are concerned not only that Leviticus did this but that he exposed these other children so they're concerned about the other children as well and according to Leviticus he didn't take any of this the other kids did but he said he didn't so it's uh it's frightening and fortunately for us it was not some other drug that was more dangerous in small doses than the was even though this was toxic to them in the amounts that they took the other kids have eaten the evidence so to speak so in the in the technical term you could draw blood and then there would be misdemeanor possession but no we're not going to charge the other children they will be dealt with appropriately by their parents and the school system under discipline conduct rules there Leviticus right now is the one we're focusing on but if someone else provided this to Leviticus we want to know because ultimately he's 12 years old so if a 20 year old gave it to Leviticus then our focus is the 20 year old but we've got to work through that during this investigation six six kids and Leviticus is seven okay one child went with her mother five went to the hospital we've not found the one child so we don't know whether or not that child consumed but we're told antidotal II that they did but we've not confirmed that yet Leviticus says he didn't take in at least five for sure maybe the sixth one who we've not talked to we know we know five consumed we suspect the six one consumed five went to the hospital by EMS one written with the parents for six and Leviticus says I provided it ask them if they wanted some and they all tore pieces of the bar off and consumed it and Leviticus is facing seven felony charges in a misdemeanor okay anything else", "y0lihM7g26w": "hi welcome to all city candy so today we are going to try a vegan candy bar we

gonna be viewing the BAM Camino by the very famous brand Kiva confection now you probably recognize the name Kiba because of their chocolate products that you see at most stores they're very well known for them they're very very delicious but today I'm gonna be talking about their gummies now this is the Bliss they do other flavors but I'm gonna be talking specifically about the Bliss which is their hybrid gummy let's talk a little bit about this awesome container it comes in a tin container which I really love it keeps the flavor really nice and fresh it is all summer themed and in the front they'll tell you how much milligrams which is a hundred for the entire one in every little gummy is five milligrams in the back it will also give you you know all the nutrition facts that you're counting your calories if you're trying to get high on a diet that will be there for you to open it it's just a quick little push down and turn voila and you'll find your gummies on the inside too it does give you a little bit more information on why they're called Caminos which I really love when an edible company kind of gives you that it kind of sets the scene it gets you in the mood for getting high every little gummy looks like this look at that little gummy how cute it is and it is five milligrams now the taste is delicious they're very tasty they're nice and sweet they're not crazy crazy good but they kind of remind you of movie theater candy like chewy sweet and something you just want to shove in your mouth all day for the high because these come with 20 of five milligrams your will needle II eat a lot of candy to really get super blown if you're willing to go down that road more power to you're willing to down twenty of these but I would say this edible is best use and best for people who are trying to micro dose specifically for the fact that every one of those little gummies is five milligrams if you're kind of a lightweight or you're doing something that you don't need to be high doesn't it take a little bit of the edge off even one or two of these or eating just one or even half of one if you're looking for a 2.5 is really great and it makes micro dosing so much easier with these guys yeah I can't say enough about how how nice these are for micro dosing and how great these are for also traveling if you're someone who gets nervous going on an airplane or something like that these are great because you won't get to blown where you'll get like super paranoid but you'll get high enough to take a little bit of that edge off which is really great if you're looking for something and that's gonna get you super high if you're looking at like go to a party and you don't drink it but you want to be stoned as hell these I'd I wouldn't it wouldn't be my first choice maybe if you have a slower tolerance or you're just getting into edibles this is for you especially if this is gonna be your first edible a try splitting one of these small gummies is so easy and they have like had like a fake little line between them that can kind of give you a little idea where to split it right in the middle these are awesome if you are working from home like a lot of us are these are great for that too because you won't get high you won't feel stupid you can get your job done but it also helps with a little bit of shaving off a little bit of that anxiety which is great yeah if you guys see these which see them a lot I've seen the prices range I've seen them from twenty dollars all the way up to thirty dollars so I guess it just depends on what dispenser you pick them up from these were pretty average for me nothing crazy that's before tap that's after tax and everything so if you guys see them out of dispensary if you got some extra dollars in your pocket I would say pick up the Camino by the Kiva you won't be disappointed you'll get high you might not get superstone but you'll get there so alright guys well that's my review for the day my name is Sarah P again thank you so much for watching in the haze and I'll catch you next time [Music]", "fBRetqM7hwk": "hi it's candy time yum-yum-yum today I'm doing a countdown of candy

chocolate let's see what the cookies and cream I love it does Oh gonna have the only thing I don't like about her she's a lot of people will be upset that it is but I know I grew up in France and the milk is different and the chocolate is also different so I have a apt isn't an active taste when you eat um I think all that Hershey there's a little an acid taste and I don't like that at this case no you don't you don't fill it in all the products to this I know there isn't that aftertaste you know but in this chocolate bar the milk chocolate there is the aftertaste of it so here it goes with the now how she's cookies and cream spread it into and show you the product and now let's taste the product mmm I really own yeah like this better than the milk chocolate the taste let's see how many

watching have a nice day bye bye", "4lLn0PhkakM": "[Music] [Music] hey guys mr. and mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you all later and see you in the next video like and subscribe [Music]", "rGBEUv0oXZs": "[Music] hello you guys I am so excited to have you here today thank you so much for joining I'm here today to show you guys my top 10 protein bars and because I'm gonna show you 10 I'm gonna fly through it really quick I'm gonna share all the details of points listed down below and I'm gonna share it from number 10 to number 1 so let's go ahead and just jump in and get started all right number 10 um is the quest bars I am this was 5 points a bar and I actually like a lot of the quest products but this in particular I feel like all of these style of bars have a very distinct flavor and texture and I'm just on pins so they're number 10 okay number 9 is a protein crisp bar from MusclePharm this is what the bar looks like and this was this was 5 points of art I felt like it was really hard to crunch into and the flavor was so so so I mean I I wouldn't have it I'm like oh my gosh I have to eat lick number eight optimum nutrition a protein wafer see the idea of this sounded very intriguing to me I love wafer cookies so much like they're just like a great treat for me so I was really excited to try it and the only reason this is number eight is it was not very soft and I feel like when you want to have like a wafer you want like a crunch but you still wanted to be soft and this was like I don't know if you can hear the crunch boom too crunchy just not the right texture for me and for a wafer um but protein wise if you really do that way for cookies I think the flavor is spot-on and yeah so I would say give them a shot for sure number seven and really the only reason this is number seven I actually really enjoyed it is detour bar they've got a smart a smart brand they're kind of smaller it's four points and I think I'm definitely I don't know why it's number seven it's just because some of the other ones I really liked a lot it's super soft four points and the flavor is delicious so I mean there's nothing bad to say about them I just had some other ones that I liked a lot more okay number five and number six were a really close tie number six came in with the one bars I really enjoy it um six points a bar it's got a great chocolate flavor um yeah so I would definitely say check them out and they have a ton of flavors I have not had very many of their flavors this cookies and cream one was really good and cookies and cream isn't even my favorite flavor so definitely check them out number five this came in at seven points of our it's a power Crunch barn oh man I have not had one of these in years I remember a long time ago I used to felt like a treat this literally feels like you're eating a candy bar like it doesn't taste protein II oh the texture is like spot-on like if you like um Nutter butters you gotta try this logo mm-hmm all right this next bar I have never had before so it's been really fun to try some new bars or bars I haven't had in a long time and this is from a brand called grenadine and this flavor was caramel explosion or something caramel chaos and it is super soft it's got a great chocolate flavor it's a good size bar and it's only five points of arms I think is an incredible deal go find them and try them I actually bought all these bars at GNC so I think that's a great place to check out bars at number three you guys I've had this before it's been a long time and I just like I forgot how good it is I love M&Ms and I love that they have M&Ms on here it's seven points that's got 14 grams of protein and you literally you just feel like you're eating a candy bar it's so soft so chewy it doesn't have a protein flavor at all I mean it's it's so good number two it's been a long time since I've had this and I was really excited to have it again because I knew I was gonna like it but I think I like it even more because it's been a long time and it's just was so good quest here oh these are seven points of our and you literally you feel like you're eating a candy bar it does not even taste like protein it's so good it's covered in chocolate and this says like caramel on the inside of this the texture and everything is just it's like heaven it's so good okay last bar to show you this came in for me personally as number one these are six points of our and I am not kidding you you feel like you're eating the most delicious candy bar ever and it's so pretty - lean bar I got this at GNC six points for the whole thing and you guys it's so good it's so good it's so good so that the peanut butter here oh my gosh mmm all right you guys that is from number 10 to number one of my protein bar showdown I just thought it'd be really fun to show you guys a variety of bars with the points listed I'll also list a few more details for each bar down below and I'll link them like I said I got pretty much all of these at GNC but I'm sure these could all be bought on Amazon or directly from the provider so

eating and if you guys have any questions feel free to ask I'm always here and be blessed with the rest of your day and I'll see you guys later [Music]", "TExL-4XhcuA": "Everybody has their favorite kind of candy.\nIt's the thing that brings them joy after a hard day, or even if they're having a good\nday and they just want a little extra bit of sweetness. However, sometimes the best\ncandies get taken away, and we still think about them. So here\u2019s our list of top 10\ndiscontinued candy that we want brought back. Wonder Ball Any kid who came of age in the early 2000s\nprobably remembers the commercials for these very strange chocolate balls filled with candy.\n\"Oh I wonder wonder\u2026 What's in a Wonder Ball?\" Well, the answer to that question is\nsome extra candy (because a chocolate shell was never really enough, was it?), as well\nas a \"prize\" for all the hard work of consuming excess amounts of sugar and artificial coloring.\nWhat was this prize, exactly? Usually, it was something only nominally entertaining\nto a child. It could be a sticker, or maybe a temporary tattoo of your favorite cartoon\ncharacter... Definitely nothing to write home about. Still, the prospect of getting any\nsort of non-candy item inside of candy was tempting enough to make these treats relatively\npopular with young people. After all, that's the reason why Kinder surprise eggs are still\na surefire hit any time of the year, unless you\u2019re in the United Staes where they\u2019re\nstill banned. Unfortunately, while Kinder had figured out the best way to keep its toy\nprizes safely contained inside of a plastic capsule (those toys, by the way, were far\nsuperior to the disappointing and ultimately unmemorable items hiding inside of a Wonder\nBall), Nestle couldn't quite pull it off. Wonder Balls were taken off of the market\nafter being deemed a choking hazard. Yet even despite the disappointing prizes and forgettable\ncandy treats waiting inside of the ball, we still get all nostalgic whenever we think\nof them. Triple Power Push Pop Sometimes it's too hard to decide on just\none flavor of candy. That seems like an odd thing to say, considering that a lot of candy\ntastes pretty much the same as anything else. After all, who can tell the difference between\nred and blue candy, right? Here's an interesting fact about the blue raspberry flavor, as a\nbonus: the reason that raspberry is often blue is so that it can stand out from the\nother \"red\" flavors like strawberry and cherry. Anyway, getting back on topic, back in the\nday kids wanted choices when it came to their candy. Not only that, but they wanted something\nthat could last a long time. After all, candy costs money, and when you're a kid, you're\nnot always flush with cash. Thus came the Triple Power Push Pop. Unlike a regular Push\nPop, this bad boy had three different compartments, each containing a different flavor.\u00a0It was\nalso the kind of candy that could be enjoyed over a few days, since it had a tight-fitting\nplastic lid. That meant that the TPPP was basically more bang for any kid's buck, as\nit could sit comfortably in their pocket or their backpack for days. Of course, there\nwas no danger of it going bad, since it was basically just pure sugar mixed with all kinds\nof artificial flavors and colors. Hershey's Swoops Pringles are most recognizable by their signature\nshape. As soon as anyone spies one of those swoopy, almost aerodynamic potato chips, they\ncan be assured that it definitely came out of a can and probably tastes only slightly\nless appealing than a regular potato chip. Still, maybe the shape of them is what makes\nup for the somewhat lacklustre flavor, and that is why they remain a popular snack choice.\nWell, that and the ease with which you can store them on a grocery shelf or in your kitchen.\nWhy are we talking about Pringles in a video about candy? Well, the answer will be obvious\nin a moment. We want to talk about another discontinued candy that left chocolate lovers\nwanting once it was pulled from the shelves. We're talking about Hershey's Swoops. The\nreason we brought up Pringles is that these chocolate \"chips\" (not chocolate chips, but\nchocolate shaped like potato chips) had a remarkably similar shape to Pringles. They\ncame in small plastic containers and were even stacked up like the aforementioned potato\nchips. However, we have to wonder just how satisfying these things actually were, since\nthey would probably go pretty quick if you were really enjoying them, and they definitely\ndon't have the same snackability factor as potato chips. It would still be a few years\nbefore chocolate-covered potato chips hit the market, so maybe these were just a precursor. Altoids Sour Any connoisseur of mints knows that Altoids\nare pretty much the champagne of breath fresheners. Then again, maybe they're more akin to something\nstronger. The 12-year-old scotch of breath fresheners, maybe. Either way, there\u2019s really\nnot any other kind of mint that holds a candle to the \"curiously strong\" Altoids, which come\nin their own little metal tin, a nostalgic bit of candy storage that still exists even\nto this day.\u00a0Sure, Altoids aren't for everyone, but there is no denying that they are the\nkind of mint that really leaves an impression. So, where do you go after making what is essentially\nthe strongest and most perfect mint on the market? Well, the next step, obviously, would\nbe to expand into fruit-flavored candy territory, and if you can't make that kind of candy minty,\nhow do you challenge your customers in a new way? The good people at Altoids figured that\nif you can't make a fruit candy minty, then why not venture into sour territory? Altoids\nsour gave Altoids fans a whole new flavor experience, asking them just how much sour\nflavor they could handle in one candy. Of course, Warheads, a candy that prides itself\non being far too sour for regular human consumption, has been on the market for many years, but\nAltoids Sour had slightly more class. However, they did not last, as people preferred the\ntraditional mints over sour candy. Jumbo Nerds One of the main appeals of Nerds candy is\nthe size. After all, it's more fun to just dump a whole bunch of them into your hand\nand toss them back then it is to eat one at a time. Nerds, of course, came in boxes with\ntwo flavors, one on each side. The more ambitious Nerds eaters would open both sides at once\nand simply dump the tiny, tangy candies into their mouth, getting a nice flavor combination\nthat was like something new in itself. However, Wonka has been experimenting with ways to\nmake Nerds different for years: they have made multi-colored flavors, strange combinations,\nand even a gummy rope covered in Nerds called, appropriately, Nerds Rope. One idea that never\nquite stuck, though, was Jumbo Nerds. These Nerds were far bigger than their tiny predecessors,\nand while it seemed like the obvious choice for candy advancement (bigger is better, right?)\nthe idea never really stuck. It could have been because people preferred the little Nerds,\nor it could have been that they tangy flavor and crunchy texture just didn't work as well\nwhen it was scaled up. We may never really know why candy lovers seemed to reject this\nidea, but the simple fact is that Jumbo Nerds were just not meant to last. Hershey's S'mores bar S'Mores are a treat that you never really\nget to eat in any situations outside of a campfire, are they? After all, no one is making\ns'mores in their kitchen (and if they are, then they are truly ambitious dessert lovers),\nand it's not like you can walk into a store and buy a pre-made s'more. That is, until\nHershey's came up with an idea for a candy bar that could replicate (or almost replicate,\nanyway) the flavor of that campfire treat. The Hershey's S'Mores bar wasn't a terrible\nidea, at least in theory. While the bars themselves were pretty tasty, it would have been a fool's\nerrand to perfectly match the flavor of an actual s'more. While the bars themselves combine\nthe chocolate, marshmallow, and graham cracker components of the traditional treat, one thing\nthat they could never replicate should have been obvious to the folks who created it:\nthe taste of a roasted marshmallow. Even the people over at Jelly Belly could never get\nit right, making the toasted marshmallow variety of their signature jelly bean one of the worst\nflavors in the mix. The texture of the marshmallow filling was also a little bit off. It was\nchewier than your average marshmallow, which might have made for textural improvement in\nthe bar, but just took the flavor farther from what it was trying to replicate. Reese\u2019s Bites What we want to focus on is Reese\u2019s Bites,\na variation on the famous peanut butter and chocolate combination that came about in the\nearly 2000s. Now, to be fair, there were other versions of Bites on the market, but let's\nface it: none of them could hold a candle to these little balls of flavor. Reese\u2019s\nBites were basically just what they sound like: a peanut butter cup molded into a ball\nform. What made these things so special was that unlike a peanut butter cup, you could\npop one in your mouth and let the chocolate melt away into the peanut butter center, creating\na truly delicious flavor experience. Plus, they came in big bags rather than a sleeve\nof three, so you always felt like you were getting more bang for your buck. Unfortunately,\nall of the Bites were eventually taken off of the shelves, and those who loved the Reese\u2019s\nBites seemed to be hit the hardest. Sure, the other bites were good in their own ways,\nbut they just couldn't hold a candle. And while you can buy a big of mini Reese\u2019s\ncups, it's just not the same at all. Butterfinger BB's Finally, we come to the last candy on the\nlist: Butterfinger BB's. These little bite-sized variants of the Butterfinger candy bar were\nbasically the precursor to the Reese\u2019s Bites mentioned in the previous entry. However,\nthose bites didn't have the Simpson family as their spokespeople, so there's something\nto be said about Butterfinger's advertising strategy. Still, there are people who miss\nthese crunchy, sweet, salty candies, simply because they were just too good to pass up.\nWe're not sure why Butterfinger decided that they didn't need to make these anymore, but\nwe really wish they would consider bringing them back. PB Max This one is a major throwback, so we wouldn't\nblame some of you if you don't remember. For those who got to have these amazing treats,\nthen this will come as a welcome reminder of just how special and delicious they were.\nBefore we start to talk about the candy itself, let's put them into context, because there\nis actually a big difference with these guys when compared to other candy and chocolate\nbars on the list. When you were a kid and you got to pick out what kind of dessert you\ngot in your lunch, it was something really special. You could stand in that cookie aisle\nfor days trying to make up your mind. Of course, you might have also got the chance to pick\nout a certain type of granola bar, since this was back in the day when something was healthy\njust because it was made of granola, never mind the fact that it was still jam-packed\nwith sugar.\u00a0If you were lucky, then your parents would let you put a box of PB Max\ninto the cart and would put one in your lunch every day. That's because unlike the other\nchocolate bars on this list, PB Max's were actually sold as snack bars and came in boxes\nof six, much like Little Debbie snack cakes or the aforementioned granola bars. These\nthings were basically just peanut butter and cookie coated in milk chocolate, so there\nwas no reason to think they were anything other than a chocolate bar. Rumor has it that\nthese snacks were discontinued because the owner of the company that made them just wasn't\nthat big of a fan of peanut butter. The rumour mill has been churning up for quite sometime\nabout the possibility of PB Max being re-released in the near future. We did some digging, talked\nto some people who would know, and it seems like these rumours are indeed true! The comeback\nof the PB Max actually is already underway! No you can't get it right this second, but\nour sources tell us there will be an announcement about all this soon enough, so stay tuned! Tart n Tinys To end things off on a more positive note,\nwe've got more good news about this one too! Right now we want to take a look at a candy\nthat falls more on the fruity end of the candy spectrum: Tart n Tinys. These little, colorful\nchunks of candy came from Wonka, and they were really pretty delicious. First, you had\nthe more straightforward sweetness of the shell on the outside of each piece, but inside\nwas a more sour and tart candy filling. They were the kind of thing that you could bite\ninto, or you could suck on one for a while and let the flavors melt into one another,\ncreating a totally different experience altogether. Maybe it was the too-cute name or just the\nfact that people had moved on to other types of candy, but Tart N Tinys were not to last.\nBut good news! Tart n Tinys are back, as is boldly proclaimed on the packaging for the\nre-release. As of 2019, they have been re-released and are widely available both online and at\nretailers. Bringing back old favourites is a trend we hope keeps going strong! Satisfy that craving with another BabbleTop\nvideo, just tap that screen.

today we wanted to talk about candy bars [Music] so when you think about a candy bar yes it's like the first thing that comes to your head there she's that's the first one yeah oh no okay i don't know well when i think about candy bars if i'm gonna buy a candy bar i'm probably gonna go get a snickers or something something with like some substance like a butterfinger yeah i do love a good butterfinger we wanted to talk about some different candy bars that you're probably very familiar with the ones that i'm about to show you and then we're going to talk about some that he's maybe never even heard of and maybe you've never heard of them i've heard of them because i own a candy store and like i just have to know about all this stuff but alex he's learning so let's start with one that i know he knows and i know everyone out there knows m m's not really a candy bar but a very popular chocolate candy been around for a long time everybody knows them they were made popular i think because of like world war ii where they were fighting in like warm conditions and they didn't want the chocolate to melt and so that's why it has the candy shell oh it melts in your mouth not in your hand yeah m m's who knew so another one kit kat kitkat has been around since like the 1930s it is globally produced by the nestle candy company but in america it's produced by a division of hershey weird right interesting kind of explains why all over the world you can find all these different kitkat bars but like in america we're just like kitkat here they are here they are this is what you get that's it it's a four little bar thing and how does they have like a jingle how does that go i'm not gonna sing it what give me a break give me come on break me off if you see that kitkat bar yes exactly exactly it's been around as long as you've been alive since 1980 something anyway kit kat made by hershey in america speaking of hershey hershey candy bars it's like the og of the candy bar world according to the package it says since 1894 but literally everything on the internet is like yeah no these were first sold in 1900 so close hershey giving yourself a few extra years like 1900 made popular by milton hershey who was basically the first chocolate bar pioneer in america he started all of it he started with the plain hershey candy bar which now has so many different varieties there's like hershey with almonds hershey's cookie and cream there was one with like almonds and blueberries and cranberries i've never seen that if you've seen that please let me know because it sounds delicious special dark there's just regular dark hershey has evolved so these three with the exception of m m's like not really a candy bar but a candy that everybody has probably heard of tried knows and now you know more about it than you did when we started this video i know a lot more exactly but kitkat and hershey two very popular ones you can find them at like any gas station any store they're everywhere now i want to just talk about like some that you've maybe never heard of oh gosh if i can get this box to open if you are a devoted saint gen candy youtube channel follower watcher then you have probably seen the video that we did on the abba zaba bar have you ever seen an abazado bar i'm not so i had never tried an abba zaba bar before and one day like a year ago for the sake of this youtube channel i thought i'll make a video and i will try an abba zaba bar now an abba zaba bar is chewy taffy okay i like taffy i like all kinds of salt water taffy with a peanut butter center yeah my thoughts exactly i love peanut butter always have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch every day of my life peanut butter by the spoonful i love it but taffy and peanut butter i thought that seems weird strange turns out it's delicious and if you want to see my full reaction to this go check out our youtube video on the abba zaba bar you'll learn more than you've ever wanted to know about the episode abba zaba bar and you'll get to see my full reaction we're not actually gonna try this one today because i've already had it okay so you'll have to just buy one of those on your own and try it or just take my word for it i mean you could get them anywhere but i got that one at sweet things that makes sense little inside joke for all of our instagram followers there anyway that now leads us to can you tell i was never a drum major the big hunk bar the big hunk bar has been around not quite as long as the hershey bar but the big hunk bar is currently produced by the annabelle candy company same candy company that makes the abazaba bar coincidence yes it was originally produced by the golden nugget candy company i've never heard of the golden nugget candy company because i don't think they exist the annabelle candy company bought out the rights to the big hunk bar back in like the 1950s from the golden nugget candy company so i think ever since then that candy company just kind of like disappeared why is it called the big hunk you know nothing on the internet told me why it was actually called the big hunk but we do get a lot of people that come into the candy store and they'll see it and they'll be like i should buy this for my husband and i was like sure you should all jokes aside the big hug candy bar kind of like the abazaba bar both chewy but very different this one is taffy with peanut butter this is a chewy nougat so like kind of taffy-esque with peanuts based on that do you think you're gonna like it yeah i like peanuts okay have you ever had like a payday mmm it's like heavy on peanuts it's very heavy on peanuts yeah well so this one you can't even feel the peanuts in it oh then yeah it should be fine right pretty mild why do i feel like i'm going today for surprise i have no idea why you feel that way but we are going to dive right into this because like i said i have never actually eaten one of these i keep meaning to try them all the time but i'm just like that was a lot of a candy bar i don't need to eat all of it and what if i don't like it then i've just opened a candy bar that now i don't like so i thought what better time to try a candy bar for the first time than with my old college roommate in a youtube video for everyone on the internet to see and now that you finally have a hunk present it makes sense jokes let's dive into it there's a few calories in here it's a cheat day maybe we're not gonna try it can't get it open great job on the packaging in the belkani company okay oh okay so have you ever had those little crunchy peanut butter bars they're like this big they're made by the atkinson candy company because of course i know that my grandma used to have them all the time so it's kind of like old lady candy but it's just crunchy sugary peanut flavored little candy bars peanut butter bars no okay well that's exactly what this smells my grandma always had heath bars oh wow your grandma had real strong teeth [Laughter] are we just going to like lady in the tree who's the lady oh that looks interesting so much nougat not taffy and peanuts it looks like someone put peanuts in glue paste yes it does it just it smells smells good and the fact that it's already bending to you very very bendy i'm gonna take half and you take the other half do we twist i don't know why is a sword that's what she said [Music] oh it tastes marshmallowy oh you don't like it oh no it does not taste like marshmallows really it tastes like marshmallow fluff to me not the same consistency but it tastes like marshmallow fluff it's interesting it is interesting the peanuts are very crunchy and it's still it's kind of weird that being surrounded in all of the nougat it doesn't soften them what is nougat exactly sugar it's just a lot of sugar egg whites maybe corn syrup yeah peanuts honey that's what gives it the like sweet i do like the honey and dried egg whites nougat is kind of like a meringue ish that was a lot i shouldn't have bit off that much still not a fan i think it's just like the taffy part maybe i'm not a fan of i mean it tastes good i think it's like i'm gonna keep eating this good chewing well see back in the day a lesson made up history candy wasn't as readily available as it is now so they made candy to where it would just last a lot longer they didn't i made that up it's not a real fact you can't google that and find it on the internet unless i put it on the internet you don't have to keep eating it well i feel kind of obligated too okay i definitely wouldn't recommend eating this if you have a loose tooth or fillings well unless you're a little kid so when you say baby teeth making a mess there's just peanuts going everywhere i also don't think that you should take it completely out of the wrapper because my hand is greasy now all right well i still have a lot of those left to finish alex miraculously finished his but he's gonna be chewing on that for a while so if you have any thoughts on the big hunk bar if you've ever tried one if you have any questions i don't know that i'm gonna have the answers but if you want to try one of these we do sell them in my store so you can come and buy one in person and then you can tell me what did you think about it because all around i think it's pretty good hunk the label speaks for itself stunk i'll go hunk a bird in love it could be like our outro until next time see ya it's still stuck in there yeah it's gonna be there for a while", "e3jGzfVwFzM": "welcome to Kenya and we have a

little bit of traveling today and buy travel I just mean about a mile away from my place here in beautiful Signal Hill California Long Beach right down there is looking a little hazy today so not quite the view what I was hoping but really I was here because I have a new camera that I want to play with so if the sound sounds terrible that's because it's just using the camera's native microphone and I suck and if the image is terrible it's because the sun's right there and I haven't looked at a few finder so we're just gonna do this one rock wild guys let me disturb hello guys and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I am sorry if I sound a little shitty I'm testing out a new camera that does not have an external mic so it's just the little microphone inside the camera today my apologies also I'm sorry if that sign sucks I don't have a viewfinder right now but what I do have for you guys is a really elaborate package one that I'm sure I'm gonna have trouble opening it is district edibles cannabis infused gummies indica raspberry hundred milligrams and as you can see this is some pretty crazy packaging and I was like these two little hooks here got a slide open I don't know we'll try to figure it out um I have had some luck with gummies recently like plus plus is great so my opinions on gummies are starting to change especially as like the shitty players leave the market like ed appears or infused creations I know they're still out there but they're not as present as they once were so now it seems there are a lot of legitimate gummy makers so I'm looking forward to this and guys I did do a little fad right before I took this bit or went on this video here so that way you are sure that I'm getting a hundred percent of this THC coming in so let's see if I can get this open here let's see it has some directions lift cap while pressing side tabs well it looks like one of the side tabs might be broken so well this is a bad scheme for for our guys at district edibles if they require such fancy packaging but their packaging is broken how are you supposed to get into the good stuff oh boy yes so this one is broken so you cannot get into it which means I'm probably gonna have to get some scissors for a crowbar because this is pretty solid plastic pretty shitty job there district edibles on your packaging I mean come on beer we all just want the weed yeah I've almost gotten it I'm just gonna break the damn thing tada we did it guys as a family as a team and here are our goodies that we are rewarded for all of our hard effort on the inside these 10 gummies right here in the back they say we are things like orbiter and gravity check and booster who knows weird little gummies they're kind of plush shaped and green as you can see and they've got just this little standard of lumen on packaging on the back of the top and guys like all of our edibles don't worry we'll be doing all 10 of these maybe not all 10 on cameras and won't bore you to death but I'm gonna let you know how they taste and then I'm gonna come back to you guys two hours after I finish the last one to let you know how they're actually because that's what we're so here we go taste test number one for the blue raspberry district animals and their shitty now broken ass packaging okay in terms of edible taste definitely has a cannabis taste still has that blue rat sour e blue raspberry taste not the worst edible I've ever had not the worst gummy I've ever had either but there is a strong cannabis taste to it which has me a little optimistic that it's going to be pretty poached but if you really hate cannabis tastes definitely want to give these ones a skip because they they have it for sure so here's a close-up shot of their little + or diamond dirt whatever you wanna call this cross shape do what second same as the first yep fairly strong cannabis taste but it goes away pretty quickly it's not that over overpowering style of cannabis taste either these are easy to get down they just pop right up just do them up and that guy is gonna do it for this first half I have seven more of these to get through which I will do in the next 15 minutes or so and then I will come back to you guys once we're all said and done in two hours but you know how we're actually feeling so thanks for watching wheat guys and I'll see you in just a bit deuces hey jerks welcome back two weeks it's been Oh two and a half actually I think closer are three hours since I last checked in with you and I am still talking district edibles blue raspberry indica and guys original intuition is correct in this new legal world of edibles in California gummies are pretty good now you can sort of safely by gummies that are securely vetted and lab tested all that good stuff I think a lot of the bad actors are gone um just because I don't think you can go buy a big bag of gummy worms at Costco anymore slather a couple of milligrams of oil on it and call it a product anymore that just doesn't work in this world for both good and bad so the district 9 or the district to start district 9 the district edibles is actually pretty good the taste wasn't too bad there was a decent cannabis taste to had not the cannabis haze was decent is just flatly pronounced but I am actually rather high I got up to I would say I almost even hit an eight for a second maybe that's because I was playing some Red Dead - and everything just felt a little bit more euphoric in that moment anyways but regardless I can tell you these are pretty potent I picked these up for 20 bucks in the dispensary in Long Beach which is about the going price of any easily and between this and plus it's pretty much a draw for me they're both now legal edible brands basically the same format each I think plus has five milligrams these have ten so these are about as strong as like the cushy punch hundred milligrams or the plus hundred milligrams so I don't have any problem recommending them I just think they're packaging sucks it's unfortunate that this one happened to be broken but you know it shouldn't break so that's one downside but other than that actually really really liked the district edibles I keep forgetting that name I keep forgetting that name so guys that is gonna do it for this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on a next review this is", "x3J_BzXr6oA": "[Music] welcome back to all cities candies on rap video series where we try before you buy so today I'm here with

live here with Kristen Aiken Kristen what are we taste testing today today we have 16 different kinds of English candy bars because we are always hearing that they're better than American bars so we wanted to taste them for ourselves can you walk me through them yes all right we've got the double-decker the Turkish Delight of course fries chocolate cream the aerobar Cadbury Dairy Milk the crunchy the twirl twisted the lion bar whisper dark chocolate Kit Kat a flake bar galaxy caramel the Yorkie boost duo which supposedly has an energy boost and in the Cadbury Bournville it tastes like a Hershey bar not bad little roller sweet so the Rice Krispies is it caramel is it nutty it tastes like it is after shaving it it's really freaking me out did you get back to you oh oh my god it won't leave my mouth trying to be good I'll eat them all later in private the middle has the texture of like clay or something I thought this was going to be an easy taste test would I have a major sugar headache right now after all of our hard work who were the winners hopefully we weren't misguided by too much sugar but the big winner was the double-decker it was really marshmallowy and delicious but also crispy is the perfect combination of everything you want overwhelming loser by a landslide what was it it was the Turkish Delight and I think you should tell everyone how you described it grandma covered in chocolate it was so perfumey it tasted like old old perfume with like a chocolate hat on I hated it did you hit it I hated it too I hate eating flowers laughs okay I am good for chocolate for quite some time", "eHmvtSJery8": "welcome to candyland wonderful look at this a lot of candy we gonna taste each one of them and count it down see who's gonna be a winner see this is lion and friends i grew up in this they call it lyon oui this is a delicious product telling you guys i don't know if you uh probably don't know about this but i'll tell you what this is a really good product but i wanted to show you this and i've been wanting to make a video about lyon so this leon here really like no comments you know it's crispy this is a new recipe actually but it's still like about the same now same type of product i grew up on yeah it's crispy and chocolatey mixture of a lot of things cocoa um cereals yeah and rocks i had some caramel in it too and that's late this is an interesting one turkish delight i wonder what this product is made um where's where it comes from always made you know what country oh well probably won't um find out let's uh google it but i was interested you know because this has a turkish name in it like turkish i was wondering if it's from i want i don't know but let's taste it hmm yeah oh it's fruity see them this is a the fruit inside and um wrap with chocolate right well it's all right first grade that has a great taste but um that's not like something that i'll do every day but it's not bad and let's taste another one hmm which one actually go for kitkat you know those these are the hazelnut and this is a kind of something you know i wasn't familiar with i never really tasted before because i'm just like a regular kit kat person the ones that are very popular this is a chocolate chocolate this one is a hazelnut so let's taste this it's bigger than the other ones mmm pretty good yeah it's soft i really had the heat that he's gonna hazelnut taste in it wow i really like it yeah pretty good by kitkat and the white kid cat this is a chunky white let's taste this white chocolate look at this bar nice okay yep i'm gonna give it a minute um hey think about the three yeah white chocolate takes over the taste i can't even taste the middle that's the inside of it because the white chocolate is so strong and heavy in a taste yeah so this is like definitely like a white chocolate like product you know and i like this better and then this is another different kind nestle arrow i don't know if you pronounce it like that but ariel and this is a chocolate chocolate oh is it let me see um bubbly chocolate yeah it's all chocolate maybe you know you never know it may be a coffee because it looks like it can be something you know it can be anything all right let's see these are you know pretty good looking and look at this soft oh strong chocolate taste i really no i don't like that chocolate is like this it has an aftertaste i don't know if i can describe it cocoa plant you see it's probably like some yeah some like uh chocolate powder like you know milk chocolate but it's not like the best enough so it's not the winner of the game let's see i have nestle here milk chocolate chocolate leche let's open it if you're from france this is the commercial you hear on tv it's good in chocolate nestle is good in chocolate say bone chocolate hmm the chocolate is really good yeah no lies really good and crunchy interesting let's taste this oh wow oh that's different well it really gets like the crunchy you know filling sensation very sweet oh my goodness i'm on a sugar high right now that is a dairy milk caramel oh man these products are gonna make me go sugar extreme sugar sugar sugar high eating a lot of chocolate tonight yeah i'm getting all for you guys look at this dairy milk it has some caramel i hope it is soft because i like the fluffy ones yeah it's very soft it's like a milky way sort of you know yeah that's what it tastes like milky way picnic picnic oh thing is uh broken side so i shouldn't i shouldn't get my money back for this call the 1 800 number on the bars that's what the a lot of customers do you know you look up the number on the boss you can either get your money back complain tell them something you know and then they send you free coupons free coupons some some people pronounce it like that coupons and some people also say boom everybody got their own ways of saying things mmm not good i mean good yeah mmm this has a whole bunch of stuff wow raisins peanuts crispy cereals caramel yeah very healthy i don't know if i would say healthy but pretty good another dairy fruit nut oh came apart hmm this is a harder one they have the little pieces of um fruits and nuts inside like this um it's hard not the best you know heart is always more damaging to teeth so what about 12 the intense chocolate hit oh this comes in like twix yeah the imitated twix look um it's soft um and it's very intensive just like they say intense chocolate all right um last product an original yorkie from nestle packaging is harder and this is a different look this is also all chocolate you know like a regular chocolate bar no um no caramel no crunchiness just straight chocolate and it's milk chocolate so the winner i believe is probably mmm kitty cat yeah kit kat man kit kitkat um hazelnut is my favorite out of all of these that i tasted tonight thank you for watching guys please subscribe to the channel for more candy previews like the video and have a good night

folks make sense of your dispensary uh accidentally jumped the gun forgot to record this once so i already opened this package that was just a moment ago haven't eaten anything welcome to weeds guys with a review show here on welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary classic ass episode today which means yes a good old-fashioned edible and one of the most old-fashioned kinds of weed edibles the gummy that's right we're taking a look at wanna one of the makers of the cannabis infused sour gummies these ones your standard 100 milligram edible 10 different uh pieces at 10 each however these ones are also a cbd blend uh at a ratio that they actually have listed incorrectly there of 10 to one even though it should be one to ten the way they have it listed in that it is 10 milligrams of thc per piece one milligram of cbd per piece 100 milligrams of thc total 10 milligrams of cbd total in this package in these strawberry gummies i picked this up and i accidentally already opened it was recording didn't realize my bad haven't tried any i picked these up for 18 bucks at a dispensary here in long beach california which is a slight premium i would say over there traditional gummy edibles which probably average about 15 so a definite premium there not a whole lot but something to notice and again it doesn't have that nominal amount of cbd in it which i'm curious if it's going to have an effect on me that's not a lot of cbd i'm guessing it probably won't but we'll be on the lookout for it um and on here as well as all the good stuff you want to see they've got lab testing results although this is nearly a year old at this point which is a little disconcerting but whatever uh nutrition information all that good stuff so let's go ahead and take a look at the most important stuff the gummies themselves these 18 gummies and here you go looks just like that 10 of these squares in there oh smells very strawberry not very weedy at all mostly just strawberry well let's go ahead and give it a bite give it a test see what it's like gummy weedy strawberry a lot of wheat flavor actually more wheat flavor than i was expecting not grotesque but for the gummy candies higher than average but otherwise a totally fine gummy candy nice soft chewy okay well i would say in terms of taste a slightly weedier taste than your like plus or your steezy gummies but not revolting in any shape or form but it's there uh but of course guys it's not the taste that we're in this for trying to figure out if they're gonna work or not are they gonna make you hide and for that well that's what we're gonna have to wait around and see um so uh any time i do gummies i like to try to do them under the optimal conditions i don't think i said this i did have a little bit of fat beforehand just to make sure it's going to hit me just right not necessarily for you or for everybody i do it just in case so i had a little bit of fat before just for the optimal thc absorption um but it's still going to take a while to hit the old bloodstream so i'm going to finish these gummies off of the next i don't know hour so do all 10 as we do here on wheats we review the whole product i'm going to review them over the next or as i said eat them over the next hour and then two hours after i have that last one or thereabouts i'll come back to you guys and give you our wrap-up thoughts the most important part of the edible review is it gonna get us high and for that guys you're just gonna have to stick around and i'll be back in just a bit to let you know our wrap-up thoughts about these wanna sour strawberry gummies well here's one for the blooper reels guys i'm back two hours two and a half hours later with these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and as you can see with my eyes they are pure as the driven snow uh and i came here with a really bad review i was gonna come and really trash them as i was like these are pretty um non-existent non-existent in terms of the high that i feel from these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and i was gonna say something along the effects of well maybe it's the 10 to 1 ratio and maybe that little 10 percent of that welcome back to wheats guys it has been two and a half hours since my first uh bite at the wanna cannabis infused sour gummies and if i look very very sober you're correct um i this guys is gonna be one for the blooper reel uh i came here to excoriate the uh folks at wanna i'm saying that these gummies basically did nothing to me all ten of them felt practically nothing and i was originally going to think well maybe it has something to do with that um strange 1 to 10 ratio of cbd to thc and maybe just that 10 cbd was enough to totally blunt the thc and but not provide any of those cbd benefits that was just i've said i was gonna feel like i felt just kind of peaceful but that's about it not really high at all uh and that's because that is actually the case uh i had it wrong not them well actually the bud bud tender had it wrong uh i ordered the one to ten and they gave me the ten to one uh so this really is 10 cbd milligrams to 1 thc so this is 100 milligrams of ca cbd 10 milligrams of thc the exact opposite of what i thought it was um at least i know that i know when i'm high or not and i was definitely not high in any traditional sense with these but that's on me not on them this one's for the blooper reel we'll have to review wanna again in the future this was just a fun little [ __ ] up um and an 18 mistake so uh wanna i am sorry i uh did not mean to disparage i don't know anything about you just yet i do know that my bud tender [ __ ] up the order uh oh well uh [ __ ] happens but we will check you out again in the future apologize for that it's been fun it's been funny anyways that's gonna do it that's gonna do it for this non-existent review here on wheats no cherry on top just a big shame on me thank you so much for watching guys stay high and more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you guys right back here for our next review live stream or even [ __ ] up see you then

a good day i hammered out a bunch of work it's still the a.m. but I got something up next and it's an edible bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang so we're looking at bang chocolates powered by Endeavour indivi just because uninterested let's see let's pull them up on the old Weber site here of course we have the begin age gate day 20 month April and year whatever makes me old enough 1933 enter ok here we go in Devon in diba who knows we don't really care it's just a company it's just a brand sometimes we care I'm not sure about this they're doing pre-rolls they're doing cannabis salt interestingly like Emma the salt it's an interesting one here we got dark chocolates gummies White Russian Bud cannabis sugar okay so I got a variety of edibles let's check out their packaging cuz that's part of it nowadays it's interesting they have for this this is milk chocolate this is dark chocolate the packaging is different sizes that means they just had a whole bunch of packaging lying around they're trying to make it work right they're making it work they're doing it alright so here we go ten milligrams in each bag total THC per unit is one piece one piece of chocolate in here I can see that feel that this one's milk chocolate also one piece let's see their package date this is their package date March 10th 2020 it doesn't even say package date I don't know what that date actually now I'm confused this is the package date it doesn't say package date and then this is the expiry date the date that's in the future that's what makes sense there to me alright package date on this guy is April 6th April 6 so very relatively close I got both milk chocolate dark chocolate to see what the [ __ ] is going on in here do you like chocolate I love chocolate I like milk chocolate sometimes I like dark chocolate ingredients we've got the sugar bittersweet chocolate whole milk powder just a bunch of chocolate stuff I'm not [ __ ] reading that but I do like the expiry date the cookie I had from Aurora I never had an expiry date very weird to eat have food without an expiry date it's open these up alright let's start with milk sugar dark chocolate because I like it less so boom we're tearing that open like that you see and we're also going to there's a childproof sort of seal on here and this is how you open these is a little flap here you want to grab that then you want to open this flap up in here you just pull that side and the shoe opens right up that's how if you're a child don't watch that that's the key to open a hotel group and here we have chocolate it can be broken up into four sections that's what that one looks like let's just bring out the milk chocolate as well so we have it both out here much smaller package on this one even how they have directions on the back of it - how to open children can understand pictures - just let me point that out there and then we have the milk okay bang-bang all right let me get in here we're gonna try this one first let's snap that one snap that one dark chocolate mmm very dark now what I'm looking for is the percentage of cacao usually when you deal with dark chocolate or chocolates - milk cow is there like percentages of cacao so that you [ __ ] know what you're in for once you're so high in in [ __ ] cacao darkness it can be really bitter this is too bitter for me it's cotton it's a really dry chocolate it tastes like nothing but chocolate she's bitter but if you like that go that way let's try the milk chocolate it's not like your just your standard regular old chocolate not like your Easter Bunny milk chocolate there's that's a little better there's a little pop I'm actually quite happy with that good job so ten milligrams per four pieces that's 20 milligrams total between the two bags of chocolate I'm just gonna eat the rest I'm a mix of chocolate and the brook toggle together Laura price right 4:49 great price actually that is some of the that's me a second so four dollars and fifty cents to get 10 milligrams of THC in some pretty good chocolate bang bang on bang on good for you you're making it work so you got some extract and you managed to put it in a chocolate and put it out to the consumers at a good price this is just a regular ol edible and if you're looking to dip your toes you can get as small to 2.5 milligram dose even 1.125 found $1 whatever 1.25 dose - if you want to break those little cubes in half if you wanted to bite that now you've got a one point two five milligram dose great for beginners cool for beginners this is a 2.5 milligram dose when it's broken down but for four dollars and fifty cents yeah if you're just a beginner in a lightweight yeah let's go these are fighting just get more ever give up that's a win I got these that spirit leap bang-bang tasty little chocolates spirit leaf West Kelowna shout out go grout that's cheap especially if 10 miligrams works for you five bucks boom grab - 10

specifically Rob hots sour flavors I believe this is a relative new relatively new flavor for them I'm not a million percent sure even close to sure if it's on the REC side if it's not now I would imagine it will be soon so diving in the flavors we got inside here blue raspberry grape and green apple I don't know I had to look at it I actually know the flavors of jelly me anyway that's pretty much my favorite flavors enjoy ranchers and other candies so that was a super big plus for me I'm not really a huge tower fan so I'm really hoping they're not especially a sour yeah I was gonna enter a picture probably already did or I am now so we're gonna dive into what one thing to keep in mind is the brain all right we go is that the milligrams posted on the bottle or on the container are not necessarily the exact amount that are in your specific bottle your specific bottle will have a separate location where it is located exactly how many milligrams are in there I will insert a picture of it but it's I just keep smearing it you cannot see it at all anymore but I know that this bottle says 500 milligrams and it has 467 point 6 4 milligrams in it meaning each piece is not 50 milligrams but 46.7 6 milligrams per gummy it will always tell you the specific amount of THC that is in and milligrams that is in your container but it's not always exactly what's on the bottle sometimes it's more though I had another bottle of greens but I ate before I could review sometimes it's more the greens were 500 and something milligrams so each milligram or 5/10 I think or anyway doesn't matter because it was 51 milligrams per gummy i remember that specifically so sometimes you're getting more sometimes getting less if you're really a budget conscious person and you want to really maximize your bang for buck check out the different flavors and see what milligram is the highest of the actual bottle that you'll be purchasing we're gonna move on to the scent also it doesn't say whether it's a hybrid or indica or sativa so that means it's a hybrid most edibles are pretty much hybrids anyway I'm to get a edible specific video posted so keep an eye out for that because I'm gonna give like tips tricks all kinds of different information about edibles specifically that you can apply across pretty much all edibles sauer sorry I'm getting a little bit of the grape but I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys these two are the two that I'm gonna be eating and one of them is great the reason these are the two that I'm gonna be eating is because I licked the [ __ ] out of them getting the sub nail photo and specifically the purple one is the one that I started with so it got the most saliva on it so I'm not sure if that has affected the scent that I'm picking up the most in here I'm like rotating something like the blue raspberries up on top I still kind of get great more than anything else behind this hour cuz this hour is the first thing that I smelled so that's a little bit concerning for me but when I was licking them I didn't taste a lot of sour however in the photo you can see there's a lot of like more there's a lot of rocky material that's only on one side from what I can tell because the green one too it didn't have any on the bottom I'm thinking that's the sour so I would imagine that you could dust that off and they wouldn't be sour but tact tactically they are I'm gonna grab one that I haven't wet because that they're more sticky Wow they're mean Wow I'm having before but they are they're very soft and compression they're definitely gummies cuz they're a little bit sticky but let's see yeah they're a little bit sticky my fingers are a little sticky after that but I could be because I was also handling the ones that I licked so we're gonna let see my fingers do not feel sticky at all or the like least amount like to smile if anything so now we're gonna squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze it is sticky yeah it's sticky and that's one that was not licked but it's not super bad cuz now after I've done it a few times it's pretty much not sticky anymore so a little sticky but you'll be able to like dust it off and no big deal as long as you don't like continuously looking and grab it and grab it and grab it that makes it sticky alright let's ride let's ride so I'm gonna be doing actually 150 because I'm gonna try all three well I was Jenni myself so harshly I'm like oh you're not getting quick enough that I couldn't actually think about adding up the numbers so it actually may be more like 135 levi's I am going to put the sour directly on my tongue with this one and then the other way on this one and whichever way I like the most I'm gonna do for the blue raspberry because that's my favorite and the apple looks like it's not got a lot of stuff on it so [Music] okay I push the gummy off to the side to just deal with the sour but it's really not bad like you can see my face with like a little bit but when it's really sour it's my faces all kinds of you know I am definitely getting a great flavor I would say that there is a mild earthy flavor to it I mean hash has a very very attached distillate has a very mild cannabis flavor to it but I'm picking that up so it's not but I I mean any edible honestly any edible is gonna have the slightest flavoring whether it be hashey or earthy which this is a little bit both I'm getting it's interesting you know I'm getting the earthiness of the you know cannabis component but which is in distillate but I'm also at the end getting a little bit of the tang or the dryness maybe that's it of the hash flavor if you have smoked hash or gotten it on it and like licked it and stuff you kind of know what I mean you the smell like honest if you know what the smell is you kind of know what the taste is so they're green apple oh and as far as I continue to talk the flavor I'm left with is a very mild grape kind of a again there's it's not really necessarily earthy at this point it's an off great like it's great but just like a little okay solid metal that straight-up tastes like Ukraine Apple the end part I got a little bit of sour and as I was coming out of it it tasted like a sour green apple so that was really nice not quite as much earthy flavor in that one I just think maybe the green apple complements or goes with the cannabis ever slightly so more than the grape so more I'm not really tasting the green apple anymore it was strong when I was eating it but it doesn't really have a leftover flavor and blue raspberry [Music] whoo Smiley's an idol I ate a boy okay that was delicious it honestly reminds me of a blue Slurpee but I I honestly don't think I've ever tried a Slurpee ever but it's what I imagine a blue raspberry a Slurpee tastes like blue raspberry otter pop that's the closest that I can relate it to cuz it's not quite blue raspberry Jolly Rancher but it's blue rounder blue blue raspberry otter pop so it's a little duller than a Jolly Rancher but still nicely blue raspberry we're popsicle I swallowed unexpectedly during that so some sour got in my throat so it's not the best feeling and I did just eat on three so I'm imagining the flavors gonna be a little ol kooky but I kind of maybe I just want it I feel like I have a remanence of blue raspberry in my mouth but I might just be wanting it so much that its existing you know for the placebo effect so flavors oh dude I didn't get any hash from that no earthy no hash maybe because I like that flavor so much or it goes better with it I don't know but it tasted delicious so that you know as far as overall experience I appreciate that the sour is not super sour I almost think there's gonna be people who are disappointed but it's not super super sour but I thought it was a nice mild level of sour what yeah I still get the grape more than anything in that particular whip waft I wonder if it's because I was also thinking it was gonna be so much more sour that I smelled this no I smell sour but it's not as strong it has before that's so funny anyway I love Rob hot gummies I've had them pretty consistently there's definitely other companies that make really good gummies but Rob hots from what I've experienced so far seems to be the best thing for the [ __ ] and having good quality like great quality gummies however I did want to mention gelatin and glucose syrup is in here I don't know how that relates to either vegetarianism or veganism all right so the milligrams are definitely affecting me at this point I'd say I'm Spacey relaxed [Music] I'm frontier I was more minute early and now I'm more relaxed and I think when I get to doing the video editing it'll be easier to focus than trying to pull thoughts out of this brain it's more just do versus think which is wonderful my hands are so dry my knuckles oh my gosh I need to get more lotion I have to go okay I just needed a quick thing yeah yes I would recommend rabbits gummies I would say pretty much overall at this point different flavors you you're gonna like and not like so that's gonna be a personal thing but overall I think that Rob Potts does a good job with their gummies and the sours were delicious and not super sour and I really like that I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your day", "DzlN7MHiyEI": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you stop by and for all you awesome awesome subscribers welcome back thank you so much for helping me get to over that 50 000 mark i love you love you love you thank you so much so let's keep it going next stop a hundred thousand all right so for today what i am going to bring you is how to properly infuse chocolate yes that's correct so it is very warm in my kitchen right now at nights like 85 degrees so it is melting fairly quickly but this is properly tempered chocolate if it wasn't it would be a total mess i actually wouldn't be able to hold it about 83 degrees in my kitchen right now so as i said i'm going to show you how to properly do this i've seen a ton of recipes i've seen a bunch of people also doing their edibles where they're using coconut oil or butter now they may be using candy melts and if they use just a little bit they may get away with it however if they're adding any kind of amount of oil or butter to even candy melts it's not going to stay solid at room temperature really the only way is to infuse coconut sorry to infuse cocoa butter and then we add our cocoa butter to chocolate and then we temper that chocolate so i'm going to show you how to do all those steps and explain a whole bunch about cocoa butter temperatures and exactly what tempering chocolate means yeah a whole bunch of science and stuff that you probably don't really care about but you couldn't hear it anyway yay so um ingredients wise i'm going to kind of jump right into there there's not a whole lot ingredients all right so what we're going to need here is about half a cup of melted cocoa butter and you want pure cocoa butter so i picked up these um organic pure cocoa butter wafers so just nicer to work with because they're in these wafer forms otherwise it comes in block form not the easiest to work with so a half a cup is four ounces i use about five and a half ounces for a little blossom for a little bit of loss or whatever so i end up with a half a cup which is about four ounces there and you're going to want about two cups of chocolate or the amount of chocolate that you're going to need of what you're working with and you want to use a really good grade chocolate the better grade chocolate that you use um the better your product is going to taste and the better quality it's going to be as well you can also just take your favorite chocolate bar so it's dairy milk or jersey milk or i don't know any kind of type of bar you like lint you can use any of those um to infuse as well as long as you temper it you you can always take a tempered chocolate bar melt it and re-temper it and put it right back to where it was so i'm gonna show you um three ways to actually temper chocolate yay but let's get to the first step of actually infusing our cocoa butter so a couple of things with cocoa butter and why it's really difficult is cocoa butter burns at a very low point it will burn over 120 degrees fahrenheit um so trying to do it on the stove top nearly impossible even if you do it on a double boiler because water boils at 212. that is too hot if you put it on super super low and on a like a minimum and a mine simmer and really monitor the temperature you may be able you've got to keep it at about 100 degrees fahrenheit so it's really difficult to try and do on the stovetop can't do it in the magical butter of the magical butter machine because its lowest temperature is 135 degrees fahrenheit too hot it will be completely burned i know because i did it they liked me on one of those websites the main guy who does it i can't remember his name so the levo is perfect for this because you can set your temperature to exactly what you need it to be so this way i'm going to set it to 100 degrees that's what's really nice about the levo or a machine that you can customize your temperature settings because all oils are not created equal for example cocoa butter like i said will burn over 120 degrees fahrenheit whereas olive oil it's like got like a 200 and something i shouldn't probably look that up it's got a way higher burn point so for infusing you would do that in around 180 mark um butter if it is not clarified will burn at about 250 uh 350 if it's uh clarified so even though they're all oils and fats or lipids they all have different smoke points and that's why when you're looking at getting a machine you really want one that you can customize your heating that's the main part you want to be able to customize your heating so onward and forward enough babbling about that for now trust me again not more science worrying about chocolate a little bit all right so infusing our cocoa butter very simple so i do apologize i have to keep my talk about certain things wink wink um very limited so you kind of have to read between lines on this i do apologize youtube is getting very very very sticky so i have to be very careful about what it is that i say and do so i have got about seven genes of my flower in my pod here i am going to set my cycle to activate and i've got it set to 240 30 minutes pop her in and let her go press start so it'll go to warming up then once it's warmed up it'll say activate and it'll give you the time and it'll count down the time the other nice thing is you can always pause and restart your uh infusion without affecting your time or anything so that's a nice feature of that as well so enough about that while that's activated we'll be back in 30 minutes so see here right now it's an activating mode or it's it's heated up so we've got um 30 minutes of 240 and it counts down and when it's done it says activation complete or something like that okay so our activation is complete now and we remove the pod to let it cool down you can leave it in the machine it's going to take a lot longer to completely cool down so i take it out you can even leave it on the counter for about 40 minutes i pop it into the freezer for about 10 minutes all right so my flower is nice and cool the pod goes back in our little uh rubber magnetic goes into the middle and we're gonna pop in our cocoa butter so this is the thermometer this is what regulates the temperature so once the oil or the butter itself reaches that temperature of what we sent it to it shuts off the machine itself is not necessarily going to be at 100 degrees it's once our oh once our cocoa butter hits 100 degrees the machine the heat will shut off and it will maintain it maintain the cocoa butter at that temperature whereas when you do it on the stove top what happens is is the temperature just stays because it goes by the element and your cocoa butter will just continue to increase in heat until it finally burns tada so that's it for that you put the lid down we now choose our uh our infuse cycle i'm going to lower the temp to 95 actually 100 i'll do it to 100 for two hours hit go because our butter was already warmed up there it didn't have to take time to warm up that's why i melted heat it up first so it's going to be infusing for two hours we'll come back and check that out when that's done but in the meanwhile sorry i will go over the equipment that we're going to need for the chocolate and give you a little bit of science into chocolate tempering and why it needs to be done and what actually happens behind the magical seams of chocolate so the equipment would need far more equipment than we do and do ingredients for our chocolate we only need two for the chocolate for the equipment we need a little lack of it so we're going to need a double boiler if you're going to do the double boiler method or you can melt your chocolate in the microwave if you do melt in the microwave do it in plastic in plastic containers that are microwave safe reason is plastic doesn't heat up so if you do it in glass or ceramic bowls they can heat up and create hot spots and actually burn your chocolate it gets much hotter than what you're doing plastic it doesn't heat up just make sure that it is microwave safe when microwaving start at 30 second intervals do two thirties again depending on the amount of chocolate that you're doing so for the two cups if i were to do that in the microwave i would do two rounds of 30. each time stirring it really really well in between um time intervals so i do 2 30 then i go to 20 seconds 15 seconds and then continue at 10 second intervals until it is completely melted so that's the microwave method way i do find the double boiler is a lot easier because you don't have to keep opening the door and stirring it and this and that just gets done here so totally though your preference so double boiler you can using a proper double boiler or any bowl metal bowl or glass heat safe glass bowl your water you want to make sure that it is low enough that it is not touching the bottom of your bowl again it is it will make your chocolate too hot and it will cause it to burn you'll want a straight edge spatula your chocolate molds so you can get silicone chocolate molds i don't particularly recommend them they are inexpensive but they're difficult to work with they're flimsy they're difficult to smack them down just a little hard to work with as well as they don't give you us a nice shine as the plastic or the best ones are actually the polycarbonate molds they are a little bit more expensive but they do give you a beautiful professional finished chocolate and they're sturdy they're nice and sturdy good for smacking out all the air bubbles we're going to need some parchment paper just for working and catching stuff you can use wax paper candy thermometer or thermometer or you can use a chocolate tempering one now this one other than telling you the um temperatures on the side here it's a pretty useless bachelor because one you have to have your chocolate submerged so far but we're working with chocolate and if anybody knows it's not very see-through so it gets mucked up your um spatula here makes it very difficult to read so really other than these uh spatula part of the edge and just having the convenience of the temperatures right there it's pretty useless but i got it anyway you're going to need a whisk a sharp knife for chopping up your chocolate now if you do if you're going to do the tabling method you're going to need two straight edge blades but that's just one particular method and you want a pair of rubber or latex gloves working with your finished chocolate so you don't get fingerprints all over it so i'm pretty sure that's pretty much all the equipment again you know me i always forget something so we're gonna finish up our infusion and then we're gonna get our chocolate made all right so our infusion is complete uh remember that thing i forgot to tell you you want either a fine mesh strainer or one of those bags those really fine mesh bags that magical butter or brewer has they're really good or cheesecloth they work really handy as well so the pod does keep out most of it but really fine sediment does get through so while that's all there is to it we push our button to to get down to our cocoa butter oh look at that and then you can just use this box not much is left in but you can just use a spatula just to scoop the rest of that down that's what's so nice about this so clean don't get your hands all gross and icky and you get pretty much all of your uh butter back which is a bonus and there we go that's it we now have our infused cocoa butter so we're going to let that cool down to room temperature it's not going to solidify i just want that temperature to come down so that we're working with the same temperature and chocolate and cocoa butter and i just wanted to show you comparison to just regular cocoa butter so there we go check those out isn't that sweet i can't wait to get onto the chocolate portion yay not really i don't like tempering any better all right so on to our little science portion of our chocolate before we actually make it so to explain to you in very simplistic turns i'm gonna make this i'm gonna dummy it right down why tempering is important what actually happens so this chocolate bar i just melted with some cocoa butter and set it didn't do any temperature and you can see as soon as i pick it up and hold it it begins to melt in my hands right away and it's just mushy and yuck so that is that's chocolate that is not tempered which is why you can't just melt a chocolate bar and put your stuff in and then put it back into a mold that's what's going to happen when you when it's tempered as you can see i can hold the chocolate and it's not melting in my hands it's not melting my fingers the chocolate breaks apart cleanly so what makes that happen why what is the difference between this and this when we melt chocolate well i'm gonna give you that right now okay so when we temper chocolate some really cool magic happens um when we're melting and the temperatures that we go between so the reasons why we need to bring it up to a certain temperature bring it down to a certain temperature and then bring it back up that's called our v shape and what happens in that process is there are six crystals that are created when we melt our cocoa butter or we melt chocolate sorry with cocoa butter so as you're melting it these crystals start to form in your chocolate and what happens so we've got all our different colors we've got pink yellow green and all these are what uh crystals one through six let's say the only crystal that we care about is crystal number five which is our beta crystal and those are going to be our green crystals or what i'm going to use as our demo for beta crystals those are the crystals that give your chocolate stability so it gives it its shine and what happens is it creates a chain and and to give your chocolate that stability during during the heating process so as we heat our temperature up all these crystals are made and they're all over the place and as you can see that's pretty unstable that's why our chocolate is really soft and blue because those crystals are just like that when you just melt and go when we bring up when we are tempering chocolate and we melt it to our optimal temperature and there's different temperatures for milk chocolate and dark chocolate i'll go over those a little bit later when we're doing it so these crystals are starting to form so there's a few different methods for creating our beta crystals one is just by adding already tempered chocolate melting that in i'll get into those separate processes so what's happening is we're introducing beta crystals so they said they're going to be our green ones as our temperature comes down the beta crystals start to form together they start to join up make friends while our other crystals are starting to melt away as our temperature is coming down and again if we keep keep working and agitating these beta crystals continue to build a nice solid chain which gives our chocolate our stability like so as we bring the temperature we get down to our optimal temperature then we need to bring it back up what that does is helps to remove and dissolve the remaining crystals remaining five crystals that we don't need essentially leaving us mainly our beta crystals in a nice form solid chain like so and that is very simplified version of what tempering chocolate does like i said people go to school for this and like there is i could get into some serious detail but seriously most of you don't want to hear that so let's get on to the uh tempering techniques and let's actually get some chocolate made okay i'm working forward to the good stuff the real chocolate so i've got here uh two cups of chocolate uh real milk chocolate the way to know the difference if you have real chocolate or compound chocolate or a melting chocolate just take a look at the ingredients if it has real cocoa butter it's real chocolate if it has palm oil or any other type of lipids then it is a compound or a melting chocolate or a candy melt so that's the easy difference real it has cocoa butter real chocolate needs to be tempered as i said you can take your favorite chocolate bar so we put our little candy melts into our bowl turn my heat on to medium low to low keep it on the lower end and i'm going to add in a tablespoon of cocoa butter get the cocoa butter all over your chips again this is going to help with even melting and even heating oh it helps if i actually plug this in that might help good yeah because i'm using the little um wafer chocolates i'm i didn't bother to chop it up i probably should have you should still chop it up oh you should still chomp oh my god even though i'm using i'm using this a nice thin little wafer so they do melt really nice and easily i still probably should have chopped it up into smaller pieces just to help it melt quicker but no big deal but if you're using the block chocolate you want to either grate it or make sure to chop it really really really fine so another very important thing when working or working or tempering chocolate is your uh is your atmosphere you want a very cool and dry atmosphere so around 70 72 is optimal it's really really good if you're getting up into the high 70s low 80s it makes it extremely extremely difficult virtually impossible to temper chocolate because you can't quite get it down to the low enough temperature so so for example it's 82 degrees in your home we want to bring our temperature on our chocolate down from 100 degrees down to 82. well if it's not cooler around us we're never going to get that temperature down so then you can either try doing things like doing it in front of an open refrigerator or over a fan which is actually what i'm going to do because it's kind of a little too warm in my place to call to probably get this correctly tempered but my little trick of what i'm going to have to do is uh do my stirring over my band which i tested yesterday and it worked so yay so as your chocolate is beginning to melt you want to make sure to just continually stir it to bring the warm from the bottom to the top and you're just getting all the chocolate coated again so they evenly melt and you don't want the chocolate to uh get too hot in one spot to burn that burn very easily i'm going to drop that down below now like my heat because i can feel it's getting pretty warm so because i'm doing milk chocolate i want to melt this to between 104 degrees fahrenheit and 113 fahrenheit i'm going for the 104 the lower end so that's for milk or white chocolate if i were doing dark chocolate you would go between 113 and 120 our chocolate is beginning to melt so as this melts as this melting is happening our little scatter our little crystals here are starting to form like so all scattered all over the place our chocolate here is pretty much melted so i'm going to check his temperature now so we're at 104 tickety-boo we're good to go part one to return our heat off so our first method of tempering is you take a large piece of tempered chocolate milk chocolate same type of chocolate and you're just going to dump that in and you're just going to continue to roll this over move chocolate over and start melting this bar into our chocolate we're going to continue to do this until our temperature comes down to as i said to eight between 86 and 88 for our milk chocolate so what this does in this method is we're already taking a tempered barn that has those beta crystals and we're melting those beta crystals and giving our chocolate a jump start by bringing it down to the temperature those beta crystals are going to chain up and um and do our chocolate temper our chocolate honest is probably one of the easier methods of doing it right now i'm at 97 it's going to take a little while so i'm going to do them pulling my fan over here and i'm just going to sit the bowl on the fan this is going to help me get this to temperature otherwise it's probably not going to happen so i'm just going to continue to flip the chocolate bar over making sure to get all the chocolate covered over and keep moving it around and you'll see it'll start to get shinier once you um start tempering chocolate getting used to it you'll actually be able to eyeball it once it's done it gets very you get to know its texture and its look there's no streakiness and it's shiny about at 92 little ways to go a little bit further so we need to bring this between 86 and 88. now normally your chocolate bar would be bigger to make sure that it lasted the whole time i probably could end up melting this whole chocolate bar in but that's okay so if you did have a large piece your chocolate left when you got to temperature you would just remove that piece and as you're as your chocolate is starting to come down in your temperature have a look and see if you see streaking if you see any kind of streaking it's not tempered correctly oh i think my chocolate chocolate is looking good i'm not seeing any noticeable type of streaking or separation color and it looks shiny so because i have some larger chunks of chocolate in there i'm gonna actually run that through a mesh before i put it in as i put it into my mold this is where we want our parchment paper so i'm using this just to catch any of the large chocolate bits that might might come through [Music] take our straight spatula and take your spatula and just move your chocolate that's nice and nice and flat and filled and then you want to take her and clean off the front edge then you want to take her and smack down get out the air bubbles all right so there is our method number one now number two is pretty much the same so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna add in some fresh chocolate into here we'll get that remounted to our 104. so method number two is the v this is one of the um the b method is probably the one of the most used for beginners so this is where we bring the temperature we bring it up to the 104-113 i said for milk chocolate i keep it around 104. we're going to bring it down to between 82 and 85 and then we are going to bring it back up to between 86 and 88 so that's our little b motion our little b so if i was starting from scratch i would be adding in a tablespoon of my can of cocoa butter but because i've already got that in there and i'm just re-melting chocolate and that's why i haven't added it to it the awesome thing about chocolate is that you can melt and re-temper it over and over and over as long as you don't burn your chocolate or seize your chocolate you're good to go just remember water is chocolate mortal enemy so you want to make sure all your equipment that you work with with chocolate is completely dry absolutely no water it's one reason why i don't use wooden spoons or anything with wooden handles because they have a tendency to hold on to moisture and you can be stirring away and your chocolate starts seizing on you and you don't know why because the moisture very little moisture is seeping in from the wooden handle so i tend to avoid wood okay we're definitely attempt so now for this method what we need to do is we are going to add you're going to get some additional of your chocolate that you've got so you were chopping up chocolate if you got your two cups you would split it out two-thirds and one-third you put two-thirds into melting you'd keep one-third on the side and what we're going to do is just add a little handful at a time and continue to stir and you want to stir very fairly vigorously this helps the beta crystals and we're going to continue to do this until we bring our temperature down to like i said to 82 and then those little as those melt in add in some more and i'm probably gonna have to move over to my fan to get this down to temp the temperature that i need i'm gonna add in some more my other ones are melted well that's gonna take a while so i'm just gonna get the last of my chocolate added in here my last one third and continue stirring vigorously sweet all right so we're there so i've got this down to 85 so now we take our pot there should be enough heat just from the hot water there place your chocolate back on and we're going to stir this and bring this back up to between 87 and 89. and what's happening in this process is this temperature is coming up now those remaining crystals that we don't want are melting off melting away and as your chocolate starts to come up into temp you're going to start to see it get shinier so as i said once you start to temper a few times you get to know what it looks like so you um becomes a lot easier so not quite enough heat from my pot here so i'm just going to throw it on the low here on my stove almost there's a couple more degrees and you can see the chocolate is shiny you don't see any streaking layer in the mold spatula then make sure to give her a good smack out for all the air bubbles now our last method our third method here is called tabling so we don't add um additional chocolate and we don't have to worry about temperature it creates the beta crystals by agitation so this is when we are going to use um our two straight edge blades and in order to do tabling you have to have a marble uh stove to work on or a natural stone top otherwise she no work right so pretend i'm starting with new chocolate again i would add in a tablespoon of my cocoa butter and melt that all together so again i'm just going to melt this until we get to 104 that's the only temperature we want to worry about is our what we're melting our chocolate to which is above 104 between 100 and 413 i'm going to stir my chocolate until it gets up to 104 degrees fahrenheit we've reached our temperature of 104 degrees fahrenheit remove your chocolate from the heat now make sure your working table is completely clean and we're going to dump our chocolate out onto our table now you're going to get your straight edge blades and you're going to start working your chocolate back and forth all over through between the two blades and what we're doing is we're creating agitation which is what's going to create our beta crystals doing the tabling method and you want to smear it out nice and flat this will help with the cooling and the temping and you're going to continue to work the chocolate like this until we get to 8 between 86 and 88 degrees fahrenheit for the tabling method you want to have experience with tempering so by eyeball you know it's when it's in temper so you only have to do a temperature check once [Music] [Applause] [Music] my chocolate's looking good so i'm just going to check the temperature and we're good we're at 87.5 perfect and next we're just going to get our chocolate back into the bowl so just use your two straight edges scoop up your chocolate back in the bowl so now i'm just going to be pouring my third method into the mold so we just layer down fill up the mold move her around to fill it to flatten her out and use your spatula to clean off the excess off the top clean off the sides of your mold and then give her a real good smackdown and shake back and forth to get out all the excess air bubbles and last thing we just need to let them set if your place is cool enough you can let them sit on the uh counter probably take about half hour 40 minutes however if not pop them into the refrigerator for about 20 minutes that should be good to set them up all right so our chocolate is all set up time to come out of the molds flip them over and they need a little bit more coaxing there we go looks like we've got three tempered bars look at those don't they look pretty so our test give her a give a hold it doesn't instantly melt in your hands you can touch it doesn't instantly melt good chance they're tempered even though it's cold and just came out of the fridge if they weren't they would instantly be melting okay let me clean this off so you can actually see properly so i can pick up the chocolate and i can touch it and it's not instantly melting into my hands it is going to melt somewhat a little bit because it is very warm but you would know the difference like it will melt melt and the other thing is when you go to break it it actually breaks if that wasn't tempered again even cold coming out of the fridge it wouldn't break it would more just bend trust me you know very quickly if it isn't tempered but as i said if it doesn't temper not a big deal chop her up put her in the pot give the method another try and then for packaging up your chocolate for storing or for um for packaging or whatever again in the summertime don't even attempt to ship chocolate it won't happen so what i like to use are these thin tin foil sheets they're already pre-cut put your chopped tip oils the best thing to use for um for wrapping up your chocolate so it just goes on there you want to kind of pull it tight and again you can wrap it up however you want i am not the best rapper even for christmas presents so i was so glad they came out with bags there you go there's your chocolate bar and then to make inexpensive wrappers you can just make our printouts on uh on your printer on regular 8x10 paper cut them out to fit and just give them a wrap up that's everything for you so i hope you enjoyed that video today on how to make cannon infused chocolate if you have any questions or comments at all please don't hesitate to put them down below i do love to hear from you thanks again for joining me today and you have an awesome and blessed rest of your day you", "G70-Bp6kHGU": "is it just pure pain now that's what you hate to hear goodness gravy I've got a story for you guys today listen in the pursuit of life sometimes we run into bumps along the road the bumps vary in size and severity sometimes it's a little tiny pebble in the road and sometimes it's a giant [ __ ] boulder like for instance if you were hiking and you got hit by a giant [ __ ] boulder we're doing our best alright and sometimes things don't work out the way we would we would prefer today is one of those little interesting conundrums that we run into every now and then in our lives and it happened to me I ran into a bit of an issue so sit back relax and let's talk about how I once accidentally drugged myself with the largest edible I've ever eaten last February for all the coronavirus garbage happened I traveled to Los Angeles for spring break and one of the things that I had to do was I had to sign a [ __ ] ton of posters for u2's there was probably more than three thousand posters that I had to sign and the posters were being kept at the house at The Misfits YouTube group were staying at in LA Carson was there Schlacht was there Cooper's there we were all just trying to like sign all of these posters as fast as we could because there's so many of them and it was take us it was taking us literally hours to do at this point there was maybe about five or six people in the house at this time and that's because at that point the whole main misfits crew had gone out to dinner somewhere I don't know if you know this about the misfits in general but they smoked a lot of weed every trip they do they probably spent a couple thousand dollars on weed okay they smoked the mary-jane they do the weed in order to make the process of signing these posters go a little bit smoother I had smoked like half a joint of weed so I was already decently high because I hadn't smoked in a while either sign in a way crossing my eyes Dodd might ease however my personal reaction to weed is that I get the munchies I get the munchies pretty hard I smoked a little bit of the mare Lona and then I say oh I'm gonna eat an entire sleeve of club crackers with no cheese because gluttony I originally planned to go to dinner with my girlfriend and her father so I was trying to wean off of the hi and just kind of sign the posters and wait until it kind of wore off and then I would go and do that one of the things that they had at this house was they had a giant counter in which a bunch of snacks were all laid out there was chips there was more chips there was I think pizza I don't [ __ ] remember as I look across this horizon of bountiful snacks I see a nerds rope and my monkey brain is like oh and I'm thinking to myself man I remember nerds rope I haven't had nerds rope and [ __ ] forever dude I'm thinking back to my childhood where we would go to a campground in Maine and I would wattle on down to the snack shack and grab myself a nerds rub and before eating it considering its potential applications as nunchucks or trying to tie a knot with it but then realizing I'm a kid I don't know how to tie knots and my prefrontal lobe won't even be done cooking for another 20 years so what's even the point give me a slush puppy give me a Game Boy SP let's [ __ ] it up but lord have mercy did I learn in this moment I no longer was a child but a man a man who experiences consequence in the worst way possible so I'm signing more posters you know I'm cruisin I'm having a great time all right nerds rope tastes a bit strange but that could also be my perception that I have of being already high and it's kind of you've ever been high before it kind of messes with your perception of taste a little bit it was like drinking a diet coke versus a normal coke where there's like you know there's something there there's something there but I don't fully process why it tastes different so I finished the Nerds rope and then I go to have another nerds rope because I'm high and have the munchies as I'm biting into the next nerds rope one of the misfits guys says Ted don't eat those those are edibles hmm sorry I said I'm back I must uh I must have heard you wrong um scusi yeah Ted that's inedible so I say no [ __ ] way how much was it he says I think I think it might be like 60 milligrams what 60 milligrams to give you context the largest edible I'd had up until this point in my life was 20 milligrams so of course I asked are you sure one of the guys walks over to the counter and picks up the package of the Nerds rope and with the most you are [ __ ] face I've ever seen in a person he says it's actually 400 milligrams now remember I've already freaked out when I heard that it was a 50 milligram edible and I've just been told that it is actually eight times that amount so you may be asking yourself Ted how the [ __ ] did you not know that that was inedible and that's a good question let's start with the packaging that's the packaging it uses the same packaging as the actual branded Nerds rope it's got a thing that says Terran share as if it's just a normal candy in hindsight that's very much so implying for a good reason that you really should be sharing it and not eating it entirely on your own if you're not really paying attention and it's been like eight years since you had a nerds rope this is pretty easy to mistake for a nerds rope in addition to that there was a very specific and deceptive way that everything was laid out as snacks in the misfits house and I'll just let swagger CIL's explain that for me there was a very reasonable way like we set it up because the Nerds rope was inedible it's a 400 milligram edible and he didn't read the packaging but we have on that bench it's a big-ass bench it's snacks and food chips Pringles gummy bears all that [ __ ] munchies and then there's weed food which is edibles in between that and the weed which makes sense like a spectrum dangerous that's the thing is that it would make more sense to kind of put the weed food away so that you don't confuse confuse you've ever been in a car crash even if it's not your fault there's a certain feeling after it immediately happens it's this mind racing feeling when you have absolutely no idea what to do but you also know that something has to be done or you're [ __ ] aka panic so at this point I begin to freak for three reasons first of all I didn't know if I was personally prepared mentally to get as high as I was about to get second of all I had made plans for dinner with my girlfriend and her father that night and I definitely won't be making it and I'm pretty sure she's gonna be a little bit pissed and the third reason I hadn't smoked weed in two months which meant that my tolerance was rock-bottom I like to explain this with what I like to call the skyscraper analogy right here we have the tolerant skyscraper which represents my tolerance to marijuana let's just say that whenever I smoke weed I started the ground floor in the lobby if my taunts were higher then maybe I'd go a couple stories up to the mid-level apartments that's where all the stoner kids from high school hang out and they're all pretty high up there but it's nothing really to be worried about you're probably couch locked but you'll be fine with my tolerance at zero though I knew in my heart and my soul that I was going all the way up to cheech and Chong's [ __ ] penthouse as an unwilling and unexpected guest for an undetermined amount of time as things stand right now I don't even live in the building I'm from out of town and I sometimes commute into the city oh it's a Friday night oh we should go we should go get drinks in the city that's the that's what I'm operating on I know that I'm on a timer most edibles take about 45 minutes to an hour before they kick in but I know that I've taken this edible about 10 to 15 minutes prior which means math I've got about 45 minutes before this edible hits me and I died although other things can affect this such as being on an empty stomach which I was my first thought was that I need to make myself throw up because if I can get rid of as much of this edible as possible I could potentially mitigate the level of inebriation that I was about to experience so I stumble over to the bathroom and I start to gag and I'm trying to make myself throw up but I've never made myself throw up before I don't know how to do it so the next step is that I got Carson on his phone looking up how to's on wikiHow on how to make myself throw up and then Cooper's in the kitchen and he's making cups of saltwater for me to chug because apparently if you chug saltwater it helps with the throwing up process I'm not sure how true that was it just ended up with me just throwing up a bunch of pinkish salt water so I can't speak for its effectiveness but there you go and I'm pretty sure since the Nerds rope was sort of a candy sugar based food it was really easy for my stomach to digest it really fast so I'm pretty sure if I hadn't thrown it up within maybe five minutes there really wasn't that much that I could do from there so by the time I was done throwing up some food that we had ordered earlier arrived and Cooper basically advised me that the best thing that I could really do for myself would be to just fill my now completely empty stomach from this point on all I could really do was buckle up strap in and get ready for the [ __ ] high of a lifetime god bless my soul [Music] so I'm gonna give you guys a walkthrough of what this high was like it wasn't fun I also have some video footage that Cooper took so link to his channel in the in the description once I kind of came to terms with the fact that I was gonna have to ride out this high no matter what I decided to give myself a home base just somewhere where I could ground myself and not really need to worry about moving around or anything I found myself a nice armchair and I sat myself down there and prepared for the ride of a lifetime the first thing that happening was a classic weed symptom which is cottonmouth which is when your mouth gets really really dry so I was pretty much just constantly drinking water I remember starting to get colder and The Misfits they had a room where they just had a bunch of extra merch laid out where they could just give that to friends and stuff while they were in LA and I kind of just walked in there and just threw on one of the sweatshirts and then just went back to my home base and sat down and I was wondering for myself if that cold symptom that I was experiencing was real I did research on the symptoms that I was experiencing and this was something that actually happens informally it's referred to as weed chills the THC literally lowered my internal body temperature so I actually was getting cold another thing that happened and I think this also might have been a symptom of being cold but I started getting shaky and it's really funny the way that I described that when I was high and I actually have video footage of that right here welcome back it's gotten worse friends we are it's been about 45 minutes since last and bad okay I think you need another stick of butter I feel like my entire body feels like rubber bands pretty much after that point was when things started to get um they started to get bad the shaking was also the reason why in the video you can see me clasping my hands together because I was literally like shaking so much that I had to hold my hands together really tightly and keep my body really tight and close so I could be in like a comfortable state and then I get into what is called the painful zone or the first level of weed hell pretty much any position that I was sitting in felt painful don't do too much weed I was in the pain hotel and I was its only guest any surface that I touched whether it be the arms of my chair putting my hands on my knees anything like that just felt bad and what I think I would attribute that to is just being so high my sense of touch was just so elevated that my brain was just overloaded or something most of the time I was just trying to like breathe deeply and kind of maintain my composure but whenever Cooper would turn the camera on me and he would start recording I would sort of like try to elevate my attitude and try to seem as cheery as possible because I didn't really want to seem like an idiot hi stoner on camera you know at a certain point I had to move my home base because it was too disorienting to be sitting straight up I had to go and get [ __ ] horizontal baby I pretty much had to make a mental agreement with myself just to survive is it just pure pain now that's what you hate to hear it was during this time of unbearable dizziness that my good friend Schleck decided to use a [ __ ] handheld massager on me I'm just getting the lactic acid fun I just want to get the juices I just want to get the juices flowing if you please organism do you see my attitude there I wonder why I wouldn't like that a rapidly moving massager if you want a lesson on what not to do to someone when they're high that really takes the cake eventually the fateful moment happens I had a weed barf I honestly think it was really just because of how dizzy I was getting from being high and luckily for me I had a whole sandwich about an hour ago I literally had to run across the entire room and just run into the bathroom and throw up after I threw up though that's pretty much where the high took the downturn now it was cleansing I had it was a cleansing barf yeah it was uh it was detoxifying I went to go eat some skittles but without even knowing I was on camera I went around to people and not trusting my own ability to determine this I asked them if the skittles were edibles or not I ate the Edible at about 6:30 p.m. that day and I stayed awake all the way until about 4:00 a.m. that night I woke up at about 9:00 a.m. and I was still very high but I was definitely a manageable amount of hi what struck me though was I was high for the entire next day I went to bed that night hi so in total after eating a 400 milligram edible I was high for about you know 26 hours if there's one thing you guys shouldn't take away from this is like any anti weed sentiment from this video I think weed is a perfectly healthy drug to use recreationally but we'd like everything else follows the rule that too much of anything is definitely a bad thing obviously only consume weed in a state in which it's legal and if you're of age I hope you guys enjoyed this video let me know if you want more stories from my life I don't really know how many stories I have to tell this is like the second one I've ever told on this channel but I hope you learned a thing or two and if there's one thing you should take away from

the sweet tooth Today I'm going to talk about Clark Bar The Clark Bar was created by the D. L. Clark company, owned by David L. Clark hence the name Clark Bar The only year I could find that it was created was possibly 1917, not to sure on that though The Clark Bar is one of those candy bars since it's been around for so long that its been passed around through many companies It is now currently owned by\nthe NECCO company they've had it since 1999 It just wasn't feeling the love I found an old commercial that I'll link in the description, actually I'll show you a little bit of it Kangaroo: \"I want a Clark Bar\" Announcer:  \"A Clark Bar\" Yeah that was a bit creepy I'm glad they don't make creepy commercials like that any more Puppy Monkey Baby Okay, never mind. I wish they wouldn't make creepy commercials like that anymore The Clark Bar is a flaky, crumbly peanut butter center, with a crunch Like it says on the wrapper and a milk chocolate coating Now there's three candy bars that are similar with chocolate on the outside and a peanut butter crunch on the inside The Butterfinger, the 5th Avenue bar, which I've already done, right here is the link to that video and the Clark Bar. The order of my favorite candy bars go Butterfinger, 5th Avenue bar, and then the Clark Bar. Why is that? Well it's kind of like you just have your preference of peanut butter flavors like there's Jif and Skippy. Two different peanut butter companies. Is it Jif? I don't know. I'm trying to remember. Jef? Jif? I like Skippy peanut butter, so that's the one I buy It's just preference But it is a crumbly center and milk chocolate on the outside It's good if you like a crunchy peanut butter center and chocolate. It's just for me its preference Sorry Clark Bar Sorry Jif and Skippy are two main peanut butter companies here in the United States I don't know if they're outside of the United States Sorry I got to remember that people outside of the country watch these videos. My bad! Thank you for watching this week's\nvideo of TheCandyGuy Links for the Penny Candy Store and myself will all be in the description of this video I post videos every Friday, so I shall see you all next Friday Have a sweet day. Bye!", "iwa-9ZrseQM": "okay so this is the wonder bar by canna banana and it says on the back highest quality psilocybin chocolate bar on the market and eliminates the upset stomach feeling that users would get from digestion of the mushrooms the product has been known to significantly reduce anxiety stress depression increase focus and stimulate brain cell growth yes we like that and it says start slow and in a safe environment do not operate any motor vehicles while using this product please do not and this does have four grams per bar is what it supposedly says on the back um so it does come with 12 pieces so three pieces would equate to one gram that is what i started off with i would say that that's probably a little bit off because i have taken a gram of mushrooms before and yeah i would say it's probably a little bit off now definitely no upset stomach feeling whatsoever every time i have taken mushrooms i would have to purge after taking them which not nobody likes that um so that's a big benefit my stomach didn't hurt but it does make your stomach like a little bubbly and you have to go to the bathroom and a little gassy just so you know i'm gonna keep it real with you on that but other than that it was amazing um it does the three pieces in my opinion does give you like a nice therapeutic high like it says a really calming and high end of all of your senses feeling really good in general if you want to get into that creative flow state i ended up taking one more piece so a total of four pieces and for me that was perfect just to get into that little trippy zone and able to get into that deep flowing connection for meditation and journeying so i would recommend if you do want to trip hard at least start with six pieces if you are experienced with you know psychedelics or mushrooms in general um for me the four pieces was great i was chilling i felt such powerful healing and loving warm energy coming in and i actually did this on halloween so i had an incredible experience i really anchored in my timeline and i brought in a lot of healing onto the earth and onto all beings and i just felt so wrapped up in love and peace and harmony and so much balance coming in but um the fact that i did it on halloween and the veil is already so thin and plus we had that intense full blue moon i felt like the energies were just amplified so i really didn't need to take any more than that um and i think some people might generally think that taking this on halloween might be like oh you might have a bad trip or you know something like that or something weird might happen but i want to empower you right now to remember that you control your frequency and from each moment to each moment you dictate what frequency and timeline that you're residing in

and jelly milk chocolate one the crunchy tortilla muchacho taco the crispy caramel popcorn the toasty campfire smores and finally the funky fry and killer ketchup so we're gonna sample all five and see do they taste like what they're saying they are and are they any good at that FYE is originally an electronic store which is now becoming more of a you know crazy memorabilia you know toys you know anime funky foods whether it's you know crazy ones like this or from you know japan the mystery boxes and stuff so there's a lot more different types of products you can get it FYE so I picked these up they're these candy bars were a dollar apiece so let's go ahead and try these out and see how they taste see they're any good as a milk chocolate candy bar and do they even taste like what they're saying so let's start off with you know toasty campfire smores so this should taste like you know chocolate with some graham cracker and some marshmallow in it just want to point this out I just realized I'm looking at the Best Buy I'm gonna still try these candy bars regardless I don't know if it's gonna change the taste today is September 3rd 2018 this one's good Best Buy September 13th so this is expiration date is really close on this these other four her best by date was May 24th 2018 I guess I should have checked before I caught these that these weren't old and expired apparently that's not a very popular product is Tommy he's buying very vast their expiration date or best my date I don't know if chocolate actually expires maybe I should look that up before I try these alright so I did just look it up and it says they can last you know year the two years after they were made although I don't have a day on here what it was made is this when it's best buy doesn't say it's expired so I'm gonna try them anyways it's already paid for so let's start off with the toasty campfire and s'mores and see how this candy bar test ok so I have a piece of the toasty campfire and s'mores tasting chocolate I don't you see in there looks like little pieces of marshmallow and graham cracker in there I'm really not tasting it at all I mean if you hadn't showed me this and just getting me a piece of this I just thought it was chocolate bar I really didn't get any taste of any graham crackers more on that one so that one a little disappointed that what I mean so let's move on to let's try the crispy caramel popcorn let's see if this one has a stronger taste that that stands out and also this is one of those ones that's past its best by date there's no creepy crawlies in here when I open it it looks fine just looking at this one it you can tell a little bumpy on it looks more like a Nestle's crunch and you can see some white stuff in there I don't know that's supposed to be the popcorn let's see so this is supposed to be crispy caramel popcorn has the texture of a Nestle Crunch what yeah I mean you still know you're eating a chocolate candy bar you you still have that chocolate taste but it's hard to say it's popcorn let's get like a buttery taste it's definitely different tasting than this more one it doesn't jump out at you as oh this is caramel popcorn but it has a different flavor I get like that to me it tasted like buttery popcorn almost not caramel popcorn again if I hate this without you telling me what was in it what it was supposed to taste like I wouldn't know it wasn't a normal candy bar but I I don't know if I could have pinpointed that that was popcorn a caramel popcorn flavor so let's try the peanut butter and jelly one so so far two candy bars in hand I'm not blown away by them like a lot of that flavor really stands up I get it I see that flavor stats you can taste a little something there but again if you weren't told I don't think you know what you were eating you know what flavor was supposed to be this one a very smooth texture on the candy bar so it's not bumpy like the last one where it looked more like a Nestle's crunch this this looks like maybe a piece of Hershey's chocolate I don't see anything inside it that would be the peanut butter and jelly but let's see how it tastes so this is the peanut butter and jelly candy bar it's a soft one the other ones were you know crispy you know this is just a much softer piece of chocolate and there's a very odd taste I mean it's ideal maybe it's the peanut butter that's making it soft if there is peanut butter in here I don't taste it and you get a hint of the jelly but it's ah it's just an odd I see the ingredients so it has raspberries not so suppose to be a raspberry jelly maybe that's why I'm not a fan of raspberry jelly maybe that's why it has an odd taste I do taste the jelly I don't taste the peanut butter in it even the peanut butter is why that that chocolate is soft in there but pry my least favorite one of these three that we tried so far not a fan of that one I again I can taste I get that hint of that raspberry jelly but other than that I don't taste the peanut butter and that raspberry almost overwhelms the chocolate you don't even really taste the chocolate did care for this one Lee's favorite so far just so you're where I am cleansing the palate between the the candy bars got my water rinse and everything else I can taste the candy bars a little better um let's take this taco one to last that that one seems interesting so this time let's try the funky fryin killer ketchup see how this one tastes you know the bumpier texture that the air holes inside the chocolate a lot like a Nestle's crunch so this was so this should taste like fries with ketchup on it oh wow that is other than odd chased I mean Hornet live done wow this one this is worse than the jelly one just the tape I mean I guess I'm too hard to describe what this taste is I mean I know it's supposed to be the fryi but it's not tasting like french fries and it almost has a little this one has a little bite to it like a little spice in it let me look at the ingredients on this one it does like on the tip of the tongue a little so it has potato chips in this one chipotle chili powder so that's what that spice is coming from on this one so as potato chips some garlic jakoli chili powder and I think that's what I'm Ted I'm not tasting the fries it's a garlic in that that's that spice and it almost tastes like you know bad grease like like maybe fries that were cooked in really old nasty grease that just where you're just tasting that that nasty deep that grease from that deep fryer not the fries I mean worse so far I mean I'm not again the ketchup I'm not getting the fry taste I'm just kidding and it's still I mean I can still it's not hot but I can still feel that that a pepper that Chipotle in the mouth I mean why is that in their fries and ketchup should be spicy I mean I don't get that maybe if they left that out it would have tasted fine but I think that just really ruined to them not a fan of that candy bar at all that was I mean I'd rather eat they didn't like this one but I eat this one before I would go back to this thing no let's move on nothing a little scared about this cuz that wasn't anything like fries and ketchup so I have no idea what this crunchy tortilla mucho muchacho taco let's try it out so there's actually tortilla chips in this awesome I feel I'm not gonna like this I like spicy things I do in chocolate yeah so this has milk chocolate has tortilla chips chipotle chili powder again just like that other one jalapeno powder so this one should be even spicier than the last one we'll see again same texture as as the last one as several these have been more like a Nestle's crunch well anyone you get the taste of those two tortillas in here chef's I'm getting the heat right away the heat right on the tongue that's like ah like oh you can even see the little tortillas and that's what a little piece of the chips oh you're eating the chocolate just like when you eat them I got tortilla chip and it's ground up in your mouth a little pieces that's what's left when you're eating this this little piece of the drug to you this it's odd um just a really odd texture i those little pieces of chips in there aren't knowing I don't care what the heat you're getting some heat from it but that's it it's just like chocolate with some heat and the little chips that are now stuck in my teeth I did I mean as far as the overall flavor even those what this one's spicy too it's way better than this one I think so obviously it's not the the chili powder because this one has it - and this one is fine maybe it's the garlic that was in this one and the onion powder that really made this one just awful I mean this one I could eat I'm not thrilled with it not because of the taste is the tax jingles silly little chips that now I'm stuck in the hole that are inside this I mean I guess my favorite would be this one cuz this is mostly like a chocolate bar I mean this one some heat little chips inside it that I don't care for but the taste the taste is bearable it's not super spicy this one was just really soft and odd all I could taste was really that raspberry jelly and it wasn't a big fan of that this was the worst there's some heat in it to that I think the the onion and the garlic flavor and they're just I don't know what back this supposed to taste like fries but no the caramel popcorn wasn't bad it didn't taste like caramel popcorn it tastes head it tastes like buttery chocolate like I didn't really get that popcorn so much I got the flavor the butter but which is supposed to be caramel they're not Larry that's to me a taste like doesn't buttery chocolate what's not bad this one maybe if I ate more of it I get more because maybe the pieces I didn't have the graham cracker or as much as the graham cracker marshmallow mat so I but this one is decent just because it tastes like a normal candy bar but uh for the pie guy had it didn't really taste like s'mores but it was the best out of them you know they're a dollar a piece I check the expiration date before Vicky to make sure you don't get old ones like I did but you know if you want to try something out and you know you might like them I mean you might like a candy bar with a little heat in it go ahead and pick up this one this is probably has the most heat in it I still film it in mouth a little bit not hot just you spill a little spice in the mouth but yeah head over to FYE and or maybe another store has these do these are the food fight flavored candy bars I got them for a dollar apiece I don't know what they're going for at your store yeah I mean they were okay they weren't great I wouldn't buy these again [Music]", "WEFVZoVPeFg": "Oh guys welcome to kenny'll and

weed and I bet you most of them will tell you they made the classic mistake the beading too much one company working hard to solve this problem is an outfit out of Oakland California called defense a started by former Apple employees davon se specializes in fancy cannabis infused chocolate and they are some of the most user friendly edibles we have ever seen we made the product is accessible because for the most part people have had bad experiences with edibles and we want to change that so really paying attention to packaging pay attention to consistency of dosage but also making something that's delicious two things in particular caught our eye first thing was the graphic design it's tasteful and it's subtle you won't find pot leaves or any other imagery commonly associated with weed culture but what you will find are a clear indication of the bars THC content simple instructions and sensible dosing recommendations each bar contains 18 suggested servings of 10 milligrams of THC each if you're new to cannabis start with half a serving and look there's even a helpful diagram the second thing has to do with the shape of the chocolate bar segments you do easily because you know using a square and do things that other chocolate bars do all the time where they just puts a logo on each 18 servings that just didn't seem fun to us so we looked at you know just other ways of just adding dimension to the bar day fonts they decided to go with pyramid shape segments but it wasn't easy there are three different shapes in every 18 seconds our and davon say needed all of them to contain the same concentration of cannabis so they enlisted the help of a mathematician to ensure that all three shapes have the same volume that might seem like a minor detail but like every other aspect of this chocolate bars design it's a premium touch that actually adds to the experience those details add up and they're about to matter a lot more just a few months California and several other states will vote on whether to legalize weed for recreational use which means that a marketplace that's already flooded with options is going to become a lot more crowded it's this kind of attention to detail that's going to really set products apart", "HY6wNbV4rMw": "welcome to my new youtube channel today I'm doing a review on these one up a psychedelic mushrooms chocolate bar okay so as you can see it has the little tone it has the little toad riding Yoshi up there so basically I tried to ease and um basically I was like the human guinea pig and I will give you guys my take okay so right here it says 3.5 grams per bar so 3.5 grams if you are not a hardcore psychedelic mushroom eater I would definitely advise you not to take the whole bar you know you don't want to take the whole thing my brother did and/or I know somebody that did I mean and no don't do it he had a bad trip basically he was tripping balls and he totally did not enjoy his experience so you definitely want to maybe take half um um I took four pieces and that hit me pretty hard the first time um it was a pretty good psychedelic trip you know what I'm saying I was tripping I did feel really good and I was definitely having like a very spiritual experience to say the of to make it you know plain and simple but the swaras like the chocolate it taste is okay I mean taste is like gut you know just like maybe like a Hershey's chocolate bar kind of not as good and it definitely kind of messes with your stomach like mushrooms tend to do so there's that also the first whenever I first took him I took him at night and I thought it was gonna put me straight to sleep but um and it you know it was like 11:30 or something I was like well I don't even you know I shouldn't even take him to sleep because I'm just gonna sleep on him and I ended up not sleeping at all that whole night I was just like geeking on them so definitely don't take them if you're planning on sleeping like ya don't know because I did it twice and twice I didn't go to sleep oh so there's that what else um okay so in the back you should definitely you know I'm saying consult your physician these are illegal in most states so I wouldn't advise you to eat or do anything illegal but you definitely want to look right here at the bottom has the dose unless you could see that it says one of three pieces is a micro three to seven is I'm not really sure it's a thing that says like spiritual and the own it says the therapeutic and eight to twelve pieces it says fantastic but I would cross out fantastic and put trippin balls gonna be tripping balls boy II so yeah this is always like I said you know you probably get it for like forty fifty bucks if you pay six you're up Angie I'm ripped off so we're gonna I wouldn't pay that much alright guys so if you try them before just you know comment just lender YouTube channel so like comment and subscribe and I'll be reviewing I'm gonna i'm taking some Hydroxycut

strawberry sweetness and a tart lemon flavor that's just right I wasn't wincing or pinching my lips while chewing on this gummy like I might with other sour candies if you're looking for that experience though I'd suggest mixing this gummy with some sour patch kids medicinally wanna sour gummies provide a one-to-one ratio of THC and CBD per gummy this translates to a medicinal experience that's both mildly euphoric and relaxing used a few hours before bed this gummy is excellent for distressing after a tough day it's also great for inflammation relief rest and sleep euphoria creeps up with this one building to a crescendo about an hour or two after eating the edible I could initially feel a slight headband effect that grew in intensity before peaking and slowly dissipating this was followed by immediate pain and stress relief overall I rather loved one a sour gummies they are great for the evening providing gentle euphoria inflammation relief and smooth relaxation before bed if

"EHBqjp1NS7o": "what's up guys Sara here and today I want to show you guys how you can easily calculate dosage when making your own edibles so the first thing to understand is that the average dose is considered to be ten milligrams if you're new to using cannabis or you have a really low tolerance level you might need like half of that maybe even less if you have chronic pain or your chronic user you might need considerably more so it's just good to maybe aim for the 10 milligram mark and when you eat your edible eat like half of it wait the 60 to 90 minutes and see how you feel and then you know for next time maybe you need the whole thing maybe you need to maybe you need even less okay but when we're calculating the dosage when you're making your edibles at home it's kind of nice because you can gate you can make them basically cater to exactly what you need based on your personal requirements so what you want to start off with is some cannabis obviously and this is more than a gram but like just for simplicity sake let's say this as a gram of cannabis now when we're talking about dosage we deal in milligrams like I said the average dose is 10 milligrams so I'm gonna take this one gram and convert it to milligrams one gram of cannabis is a thousand milligrams okay and then if you know the strain then you will know what the dosage is of THC in that cannabis so some strains have 22% some have only 12% the average is 10% so if you don't know what it is go with the 10% mark but obviously it can vary quite a bit it's best if you know what the strain is that's that you're using so we've got a thousand milligrams in our one gram and for simplicity sake again we're gonna state we're gonna go with the average teach the content which is 10% so 10% of a thousand milligrams we go 10% times a thousand I got 100 milligrams so in that one gram of cannabis there's a hundred milligrams of THC now let's say I'm gonna make a batch of cannabis infused coconut oil so I'm gonna take a cup of coconut oil I'm going to infuse it with cannabis and then I'm gonna use it to make something gummies or cookies or whatever okay so I have my one cup of coconut oil I add my 1 gram of cannabis which is a thousand milligrams which contains a hundred milligrams of THC so I know now that in this one cup of coconut oil there's a hundred milligrams of THC now when I go to bake with this let's say again for simplicity reasons or sake I am going to use that whole cup of coconut oil and in a bake a batch of cookies and I got 25 cookies out of that batch so I've used the whole cup I've used the hundred milligrams of THC and I got 25 cookies so I go 100 milligrams you know that was in that recipe divided by the 25 cookies so I know that each one of those cookies has 4 milligrams of THC in it and like we said the average dose is 10 milligrams so this would be a really good like starter amount for somebody you can have one cookie which only has 4 milligrams of THC see how you feel next time maybe you need two cookies or next time you make a batch of cannabis infused coconut oil maybe you use two brands or three brands or whatever depending on what you need personally so that's a really easy way to we calculate dosage when making your own edibles so that you can better control your own medicine and how it best works for you thanks so much for joining me

today i'm going\nto attempt to eat 25 of these 45-gram Cherry Blossom\nChocolates as quick as I can! If you're new to the channel, my\nname is Will, and if this is your first time here then please remember\nto go like, share, and subscribe! Now, before I can eat all of these\nCherry Blossom Chocolates, I'm gonna have to unwrap them\nand unbox them, so let's do that! All right, so I have\nthem all unwrapped now, and before I actually start eating them, even\nthough they show you on the box what each of these chocolates looks like,\nI'd still like to show you guys. So I'm going to cut one of them open!\nHopefully I can do this. I took them out of the fridge so that they'd be soft. All right, so that's what the\nCherry Blossoms look like on the inside! Without further ado, this is me,\nnomniortex, versus 25 Cherry Blossom Chocolates! And start! These are super sweet! This is black coffee. And milk! They're just as good as I remember, from\nwhen I was a kid! They're really sticky! The chocolate is really thick. And I should have mentioned these 25\nCherry Blossom Chocolates weighed a total of two and a half pounds! Ah! They're hard to swallow because the\nentire thing wants to stay in one big mass in your mouth. That's over halfway! I really want to peek at the time,\nbut I'm not gonna. These are really big! They're so hard to swallow! Only five left now. Ah! They're so hard to swallow\nat this point! Last Cherry Blossom out of the 25! Ahh! Okay. So that took nearly twice as long\nas I wanted it to. Ideally, I was thinking 10 minutes, but\nthen I realized how thick the chocolate was on those and\nit never would have happened in that amount of time. But I have to take\n18 minutes and 58 seconds as a pretty respectable finishing time. For 25 Cherry Blossom Chocolates. So, thank you for watching! If you guys liked the video, please\nremember to like, share, and subscribe! I'm Will, also known as nomnivortex,\nand as usual, I'll see you guys next week!", "gJi9cUCaUrs": "I think initially the trooper when you stop that you know it's easy to not mistake that for regular chocolate but it's the odor of it it's more and more prevalent you know historically it's marijuana methamphetamine cocaine but you know with the legalization some of these other states we're seeing a huge increase in these edibles and this particular seizure involved 400 pounds of chocolate candy bars and as a parent you know my first concern is you know what if these get in the hands of children and that could be certainly dangerous oh we're certainly worried about that just to raise awareness to our citizens that you know this stuff looks like chocolate candy bars but in fact it's marijuana", "ZqsIT_mGapI": "hi everybody my name is Sonny and you are in sunny days kitchen sorry for the shaky camera but I just had my silly cat max jump on my shoulder Oh Manny way we are going to show you how I make my canna chocolates I make it with my half a cup of can of oil and it's coconut oil infused with cannabis I make it myself and a cup of chocolate milk chocolate for flavouring this time around I'm going to use raspberry laron oils they're fabulous I use them all the time I make heart candies as well and I use these flavorings in them too so sorry I'm gonna stutter a little bit I'm a little nervous this is my first video I'm gonna put up on YouTube but anyway so and this is my little spoon that I use with I used two of these this is half a teaspoon of measuring with the oil and then in these is what I used as my moles so I'm gonna pause it so I can put my half a cup of kind of oil in to the chocolate and then I melt it that way melt it down slowly in the microwave some people use like a double boiler or whatever but I don't do that I do it slowly in the microwave it doesn't take too long especially if I'm pouring my kind of oil over top of that and it helps the mixture actually it's probably good to go but I just put it in there I'm gonna have to put it in the microwave just to melt it a little further but dying out and then I melt it down mix it together and we'll be right back okay so we're back I melted down the chocolate and it's just a little bit shy of one cup but I'm not too worried about that because um that amount right there will probably make 45 chocolates so I've set out my molds I have my small these are half a teaspoon each these are a full teaspoon so this is a full dose one of these is a full dose you'll have to take two of these depending on your tolerance level some take two three four depending on my pain level my tolerance level is quite high so I switched from smoking to edibles and back and forth so anyway this is what I do I take a full teaspoon of the raspberry flavoring I put it in there stir it around and because it's just me doing this I'm gonna have to pause it again sorry okay so we're back so I've got a tablespoon of the raspberry oil in there flavoring mine if you're wondering within my little box it's all my Laurent oils she's fabulous I loved her oils I use them all the time there's the raspberry but I've got because I make hard candies too I've got different flavoring in there I have a green apple caramel butterscotch root beer creme de menthe and orange I believe so anyway here we go this is pretty well good to go just scrape off the knife it's kind of hard to do when you're looking at it through the camera all right the whatever so then I take my little half a teaspoon and I just measure it out obviously you just take whatever because it's going in the mom like I said it takes two of these because they're half of teaspoons I just find that the smaller spoon goes better into the molds without making too much of a mess so here we go we're gonna go in one of the malls takes two it is to get it falling up as you can see it's pretty level oh don't have it so we just keep going and going and going and going you have no time lapse so I'm gonna pause it and I'm gonna get these done and then they go into the fridge and they sit in the fridge I don't know about 10-15 minutes you can check them after ten minutes because but because my molds are fairly thick molds I keep them in there probably about 15-20 minutes just to be sure that they're all solidified and they're not going to again max jumping on my shoulder on you jerk ball just to make sure that they're solid enough that I can pop them out of the molds and bag them and put them in the freezer so I am going to pause it and fill the molds and put them in the freezer so we'll just end it here but this is what we do and I will pull them out of the molds next okay so there are linear molds and I'm a little medicated because I went licking the spoon after I filled all the molds up it's very good taste yummy that's why they call them edibles because they're so good anyway I'm gonna put them in the fridge now and the next time you see them they'll be ready to be popped out of the malls so instead of waiting for the other ones to solidify cuz it'll take 15 minutes anyway so I'm just gonna cheat here anyway so these are ones that I already made that I put in the freezer and I find that these chocolates I've had them in the freezer not these particular ones but some of my edible chocolates in the freezer for just over a month and they still taste great so I've never pushed it any longer than like maybe five six weeks because sometimes they might get that freezer burn taste so just keep it to your personal preference anyway they might not even last that long but me I don't always eat edibles so I just make them and put them in the freezer so that they're there when I do want them anyway so this is all I do is just you just push on the back of these silicone molds and they just pop right out and then I put them in my bag ease I put about a dozen in each bag and then because they're little freezer baggies they don't hold a lot anyway and then I just seal them off right okay so I got everyone's in there these are crime to match and the ones are in the freezer they're our raspberry so that's it so I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please put them down below and I'll try and answer them as as soon as I can I'll try and keep an eye on it I don't anticipate too many people watching it because I know there's a lot of videos about edibles on the internet but I just thought I'd try my hand on it and on my channel so again this is flower child and I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please post them below and I'll try my hardest answer them okay smile have a great day be true be honest be respectful stay true and stay unique bye", "8G0uy08bGNo": "[Music] welcome back so today well yesterday we went to see bd+ and got some new and goodies he decided to try out some new radicals there little gummies yeah squid yep and so there are 10 milligrams per serving and there's ting servings in each pack yeah and they are full spectrum hemp so it does have less than point 30 percent THC in each serving but for us today we're gonna take the little thing just because 10 milligrams of CBD with how much we have been smoking it and everything isn't gonna do much for us so for it to really work and has to give you the full effect how did you open pictures open [Music] and yes it for me I have the blue raspberry I have the Concord grape and what's interesting about them is like they're colored with natural products mine's colored with cabbage as far as like rubbish yes that's interesting okay so yeah it comes out as these little video gummies I don't know even how to do the individual servings personally you try it yeah you'd have to definitely cut it it does have like little marks to show you like where to cut but don't think that's easy to pull apart that's all good I just say you can definitely do the CBD in there but you can taste how much more natural it is is there seriously like a handful of ingredients there's coconut oil full spectrum hemp extra citric acid organic sugar and water I mean I teach a little bit I taste a little bit of the grape yeah yeah so way to go lunchbox alchemy yeah these are really good so we are at our local mall and we're just gonna kind of walk around I was wanting it to go into forever 21

it's been sitting us to get a fragrance rate like that whenever I spray for you freely all day long he has to over all those gummies definitely helped highly recommend it tastes good - yeah they tasted really good the only thing that I think people are gonna have a problem with is the splitting just because it is a gummy so I think you've been cutting it will be a little difficult but the only way I can see possible is to cut into it Jonathas definitely from TV first for telling us about them yes and I will be linking in our description exactly where you can get it online on CD plus

up normally one hit of a bomb and i'll be [ __ ] fried you're gonna be [ __ ] up i'm hoping i'm like paralyzed that's what i'm hoping for so yeah [Music] those taste like real gummy worms though that [ __ ] well no they are real gummies yeah but normally like if you infuse like a cookie with thc and you can still see guy should be [ __ ] up it will be worth it though dude perhaps you're doing that i mean it's not like it's not like you know i mean you don't have to work tomorrow right he's underplaying it dude yeah i'm unemployed baby you're good you're good 25 minutes how do you feel better

that right here let's go to the light a bit so these uh people can see how red the eyes are um so guys um i shouldn't say guys i don't like that hey you look at those eyes right there that's what those edibles do after one hour that's 500 milligrams of delta 8 thc um edibles man they're frying me already hell yeah it's been what are you expecting in the next 30 minutes sleeping probably so we'll see if we get any more of this are they sativa indica or what just distilling distillate oh so [ __ ] blacks is that what that is i guess you could call it delta 8 wax i mean wax is desolate um i guess but there's different methods of extracting it like co2 and bho and i guess the consistency determines what you call it but it's just distal it's just super thick and sticky and uh basically the gummies just regular gummies and they actually spray it with the actual thc oil oh wow so you're when you eat the gummies you're literally eating the straight oil on the actual gum that's insane i don't think i heard like a word you said because i'm just [ __ ] just going in and out of my eyes oh okay [Laughter] you feel [ __ ] up oh [ __ ] i can't feel my lips oh no like stuck to my teeth so

"gFReMX-Xyyg": "hey guys save me an inter gonna be trying three candy bars this is three flavors so we're actually trying five candy bars we've got a new baron brand chocolate it's peanut butter and jelly and this was 349 at Toys R Us so it's not a cheap chocolate and then we have delicious which is a Walgreens brand delicious Walgreens flavor or a brand of chocolate this is only a dollar and you get three coffee can't connect confection treats maybe with real coffee so we'll just have to split these out it looks like a the size of a ghirardelli square is kind of what it looks like when you got no one if you only get three squares it yeah you gets three aces yeah three square is one of each water oh I also have something from Toys R Us it is a crush orange bar it is dark chocolate with orange pressed flavor chilling there are three little pieces in here it was a dollar I think it's going to probably taste like the flavor packs do for water tastes like orange like that one's fresh but it won't have that fizz or anything that hot does in no time I want to feel place like an orange one they also have a dr. pepper in orange coming in that chocolate ooh-wee but we goodbye you don't expect that I expect it means you know just taking one I expected it to be yeah I broke mine oh I know I exploded it it's running how I could talk to a chair I'm sorry I mean you squeezed it I didn't know it was gonna explode you love it too hard I'm trying to break it to show it to the people like God I'm gonna like a Looney Tunes this meeting on TV those were okay honestly they kind of taste like medicine that's all do you want me to take a break see wash your hands yeah we'll be right back about Anders all cleaned up that literally tastes like orange cough medicine two minutes I don't think was very good it was actually absolutely appalling right it's uh I was trying to break it for the camera and it makes literally exploded in whenever we're it's it's terrible it's very runny chocolate was really really hard like crisp are mean it does the flavor wasn't even good it didn't taste like a one crush and literally I tried to wipe it off the table and it just created this instant stick pad like for flies and it's like you're you're ingesting this as well you know made me think about it there for a moment I'm excited for this because I like you PB&J type thing oh they come on stick wait little Gavin side stick you know what they're amamiya PEZ dispenser things you know the Pez candies those look like a comma Pez thing did you John many calories no you really can't see the jelly these are three bars via three bars they're 170 pounds this is the jelly part come on once again how long letter processes get this chocolate this wonderful peanut oil that's funky that was expensive to say what I want to say as long as it's not proven actually you can say whatever you want later he's gonna say it tastes like PB 2 and no is that what you were gonna say would you love baby to in your planet I'm fan of it and it's okay you know what not everybody is a fan of PB - I don't - chocolate if you want a good peanut butter and jelly treat go get you an uncorrectable promise no matter smokers those are awesome well this is not worth I don't even know how to thirst again yeah poor Gavin for 349 doesn't worth about 49 you know not where were that big sense yeah cuz those

morning rush and hazelnut dream over like they even though yeah they're a more square time of course - other than the same size is that Ghirardelli yeah let's try the hazelnut last let's do the the know these are $160 of the olive oil yeah really peed all three down not bad well that's that's more than well that's the way less than a they're doing I'm slowly getting there there's a little boy there pre thin that's why it's not many yes Louise is a piece of charcoal Wow for coffee it has that really good coffee flavor that I like it's not bad for Holly it tastes like coffee with cream on it this one I'm gonna try not to compare these to what I usually buy which is but this little little tiny coffee shop in Taylor it looks like a shed that you put in your backyard but it's a coffee shop and they actually sell cup get chocolate-covered coffee me and that's what I've got some like with the actual coffee bean crunching and all that that's pretty close to the flavor without the crunch that's really good if you you would to really like that coffee bean flavor that's what you smell when you walk down the copy out is what that tastes like so this is morning rush the other ones better this is a cappuccino I like a little better the vanilla was more like a coffee with like a creamer like a was it cream net or whatever the whatever the carnation creameries that's what it takes in like this is just yeah Coffee I mean it was like black coffee the vanilla was like black coffee for me you know I've had some cream room this one was like this is more like a cup of tea no oh this one tastes like they put creamer into the black coffee but no sugar I'll get this out sooner or later okay and this is the hazelnut one it actually looks like it has a little piece a woman rejuvenated and crunchy now just a little bit there they're soft they're not very good no that just tastes like chocolate hazelnut to me taste it did you haven't any coffee yet man I've just got coffee washed out of the mouth that tastes like a very sweet sweet coffee like they put a lot of cream and sugar in it he does have the hazelnut on top of it my mom bought as a a Keurig while she bought it for Christina and the ones that I drink are the hazelnut cappuccino so that's pretty close to it I don't it doesn't taste like a good hangs on that path to me no it's okay how did all this honestly the only one I would buy is the vanilla the line I actually kind of like that one okay if you like coffee but you have to really want coffee flavored chocolate too want to get those which I'm not talking coffee yeah my bottom line opinion I think this was a disastrous video that crush I wouldn't touch it that PB&J was abysmal yeah and those were just okay okay they're not really worth how much they're gonna go no I mean it's it's a dollar if you want to try it try it you might be your new favorite thing but for them if you like chocolate a lot of you like coffee flavored chocolate and if you do try these out I think you might like them but the other two just stay away from those things are awful okay hope that helps you make some kind of decision about what - I bought for snack and catch you next time", "cRT58q2AoeI": "horrible ah that's horrible greetings and welcome to another british sky reacts video and in this video a british guy is reacting to lots and lots of us candy and savory snacks i

savory snacks from some great friends of the channel mr zak stroud and the boys from blanks no one asked for go check them out links in the description really really funny guys and they were kind

but hey here goes bottoms up um yeah not bad actually they're all right they're not on the reese's scale so i'm gonna give that a solid six and a half out of ten they're nice it could actually be a seven but yeah six and a half out of ten for bunch of crunch okay moving on next we have mini charleston chew never heard of these chewy flavored nougat or nugget with delicious chocolatey coating

what your mark out head is okay charleston chew mini hmm hmm okay um yeah they're all right they're nice i'll give that a six out of ten i feel like i'm being the harsh judge today yeah i'll give that six out of ten that was all right that was okay thing is that the bar has been set really high with the reese's and the fun fact i've just found out our local convenience store actually sells reese's

cherry which i've never seen before in like a style of a red bull can i'm not sure if i should drink it now or maybe save it for a video and this bad boy i mean this looks crammed with sugar or

is take care god bless i'm gonna finish these off now and see in the next video foreign", "db3sIVwDbUM": "- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually. (chill beat)", "YFKNLym1r3w": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it's your boy goblin and today we're coming in with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you guys next time peace and subscribe if you haven't already peace out everyone", "EjbVn3G-Syo": "what was that the alarm system oh yeah that's the alarm is that going to be picked up in the video [ __ ] where did i leave off at hey man it's mike from bonus cbd.com today we got uh hometown's new gummy bears man this is that delta eight thc pretty [ __ ] excited about this supposedly delta athc is supposed to be some strong [ __ ] it's supposed to knock you on your ass man i'm really curious if it's gonna taste the same as the other blueberry uh gummy bears they kind of had a sour taste to it it was pretty good man so i'm really curious about that so let's go ahead and start talking a little bit about delta athc supposedly what what everybody's saying is delta 18c is supposed to be more of a medical property thc more so than delta 9. delta 9 thc is the one that's regulated that's the one that you can't have above 0.3 percent you have that have to have it below now all the other tastes like delta delta eight thc a thcc all that can just be as high as they [ __ ] possibly can or as low as they possibly can either one there's no regulations on those guys it's just a delta nine thc that has the regulation but let's go ahead and crack this open and try these out now when we got these in they told us two get you feeling real good three you getting couch locked so i'm thinking about just trying out three i'm gonna try out these two and then go from there has no smell so we can't do a smell test let's try these gummies out man all right so let's go ahead and talk a little bit more about the thc's and the cbd properties that are inside these gummies um first off though the flavor it tastes just like the other blueberry gummies if you've ever had that if you haven't it's just a sour patch kid with the blueberry sour patch kid pretty much that's the easiest way to explain the flavor of that one now so one thing about this is it has like hardly any cbd properties in it it's point if you look at the lab results it's going to say 0.01 percent they round it down to zero that's why you can see on the side of this package it says zero milligrams of cbd there's not enough cbd in it for them to say hey these are cbd gummies that's just kind of false advertising now it's only pretty much only delta 8 thc and that's supposed to be good for medical use now as far as recreational side goes we're still waiting on that to kick in so we're gonna go ahead and give it 30 minutes and then we're gonna come right back and i'm gonna tell you how i'm feeling off these delta a cbds tell you how good they are how bad they are so stay tuned i'll be right back man all right man we're back after waiting 30 minutes for these to uh kick in i do feel a little something off of it more so than what i was expecting i wasn't expecting a whole lot so let's go ahead and talk about how it made me feel imagine taking like one or two beers that's about the same amount of feels that you get off of this i can see why it's good for some people and i can see why it's not good for others a lot of people are like oh delta eight that sounds spicy it's new it's not bad i don't mind it at all one thing i like about this is there's like no thc in it so if anybody needs to take it and you don't need thc in your system yeah you'll be all right man now if you're wanting a little bit more of a kick there might be something else stronger i want to say actually i have more of a feeling off the cbd gummies versus the delta 8 gummies that one gave me a harder feeling quicker this one's giving me more of a deep feeling i don't know if that makes sense i don't know how to explain it other than that but that's what i get off of this so it's pretty good i like it like i was saying though earlier the flavor is going to be a lot like a sour patch kid so

"5-o1BEb8eek": "now speaking of getting high yeah you know not all highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "km6Rg_tsI6o": "Canada's legal cannabis market is about to get a little bigger today the federal government announced that edibles will become available for purchase this December but there are tight rules about what's in it and how it's sold the CBC's Katie Simpson is here with all of the details so Katie tell us what did the government announce today well the government had been expected this is part of the the next wave of the legalization process and so today the government announced that it's not going to be until mid December at the earliest that stores can the stores that are licensed retailers can actually start selling edibles as well as topicals and extracts those are a number of different products that there is a big market for according to some of the people who work in the industry that we spoke with today have to say but again this is part of the larger process with the government trying to to legalize marijuana legalize these products and there are going to be some limits here as well the government announcing that the way that edibles will be packaged they'll be limited to 10 milligrams serving sizes and there will also be continued to be the rules around how much marijuana or how much cannabis people can buy when they are at one of these licensed retailers bill Blair who is been in charge of this legalization program he earlier today spoke with reporters and defended the way the government has moved forward on this I've heard from the industry and people saying but you know we could make more money if you only did this or relaxed these regulations but quite frankly that's not our motivation our motivation is and will always be to protect our kids to protect the health and safety of our of Canadians and to keep our community safe and displaced that illicit market that has developed over decades so the government has said from the beginning that the reason it is doing this is it wants to make it harder for kids to get marijuana it wants to eliminate the black-market those things that'll be a long term achievement that has not happened yet if they are able to achieve that but this is the next step in that wave okay so what's the reaction been so far today well we went to a marijuana shop I'd never been to one before and we went in there very busy we have to fact-check very busy and we went in and spoke with Michael Patterson who's a co partner at fire and flower and he says that one of the biggest things ever since his shop open back in April one of the biggest things that customers ask is when can they get their hands on edibles have a listen just because in the previous black market you really had no idea what you were consuming and because there was such a delayed effect when it hits people quite often but have very bad experiences so there's a lot of people who are interested in consuming cannabis not by smoking it and would love edibles they just don't really want to take the risk of what's currently out there so that opens up edibles opens up a completely different discussion because right now on the black market as Michael just mentioned no one knows what they're getting really also there's the concern which is a concern for the Canadian Centre for substance use and addictions they have a concern about people who might not know what they're doing if they are taking these because the body processes edibles in a different way than if you were to say smoke a joint or smoke Agyei as the kids say have a listen I think one of my biggest concerns is is over consumption or over intoxication with smoked cannabis you start to feel the effects you know relatively quickly if you're using an edible cannabis product so it can take up to two hours before you can feel the effects so this is a next phase thing obviously that centre of the official we spoke with from the centre says this needs to be researched heavily there and there needs to be a lot of precautions around this particularly because there are some very serious fears about you know what if kids accidentally get their hands on this people who don't even know it's a cannabis edible eat it and they don't want to have an experience like that so there's still a lot of work to be done around that but for those who are interested in the edible products they gotta wait until mid-december okay Caity Lotz to chew on thanks so much Katie Simpson I've heard from the industry and people saying but you know we could make more money if you only did this or relaxed these regulations but quite frankly that's not our motivation our motivation is and will always be to protect our kids to protect the health and safety of our of Canadians and keep our community safe and displace that illicit market that has developed over decades Canadians will soon be able to legally consume a new range of cannabis products edibles such as baked goods candy and cannabis extracts will be available this December as well as topicals like ointment screams and even makeup but the government is setting strict rules on them each individual package of edibles will be limited to a maximum of ten milligrams of THC and packaging must be plain and cannot appeal to children also cannabis products containing alcohol nicotine or caffeine will be prohibited unless it's natural caffeine like what's found in chocolate for instance so is industry on board with these regulations Sebastian st. Louie is the co-founder and CEO of hexo a licensed cannabis producer based in gatineau he joins us now from Montreal Sebastian thanks for taking the time I want to start with your overall impression of the regulations rolled out today what's your reaction to those I think from hexose perspective we're really pleased at the progress that we're making in Canada I mean we're on the world stage world leader creating just amazing experiences for consumers and now we have a whole new way to delight our customers so we're very excited about October and December walk me through some of the specific regulations here though because it makes it clear that the products cannot be appealing to youth how do you navigate that what does that mean because a chocolate bar or gummy bear the cookies these are appealing to kids well we're working very tightly with Health Canada on exactly how we roll out the products and bringing a cannabis into responsible use has been a core tenant of what hex has been all about for the last six years the interesting thing about legalization of cannabis as we've seen in the stats in Colorado and now in Canada even is we see a reduction in youth use and so as we move into edibles now we'll simply apply the principles that we've learned from dried marijuana and oils and make sure that we don't put the products within easy access of youths make sure that the packaging is not appealing to them and of course avoid certain form factors when we're talking about gummies about things that could look like a toy or a gummy okay so you have to have plain packaging and how would you make a edible chocolate bar and cookie for example that isn't appealing to a youth because those seem my kids they like chocolate bars they like cookies it starts from the safety of the distribution and then from the safety of the packaging itself so we put everything in child resistant containers and then of course it's up to the adults that purchase cannabis to make sure they store them in a safe location out of the reach of children the limits of 10 milligrams of THC in the package of edibles people tell me that this is a low level of THC compared to what's there in black-market edibles so is this a potent enough limit for the market yeah the exciting thing about the research Heco's doing today is that we can actually increase the effect in body with much lower doses than what's typically seen in black-market we've been able to go to a smaller particulate side and the result is that it's a safer product it's a lower dose it's a better experience for the consumer and we are we're absolutely happy to work within the ten milligram limit people will have a very pleasant experience with with those levels it's legalizing it is obviously a new frontier and experience for Canada but for a lot of people who might try this for the first time edibles might not be the way they are introduced to cannabis for a lot of people so will there be instructions will there be guidance on how an edible would affect a consumer for the first time versus other methods of consuming cannabis so interesting that we're now only legalizing edibles but hexo has had experience with edible cannabis products on the market now for many years we were the first company in Canada to introduce our D carb product which is an edible cannabis powder which fits currently under the dried marijuana regs and so we've built a whole slew of Education programs and working with the distribution and the provinces in getting that information into the hands of consumers start low go slow right so but if I want to try an edible for the first time how am I gonna know how that may affect me is there going to be some sort of advice that comes with the package when I buy it or is it just gonna be trial and error there is reaction and depending on everyone's biological makeup for different doses so that's why we suggest for example especially in the case of our new beverages that we're launching with Molson Coors this coming October what we're gonna be doing is ensuring that the product is sessionable and that it starts at a very low dose especially in the case of THC so the idea that someone's gonna be able to work up to an appropriate dose for the effect that they're looking starting at say 2 milligrams of THC and then if somebody feels that they need to have a higher dose well then they can have a second or third session of the product ok so what are you doing with moles in Korres because the regulations on the Edible says no alcohol no nicotine no caffeine how's that working well we we think that mixing alcohol and both this is both hexo and Wilson's position the mixing alcohol and cannabis is unsafe and so we're not shipping any product that will have alcohol and cannabis together what we're doing is we're creating formulations powered by EXO that'll help people for fun sleep focus sport sex and Diet we're inserting those formulations into all kinds of great based beverages that Molson is investing in and those will range from sparkling waters to waters to of course some d alkalized beers that people are familiar okay so using them for for manufacturing and distribution and bottling and canning and that sort of thing but not alcohol connected with it no but the base products as well that they're investing in because they're starting to diversify and starting to buy other beverage brands outside of beer okay so most of course doesn't have trouble supplying the market with its product the marijuana industry the cannabis industry has had problems supplying the market since since legalization began how do we avoid some of the problems we've seen with traditional cannabis on edibles I think that there's been a lot of lessons learned by the industry in the in the last six years heck so for one is ready for October 17th now it looks like it may be a few extra months to get products on shelf but we're already ramped up the logistics supply chain is done we have the largest cannabis manufacturing Center on the planet in Belleville Ontario 1.5 million square feet of straight manufacturing we have over 1,100 employees hard at work including 25 top phd's food scientists and the products are going to be absolutely fantastic and ready on store shelves with our partners of course starting in Quebec with s QDC but Canada wide okay

"ThNwk7U3KIU": "[Music] hi Oh welcome to Diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if it's the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back I hope everybody's fine today and doing well I am just hunky-dory peachy keen so today I am going to show you how to make twist Twix chocolate bars so remember these shortbread recipes that you did that you saw and for those of you who didn't go watch it because you're gonna need it to make this one so with our shortbread cookies we're going to make Twix chocolate bars check these out caramel chocolate and our cookie mean just like the real thing all right so I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need and we're gonna make up some Twix boom shaka-laka-laka alright so let's jump right into those ingredients well what you're gonna need is one pound or two cups of brown sugar and you can use the golden or the dark it doesn't really matter the darker will give you a richer color and a bit of a richer flavor we're going to need 1 cup of butter in total so what I've done is three quarters of a cup of regular butter and 1/4 cup of cannabutter you're going to need a 1 cup of corn syrup again it can be the light or the golden that doesn't matter again if you use the golden you're gonna have a bit of a richer flavor and a richer color one and a half teaspoons of vanilla one can of sweetened condensed milk and that's the small can this is 300 milliliters we're gonna need a pinch of salt our shortbread Joe from the previous recipe and if you haven't seen it I got the link below for you and I'm using chocolate candy melts for doing our coating I do promise I will do a temper put real cocoa butter etc how to infuse but for today's for simplicity sakes I'm just using candy melts so if you know how to temper your chocolate and stuff you can go ahead and use real chocolate totally up to you so let's get into our equipment and then let's get these quicks made so the equipment we need is a torch line cookie sheet a straight edge knife or chef's knife a spatula silicone or sorry silicone spatula or a wooden spoon moon or a wooden spoon do not use metal you're going to need a candy thermometer fun know if you've got one or something that's going to be able to for you to pour easily and a medium sized saucepan preferably heavy bottom it allows for more heat better not more better heat distribution so you don't end up with any hot spots that's it for our equipment so let's jump in and let's get these made a couple things I forgot to tell you oops rolling pin offset spatula if you've got one our regular spatula helps move the cookie and a little extra flour here so we're rolling our dough out okay so be sure to preheat your oven now to 350 degrees okay so I'm just gonna sprinkle some flour down here on my surface make sure I'm well cover because it'll probably be sticky so your dough will have been sat in your refrigerator for about 20 minutes or if you make up your dough ahead of time and and it's really solid just take it out leave an Agilent gets to room temperature it takes probably about an hour an hour and a half depending how warm it is so I thought I just used about half of my dough the other half I'm just gonna make regular cookies put some flour on my in I'm going to roll this out to about a half an inch thick and a five flower has needed it's pretty good a little on top here I kind of want to square this off or straighten it off here and now I'm going to make about half inch slices when it kind of about a half inch thick not the straightest but oh well well cover it up it's all good and then you want to cut those in-house so you want to have about half inch by about one inch one and a half inch or basically however long you want to make them they're yours so if you want to have any real lot once leave them but I'm gonna have these let's transfer them over to my cookie sheet now your dough is probably very soft you want to be gentle not like that so if you go flinging it all around now you can't put them fairly close together on the cookie sheet these cookies don't rise and they don't spread out so it's better the smidgen but not not like a regular cookie so you can put them fairly close together then the extra dough you can either make more chocolate bars or you can just make up a batch of shortbread cookies and if your cookies have become a little warped getting them onto the pan cuz they're soft you just take your straight edge and just kind of flatten them out again clout now your edges I'm not gonna be that particularly fussy as long as you're straight once they're all on the pan grab a fork and you're gonna put holes in through the top of each of your cookie and this is to release the moisture the other reason you usually put holes and is to stop them from rising but these don't really rise so let's bring with releasing the moisture I just put a line of dots across the top you go about 3/4 of the way through with your fork okay so we're gonna pop these into our preheated oven of 350 degrees depending on the size of your cookies it could be anywhere about 15 to 25 minutes keep a close eye on them because once they start to bake they go fairly quickly what you want is to have a light golden brown around the edges just a very light coloring through the rest of the cookie you do not want them getting dark so keep a close eye on them because members your friends are always very light in color so it's it's a very very light golden brown around the edges and you always put your cookies on the middle rack there we go so my spread out a little bit more than they're supposed to I've done made two previous batches the last couple of days and these puppies never spread out at all so I'm not sure I'm a guy oops my recipe slightly a little too much butter but if that does happen to you no fear while they're still warm take your straight knife and just cut them apart yeah they flatten down and spread out on me I'm not sure what I messed up in my recipe long as they dry firm and taste good no problem so you can allow them to cool for about 10 minutes on the cookie sheet then transfer them over to a cooling rack and we're gonna allow these to completely cool to set for a couple of hours before we eat the candy bar if you try it too quickly your cookies will end up too soft so don't do it so I'll be back when these are completely cooled and will make up the caramel and get them - chocolate oh I cannot wait now that my cookies are all cool we're on to the good part like caramel YUM alrighty so basically everything goes into the pot except of the vanilla that goes and when we're done so in the water sugar our brown sugar my cannabutter my regular butter my cup of corn syrup and our can of sweetened condensed milk and we're going to stir that together so you just want to stir this until it's all combined and so it should be looking like this we're going to turn our heat on to a medium and you were going to stir this until we and we're going to continually stir this once it starts to boil we'll add our candy thermometer and we are going to cook this to 240 degrees but it is very important that you stir the entire time if you don't it will start to burn on the bottom and you'll get little dark flecks if by chance that happens you can always just run your caramel through a strainer oh sorry I forgot and we're gonna add in our pinch of salt okay stirring stick with sugar sauce here a thick syrup not as much fun as I thought always make sure to go around the edges in other words don't just stir in one area make sure you keep now of course if you have kin of sugar or cane of syrup you can absolutely replace part of your corn syrup with your canister part of your sugar with your can of sugar if you do do that though make don't forget to de lightly grease the sides of your pot so your product doesn't stick to the sides so a nonstick cooking spray it works great and they just take off the excess but don't forget that part but if you're just using canned butter we don't need to do that step this is basically what your caramel should be looking like right now I'm eating up I'm so excited I'm gonna be getting a new camera so now we can have two angles one on me then one pulley on the product so you can always see exactly what's happening can't wait for that to happen for my next video I should have that yeah I'm actually gonna touch my candy thermometer to it but just before it starts to boil that way I won't have to stop stirring while it's boiling and have it burn on me so attach it before it starts to boil just safer that way and as I said we are going to cook this to 240 degrees that is firm ball so this is going to give us a firmer caramel if you like it softer you can just cook it to 235 between to 35 to 38 and if you find that it is brownie that you're getting little brown bits even though you're stirring then turn your heat down the bed so if you're medium turn it down to medium low my stupid thing popped off and they can't get it back on and I can hold it with one hand and stir with one hand I'm having great difficulties and I got brown bits in my caramel and I just let you know your candy will get to about the caramel again to about 220 221 and I'll probably sit there for what seems to be quite a long time you're gonna think your temperature is not going to rise nitin just leave it there that's kind of its mean cooking point after that point once it starts to rise pasta 221 you will find that it will climb fairly quickly so just be patient and as the temperature gets higher you will notice your your caramel will start to darken up it'll get a richer it'll get richer in color it's supposed to do that trust me you will know if caramels birth there is no mistaking it at all and the caramel is also gonna thicken up the hotter that it gets the thicker it will get almost a soft ball and said I want to go to firm closer to firm ball look so good no caramel mmm it should be thickening up quite a bit at this point as well getting get dark a much richer in color and I think we're pretty much where I want to be careful a lot of out let's take her off the heat keep her stirring grab your funnel put it into something that it can hold on you can pull it in and I'm gonna pour this in oh that hurt and the rest of this I'm going to pour out onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet don't scrape the bottom of the pan it'll have like icky stuff there don't scrape that stuff out no you're gonna hurt later oh I forgot to add the vanilla so when your caramel is done add in one and a half teaspoons of vanilla oopsie me I'm gonna add a little bit into my Mike funnel here little unorthodox but hey those little burns hurt oh okay so now normally you would have put your vanilla into the pot unlike myself so I've got that mixed in there fairly good so you're gonna put your parchment paper underneath your wrap your drying rack and you're just going to disperse some of your caramel over the middle of your cookie now with your extra caramel if you want to make if you're making more and you need more for your thing you just take a bunch of n2 some of it and put it into a double boiler and just to melt it down enough so it's workable so you can always reuse whatever you used on your pan or you can cut it up and just to have it eat it as caramel pieces so now I'm just gonna let that caramel cool and let it set onto the chocolate then we're going to clean up our edges and pop them into the fridge for a bit get a nice and cool melt our chocolate and get them covered up so they're actually chocolate bars well it's still warm and workable just want to get a paring knife and just take off any excess off the sides it'll be easier to do while it's still warm but make sure it's not hot I don't want anybody else burning themselves as they like so something like that we just want to straight cut that off this way we'll have nice clean edges you try it when it's completely cool you're likely to pull the caramel right off you don't want to do that now on to our final step coating it with the chocolate so you want to melt up your chocolate however you want to do you can do one on a double boiler or in the microwave if you do it in the microwave do the first round for 30 seconds then go for twenty-five twenty fifty and then continue just in ten second intervals until you get your required melted texture but each time take it out stir it really well in between alright so first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna coat the top parts out look take your cookie and dunker in let the excess shake off the excess and put her on the tree and you want to try and get like all pretty much right down to the edge there so just continue to coat your top top first then once I get them all coated I'm gonna throw them into the refrigerator for 10 minutes let them chill up nice and firm and then we'll do the bottoms now that my tops are all covered in cinema pop these in the fridge for 10 minutes I'll let them firm up nicely and then we'll do the bottoms and we'll get to finish this out and try and give them a try oh my can't wait and then if you want if you've got that leftover caramel and you don't want to use it for a Twix bar you can always just cut it up into pieces and wrap it up in wax paper or parchment paper or you can make chocolate-covered caramels so just cut it into strips cut off a little rectangular square shape just dunk her into your chocolate now if you've got one of these dipping tools some dipping tools sort of thing like this just makes life a little easier or you can use a fork and that's it that's what you can do there with your extra caramel and if you want to make salted caramel get some sea salt and you can just drop a couple of a couple of grains of sea salt on top of your chocolate here I show you you up just a couple then you got chocolate then you've got chocolate salted caramel so look at all the things you can make from this one recipe now that our chocolate bars are set on top here we're just gonna do the bottoms so you just want a layer obviously just get the bottom in there shake off the excess enjoy we want to make sure to get off the excess and you can either layer down that way or if you want you can flip them upside down but and again just go through and do that for all the rest of your Twix and again I'm gonna pop them in the fridge just for a couple minutes to get the bottom set up and then it'll be back to give them a taste and think about and then just store them you cannot wrap them in tin foil or wax paper or put them into an airtight container with a lid and you can keep them in the refrigerator or on the counter and these would also freeze up okay and our Twix bars are now done so once you've laid them out and they've settled if the bottoms if you get like a big lay out like that that's extra siding there no no here we go like that and you want it to look cleaner just get a nice straight edge yeah better if you heat it up it'll work better it'll go through a cleaner but you can just cut through off the sides so you can just cut off the excess off the edges just to make them look a little cleaner neater and that's it all right let's give one of these puppies a try if you let it get back to room temperature first before you tried the crime out because otherwise to meet you heart and on my next batch I would not cook the caramel went to 240 probably two more to like just about to 36 a little bit firmer than I will liked it so 240 is going to give you really really firm 236 is going to give you a nice between that soft and firm without it being real firm but again it's a personal preference so you've got that range there to work with so that's my Twix tutorial there for you I hope you enjoyed that as always I'd love to hear your comments and if you have any questions please don't hesitate to put them in you know where down below alright guys so thanks again for watching and you have an awesome rest of your day", "bwbZTN4fMGM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment

thinking about trying a cannabis edible for the first time to see what all the hype is about you should know that eating cannabis edibles to party your relaxed can be a fun and rewarding experience but remember THC does have the ability to intoxicate and should therefore like anything else be used responsibly I have before us the ultimate guide of all you need to know to guarantee an awesome edible experience ladies and gentlemen I give you the puffs puffs posts official guide to edibles I shall start us off with a story that is all too common among so many edible users and me Gwen Gwen wants to try cannabis edibles for the first time and enjoy a healthy dose of THC with her friends tonight she's inedible and eagerly awaits the euphoric effects she waits and waits expecting to feel something at any moment a full hour goes by and still no feeling of a cannabis hi she waits and waits another full hour still nothing by now Gwen is growing impatient and suspects that the edibles she ate just aren't potent enough for her she eats another edible this one should do the trick no more than five minutes go by and suddenly Gwen is hit with a full-frontal TC sensation she is consumed too much and the effects are overwhelming her she spends the rest of what should have been a fun night feeling over intoxicated what went wrong here did the edibles do this - Gwen or an a momentary lapse of preparation did Gwen do this to herself to find out what happened here we need to delve into the rules of edible consumption and examine just how Gwen broke these rules rule 1 know your notes unlike alcohol cannabis THC is a very safe non-toxic substance with no known lethal dose however much like alcohol when somebody ingests more than they can handle there can be some undesirable side effects excess of THC beyond one's threshold can result in a temporary increase of anxiety agitation elevated heart rate or even vomiting one of the biggest mistakes when made right off the bat was eating a cannabis edible without inquiring what the dose was one thing to remember for your first time is to start low and slow with a more manageable 20 milligrams of THC eaten will give you higher than 20 milligrams of TC smoked so you may have to dial your usual dosage back of it most health experts recommend a conservative 5 to 10 milligrams of THC to start you off just because your party animal friend can down cannabis animals like their potato chips and function fine doesn't mean you should immediately follow suit understand that everybody has different limitations when it comes to metabolizing THC the process of knowing your dose is crucial to gauge how much TC you can consume comfortably without erling yourself into a sour experience know your limits stay within it rule to wait just wait there is a difference between smoking and eating cannabis when cannabis is smoked your lungs absorb the cannabis right away and you feel the high instantly but when you eat cannabis it is processed through the liver and may take anywhere between one to two hours to feel the full effects another one of Gwen's many errors was failing to recognize this waiting period she mistook the delayed process of the edible digestion as it being ineffective in doing so she overcompensated by doubling her dose unnecessarily now any negative sensations she feels off the first edible will compound two hours later when she fully digest the second one she what when should have done was relaxed sit back eat Cheetos and let the edible run its full course so if you take an edible and you were waiting to feel for its effects but they never seem to arrive don't worry just wait some more give your body the appropriate amount of time to fully digest the edible and then decide whether or not you want more THC in your system rule 3 know what to expect so you've taken the appropriate dosage that best suits you and you've exercised patience and waiting for the substance to run its course good job the effects kick in the process of liver digestion is much more thorough than lung intake and your body will therefore absorb more properties from the cannabis at best you may feel a very cozy and content feeling or experience a heightened libido and increase sensuality rule 4 there is a time and place for edibles especially if it's your first time try not to drink alcohol while on edibles whose can magnify the effects of THC potentially making the user too hot I also would not recommend driving working or operating machinery after you take them since they can't intoxicate you instead it may be wise to reserved an entire day set aside for them like maybe the weekend or on a date you can just sit back and relax these conditions are optimal because you can feel the effects of an edible six to eight hours after ingesting them so be ready for a long day of fun taking an edible before you go to bed is also an option since the effects can combat insomnia for many people just like baby pictures and recounting your last trip to Las Vegas there is a time and a place for edibles so I hope you learned a thing or two from our guy remember when trying any new substance do your research find out the ideal dose for you educate yourself on what you can expect to feel and know when the best time to consume them is with all that being said I wish you all the best of trips follow these rules and I can guarantee you a safe and fun edible experience every time thank you very much for watching and follow us like us subscribe to us for more news cannabis thank you", "2l3xFaS8vOY": "I'm gonna get stoned first thing in the morning hi welcome to and anything show and today I'm going to show you how to make homemade wheat chocolates that's right folks it's time that we bring leads to the forefront people I mean it's legal basically everywhere except for I love and I recently came into possession of a large quantity of marijuana so when that happens my favorite thing to do is make cannabutter 500 milligrams of THC right here folks making chocolate at home doesn't appear to be that difficult it's basically just a cacao or cocoa powder a sweetener butter and whatever else you feel like adding in this case we're gonna use some hemp arts you can make it in between like plastic bags so that's like a bark or even better you have ice cube trays or like these silicone molds silicone molds that was weird so I'm gonna put some in here and then I also have these awesome weed ice cube tray molds my boyfriend actually got them from his office as a Christmas party because they all think that he's like this huge pothead meanwhile the kid hardly ever smokes weed he just looks stoned half the time so if any of you are watching this I'm calling you out and you do not smoke pot you are not some pothead that everyone thinks you are and the only person that is using these is me I'm concerned slightly that they're brave when they pop out so we'll see what happens I'm gonna do a few in here and a few in here I'm also going to use this maple syrup which is from New Hampshire keeping it local I'm gonna use some vanilla extract with Jam and I just got a Mexico if you haven't seen those vlogs to check them out so this is local to Mexico and I'm gonna use this wheat butter that I made and the weed my frame grew and its local to Western man so sourcing maybe we are sourcing local we're sourcing regional or keeping them heavy in this kitchen the first thing we're gonna do 1/2 cup of coconut oil which is okay and next we're gonna add in 1/2 cup of cacao now with this recipe I'm gonna try to make 10 chocolates with it so I did have to do a bit of crazy calculations but each serving is gonna be about 50 milligrams of THC so this is not for beginners of edibles but I'm no beginner you know the reason I'm mixing everything in this mason jar making a [ __ ] mess already it's because I'm gonna use this immersion blender so we don't have lumps I thought mason jar be the easiest way of course they always thank you underestimated what a slob I am and now I'm annoyed [ __ ] [ __ ] my hair now [ __ ] is this how do people make like measuring stuff looks so easy I always make a mess they just pour out the powder into the half cup and just [ __ ] pours right now but when I do it the whole house needs to be cleaned we are coconut labor cacao now we need our half teaspoon of vanilla I'm really excited to use this stuff it's supposed to be very high quality I had to check my bag to bring him home and everything smells mmm smells like sunblock and vacation 1/2 teaspoon oh we're gonna need three tablespoons of maple syrup it's so good I guess that's it so now we blend much easier than whisking that's for damn sure they're never gonna get all this [ __ ] off the sides because I'm on every last drop hmm how I shouldn't be doing this probably gonna get pretty high by the way I cancelled my dentist appointment this morning I'm not like a counselor of things but we got snow last night it was for two fillings but like they're very small cavities and that's totally not an emergency and I really didn't like spending $200 so you know what I cancelled I felt guilty about it but then as soon as I did it I was like that was the best decision I made hopefully don't charge me okay so now comes the interesting part we want to weigh these out evilly because I want each chocolate to be the same amount of THC so I'm gonna use this 1/2 tablespoon and I'm gonna try to make 10 of these okay we're gonna do a few in the weed chocolate mole because I just think that will look really cool but it might prove to be too difficult and you might have to give it up let's see how it goes in here oh yeah much better - you're gonna add a little bit to each once they're all the same size so now I just want to get you know my place this is gonna be to hide right here well use my hands like I'm getting aggressive right now I'm definitely going after this one mmm just gotta get in there verified me I'm gonna get stoned first thing morning so I also have these hemp parts which you know hemp is also derived from the cannabis plant how'd you get these from Canada because as you know it's still illegal here no plant that like basically does everything let's make it illegal so I'm gonna sprinkle some of these into some of my chocolate just to add like a fun crunch a little bit not every single one but and it just uses chopstick to cut us the world I have into the chocolate a little bit yeah if these come out well the next ones I make I'll probably add like walnuts or something all right so all that's left is putting these in the fridge or the freezer and they're supposed to harden within an hour the next time you see them though it'll be like when I'm going to eat them for the night so I'm gonna keep them in there all during the day I have to do work now let's start my day so we'll see you guys later when it's time to test these bad boys out okay guys it is hours later the day has passed I have popped the chocolates out of the molds as predicted Lee we the mold it was mostly for aesthetic purposes because it really didn't pop out that well my definitely won't do it like that again but it froze them and this is what this one looks like it's very cute you know this is like very gimmicky but in reality in terms of like consistency and uniformity the silicone circular molds were the move anyway I just ate one of these scouts honor scared what is this scout the scouts honor I just ate one of these it's the Shocker oh I just any one of these Dan can attest to it I'm not gonna eat another one because that will be a hundred milligrams of THC and that's something that we're gonna save for another day by another day I mean tomorrow I'm gonna store these in the freezer I think they'll heat for like at least a month they won't be around that long but I love it I'm so proud of myself what an easy way to make weed chocolates at home and a lot more affordable than buying them at the stores now you can buy them in the stores here anyway you have to be on your deathbed one of these days anyway thank you for watching this episode of add anything show and I will see you next time goodbye Nana you don't want these okay if you had like pointing up but I can't see anything [ __ ] meatball go [ __ ] yourself okay guys", "mAZXWAuWp6E": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make nerd ropes here's what you're going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "Zeo7fw3QtNA": "today me and Amy are gonna try this Klondike caramel bar the candy this is new there's four pieces in here so I won't be bit on no just four well I mean I can't give me the knocking you might need a couple I use the knife just to cut it open we got this Ferguson at the Dollar General Store the doll general store for a dollar there for one entire package is 180 calories which is actually not off the back for Pandey we've done a video in the past we tried the mint the Klondike mint and it was delicious it was very good and you remember Wendy cut it up and it was it was really really good yeah you get four of these four individual little balls so why don't you see what it looks like inside oh it's a good solid caramel - it's not that's not a it's not squishy it's it's firm pretty good mm-hmm he reminds me of the caramel squares yes I don't really taste the chocolate loft I hope but no but the caramel is very good cause I'm really really good yeah like that I think I would like another half just make sure oh this is to make sure it tastes like caramel just yeah that's the only reason you can actually suck almost for a long time good we're chewing them it does taste like I was a little caramel baking squares the chocolate really don't taste a lot but I bet if he didn't have talked about he would notice a difference that makes sense yeah it doesn't like staying now but I think you would notice the difference but it didn't have the chocolate it's very good and even a dollar is a little bit more expensive you know then than a candy bar at the counter though you see those are about a dollar I know when we went we we got a good deal I think it the check out they had Twix bars you bought you buy one going free and that so it ended up being like 85 cents for both of them so this is one candy bar for a guy and I guess that's not buy it because we were in CVS after that there were charged like at all or 18 or so dollars not bad but you do you only get you know for these little pieces so I would - or suck on them make them mine so longer but they're good if you've never had and I was tried and the mint that we had was really good to my preference as far as the Klondike goes between this caramel and the mint I would choose the meth yeah and that was good and you could cut those in the fourth - and get really small pieces I would just rather have a roll over honestly yeah well I was gonna have a caramel chocolate I would rather have a Rolo because you really taste like chocolate and caramel this is good though right so

unknowingly handed out to more than 60 families at a food bank at the First Baptist Church in Roy this morning the church partners with the Utah Food Bank Fox 13 Sydney Glenn is in Roy tonight Sydney what are police saying about this well let's ask them ourselves right now I am live with sergeant Gwen and they are responding right the second you can see all of the officers behind me talk to me about the latest several children accidentally ingested this candy today yes a little after 3 o'clock this afternoon we were notified that a five year old girl was in the hospital for a THC overdose and we learned that the candy she ingested was provided to them through a Food Bank donation center here in Roy and so what you're seeing now was our officers are actively reaching out I believe it's 72 different families to make contact with them to ensure that we can recover as much as we can make sure those children who have ingested are seeking medical attention so you said to me earlier five children and told so far you have confirmed have ingested there's two of them in the hospital how successful have you been in reaching out to those families so we're looking at reaching out to 72 families and I think so far we've contacted I believe it's 44 families and we haven't been notified of any new victims probably within the last couple of hours let's talk about this huge response that you have right now for something that has never happened here before it's never happened here before and I can say probably for the first time in my career here we've actually called out half the department for an incident such as this you know and it's just a mistake and this is what it turns into you guys learned so far well we've learned so far that we need to be able to respond to these with haste to make sure that no other children are injured or two maybe notify those who aren't aware of what's in their donation that they need to be looking through them probably more carefully to ensure that this doesn't continue and we unfortunately have a bunch of volunteers who are trying to do a good thing and unfortunately this is what a yeah such an unfortunate situation I also spoke with the Utah Food Bank earlier today the CEO says she's just absolutely horrified about what happened the president and CEO of the Utah Food Bank said they were absolutely horrified that this product went out she went on to say she can easily see how volunteers would not have known what to look for a spokesperson for the agency said the THC candy donation came through a bulk commercial donation the CEO of the Utah Food Bank expressed her apologies and said they are changing their procedures to make sure this never happens again so if you are one of those people that did get that THC infused

"OXMDHHWoKDM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you how to make infused oreos this recipe is so simple so easy and you can make as little as you want you can even just make like one or two and they have more frosting in the end so extra frosting definitely better [Music] here's what you're going to need some oreos i chose double stuff because i like extra frosting infused coconut oil or butter and icing sugar your first step is to take your desired amount of oreos open them up and then separate the cookies from the cream and just put the cream into a bowl then you can add in some melted infused coconut oil or butter and just add that to your oreo cream in the bowl and mix it all together the amount you use is up to you i wouldn't use any more than the same amount of oreo filling that you have because i think it might affect the taste a bit more but you can play around and see what you like best now in order to keep the texture what we're used to in an oreo cookie we're going to need to add some icing sugar so i'm just putting a few spoonfuls in there until i get a nicer thicker consistency if you're having trouble getting it to mix properly just throw it in the microwave for uh 20-ish seconds which is what i did here and then i'm just mixing it all again until it's super smooth and you can taste it and see how you like it you can add more icing sugar more butter more coconut oil more of the original oreo filling it's whatever you feel tastes best now this frosting is ready to either be dipped into or put directly back onto the oreos or just eat it in the bowl um but i'm going to be piping onto my oreos so i'm just putting it into this little piping bag but you could also use a knife or just a spoon and do it directly on there you can see the frosting drips out of my bag a bit because it is too warm so i throw it in the fridge for a little bit so it's a little bit thicker when i'm putting it onto my oreos it's been in the fridge for about 10 minutes and now i am going to pipe the frosting onto each oreo and then you can put the other cookie wafer on top and press them together to be little oreo sandwiches i put them in the fridge for a couple more minutes and then they are ready to eat all right now that they're done let's give them a try [Music] very good you can taste coconut oil a little bit so maybe using butter would have been a little better but they're very good thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe

hitting my little uh my extreme cubing dad my weed man came through the other day I want to say you sailor sunday driver I'm not 100% sure but the shade is bomb and any other boy with a little ounce of shape for Christmas so that's dope what kind of lead man gives you Christmas yes what kind of nanos Matt he's [ __ ] right here I ain't gonna front they probably the dopest they're probably the dopest edibles in my opinion that I've had that's on the market that I've had sorry he's gonna need no booze on the market I'm saying it was on the market that's I've had okay so I really like them it's a hundred milligrams and the whole thing and it's five milligrams each dummy now a lot of [ __ ] be like oh 100 milligrams etting she got it had thousand milligrams if you got a thousand [ __ ] from the [ __ ] shop it probably wasn't a thousand milligrams I don't give a [ __ ] what you say or what you think it probably was not a thousand milligrams now some people can't take that [ __ ] don't get me wrong but most people can't because I've had a lot of people that has say a hundred that ain't [ __ ] I ain't got I'd do a thousand I'd do 500 and then they'll take like 10 or 15 of a real actual tested gummy and number uh gonna be [ __ ] up so I don't want to hear that [ __ ] so you know but don't get me wrong some people's tolerance is stronger than that [ __ ] you know cuz I also know that because my tolerance is like probably 40 54 where I like my high to be and if I wanted I could go 60 70 and still be like oh I wouldn't like out there but I could see people being over 100 but my point is you give them up like as a try on the dole singing it yo [ __ ] is to hide I think you need to take a month like a break if your tolerance is too goddamn much so anyway in Tunisia's ah let's see you got twenty gummies in here so I can say it's 100 milligrams one gummy is a serving and so you're looking at 23 servings in this [ __ ] no I'm sorry so many free calories per gummy okay when you're looking at the fat to zero fats about six grams of sugar and I mean six rounds of carbs and four grams of sugar so if you're on a keto diet this definitely is not the one for you and if you are vegan this is not for you or vegetarian this is not for you and the reason for that is because this does have gelatin in it which is weird though because the main ingredient is going to be agar but then they put gelatin in it so you could have just stopped with the agar instead of putting the gelatin in it and this is why I say this for companies that'll do this I give you when I come into the dispensary and they'll ask hey do you have any vegan gummies right that's understandable I've never remember you might have had a [ __ ] come in and say do you have non vegan gummies even make sense so the average person I'm talking probably 95 plus percent of people do not know the difference between a vegan gummy and when it comes to the taste so if I was a company I would just make all my [ __ ] vegan because it don't matter who will eat it because now it can get to anybody because no one's looking for the gelatin the market is not looking for the gelatin so I would just change that up if I was you [ __ ] because they have some that are vegan and those are good and there's no difference in the taste so to me they might as well just do all of them as vegan so I don't know why they only do a couple of women beginning some of them not but that's that so the other dope thing with this company is that they do them in sativa indica and hybrid so I like that because now you can get a little specific with your filling and your effects of [ __ ] and some companies stick to just doing this shit's hybrid which i think is it I think it makes sense because you know if the person walks up and that's the only gummy there some people would not [ __ ] with it if it's in the car and not [ __ ] wouldn't fit sativa but if it's hybrid they're like all right let's go [ __ ] it let me get it so I see the positives of that however the ones who are able to beast like specific admission I see there should fly off the shelves way quicker then a hybrid ones so this one right here is a cran a crammed pomegranate punch weird [ __ ] I don't know but it did taste good and the other cool thing with this is that it's enhanced nano molecular technology that they put in here in gummies and what man no molecular means whoa I don't even understand how that makes it react faster because it makes it react faster but what that means is that's just like a way of like I guess you could say measuring like how the speed of your molecules changing inside of your body so I think what's happening here is that they've sped up the process somehow of making the molecules in your body change for you to feel that humming um it's scented at two hour waiting game these [ __ ] is like probably 20-30 minutes if that like I got to give it to a one what was it last weekend for some reason I couldn't sleep welcome to 1:30 was up like a [ __ ] and I had to go rock climbing at like 10 o'clock or so I was tired as [ __ ] didn't want to go because I hadn't had any sleep whatsoever so I took ten milligrams of this [ __ ] and this [ __ ] was like a six hour energy drink like it was dope it really worked there was no crash I was like goddamn that [ __ ] is pretty bomb and so I like that versus that two hours you don't know when is gonna kick in type of filling cuz I've had that [ __ ] happen before once and some edibles cup but god I took the [ __ ] because it took so long for dumb [ __ ] to kick in I'm sitting there and I'm like mm-hmm hey y'all see that leprechaun run by look how things are turning out of nowhere you forgot you took some [ __ ] so uh I like these because they react a lot quicker so I definitely say give these shits a try now let me show you what they look like they like in little coin shapes and they are gluten free for all you gluten-free [ __ ] out there so it's a little sugar sprinkles on top of it mm-hmm so I'm fine and taste of them are really good no no she was bomb man actually there's really really good so it says that the candies Awards I never saw this really the winner most accurate formulated edible I guess that you mean it's pretty consistent and what they're doing in it I guess it's on mark of what is supposed to but yeah I got a really say my Anisha it's a pretty dope and another thing is some people don't like it we on 5 milligrams per they like oh how come I can't get nothing stronger it's still a hundred milligrams in the package whether I gave you 10 10 milligrams or 25 milligrams it's still the same [ __ ] amount and I personally like when they can chop it down like that because first of all some of these gummies are just good goddammit and I like that [ __ ] so I like to be able to eat more than one and that's one thing the other thing is you have more control over your dosing so let's say you want to go 25 instead of going 20 or 30 like 20 is not enough but 30 is too much so you just want to be at 25 I ain't the one for biting the [ __ ] in half and then putting that [ __ ] back you got me [ __ ] up I don't think that smart I don't think that's a sanitary I think this is like a nasty bout [ __ ] you put that [ __ ] back into the bag with the rest of my fingers now you'll slime it and touch the other ones he you nasty so for me I like to go put five milligrams and so I can like micro dose my [ __ ] and I can have more than one I will say this does give you a little bit of after cannabis he tastes but who gives a [ __ ] it's [ __ ] candidates like I hate when people be whining over to flavor like my Adeline fat and in my mind I'm like I would like to taste the vodka but I'll still take a shot I know you know like oh I just love that case well you say you like the taste of survive that is because it was smoother than the dog [ __ ] you started on back in the day so get the [ __ ] out here so you don't get a little cannabis taste just you know manna lemon woman up and grab you chronic leaves and [ __ ] take the tents guys damn it but even with that being said it's really just a good good gummy but you do get a little bit aftertaste a little bit weak but anyway so definitely I say [ __ ] these if you find these [ __ ] I say get them I'm gonna ask the the company when I see them why they don't just do it all it just you know Eggar and just make them all plant based versus doing the gelatin I say this ain't no like oh go on and be vegan and about that this is literally just to me from a company standpoint it'd be like if I was only in the company I would just make it where I know everybody can get it but I wouldn't even promote them as being safe vegan I would just put them out on the shelf and let them be what they are so that would be me if I was the one doing it but anyway that's the end of this video I hope you guys enjoyed it like I say have you seen these [ __ ] make sure you get them and before you get out of here make sure you subscribe and hit that peace you can get that [ __ ] notification alright and go follow me over on Instagram so anyway I'm out of this [ __ ] y'all keep the love going y'all love each other y'all keep the peace going and be peaceful too each other and I would see our [ __ ] a [ __ ] slated piece the one I want to hit the sequel we in the jungle smokin we in a jungle smokin", "pUWaZ_wxhhg": "hello freak [ __ ] that's amazing you know what's really incredible is that uh people are using psilocybin these days in what they call micro dosing taking very small doses and seeing these profound benefits ya know one of the things that I'm aware of his kick boxers are using it and kick boxers are using it a good buddy mind is using it says that he can see things happen before they happen like it was almost like he's reading people's minds when they're about to do something even on micro tosyl yeah that's very interesting in an intense environment of sparring and in the the intense physical kinetic interaction of kickboxing as any seeing what people are going to do before they do it in a way that he's never able to do quote-unquote on the natch right no I'm not surprised at all I mean and why are you surprised like what do you think is happening because I think that these things let you step out of your box a little bit they let you step out of your usual reference frame and notice things going on in the environment that again this gating mechanism we were talking about were programmed to filter stuff out psychedelics temporarily disrupt that they let the background come forward and you notice things about the environment that we're that normally you would suppress because they're not relevant to immediate survival I don't know if you've read some of the work by Simon Powell he wrote the psilocybin solution he writes very intelligently about suicide them in this latest book the magic mushroom Explorer he talks about how psilocybin is a lens essentially you can think of it as a lens through which you can look at the world you can look at natural phenomena and you will notice things about that those phenomena that you normally would overlook because we're programmed to do it so in a sense he talks about how psilocybin is a scientific instrument you know it's a lens through which you can look at the world and see aspects so that are always there but you've never noticed them before because we're programmed not to for example you know Kary Mullis is famous because his discoveries in molecular biology he attributes to his insights about molecular processes that he got from LSD that he could get down with the molecules as he put it and see how all this is working and obviously he invented a polymerase chain reaction which he got the Nobel Prize for so it's not like this is a delusion it's a real thing that he was able to notice that no one else you know what I'm saying he was able to put himself in a place where he could notice these phenomena and I think I think that's really true if you if you go to take a walk in the forest with an indigenous person you know who in some ways is in this less of this sensory gating in a more open place all the time they will notice things about the environment you know that you are completely oblivious to until they point it out you know and then that's it yes I never noticed the leafcutter ants are behaving this way or these different things their sensory sort of experience of a environment like the forest is very different than ours you know because we're used to we're just not out in nature the same way and I daresay I think one of the things that in some ways inserts a barrier between us is literacy you know we're all literate right and we like being literate it's good that we're literate but in order to be literate you have to have this separation between the self and the external environments you know you have to pick up a book and read it I am here I'm the point of view here's the book you know so that creates that relationship and you sacrifice you focus on one particular sensory modality and you sacrifice all the other input that is coming in I don't know if I make it say no yes absolutely but but that's that's what these substances can do they can essentially reverse this background foreground relationship that we're so used to suddenly what's right in front of you is not so important and you can pay attention to the things in the background that you're normally you're programmed to suppress and ignore because you know you have to be ready for the saber-tooth Tiger to come across you know over the mountain or whatever you know what I'm saying but it's good in that sense they teach different ways of perception you know and I think that's a very useful thing to learn you know in business people call these psychedelics plant teachers and they call them teachers for a reason you know much of the what you experience comes directly from the experience but much of it also comes from your change perception and suddenly realize there's a different way to be in the world there's a different way to perceive what you experience that normally you don't you know were programmed to filter out I don't know if you've ever read or had Steven Buhner on your show now he writes very intelligently about this stuff he's written a book called plant intelligence and the imaginal realm and it's all about this you know this essentially what his rap is you can learn this you know you can learn this way of perceiving whether you do it with psychedelics or not you can actually learn it and it's it's an interesting it's a better way to relate to nature or more an alternative way to relate to nature in any way I feel like we have these pre assumed definitions of things that we rely upon instead of seeing things what they really are and you kind of yeah you box them up and you package them and you go oh well there's a car there's a sand then one day you look at the car and you go that's a box that has a controlled explosion encased in iron that rolls on rock higher that's exactly what we're talking about all right there's a different way to look at things if you step out of the box and yes it is all those things and it's also a car and it's if you did that all the time you'd never get anything done that's right that's right [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "J5Nu589uIAw": "what's up everybody my name is Sarah feet and welcome to the channel the haze we're gonna be reviewing the very famous very well-known and very beloved got me edible cushy punch now this is a California brand this is the sativa formula and it is absolutely fantastic so there's a few different types of products such as you punch makes the gummies I believe are their main and their original I know now they have like vaporizers they have CTD products things like that but the cushy punch are very well known for their gummies now these guys come in a hundred milligrams they also have a 200 milligram call to TKO and these guys come in these awesome little packet they're easy to break apart and each of these little squares is ten milligrams so you can dose however much that you would need personally now they are pretty strong I don't know exactly how they're made so they are made with organic sugar and feature no artificial coloring is all made with natural coloring so if that's something that concerns you if you have allergy problems and you can do artificial coloring these guys are a great option so let's talk about flavor these guys are really nice they're sweet but you do get a strong kind of cannabis oil to smell to them so if you pull them out in public if someone partakes or it is kind of in the know-how of how cannabis smells a little recognize this then they will smell it now if you're trying to see what kind of high this is this is the sativa one and for me these guys will keep me well they don't make me drowsy you can be very creative on them yeah I built this Depot these guys are good I could go together in a pinch because you will find out my most places now if you're talking prices they kind of range up and down I've seen these guys as low as $10 and S&M as high as $20 I don't really know if there's just a lot of places that are able to up the prices because it is wanted so bad if you can find a good deal on them they're very much worth it if it's the people are signing for 20 bucks and if you have to get it but it's a bit bit overpriced for these guys all in all if you are someone who travels a lot these guys aren't perfect companions they're small to fit in your pocket if you go to the movies a lot these are great as well so that is my little small review for the fam the cushy punch well there you go guys thank you so much for taking the time and watching this review again my name is Sarah B welcome to the haze and I will see you next time oh also please follow us on Instagram the haze anyway guys thank you so much for watching I hope to see you next time and shout", "81YRgf39vtY": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it Sheboygan and today we're coming in with the shorter story but nevertheless a [ __ ] bang or hope you guys enjoy drop a like if you do also I do want to mention real quick if you guys haven't subscribed to my second channel my smoking slash gaming channel be sure to do that it'll be linked in the top of the description don't forget to drop a like if you enjoy let's dive right into it so either way eating a thousand milligrams of THC now I don't recommend anyone do this you know that's one thing that I wanna I want to make very clear and the reason that I was able to do this and to an extent handle it I mean I passed the [ __ ] out but to an extent handle it is because I smoke and have smoked a lot of marijuana and done a lot of different things with THC in my life and large quantities so you know I I'm kind of I don't know for some reason edibles just never really get me like that you know like I can't just eat a you know bag of edibles and just get high it doesn't work for some reason with me and I I mean it used to but as I you know kind of progressed and started smoking more and more you know and this happened fairly recently and you know as I started smoking more and more and just getting older and becoming more of like a veteran smoker if you if you could say I guess you know edibles just stopped having an effect on me for some reason it was mainly just dabs and bud that would get me I which I'm ok with and you know it still is that way but you know either way I decided you know can I I wanted to test if I could really get higher or not off edibles like truly baked like how I used to get off the edibles you know I was curious because the past couple times before this that I'd eaten edibles I didn't really get very high at all I had to combine it with you know a couple blunts or something to really get where I wanted to be so you know I had a couple bags I had three bags in total of these edibles that were I think they were I know they were medical they were like actually professionally made not like some homemade brownies or anything they were these little uh these gummies and they were called like terrible's I think I think I've made a video about these before but it was a different story but these edibles were the same edibles in that video so you guys remember that shout-out to you that's an old video I think but either way these things have 400 milligrams a bag so I figured you know my original plan was I'm just gonna eat two bags and then I was like well I kind of just want to get to the 1000 because that's a cool number you know and like I'd been sitting on these bags for a little while I was originally planning to sell a couple of them but I figured [ __ ] it I might as well not you know I kind of like these like they not only you know did they have THC in them and quite a lot but they were actually pretty tasty like there were some good edibles and I've had some edibles that did not taste too good but these are pretty flames you can't really tell that there's Whedon them like if I just put these in a bag I don't think you could tell they're edibles by eating them until you get high as [ __ ] but either way you know I decided I'm gonna eat like two and a half bags and go for that 1000 so off I went you know I looked at the back the dosage was like there was like 20 pieces in each bag so I was like alright I got to eat 50 of these [ __ ] so I literally poured out two bags onto a plate and then I like pulled out ten little like gummy things out of the other bag and I was just like alright I'm digging in so yeah I went pretty ham on it you know I I was on an empty stomach I hadn't eaten and you know I found up and probably a solid like fifteen ten minutes even you know I mean I really I went for it man I went for it man I'll tell you right now and you know at first I didn't really know what to expect you know I this was by far the most I'd ever eaten in terms of edibles and I wasn't really sure what to expect because I figured in my head like that can't be that like insane you know like I'm probably gonna be kind of stone but I don't think I'm gonna be super [ __ ] up but edibles are very different than just smoking a ton of weed edibles you know they're there in my eyes a silent killer they sneak up on you and just [ __ ] you they just do your dirt and let me tell you I was sitting on my couch and I was playing some games I had my Nintendo switch hooked up to the TV it was Boston and let me tell you I was playing tomorrow cart and it just happened man you know I was I got done with a couple races and I didn't really like notice when it hit me but it was very quick you know I got up to grab something to drink and I felt like how do I describe it I felt like those like balloon people out front of the car dealerships those like Wiggly like inflatable tube guys with the flailing arms you know the the family guy like skit they did on that I felt like one of those dudes I felt very very noodley I felt very wobbly and I was I was you know I wasn't really a fan of it but either way I made it up the stairs grab something to drink went back downstairs and just slammed into the couch just absolutely collapsed into the couch I was never so happy to sit back down ever in my life and have an ice-cold water it was so happy it was just a truly a cherished moment a moment of pure euphoria if you will but either way you know I sat back down and I was loving this [ __ ] let me tell ya I was just skirting on Mario Kart playing like [ __ ] I don't think I want any races I played like probably five or six races in a row and I think I came in no higher than fifth in any of them but nevertheless I sure as hell was having fun because let me tell you guys if you if you have a switch you know but if you don't have a switch playing online on Mario Kart is scary because the Japanese guys are really good like the [ __ ] Japanese guys are so good like they don't play but either way you know back on topic so I'm just getting smoked by the Japs dude it's like [ __ ] Pearl Harbor all over again it's terrible and you know I'm eventually I tap out you know I go to play some other games I end up playing some Xenoblade gas game super vague I love the switch by the way this is not sponsored but the switch is a great console it's so convenient so convenient but either way you know I'm chilling and you know I I don't really like I'm not doing anything that takes too much thought so I'm not really like realizing how high I am but eventually as playing games maybe like an hour and a half into it and I hop on my computer you know where I always am the bool spot and you know I'm just playing some games on discord with some people and I'm just something very loud just bangs outside of my house am I getting robbed all right well if I get robbed that would be kind of late for the commentary but either way back on topic hopefully not um you know I was on discord with some buddies playing some games and I I realized as I was playing with them that like nothing I was saying was really coherent whatsoever like I was like I mean I was I was able to talk and conversate but like I was just talking like an idiot pretty slowly and everything I said was just dumb you know like I I just I knew inside that I was just being an idiot but I just couldn't control myself if that makes sense you know I was just being a [ __ ] and I couldn't handle it but either way yeah I was like all right you know I have to plan maybe like two or three games to counter-strike I was like all right I'm going to bed [ __ ] this like I got to lay down or something you know I was slumped because as I was progressing through these games you know counter-strike games are long I played like 2 or 3 games and they're probably like 30 minutes a game you know 30 to 40 so long games so you know after like two and a half hours into my high I was slumped you know and it wasn't like this SuperDuper baked like whoa man kind of thing it was just like the entire thing was very very passive it was like I just I was just chilling you know like that's honestly the best way to put it you know it was a really nice body high you know very noodley just [ __ ] didn't feel like I had any bones you know I just kind of felt like a I don't know dude what doesn't have bones do frogs have bones frogs have bones but not very strong one so I'm gonna say I felt like a frog and it was just some wild [ __ ] it was a fun time but either way hope you guys did enjoy this video a little short story today also on the second channel the smoking slash gaming channel the videos on there are more you know I put a lot more effort into the production of them you know it's a lot more editing a lot more work so it's gonna take longer to get uploads on that channel so please do be understanding impatient with that but yeah that's all I got to say either way thanks for watching hope you enjoyed it see you guys next time peace", "DoRyjd2zKwY": "what's good bass draw militia bass draw keys here i'm your friendly neighborhood negro and welcome to another episode of good eats in today's video guys we got a highly requested video for you today we're going to do our own homemade nerd ropes and you know that they're goodies for 20 style so without any further ado let's go ahead and get into it let's do [Music] way all right guys and real quickly here i do want to invite everybody please check out our membership program that we just started here on the channel it really does help with making all these videos also if you're interested in supporting off of youtube make sure you check out our patreon page it's going to be linked in the description you get a lot of things for your pledges every month and it really does help make these videos so guys please if you can support us right here on the on the youtube membership program or on patreon now let's go ahead and get into this video here we go all right guys so let's go ahead and get into today's video today we're going to be doing our own homemade nerve ropes this video has been highly requested for quite some time so we're going to go ahead and make it happen today now there is an easy way to do it and there's a hard way to do it of course i'm going to show you the easy way to do it today if you guys want the like the harder way maybe we can do that at a later time but today i'm going to show you the easiest way to make your homemade nerd ropes so the first thing that we got to do is i'm going to show you what we need we're going to be using some is it haribo i don't know is it haribo hariba let's go haribo we're going to use haribo um gold bears this is what i was saying about the easy way and the hard way these are ways just to take these bears right here we're going to melt them down in the microwave that's the easiest way the hard way would be the harder way i was ashamed to be to go ahead and make our own gelatin just like you would do when we're making our gummy bears you can go and make your gelatin that way as well and do it but we're going to go ahead and just melt these down and do it the easy way and of course with nerd ropes you're going to need some nerds so i went to the store and i got some nerds so as you can see right here i have a baking sheet on the baking sheet i have some parchment paper what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take some aluminum foil and what we're gonna do is we're gonna actually make kind of like you can call it like a mold and that way we able to we'll be able to distribute our nerds and make our our nerd ropes the way that we want to make them all right but first what we got to do is we have to take some aluminum foil and we're actually going to make our mold you can say so that way we'll be able to distribute our nerds evenly let me show you what i mean you're going to take some aluminum foil we're going to make kind of like an accordion shape let me show you all right so you can see we have a piece of aluminum foil and we're going to do an accordion shape what i mean by that is you're going to hold it like this you're going to fold it like this and then we're going to [Music] hold it back like this we'll do that back and forth all right so you see we folded it back and forth now we just want to open it all right so that way you can you guys can see what i've done i've just made you can basically say like a w or m whatever that way we have places where we can actually put our nerds right we can put our nerds in here are you guys getting a good picture this way i don't think so let me raise up the camera and get a better angle for you guys but i don't think you're getting a good a good angle let me raise you guys up some there we go i think i made this a little bit too long i do believe i can fix that though there we go so i made him too long but i fixed that just by tearing off so now you can guys can see better what i'm talking about so what i'm proposing to do is [Music] now you see we have peaks and valleys in the valleys we're going to actually form our nerd ropes you see what i'm saying so what we're going to do is we're going to pour our nerve ropes in here right for the bottom layer and then what we're going to do is we're going to put these bears inside of this measuring cup and melt them down in the microwave at that point that's where we're going to medicate it now as far as how to medicate this you can use tincture you can use coconut oil it's up to you we're going to use some coconut oil today but if you got some tincture use that and as far as how much you want to use it's really based upon how strong do you want it i'm going to use two or three tablespoons of coconut oil for this but it's really up to you about how much do you want to medicate it if you're talking about how much thc you're putting in it that you know it just depends on how strong did you make your oil how strong did you make your tincture and then from that you can go ahead and you know put it in accordingly so let's go ahead and do the first part of this which is putting the nerds in here i'm gonna take a box open them i'm gonna start putting them in here i got seven boxes so hopefully that's enough [Music] if it's not oh no [Music] oh nerds all right [Music] and i said i'm going to try something on this last one what i want to do is i really want to take some spray and like spray it in here [Music] because as you can see i did these without any spray right here and so i'm wondering how how they're gonna be as far as sticking to the aluminum foil in the past when i've used things with aluminum foil and it's sticking it's been really hard to come off i'm just really trying to make sure they got an even coat so let me do that coconut oil cooking spray and i'm just going to [Music] and that's going to be our test to see if we should have sprayed it i just thought about it right now all right so look take some more of these nerds put them in here all right so we're pretty good on that i have four rows ready to do four ropes i bought a lot of nerds so i can now always do more batches so now what we got to do is we're going to take our bears right here we're going to put them in this measuring cup pyrex measuring cup put it in the microwave we're going to melt them down and then that's when we're going to take and our fused oil and medicate this up obviously if you don't want to medicate it just don't use the oil don't use any tincture if you want to make fantastic nerd ropes just like this that'll be just fine so yeah here we go all right so there's two cups in this bag we're going to use one cup right now like i said i'm doing this in batches so that way everything will work out the way we want it to so i'm going to take a cup of these gummy bears there's two cups in the bag we're going to take half of this and let's go ahead and put this in the microwave and melt this down and i'll show you what it looks like when it's finished this is two and a half minutes in the microwave and so you can see it's melted down now look at that so we're gonna do now that just melts it down we're going to take our coconut oil you can use tincture if you have tincture and like i said depends on how strong you want it i'm gonna do two tablespoons you know what i really you know what three tablespoons why not three tablespoons in there we're going to stir it up make sure you stir it up nice we're going to put this back in the microwave so we can warm this back up and keep it liquid once that happens and we take it out i'm going to put it in this squeeze bottle to make it easier to do the lines for the nerd ropes there's a lot of ways that you can do i've seen people pouring it cutting bags and that kind of stuff i think the easiest way to do is going to be with a one dollar squeeze bottle that you can get from the dollar store if you need a link for this i will put it in the description for you but yeah back in the microwave we go all right guys so we're out of the microwave now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take this and i'll pour it inside of here to make it easier [Music] so now we got this in here let's go ahead and do some lines that doesn't sound right let's put some lines in here so we can go ahead and medicate this go slow all right guys that's pretty hot so i'm going to use my magical butter glove in order to do it [Music] there we go very nice [Music] and this is going to be the easiest way for you to do it so you can control what you're doing what i like to do is just go down one time up one time and that'll be good enough [Music] it's like the easiest way to control what you're doing you can put exact strings in there perfect look at that look at that beautiful that's the way to do it without any of the waste and what's so great about it is in this

welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode we are not going to be reviewing a product instead we're going to be talking about news news and very sad news at that and that is that the edible Bonanza the edible crazy wonderful Wild West market in California is coming to an end as we know it January 1st I believe of 2018 the new regulations go into effect for both medicinal and recreational weed in the state of California and one of those major major changes coming to to the marijuana industry at large is headed headed straight for the edible industry in a really really really devastating way so what is changing one one thing makes sense and that's no more edibles that are shaped like kids candy that makes sense to me nothing you know no gummy shaped things no cartoon shaped things nothing with a cartoon mascot that'll make sense that all that all makes perfect sense to me and I'm totally ok with that but the far more devastating in the far more far-reaching consequences are gonna come in from the limits of THC henceforth each package each product can only be a hundred milligrams in total and can only have 10 milligrams of THC per serving so let me let's let's let's put that in perspective that means that you could only have a brownie can't even be a hundred milligrams it has to be cut up into ten squares of ten milligrams each and the whole thing can only be a hundred milligrams how they're gonna price these things I have no idea if they're going to be commensurate with the prices we see for 100 milligram edibles now or if they're just going to be more expensive what this does to the folks who really need those high you know folks with high high tolerances you know focuses with cancer diabetes terminal illnesses that rely on these high potency edibles for their pain and killing needs I don't know what they're gonna do it's again it's a it's a crippling blow to patients and it's equipping Bluett I assume to the industry they're gonna have to completely change the way that they operate here in California no company that I know of operates in that mode right now everybody has much more higher potency edibles and they're not divided into ten milligram parts in any way shape or form I'm just trying to think of the production and logistics work that's gonna have to go into these companies to change up their products and their formulas something like a kiva like how are they gonna break down their 180 milligrams chocalate bar and I take it back I have seen one company that's already seems to be on their way to figuring that out and that is kirova if you go to their website you can see where they now have many cookies and 100 milligram packages I assume they are coming out with this products just in preparation for the regulations but what everybody else is going to do that don't have the resources of say a you know a Korova to to shift like that to to completely change their production line the way they do everything III got to assume that's going to put them in a you know in dire financial straits so it's gonna be a big big change come January 1st and I still actually have lots and lots of questions about this so I don't know if first off everything I've read and I will provide links below I'll provide links in the description to everything I've read including the actual if I can find it the actual statute itself but right now I've seen on High Times and on Leafly and a couple other places summaries of the new regulations that are going to affect and these are definitely happening but I cannot find clear evidence on whether or not this is also going to affect medical market whether or not this is only going to affect for the recreational market or whether this is pan market and it's going to both recreational and and medicinal so I don't know I don't know if it takes what happens to all the old stock come January first if everything has to be tossed out or if there's a grace period i I have I have tons of questions left and if you are say a dispensary owner who is in the know if you're somebody who has any kind of knowledge of the cannabis law in California please hit me up I would love to talk to you on the show so we can clarify some of these laws you can email me at you can it mean weeks a tweets reviews.com or weeks reviews at gmail.com you can hit me up on twitter or facebook please get in touch with me again if you have any additional knowledge on this I would love to get in contact with you I feel terribly terribly for all of the patients that are gonna have to completely change their sort of regimen for for edibles I know a lot of patients already have their favorite edible that they you know dose themselves have everything perfectly set up to help them get you know escape their pain huh I'm I'm I'm bummed out myself um I'm not sure what what we're gonna do here a tweets we'll figure it out we'll still be reviewing edibles for sure and I'm sorry I've been away a lot recently been very busy but rest assured new reviews will be coming but as to what we're going to do January 1st we'll continue to review edibles but it's gonna have to be a change for us as well here at wheats so again guys just to reiterate come the beginning of the year the edible market that we know and love in California is going to a revocable II and in my opinion a revocable change for the worse come January 1st it's it's it's it's not going to be the this sort of great place that it was before I mean I of course it had problems the edible market like all markets had problems but I think these these new regulations are are an atrocity frankly and I hope I hope this state will we'll see the error of their ways rather quickly and and things can get back to normal but just wanted to give you guys a heads up and again if you know anybody or if you yourself know any of these laws anymore please hit me up I would love to talk to you and we can get this further clarified so guys that's going to do it for this episode here on wheats sorry for the bummer of the news hopefully things will change but for now that looks like it's the way it's going to be thank you so much for watching waits and we will see you on a future video peace", "QliaxMD6eJc": "hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at an edible before we get started if you like what you see drop a sub got a bunch of different videos like this but anyway this TKO mainly known for their black market dab carts I guess you would say they also make edibles this is the strawberry Nesquik there's a surprising amount of flavors for these normally a lot of edibles they just come in like one or two flavors but there's like a whole like a whole box of em there's a ton gluten free to start off for any of you uh non-gluten eaters there's all the nutritional facts says serving size is 1 square I could see that I ate three of them 3 little squares you'll see and 315 milligrams in total and there's nine squares so I think it's like 35 milligrams a square which I'm not I'm a lightweight I do not weigh a lot I am a very light boy so just three of these have me absolutely folded I'm sure if you're if you don't if you're not like a daily smoker then one or two of these would definitely do you good for the night take a look I like that how they have like this imprinted on him mmm I ate the one that had there was like a TKO logo on one of them I think but I am pleasantly surprised by these like cuz when I've seen these for like a year and I just never wanted to decide to pick one up but I did not expect very much to the TKO I'm not the biggest fan of their carts but the edibles are far superior than their carts in my opinion everyone tried this one flavor I definitely plan on trying more and this video does good I'll probably review the other flavors too I have another review upcoming the next one is planned and then after that I might get grabbed like a nerd rope or something do that or the Nerds rope bites if anyone has seen those and try them let me know what you think um I would definitely grab these definitely be careful because they are potent [Music] reliable tasty potent and yeah hope you guys have a good day peace out", "hqAwGzGWXyE": "hello and welcome to another episode of DOS tank review

straight-up tells tank review please", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what

"as marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

cool okay you're on the camera sorry tilting a little bit okay so we've got what is it an ounce in total i don't know man okay so yes i think we've got two ounces no one ounce but they're each half an ounce or they're each in amps i don't know whatever you spend 200 right yeah so it's half ounce yeah okay so technically together but we're splitting it uh we got the mystery mystery the mystery bag so we're gonna open one bag at a time we have this little secret we're gonna show you yes but i'm very very excited i know i first times never happened to i've never ever ever had one get delivered too nicely yeah it's really exciting just be careful oh i'm trying to be so careful okay sorry oh this is like clutch ultra okay okay here we go here we go okay so the first one yeah what's the bag for i don't know okay so the first one we have is pink cactus that i've read that that shit's apparently wicked and i got pj way blue dream way or wait blue jay waves or well actually technically it would be away fuji way because uh i've never heard of this strange before so i'm wondering about it but it's called headband or i think it's called head bang let's go ahead bang dude there's no it's not do not smoke if you're 18 years or older and you are not 18 years younger watching this video [ __ ] off yes but we're also gonna guess all right so these are the products okay but these are yes okay so we got 14 grams each oh i'm very excited to smoke this dude i'm very excited try this all right uh so we're going to pause it again no no we're going to show yourself all right but here's the thing we waiting for first ever edibles bag this is true first ever edibles bag that we've ever had on this channel so when we do these we will before and after we maybe yeah like i'm thinking maybe we'll probably do it like you take them now and then you could just [ __ ] oh my god this is gonna get oh no okay it's only 100 milligrams but let's do it let's do it oh my god this is absolutely [ __ ] horrifying because i've never done 100 milligrams you don't know or not i don't feel like that's too much ready ready oh no no no hold on i just split one half how do you do that you can't break them they're hard they're going to shatter is a force oh get a knife no get in split now okay i'm just trying to figure this out to see if this is like to put us on our ass or if we should each take one solid thing because it's hard to explain where my tolerance is it's like one minute it's really really [ __ ] high and then the message is really [ __ ] loud [Music] on the market will not exceed 100 milligrams strong [ __ ] then these edibles are to be used only got it these edibles are only to be used by experienced consumers who have a high tolerance for thc well that's us okay so all right we got some big pieces of cheese you want to take uh i'm going to take these two small pieces because these pieces hey okay cheers boys and girls shoes i'm so scared but that's really good though i like it basically a lot of the candy so here's the deal i don't know like how many there's two more left right okay so what we're going to do is we're going to talk about the same price no the [ __ ] right there nope you can't go watch this you know what we're i don't care what we're going to do is if these aren't too too strong by the time that we're done with them then we're just going to take one and then we're going to like because we're going to record two different things no idea it's in italy guy you got to wait like we'll go upstairs no okay let's book some of this one do you think we're going to get too [ __ ] up like i said we're sucking on this and it's like going in your brain more it's good though like you can definitely taste the thc in it but not much like it's actually really good it's definitely something that you eat more often so this is before we'll record after seeing well okay technically this is actually after two because we joints two joints that waiting for those guys um oh um [Music] delivery um yes we'll just deliver oh okay so shout out to plus plus delivery you guys actually deliver some really cool stuff quality delivery quad a delivery sorry quad a delivery we are really really excited to try our products we love these things um these edibles thank you very much for throwing those in and yeah do not medicate in parking lots or near public buildings do not redistribute your medical cannabis do not under any or all circumstances operate a motor vehicle i think we're not really we're not riding bikes the problem with having two joints before you have a candy is you start to drip out when you get really high like this ever no dude well no i just don't want to start tripping out that's the problem i'm cool watching a movie so you won't trip out hmm pushes asleep here's the deal when i'm this stone i don't know if it's even a smart idea to watch a horror movie or even stone right now dude i'm a little bit stoned like little jordan's got me buzzed i want a fish i'm gonna have another drink i'll show you one have some some of these try this out this candy's weird it's a hard candy but it's almost malleable in a way like because i had two pieces i can stick them into one yeah i thought no reason sorry we heard a noise yeah we heard like i thought somebody's at the front door something so i'm like wait what so um i have these products which one are you most excited to try oh [ __ ] oh whatever okay actually to be honest i read about pink guys sponsor us if you guys sponsor us we will promote the hell out of you guys this is like a gummy bear now a really really chewy gummy bear it's not even chewy for me it's still like squishy it's so hard i'm still like still sucking on it i'm really enjoying it i remember the last time i had um an edible it was i had like six sweet cookies i had a [ __ ] brownie the last time i was like this [ __ ] big ain't the whole thing i'm so dumb oh [ __ ] by the way uh just so you guys have an idea it's so we roughly finished it i finished my candy around five o'clock so from i think maybe five thirty to five six ish is probably one we'll check back just to be like half an hour after and then an hour after and be like yeah um so just um yeah okay so top shelf edibles i don't know if it's readable yeah it's readable okay and then good stuff their candies are actually very good right but here's what we're gonna do we're gonna wait for an hour to see how we feel and then if it's like i'm not sure that we got it enough that's the thing are they each a hundred milligrams bro i'm killing something uh it's impossible it's like half an hour but it's been like two minutes yeah i know it's it's it's a weird mind [ __ ] because you're like oh bro i'm like i'm feeling but it takes like an hour today oh i see that in my squishy now yeah once you suck on it i think i got a rapture gets stuck in your teeth it's a good thing that my teeth can't feel that because if my teeth could feel the higher i would get extremely [ __ ] dope like my teeth would get extremely high right now it's stuck in my tooth oh [ __ ] oh watch my teeth going on so that's one thing that i don't like about it what they got really really really sucked my two teeth well i feel like what do you expect though that's why you don't stick to your teeth you stick it in your like the center i didn't mean to stick to my feet i tried crunching my teeth and just got stuck well yeah okay i guess technically so um i'm gonna go outside and feel yeah i think i'm gonna smoke some of this yeah i think um pause this real quick and go outside yes let's pause it and then hey guys so uh currently he's in the washroom so we are gonna take this grinder this is my grinder that i use gotta add uh dollar store convenience bouncing for my house great fantastic place great guys great management anyways that's where i get all my stuff from you guys should sponsor us i go love you to go to your store all the time anyway so what we're going to do is we're going to grind up some of this and i'm going to use some of these to smoke it so here we go i don't even care to suck down suck my tooth right now ah i don't even care and i'm so let's stay there all right so i'm gonna talk about whatever's in here is gonna get dumped out from the side i'm looking oh okay so um i was using the washroom and the light was flipping and it was tripping me the [ __ ] out because i like you know how i just changed that no i was just flipping but anyways it was trippy because i started tripping

that but okay all right melissa said um she said she thinks she thinks that people are getting the hobit any social favor because they think kobe is coming out of their ass except malcolm is going to get in through their ass or out through their ass no offense but as far as dudes that's hands down the stupidest thing i've ever [ __ ] heard coming out of the ass up there people abuse how do you think about this stuff it's good hey guys if you're 18 or older and you're from our tech talk i but again if you're 18 and under [ __ ] off and to be honest here's the deal i don't like kids like they're [ __ ] stupid i can't stand kids that are like 18 and under a lot of the reason is because they're just like you you look back and you're like my god i was like that as a kid holy crap no wonder people didn't like me [ __ ] yeah technically i wasn't a kid that was like that because i wasn't a [ __ ] snowflake so that wasn't even a fair statement to myself have you discovered yet what you want to do for your talk video no i mean i want to make a rank problem about that is people do it and they just pull it off like it was [ __ ] easy for me i have so many different things i want to

have to wait for the half an hour an hour that's true yeah yes what time is it now because i'm not feeling [ __ ] if it's last like i can't i can't unpause it let's [ __ ] bye", "fZBd9aWqQrw": "hey guys what's going on Sam Bosworth here this is my first video back in a while but I'm feeling motivated and I\nwant to talk about disability today so my goal this video is to talk about why\nI take tramadol so I'll break down my disability and the things it\nspecifically helps me with I want to talk about the pros and cons so I'll\ntalk about all the things it helps me with in my daily life and the things I\nwant to do and how it helps me do them and I'll also talk about the cons and\nthe side-effects of which there is quite a few for tramadol and any opiate\nmedication obviously I'm not going to be talking a lot about the opioid epidemic\nI just want to say before I start that stopping everybody taking opioids will\nseriously harm chronic pain patients who for some, opiate medication is the only\nthing that helps an I, thus far, am also one of those people anyway enough\nof the controversies let's get into it so first of all I want to talk about why\nI take it. If you've watched my channel before you'll know I have a disability\nand chronic pain I have charcot-marie-tooth disease which\nis nothing to do with teeth its a form of peripheral neuropathy so you know it\naffects my feet and my hands foremost, it means my feet instead of being flat like\nthis are really on their sides. I have incredibly high arches making it very\npainful for me to walk I also have kyphosis of the spine which has pretty\nmuch been attributed to my CMT and that is probably the most painful aspect of\nit because while I can use a wheelchair and crutches, which I do when I go out\nthe back pain is immense when I'm sitting even now Ias I'm talking to you\nI'm on my medication, I'm wearing a heat pad but it's still is quite painful so\nthose are my two main things I also have chronic fatigue, my tramadol doesn't\nreally help with that as such. It can help me sleep sometimes and in that it\nnumbs the pain of my back but obviously chronic fatigue, if you know what that is it\nmeans you get incredibly tired very easily don't have a lot of energy doing\nyou know one hour activity even just going to the store or to the shops or\nwhatever is completely exhausting and wipes you out for a long time so that's...\nif you want to learn more about CMT and my disability in general I have numerous\nvideos and a disability playlist which will be up here or up here, I can't remember which\nside so be sure to check out if you want to find out more. so why do I take\ntramadol? well for me it is the best... for me specifically... again this might not be\nfor you, pain medication affects everybody differently including people\nwith the exact same disability but for me it's been the most effective,\ncertainly at first anyway, of numbing my pain. I don't think any pain medication\ncould completely you know make me a zero out of ten in pain. I'm probably probably five out of\nten on the tramadol but for me it was the best at numbing my pain without as\nmuch nausea but still some that came with other medications I've tried. I will\ntalk about those further into the video so be sure to keep watching if you want\nto find out what else I've tried. so the main reason I take tramadol is because\nit really helps with my lifestyle I can't work a conventional job with my\ndisability as I've explained I'm in a lot of pain all the time I couldn't even\ndo an office job because sitting for any period of time even just making like a 10 -\n15 minute video like this is very painful for me the chronic fatigue means\nI can't plan ahead of time so I couldn't commit to doing even two days in a row\nof work because of chronic fatigue I'd be exhausted even just from an hour of\nlike sitting doing something like this. like tomorrow I'll be wiped out because\nof making this video so you know I can't work a conventional job however I am a\ndisability advocate and activist and writer. if you follow me on instagram\nyou'll know that if you don't be sure to check out my thing here or it will be\ndown in the description. I write about disability everyday that's something I\ncan do in bed in my pajamas on my phone It takes a short amount of time to write a\ntweet or you know a blog post I can write over a few days, because it's\nincredibly painful for me to type with my hands so that's something I do. but outside of that and prior to my disability getting to level it is now I\nwas and still am a professional musician if you've watched any of my other videos\nyou'll probably know that I post disability stuff and I post music stuff\non here, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook etc so along with that comes the fact that I gig\nsometimes. now this is something I absolutely should not be doing it is\nimmensely painful for me to do and it wipes me out and you know not just for a\nday but for a full week you know even just playing a half an hour set is a\nnightmare on my back I have to really load up on pain medication which is why\nI'm making this video, that's why I take tramadol...and it really wipes me out so\nthe tramadol for me really helps me be able to gig because tramadol tends to\nkick in about one or two hours after you take it. for me personally, again your\nmileage may vary, for me personally it takes\ntwo hours to kick in so, and I always take it with food so before a gig which\nI usually play around 8:00 on 9:00 p.m. I'll eat my main meal of the day around\n6:00 p.m. which means I can take my medication and in doing that it tends to\nkick in around about the time I'm due get to the venue which is usually just a\npub or a club I'm not a famous musician I don't play in big spaces I just play\nlocal pubs and clubs and the people that book me are incredibly accommodating and\nknow my entire situation so taking that medication around 6:00 p.m. really helps\nme. for those that are curious I now currently take 50 milligrams of tramadol\nwhich is one capsule for me as you can see which you probably can't cos of the\nlighting, these are just tiny little tablets I find them quite easy to take I\ntake 50 milligrams of tramadol, one capsule three times a day so that's.... I\ndon't really breakfast I wake up in the afternoon because of my gig schedule\nand because my girlfriend works night shift for the most part, she works\nin a bar so I'm pretty much on her schedule I don't gig that much but I'm\non nights pretty much so wake up around 2:00 p.m. I eat my lunch I kind of call\nit. I have like some toast just so I can take my medication. I'm not hungry\nI have to force it down so I force that down, take my medication and then I usually\neat a main meal around 6:00 p.m. or 7:00 p.m. if I'm not gigging it can be later\ndepends on how I'm feeling if I've napped, if I'm tired... and then I usually\ntake it around midnight or 1:00 p.m. so I go to sleep around 2 3 or 4 p.m. so it\nkicks in for then so that's the sort of schedule I take tramadol on. so I briefly\nwant to talk about the things I tried before tramadol before I get to the pros\nand cons because these will kind of make more sense when you hear the cons of\ntramadol as to why I didn't keep on with these. so the things I tried... the first\nmedication I ever tried was codeine. I first started taking that when I got\nout of a surgery, which I think is a lot of people's story with opioid\nmedication in general so that really helped with the pain then but after my\nsurgery I still had a lot of pain in walking... the surgery I had by the way was\njust a tarsectomy I think they called it and a tendon lengthening which is\na common surgery for my disability but after the fact once I got walking again a\nlittle bit more because my foot was easier to walk on at the time, I kept\ntaking codeine for about 3 months I didn't take Ia high dose, I can't remember\nthe exact amount now you know I took enough that I could go out and function\nand it helped with the pain but wasn't too overwhelming but I found after about\na month the nausea from it like I'd take it and then 2 hours later I'd feel so\nsick like I was gonna throw up occasionally did throw up. dizziness\nlightheadedness, not the good kind of lightheadedness that makes you feel kind\nof up in the clouds it was the kind that makes you feel like spaced and just\nhorrible so that didn't work for me, codeine, and I stopped checking after\nthree months. after that I then tried acupan which I believe is a brand name\nI think the actual name of the medicine is Nefopam, that was kind of the same\nstory at first it helped it kind of you know gave me the lightheadedness at\nfirst and it was okay it gave me a little bit of nausea but it was okay but\nagain after about a month of taking that every day my stomach was like in pieces\nlike painful diarrhea making me feel really ill, too much information but I'm\ntrying to be real with you guys here so you know the pros and cons of this so\nagain after about two months I think that was maybe I stopped taking that\nbecause it just wasn't any good so then I moved house I started living with my\ngirlfriend who helped care for me a lot more which kind of made me want to try\nsomething new because I just decided not to take any medication. I'd take\nparacetamol occasionally which is like Tylenol in the u.s. I believe, just to\ntake the edge off it didn't really help I wasn't doing a lot then I was in a\npretty deep depression I was in bed most days anyways so I didn't take any pain\nmedication for about six months but then after that I decided you know I wanted\nto start getting out and about again and I went to the doctors and they suggested\ntramadol. they didn't really prescribe acupan anymore which I was willing to\ngive another try but they didn't prescribe it and to be honest I'm glad\nthey didn't because it didn't really work for me so they gave me tramadol. I\nbelieve back then I would take it twice a day and I would take a hundred\nmilligrams in the morning and 100 milligrams before bed because I was\ntaking quite a big dose in the morning it kind of lasted me throughout the day\nI didn't have any tolerance to it because I'd never taken it before and\nI've been off any real kind of medication for six months so I started\ntaking it and at first it was I was blown away with how much it helped like\nit didn't take me down to a zero out of ten at all I was maybe two or three\nwhich any chronic pain patient will tell you is amazing when you've been at five\nor six to seven and eight every day with your back or with any kind of pain so\nthat blew my mind for a month the nausea was kinda bad when I first\nstarted taking it but it really helped. I was able to go out was able to function\nwhich is you know I... obviously taking away pain if you just want to survive\nand just stay in bed is fantastic and to be honest that's the stage I'm at now\nbut back then I wanted to go out and do things and I could, because my disability\nhadn't progressed to the place it has now but at the time I could go out and\ndo stuff. I still had to be careful, I still had chronic fatigue I still had a lot\nof pain I still couldn't walk particularly well but I was able to go\naround the shops with my girlfriend and be out for an hour or so you know and\nhave a nice time. that was three years ago I've been taking it every single day\nfor three years and two months now I think it's been I think I started in the\nNovember and this is January and it helps, it really helped like I say and\nlet me do things I didn't think I could do it really helped me with gigs which I\nwas doing way more often then than I do now. I'm lucky if I do one in months now\nback then I was doing two a week maybe you know certainly five ish a month\nreally getting out there and gigging and having a great time\nso that was the pro.. that's the pros of tramadol for me. helped me with my\nparticular schedule and lifestyle the nausea wasn't too bad for me personally\nagain your mileage will vary I'm not going to say may vary everyone is\ndifferent . so it was great it really helped me but the reason you're watching\nthis video I would imagine is because you've read the side effects of tramadoll and you're scared about them, I certainly was the first time I took it I was\nterrified, I had anxiety as it was and of course one of the side effects of most\nmedications is increased anxiety so that scared me in itself let alone you know\nthe long long list of other side effects so one thing I will say straight away is\nthat on the form it says one  in one hundred side effects: nausea, anxiety diarrhea\nsore stomach whatever and then it has one in 1,000 side effects so....one in\n1,000 people suffer from these particular side effects again I don't\nbelieve those numbers.. I suffer I would say from like at least 50% of those side\neffects on that one in 1000 : most people I've spoken to suffer from at\nleast one of them if not numerous so I don't believe those numbers I think you\nneed to bear those in mind I think you need to read the pamphlet be prepared\nwhen you first take it.... don't have plans make sure you can stay in and make sure you\nhave a friend or family member around just to keep an eye on you and make\nsure you don't have any kind of adverse reaction. I'm not trying to scare you, you\nknow, I know that sounds like terrifying like you just need to be careful make\nsure you are in a controlled environment probably just a day where you're gonna\nspend in bed anyway make sure, you know, cuz it makes you dizzy it makes you\nnauseous it will the first time regardless of whether or not that will\nbe a long-term effect it will make you dizzy it will make you nauseous\nit's an opioid medication your body isn't gonna be used to it you're gonna\nhave no tolerance it's probably going to put you up in the clouds so just bear\nthat in mind. but I want to talk about my experience with the specific and the\nmajor side effects that I experience... so one I experience a lot is nausea, now I\ndidn't at first I mean I did like the first few days but then that kind of\nlike I've already got used to it it kind of stopped being as bad my stomach got\nused to it and I was fine and I could function but now the nausea is terrible.\ntwo hours after taking it I feel sick even right now I'm making this video I'm\nabout an hour and a half after taking today's dose and I'm like having to stop\ntalking every now and again just because I feel like I'm gonna gag or I'm gonna\nthrow up so you know that it's obviously not ideal it's hard to function when\nthat is the case ...so quick background before I talk about the next con... I used\nto take 100 milligrams three times a day so that was two for me anyway with my\nprescription that was to tramadol capsules three times a day for three\nyears up until a few months ago. my body obviously built up a huge tolerance to\nthat to the point where with tramadol... before I started taking it... my regular\nlifestyle would be around here say. We'll say that's the midpoint and when I took\ntramadol it would take me up to here...my pain wasn't so bad. I could go out, I was\nhappy I was motivated it was fantastic. After taking it for three years my body\nobviously built up a huge tolerance.. three years of taking any medication\nis obviously not fantastic for your body and it's going to build up a tolerance\nso instead of my mid point being here I would start my day down here like right\nat the bottom I'd wake up feeling like shit I'd feel terrible\nI'f feel exhausted and that's on top of the chronic fatigue anyway but on top of\nthat I'd feel terrible, I'd feel sick I'd feel nauseated and I just had to force\nfood down me , take my medication, do nothing for like two hours and then it would\ntake me up to maybe just below my mid point where I used to start....Frame may have\nchanged.... just had to get up and grab a mint because I was feeling sick as I was\ntalking about it... mints really help my nausea so excuse that.... so as I was\nsaying my mid point used to be here Then after tramadol for three years\nI'd wake up down here and then maybe come up to here. so around six months ago\nI decided to wean myself down off of the high dose\nI was on. it took me six months... so I dropped out one tablet from each three\ndoses over six months... so that brings me onto the con.... after probably about two\nweeks or three weeks, if you miss a dose of your tramadol you will feel terrible.\nit's it's not the withdrawal you see in the movies at first anyway you'll\nprobably just get a headache at first you'll probably just feel really\nunmotivated and lethargic and exhausted I can tell you after three years though\nof taking it and if I miss a dose which was a hundred milligrams at the\ntimes of two capsules I'd get a migraine almost straight away I would feel\nincredibly sick and quite often throw up I would have cold sweats definitely, I\nwouldn't be shaking as such and that was my experience... migraine, cold sweats, had\nto lie down in a perfectly dark... like completely dark room, couldn't watch TV\ncouldn't focus on anything just literally had to lie there and try and\nwait for it to pass.. very hard to sleep usually just lying there wide awake for\ntwo hours just waiting for it to pass and then waiting to take the\ndose I forgot about to kick in... while it wouldn't usually take two hours in that\ncase because your body is like crying out for it, it still takes a while you\nknow still lying there for a good hour feeling atrocious with  a migraine feeling\nsick cold sweats absolutely horrible so one thing I will say is if you take\ntramadol get yourself a pill box sorry about the lighting I don't know if you can see that.... you\nwant to make sure you: A) don't take too much... it's quite easy to overdose on\ntramadol there were a lot of stories about that so bare that mind you really\nreally need to keep track, if you've got a bad memory and you live on your own I\nwouldn't recommend it, if you've got a friend or family member that can help if\nyou've got a box like this... I know in America you have the tubed...erm..I can't think\nof the word right now you know I mean there's a little orange cylinder capsule\nthing I know you can get lids for those which have a timer on. I don't know the\nprice of them I know they probably aren't affordable to folks on disability\nbut if you live on your own or you've got a bad memory\nI would honestly suggest grabbing one of those you don't want to take too much\nfor a start and also you don't want to forget and the problem with that is that\nit sounds silly but once you've taken tramadol every single day for three\nyears taking the actual like pill, like popping\none out of the packet and putting it in your mouth and taking it become\nso second nature to you that you can have them sat in front of you and... so if\nyou're watching TV while you're eating and doing it you'll think...\"\"did I just\ntake that I can't remember\" and the problem is you can't say well I might\nhave but I'll just take them again in case because you could easily overdose\nor certainly make yourself very very sick and very ill. you can't just take\ntwo doses you know so most of the time when I forgot I would take my breakfast\none and then it would come to my main meal one and I'd be like crap I don't\nknow if I took that...they're sitting here in front of me I don't know how many was in\nthe pack I don't know if I took them and I couldn't risk taking it again because\nit would make me very sick it could end up in me overdosing especially at that\nhigh dose and especially at first when my body wasn't quite used to it so that\nis something you need to be careful of. So the next huge con is probably the\nthing that hits me the most after the nausea and stuff and something I didn't\nknow that was really a word for and that symptom.. and that side effect is\ncalled mania or hypomania... In the sheet that comes with my medication it says\nit's euphoria a feeling of euphoria but the  medical term, from my research, is\nmania or hypomania most likely hypomania as it's not as bad... so what that means is\nfor me about two hours after I take my tablets I am just hyper I am incredibly\nmotivated I can't stop talking.. I have a million ideas in my head, videos I want\nto make, songs I want to cover, recordings I want to do, writing I want to do,\ndisability advocacy posts I want to make like my brain is just going at 1,000\nmiles an hour I'll give you a quick list and I'll pop up the screenshot from NHS\non here ...so it says you'll have high-energy, restlessness, really struggle\nto get to sleep, very high self esteem, confidence and grandiosity, and that is a\nbig on,e and you'll be really talkative... my girlfriend will attest to that like\nwhen I take it if I'm playing a game I like talk and commentate on every single\nthing i'm doing i was constantly going and going and going and going and my\nbrain just feels like it's gonna explode going 100 miles an hour you'll have a\nracing mind you'll have loads of plans, you'll have loads of ideas you want to\ndo probably that you won't be able to do, you'll be easily distracted, definitely\nsomething i really struggle to focus even just on a TV show i watch\neverything with subtitles because i feel like there's some sensory processing i\nstruggle with that especially when I'm in like hypomania or whatever\nthat's a huge thing... you'll take on too many projects, that I've mentioned ,and\nyou'll have an increased sexual desire and that IS one..again..\nTMI, but worth knowing. that is all of those...every single one of these points\nfor me is accurate with tramadol so that's a huge thing to bear in mind\nbecause while that feels great sometimes and it can help.. it will wear off. you've\ngot like a 20-minute window a 30-minute window...It'll kick in you'll feel motivated..but like any medication for pain in general that will wear off and you will\nfeel completely shit afterwards..you  won't feel motivated anymore all the ideas you had\nin your head you will realize were unrealistic that you won't be able to do\nthem even if they were relatively simple you certainly won't have the energy and\nthe motivation to do them after... so for me those are the main ones anxiety\nnausea, hypomania/ mania and whichever one you may end up with when you take it if\nyou get either....again these are my experiences I don't think everyone\nexperienced that but certainly for me they're the three main ones... there are\ndozens... if you have any questions about other ones I may have experienced, i can't fit them all in this video...op me a comment, DM me, whatever you want I'll be\nhappy to talk you through them. so lastly I want to talk about my experience in\nweaning off of tramadol six months ago. As I said I decided that I was taking too\nmuch instead of being here all the time I was starting the day here and coming\nup to here which was obviously defeating the entire object of taking pain\nmedication. my body had grown up such a tolerance to it, it wasn't helping with the\npain, it wasn't helping me get out and about and do things it was leaving me\ndepressed it was leaving me exhausted so I went to the doctors and I said \"look this\nisn't working for me anymore I want to certainly cut my dose and\nmaybe hopefully get entirely off of it\" so as I said so I dropped one tablet of\na dose out of each dose that I would take so instead of taking a hundred\nmilligrams three times a day I would take fifty milligrams three times a day\nI did that over a course of six months I dropped one tablet out pretty much a\nmonth and obviously not exactly a month but I found that was the best way to do\nit that was the lowest dose, 50 milligrams per capsule, I could get at my\ndoctor's so it was the slowest I could possibly do it. I wasn't in a mad rush\nbecause I know that missing a dose made me feel terrible and the withdrawal was\nalmost unbearable so I did it slowly it was a long six months of not really\nbeing able to gig of not really being able to go out and do a lot of stuff it\nwas just a long six months of Netflix and video games and that sounds amazing\nbut not when you feel absolutely shit and can't leave the house for around six months to\ndo anything. so if you do take them please bear in mind that when you try\nto come off them it will probably be difficul.t I have got a friend who says\nthat she managed to just stop taking her entire dose which was around what I was\ntaking with no real issues a couple of days of feeling a bit off but then she\nwas fine but the majority of people I've spoken to really struggle o get off them\nbecause they are addictive they are you know your body builds up a tolerance and\nit wants more to feel the actual effects of it instead of just tolerating it and\ncoming up to that point where you feel like you did before you even started\ntaking them but get no real benefit.... so what's my plan going forward? because I\ndon't want to you know I've taken tramadol for a long time, my\ntolerance is too built up. I would like to get completely off of it at least for\na little while so that my tolerance will go down and then I can start again maybe.\nmy plan though is to try and get some muscle relaxants so that I can come off\nthe tramadol and in that in-between period before I try different medication\nI can at least sleep and they'll try and numb my restless legs... so I'm gonna try\nand either take baclofen or I'm gonna try and take diazepam if my doctor will\nprescribe either... again very difficult and I know it's just as hard in the US\nand obviously you have to pay ridiculous prices too so I don't know if\nthat'll be possible... one thing that used to help me a lot when I was younger is I\nused to smoke cannabis or marijuana or weed or pot or whatever you want to call\nit that was the best pain medication I ever had but A) it wasn't legal B) it was\nexpensive and C) the anxiety that came along with that for the strains that I\ncould get hold of were eventually too much for me so it was like a month of a\nreally good pain medication but then the anxiety got to be too much... it is\navailable now on the NHS but chances of getting it are slimmer than getting\nopioids really the only categories they really give it to you is people with\nepilepsy obviously because it can stop the fits..\nI believe don't quote me on that... people getting over the effects of chemotherapy\nfor that and people with multiple sclerosis... now my disability is kind of\nsimilar to multiple sclerosis in some ways so maybe I can make a case there...\nchances are slim though while I was trying to come off of my tramadol I\nwas using CBD oil supplemented.... and read up on that before you do it because it can...\nbecause of the way your liver processes tramadol and because of the way it would\nprocess the CBD it can make your liver not process tramadol as it should\nand it can make you overdose but when I came completely off I tried that CBD for a week and through the day I did ....taking way more than suggested ....you\ncan't really overdose on CBD ooil but please again read up on that before you take\nmore than you should, talk to people ,read up on it and talk to you doctor... but I was taking\nthree times the recommended dose on the CBD oil that I bought in a store and it\nhelped.. it helped with the pain it helped me relax a little, helped my muscles\nrelax. there is no THC which is the part of\ncannabis which is the psychoactive part that makes you like high and makes you\nyou know you can hallucinate or whatever kind of cannabis you're taking...but the CBD oil\nis just the cannabidol which is what stops you feeling as much pain to give\nyou a simple explanation.... so that's my plan anyway this has probably been a\nlong video I apologize for that but I really wanted to try and cover all of\nthe bases obviously it's all important to know the pros and the cons because\nthe pros can be very high and the cons can be very low chances are you'll come\nout for both somewhere in the middle eventually after taking it for a little\nwhile... so do more research don't just watch my video watch other people's\nvideos talk to your doctor talk to people online in chronic pain forums\ncome over to my Instagram account I'll put it here and it's in the description\nunderscore Sam Bosworth...

guys welcome back today I'll be showing you how to make peach ring gummies I am including a recipe in this video but you can use any recipe you like you could even buy orange and yellow pre-made store-bought gummies and just melt those down and that will work just as well and this video is going to include some troubleshooting because I had quite a bit of issues making these I had to remould them multiple times I'm gonna show you guys how they started which was like this but eventually I got to them to come out like this here's what you're going to need 1/3 of a cup of water three and a half tablespoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below 1 teaspoon citric acid 1/2 teaspoons of peach flavoring oil 1 tablespoon of Tincher 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 a tablespoon lecithin white food coloring and yellow and orange food coloring the first step is to bloom your gelatin so just pour your gelatin over your dish of water as well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe also let me know do you guys prefer shorter videos that I don't include any troubleshooting or errors or you prefer videos like this where I kind of talk about things that can go wrong and how you can fix them let me know in the comments below", "zrL0wlu_H-E": "so i had some requests to do a delta 8 gummy review and i definitely was not opposed to that so i decided to try out the 3g brand because that's one of the most common brands of delta eight that i've come across and there's a bunch of pretty solid reviews on there so let's check it out now i actually had to buy this one i didn't get an offering to do it for free but whatever wasn't too bad they're currently 25 off right now so we have here the gummies i got the watermelon flavor they have watermelon or black raspberry i'm just going to give you a quick breakdown try it out come back later let you know what's going on so i got the larger pack there's 32 servings in here serving size is half a gummy i really want to take two but just for the sake of trying it out for the first time and giving you guys a solid review i'm just gonna try one just so i don't get blasted out of my mind because i did see some pretty interesting reviews that even one gummy would do the job for a while before i do that let me first read the back and try to reenact my initial reaction so i turn it around and then i see right here can take up to four hours what to feel full effects that's not really a good actor but i don't know i've seen some of the reviews say it's just been one hour until they feel the effects i highly doubt it's gonna take four hours i did eat some food before this the ingredients i'll post them up on the screen it's basically just a bunch of sugar and hemp extract this feels like one big gelatinous blob i don't even know how these will separate but let's see oh these smell really good they are pretty separated it looks like so it's not that big jello blob i thought it was so let me try one out wow ooh damn it tastes like that old school bubble yum watermelon or whatever the brand was called let me just read a couple of these reviews that i'm looking at on their website here because i'm not going to get too too in-depth with anything with that because you can check it out for yourself i'll link it in the description and probably post some screenshots here too so the first one that got me anonymous may 11th 2020 eat a handful and you will literally be tripping i doubt i'll be fully tripping but i don't know maybe a handful would uh you know definitely do something i don't want to quite need a handful yet maybe at a later date um just to you know cost effectiveness and everything let's see here anonymous may 11th they are tasty great consistency i wish they weren't out of stock all the time that's partially why i jumped on buying these because apparently they're out of stock a lot and for some reason my new phone is freezing when i'm going onto the site so whatever so overall taste is great i'll be back in a while hopefully not four hours and i'll let you know what's going on and then i'll probably based on what i'm feeling have another one so we'll see see you in a bit these are [ __ ] great it's about 6 30 p.m now i took the first one at i think it was around noon so i rode my bike down to the park i usually do this and it wasn't too cold out so i ended up for just a couple hours really a mix of working out stretching riding my bike whatever and then as this stuff continues to just you know kick in it was it was awesome so absolutely perfect especially if you if you've ever you know when you kind of just get in that groove of either working out or stretching or whatever and then everything just feels phenomenal and i just look like a weirdo doing all these weird stretches in the park and whatever so i'm back now i took a shower and like i said it's around 6 30. it definitely would i feel like this feeling would definitely just kind of last feel like it's leveled off and now it's kind of slowly calming down and i feel like this would last this still uh like the euphoric very nice just both uh both body high and then just mental high of just feeling just really nice really relaxed and it's fantastic so i'm sure the vast majority of you know exactly what i'm talking about so these are 100 worth it based on what the price is and then having 16 in here and mind you the serving size is one half gummy and i just took one full i would never suggest just going outside of the full dosage the first time you try it because everyone's tolerance is different but with that said i'm just gonna have one more and i'll be back tomorrow to let you know i assume it's just going to add on to the current effects spike them up again and whatever so i'm just going to enjoy the rest of my evening have this and i'll be back tomorrow morning and let you know what's up the next day wow i absolutely love these so the second gummy as the other one i said was kind of just wearing off after several hours the next one definitely i'd say started to kick in but is the way i experienced it is that that leveling off just kind of built up again and i went to sleep and say maybe around 11 o'clock and i was definitely feeling it for sure no signs of that slowing down or anything i slept great i woke up today i'm still pretty early i've been getting up pretty early even on the weekends and i noticed maybe the slightest bit of grogginess but it wasn't anything that you know made me sleep in for a long time or feel uh bad or impact me negatively or anything but all i contribute that to was just the fact that i had two of them and then the last one i think was around six or seven pm and uh yeah so it wasn't really even a bad thing at all i just wanted to mention that little aspect and that kind of occurred the first time i tried a delta 8 anyway after not having any sort of thc for several months but if you were looking for a gummy delta a thc whatever a good substitute to delta 9 thc and especially if you are trying to find something that's not smokable and edible this is a hundred percent awesome i love this and as with the other uh tinctures and everything but this one was very familiar to the erita hemp tincture that i still need to post a review on but maybe by the time you're watching this video that's already up so check that out but these were very intense very similar to even having a delta nine edible but it was still no sort of paranoia or anxiety or any anxiety or anything i know people mentioned the paranoia and anxiety can be a bit less on delta eight which is you know i find that to be true but even throughout years of smoking or eating whatever delta nine i feel like the anxiety and the paranoia that one can experience with that just in my experience just in my personal opinion it really all depends on your mindset beforehand because i've known that in times of my life when i was when i had much more much higher levels of anxiety in general and you know whether it be anxiety depression whatever other lifestyle factors things that have been going on in my life at the time that the majority of time that i would smoke pot or delta nine my anxiety levels chances are i would my anxiety level levels would go up exponentially when i would smoke until i'd have to actively just force myself to calm down really and just relax and enjoy it and then other times i would have it frequently and that did not occur at all so i feel like a lot of it has to do with your mindset but once again you know thc the endocannabinoid system and everything it's all going to be entirely different from person to person the way they feel the effects as is with these gummies or certain delta a cartridges or certain types of bud whatever the way i experience these gummies here could be totally different for you depending on where you're at in your life your own genetics a bunch of other things but me personally awesome so if you are into this type of stuff which you probably are if you're watching this video and you've been curious what these three chee gummies were like that's how they were for me so i'll put a link in the description below if you want to check out their main website i'm not affiliated with affiliated with them at all but hey if you want a business partner 3g let me know and i can help you out by you sending me more stuff and i can review it so that'll be it for the video if you like it any comments criticisms whatever leave that down below subscribe like all that stuff whatever and i'll be making some more videos that's it see you next time", "OTo2wiNTe8E": "hey everybody gets me for girli here and we are back for day one of the 20 days of 4/20 now you guys might have seen on my youtube channel unfortunately I missed the 12 days awaken bake for this past season but I'm here to follow it up while everybody is Quarantine themselves I guess with a little extra content we're gonna do the 20 days of 4/20 so welcome to day one today we've got a beautiful 180 milligram kiva chocolate bar this one is the churro milk chocolate flavor it's like a cinnamon sugar and it is delicious now I've had several different flavors of these bars they've all been consistent they've all been tasty and they're all relatively affordable or at least on the medical side still the one thing I don't like about these bars is the packaging now it's beautiful it looks great it's the for only proof packaging so you gotta like stick two fingers on that side and pull on this side and then pull out over here and finally we get out this chocolate bar so this is basically just milk chocolate and there goes my lighting milk chocolate and some cinnamon and sugar and chemical and flavoring I believe it's made with distillate and again these are 180 milligrams but they're actually gonna be reducing them to 100 milligrams from what I understand and in addition to the flavor look at all that cinnamon sugar deliciousness on there oh yeah I like the fact that it comes in five milligram pieces so all the way down you can see you've got basically rose up to 20 milligrams and sometimes that's a good dose sometimes you just need a little more happy first day of the 20 days of 4/20 guys shout out in the comments below some products and things you like to talk about I'm not gonna sit here and make you watch the rest of me eating this but shout out the Kiva making some great bars produced by high left arms and gotta pick this up at our nature's relief in Burton cheers to all until next time

um did him with re on the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger registered on some Micro dos versions of mushrooms that I have to add two of them and they were it was great it just made things a little bit brighter have you ever microdose yes you know does that all-time hey white oh really Ron white so micro dosing [ __ ] yeah cuz I'm on this new drug it's called mushrooms and I just take a little bit every day woah yeah I know a lot of people to do that yeah a lot like dozens dozens of people who microdose including fighters I know a lot of fighters from microdose yeah I forgot today was even on any I was like I was just like oh this room looks like cooler yeah I just feel so oh yeah I ate that little piece yeah you just feel a little better and you're like what is all I took mushrooms yeah I forgot [Applause]", "a61vjUPxcFc": "hello senior stunt fans is the real senior stunner back at you today we're gonna be discussing powerful edibles this is non liquid mostly chocolate but let's talk about starting at the top with my WoW brownie remember edibles are to be used very carefully this in particular is some of the strongest edibles I've come in contact with the WoW brownie 500 milligrams bottom line even though it's not that big one bite and you got to put it down and wait an hour and a half two hours because I found it to be almost too strong so be careful with while brownies they're very strong mostly a sativa / hybrid on the upside there Delta which is a more traditional Delta nyan edibles this is a classic 250 milligram milk chocolate that for people it's scored into nine different pieces for people who just want to have it casually this one is much more intense for the experience usually this would be something even a beginner could eat into over here let's move on down to our pj butters assortment we have two today that we're gonna look at on the right is a traditional Belgian milk chocolate double dose with 300 milligrams that means you can take it to a movie or a concert pop it in your pocket it's real small look how small it is and it's very discreet here it is in Belgian chocolate with cappuccino flavor also PJ butter 300 milligram Sheriff with a friend please I bought this because I thought it was gonna be really exciting I'm looking forward to it this is a hive I've talked ilat Belgian chocolate flavor came a lot of different flavours what they do with this 400 milligram puppy is they score it they score at a number I think they score at 20 different pieces he bought you cut out a little piece for yourself and / - so you're in 40 milligrams apiece take two of those and you'll be very very happy let's move over to bang this is medical cannabis pretzel chocolate and this is one for one person that says double strength but for me 120 milligrams really is gonna be for me now I want to take this and go into detail the Wow 250 bar is made by the same people that make the Wow brownies and you have to be very very careful some reason I don't know what they're using on inside of their edibles because it doesn't tell me if it's distill it or cannabis oil for weed it's incredibly strong their brand let's move to something that I've experienced with I've tried the G bar before the 500 milligram buy lol edibles very tasty this is done really nicely it's a pretty package but it's also a very tasty bar because of that I purchased some 1000 milligram bars they're the same size but more potent so yesterday I attempted to take a piece of one of these were the day before oh my goodness I had a piece of one of these and I had a bite of the brownie no drink during the day and oh my god so I think what has to be said about edibles especially edibles with this type of power because these are really powerful animals is you need to go very slow and in small small pieces you're not like me don't think you are with edibles most people I've been doing edibles for a very long time if you have and you understand what I'm saying they can overwhelm you very quickly so you don't want to turn book could be a great experience and have it be a pain in the ass because you don't feel good so remember go slow but go bold or go home right this is a fine assortment of edible high potency edibles I wanted to take a look at from the real senior stoner everybody have a great day thanks taking a look", "rJuiVRAr8lM": "hello welcome to another episode with oil there today you can see I've got my hard times souvenir cannabis cup t-shirt on it's a size too big but it

girlfriend it's basically just a bubbler with five slit male adapter so let's a little rig with the titanium nail it didn't come with the titanium now I just stuck it on there it came with the green dome you've done this pretty I'll show you that in just a second let's rip it this is the Bubba cutter great piece I love that piece so smooth you think you know how the bubbles Lupo it has the bulbs right here excuse me oh it's got I can anchor need pineapple shape thing down there then it has the old-style splash garden that has two turbines the turbines have six slits Oh there are 45 degree angles oh that bubba kush mess me up that's the vast rome on to the next down and then i will be on to the monkey bar this is a try review I guess this will be like now the one of the first video is the wax and shadow review part 1 that was a Charter Review I did three different types of shadow but this is a three different products this is vho shatter this is who this is bhl shatter that hasn't been vacuumed you guys know about that if you know about it you know about it if you don't you don't maybe I'll teach you someday but this is the co2 wax I guess they call it moon rocks I think that's just the brand it's very sweet and very smooth you know sorry it's almost like inhaling nothing but you can tell it's it's actually like a little less potent you know it's like there's not as much it's not strong is what I want to say but I want to be biased you know because I made the Novak so I'm not gonna now I'm not gonna say that's a fish so that's just my personal opinion now on to the edible the monkey bar oh my gosh I'm so excited I made like two of these they're so good all right guys had the positive get some sanitizer gotta have clean hands touch some dabs and dabbers and I don't much you blow here for the cannabis cups not alone I'll clean their hands where I know I keep my hands pretty clean you never know better safe than sorry and I always want to take the utmost care cuz I don't want to affect the taste of the edible especially since this river activated this time I've never tried river rock before I'm excited they're very popular wolf flip he really likes them maybe they just promote him or he promotes never they cost about each other I'm not exactly sure this thing already looks delicious it's three you know it's three pieces and then four of each sellers 12 it's 100 milligrams so there is about you know almost ten milligrams in each one so it's basically dosed out you know you you really can't get too crazy like they they say this some guy got all crazy um edibles and you know jumped out of a hotel that's that's really sad you know I don't want to make light of that or anything like that especially to the family or the people that are involved with that but it just to me it's out of my comprehension how that could happen it had to have been something else like if this doesn't doesn't had a like everybody that was here when I was with ate a cookie that was over sixty eight milligrams you know and they were all fine they almost didn't even notice the difference so it's just hard to believe all right testerone I'm just gonna go ahead and devour this whole entire piece you instantly taste the coconut right off the bat smooth coconut and chocolate you know it's like mm-hmm it's like an almond joy mm-hmm has crunchy parts to has walnuts but that was not a walnut to have to say so it's coconut flavored chocolate yeah that's what I thought I could taste the coconut and it has bananas and walnut so I guess that was like it dehydrated banana again it was pretty crunchy that was good one more piece for good measure it's actually a high-quality chocolate - it's very smooth it doesn't have like a chemical taste it doesn't like about the classic alcohol taste of most edibles doesn't have any alcohol in it a sneeze cocoa butter the walnuts are diced up like small pieces they're not too big and I'm drooling all over this is so good yeah they definitely improved from last time I'll try it I think I lost time I tried it was last year five over six months ago but wow it's still just as good they're very like I said very smooth very high-quality chocolate no chemical or solvent taste in it it has it has a little bit of the medicinal taste like you taste the herb a little bit but it's a good taste you know you enjoy it's not like oh oh what's that you know that doesn't ruin the chocolate you think it's just like you to chocolate and then after it's like kind of it's like cinnamon you know how soon it has like a lingering a like a lingering effect like almost like a lingering taste like it's probably cuz it's powdered it probably actually does lingering them up a little bit but wow I got to say that's like one of my favorite edibles and that's like a great it's a very pleasurable experience you know it's it's enjoyable it's good it gets you medicated it says it may take over an hour or two hours to take effect but usually if you haven't just like if you didn't just finish digesting it's pretty good sure it's gonna go down and start digesting and like within 30 it's a 45 minutes so it's an hour you should feel something if not you know it's trust looking a little bit that's what I always notice is edibles if you smoke a little bit it's like you know it's like all right like I felt that a lot like is that really really good stuff and it'll be the same stuff that you smoked the day before it's just you you feel it more because you ate the edible and it's cool because when you eat the edibles you forget that you ate them so it's like you forget that you're high so you don't act high and then you'll realize that you are high but no one else can realize it because you're not acting like it if that makes any sense until next time guys although they're gonna leave on that note [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "LMTzxpmUDlA": "hi everyone you all are having a big day today okay retake hi everyone I just kind of wanted to make this video I'm going to be doing an eyebrow tutorial not really like a tutorial like I am NOT a new guru I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing kind of like an eyebrow tutorial slash edible review slash me just [ __ ] around so I am getting ready because my brother is performing down on sunset today and I have to get ready because I'm going to go and support him Josje oh sure my eyebrows or something that's like really important to me like in high school if I didn't wear makeup at all I at least had my eyebrows build it that's the most important thing your eyebrows shape your face like there I just can't stress enough they're just one of the most important things as far as your makeup routine so I am going to be reviewing I have some kiddo candied pineapple flavored sativa gummies I have never ever tried this before so that's kind of why I decided to make a video on this because since I haven't tried them before I 150 percent honest opinion on them as far as flavor goes as far as experience and all these things I really personally I have a pretty high tolerance for someone my size and weight normally I consume around like 20 to 30 milligrams depending on the edible I know some people take like 1,500 I'm not rich for myself I'm just trying to enjoy myself I just want to live up to my eyebrows how is that not something that everyone so I got these per recommendation of my pleasure I was like I need medical it taste it and that's going to be infected a hundred milligrams of THC and the entire thing each piece is 10 milligrams there's 10 pieces so [Applause] okay we're just gonna pour some my hand and see how that goes okay Oh baby we're gonna go for four is a good number I'll try to pull myself we're gonna messed up a little bit by getting pineapple I don't know why it's available in our shower they're pretty sweet they taste good don't get me wrong but I just don't think I that was it for me [Music] - now they don't taste like wheat okay don't get it twisted it tastes really really good just makes me when structures eat one two three dummies okay guys so I'm going to tie myself 45 minute they not 45 minutes I'm going to be doing my foundation I'm going to do contouring pretty much going to be doing everything besides my eyebrows a little buster [Music] so I went to the and they found I found cotton candy this is honestly the best thing that could happen I started getting hired like 2025 minutes and it has only been significantly up from there I'm supposed to be doing the eyebrow that's right I decided to sit down for this because when I was getting super high I was just like enough this sucks why not set make things easier for myself so I have this product it [Music] my bread my powder Brett brow powder duo who's just so hard to say I've used this quite a few times ladies this little end it's like a as you can contrast I forgot it has an angled edge chicken the spoolie side so [Music] okay there see where the angle is handy now [Music] I'm so into this eyebrow right now it just goes to show how good the eyes I mean so just happy and like just having a good time I hate pizza right before the comic and and oh my god it only took me like 10 minutes to my favorite so evident the good thing about like doing your eyebrows is you can just like go back in there as long as you have please blend it out later so don't be afraid to say this is so sad immediately is dark the very bargain it's okay hope you find one we'll see what happens with this one okay let's get it [Music] - like I'm Kris [Music] maybe the tail is essential Oh [Music] okay so now this is also a very crucial step you have to outline your eyebrows with like get this [ __ ] together I promise that's a huge issue me out there she's gonna have faith in the process okay [Music] my [Music] so we're going in on the top crusty dusty trusty PT blender this is honestly a really important step because it just changes everything it makes it look so much more [Music] [Music] it really is just like life-changing just like it's a whole different I really like this really wise [Music] [Music] so the answer was bullet that's all see the continued struggle so I want [Music] it has work point to me and I see supposedly they're made with all-natural ingredients they definitely tastes like pineapple there since me and they were so light but I expected them to a little bit more sour just because for some reason I know I thought there were sour gummy is a sentiments so they're made with agar locust bean gelatin glucose cane sugar closed strings citric acid capsule and not just it contains you know food allergies whatsoever however are not vegan they don't stay organic they're definitely not kosher but they need all the requirements like their lot tested free of metals [Music] Oh two hours later everywhere yeah I think this is better than I know that there's CVT in years

nine i shouldn't eat them all but i have to save room for the alligator too so we'll see this is gonna be uh quite a fun time yes wow this is gonna be a hard choice these things are so pretty ah okay um [Music] all right let's try this one it looks really pretty this is uh very pretty looking [Music] [Music] oh yeah that's the aztec one it's spicy it's so good i love it oh if you know anybody that loves spice with their chocolate it's amazing it's got so much flavor in there to me right now i'm loving this it's really good that's fantastic chocolate yes two thumbs up oh okay let's go totally different let's go for our it's completely different little chocolate truffle [Music] it's just super rich chocolaty goodness that is really good this thing is covered in nuts this is going to be so rich oh this is going to fill me up so much [Music] that is a very stout flavor of rum tastes very good but uh definitely put the rum flavor up in here i'm like maybe i just started happy hour [Music] oh interesting one [Music] so far this one's just the uh most normal tasting just typical chocolate flavored one it's very good it just tastes like overall chocolate nothing extra surprising and really fun to it it's just good basic chocolate i like it [Music] this one's really pretty too [Music] wow that one just had an explosion of raspberry flavor inside of it it's so good oh this one looks kind of normal this is a milk chocolate one [Music] this one's good but again this one just tastes like milk chocolate [Music] hmm this looks curious whoa really powerful orange flavor i think this is the gram marinade one just such a strong flavor of orange and a little liquor to it [Music] and the orange flavor keeps the build one it's very nice hmm very smooth um we'll probably pick up the flavors it's got a little different flavor to it but it's also overwhelmed by that orange flavor give it a little bite is very rich velvety chocolaty i'm not not got anything else from chocolate flavor and so i've got some of that uh orange flavor still in my mouth okay see how this one goes [Music] hmm very rich inside throwing this up very uh decadent luxuriously tasting it's uh super super chocolatey [Music] the uh i thought of that one just had a little extra creaminess to it but uh different than the other ones it was a rich sort of uh more uh silky smooth texture to it it was just ooh just rolling over my tongue it's a unique way it uh really had a lot of just good texture with the flavor combined to give it a very unique experience compared to the other ones so that that was uh kinesthetic and flavor combined to really make for a different experience so that's uh probably one of the more unique truffles i've ever tried just because it had such a contrast in the way the feel of it on your tongue as you ate it nice okay now we're gonna get to the uh alligator oh i'm like chocolate overdose but for everybody out there i'm gonna make sacrifice and i'm still gonna sample this alligator there's no way i'm gonna finish it at this point but uh we're gonna we're gonna sample this just because we can't we can't leave the poor alligator without sampling it oh how to do it alligator let's see all right there's the opening okay we untrapped the gator [Music] here he goes oh he's escaped what are you gonna do wild gator he's escaping the vicious animal well we can only do one thing when the gator tries to bite us we bite back hey so the uh alligator just tastes like milk chocolate that's good put those truffles oh my gosh totally different level so uh if you like the decoration it's fun to have the decorated little things like the alligator but my gosh for the flavor those truffles i've never had truffles that good those truffles are amazing you need to go try

bar review and we have from quest protein it's birthday cake if you guys happen to hear a grinding sound that's okay that's just chance eating his bone again hey chance say hi hey chance he says hi so so this is 21 grams of protein four net carbs less than one gram of sugar and 14 grams of fiber of fiber per bar it's also 180 calories and that's not bad so we're going to go ahead and try this out see if it tastes like a birthday cake so here's what it looks like out of the wrapper so it looks like there's like sprinkles and stuff on it let's go ahead and snap it off a piece come on focus all right so that's what the inside looks like so let's give it a shot it's very chewy taste i like birthday cake tastes really good very sweet very sweet but it tastes pretty good um i would get this again if i want something that's gonna taste like birthday cake definitely a sound option um i didn't like how chewy it was though uh that's the only downside and it's hard to find protein bars these days that don't have that chewiness that you can even see it just let me push some more out of the wrapper you can even see just in the flex like how much that flex is before it even snaps um it's though it's getting harder to find bars that watch this snap kind of like you know a regular candy bar would so this uh from quest i think it's a buy it's about 250 260 a bar um i've seen them as low as you know two bucks but uh it's not bad for the price it's a little on the higher side mid middle higher end so but can't complain tastes pretty good so like follow subscribe comment below if you've tried this and what your thoughts are or any other flavors from the quest brand that you think would be good for me to try so see you guys on the next one the healthy nerd", "11NXPaUP9_0": "let's take

i really truly appreciate all your awesome comments and your wonderful love and support i do apologize i've been a little absent for the last couple of months i've been really pretty sick for a while there um today's about the first day that i felt good so yeah i came to make you guys a video so if you want more details i put up a video under the community area there but i'm not going to bore you with the nitty gritty details here so let's jump into what i've got for you today and what i've got for you today are hot chocolate balms so what these are if you haven't seen these yet are really cool so these chocolate balls they're the hard chocolate balls and they're filled with hot chocolate or cocoa whichever you prefer and you put them into your mug add your hot milk and they turn into hot chocolate of course canna um but uh these are just wonderful and they make awesome um gift ideas for the holiday time which is just coming up right around the corner i know i'm sorry i'm sorry um but as i said they do make great gift ideas so without any further babbling on here let's jump into those ingredients the equipment that we're going to need to get these made and let me show you how to make these oh one thing i did tell you because this recipe today i mainly just show you how to make the chocolate balms if you want to see further details on how to infuse coco cocoa butter um check out my video on canna real milk chocolate and there i show you exactly the details on how to infuse cocoa butter and yes you can only use cocoa butter with real chocolate you cannot use coconut oil or anything else so please don't ask me that question only cocoa butter so i said if you need any further details on that as well as tempering details all right so what we're going to need for our can of hot chocolate balms is two cups of real chocolate and um you want to make it a dark chocolate it's going to give you a richer flavor so about 2 cups or 16 ounces if you've got black chocolate or shaved chocolate that's what you want to go with 16 ounces or two cups about one and a half to two cups of hot chocolate powder and this will be the pre-made hot chocolate powder it's already done with sugar if sugar is an issue for you then you can definitely use just straight coco you don't have to use the pre-made hot chocolate as i said i just do it because it's already got the sugar mixed in and it just simplicity's sake we if you want to add marshmallows what i did because these little dehydrated marshmallows are difficult to find is i just bought a really inexpensive hot chocolate mix sifted out the hot chocolate and kept marshmallows hey me um i think they if they're available on amazon if they are i'll throw a link down for you and then for i'm going to decorate mine with some salted caramel um for the decoration and give my hot chocolate a little hint of salted caramel but you don't have to do that if you just want to decorate them with a milk chocolate later to have that contrast giddy up i have not just leave them plain and then we're going to use um so this can be an and or an ore i'm going to add infused cocoa butter to my chocolate and i'm going to add about two tablespoons the other thing i'm going to do this is the end or i'm going to infuse my hot chocolate with tincture so as i said if you've got both you can do it if you just got one or the other there there you go you just add the cocoa butter to your chocolate or tincture to your hot chocolate all right so that's it for the all right so the equipment that we're going to need is you're going to want a double boiler for melting your chocolate so glass bowl in a pot or if you've got a proper double boiler you can use that of course most people don't so a bowl that fits snugly so um you don't have steam and stuff coming out the sides the other is you just want to add enough water you um towards the bottom you don't want any water touching the bottom of your bowl because it will get too hot and it will burn your chocolate also make sure if it starts boiling a little bit that it's not going to be touching the bottom of the bowl so you can always melt your chocolate in the microwave or what i picked myself up is one of these chocolate melting pots these things are really really nice so if you do do a lot of chocolate you may want to take a look at investing in one of these and what's great about it is because you have total temperature control although it's in celsius so you're in fahrenheit you just need to get some conversions but um easy to do anyhow as i said you can go 30 is about 86 degrees fahrenheit i believe which is your lowest temper for milk chocolate and for um for milk chocolate and white chocolate and then it goes up to 80 which for the most part you would never go that high because that's like 165 so and the reason that these are super nice is you can put your chocolate on and just walk away and leave it for a while you don't have to stay over the pot and continually stir it it's kind of nice basically i say it's just idiot proof for melting i've burnt chocolate before on the double boiler i step away for a moment this i can just drop the heat down step away go do what i want come back and just adjust my temperature and carry on my merry way so besides a way to melt your chocolate you're going to want a candy thermometer or a chocolate thermometer measuring spoon measuring cup about a quarter cup measuring cup or depending on how much tincture you're going to use a couple of spatulas straight edge a straight edge cutter offset spatula and a straight edge spatula if you've got those and a whisk you can use a metal whisk or a silicone whisk for chocolate either is okay [Music] you're also going to want a pair of gloves either silicone or latex or whatever really professional chocolatiers use cotton gloves but we'll just go with these this will help prevent you getting fingerprints on your product as you're as you're playing around with it if you're going to do some decorating you want a piping bag and then our mold for our little chocolate balms so this is i believe about a one and a half inch mold i will put up the link for it to um for you to see exactly which one it is and we're going to want parchment paper and the last thing that the method that i'm going to use to temper my chocolate is tabling if you are going to do tabling you need a marble slab or another natural stone slab things are falling uh is a natural slab as i said or marble and i actually got this from a table so all right let me get that out of the way and we're going to need a bowl we're doing our hot chocolate little tincture a baking dish with parchment paper and you're going to want a fine mesh strainer and a bowl i think that's about it of course you know i always forget something along the way but if i do i'll let you know all right so let's jump right in and let's get our hot chocolate infused with our tincture all right so to infuse our cocoa or our hot chocolate whichever you're using um get your uh get your powder get your strainer and we're just going to sift this through just to take out any lumps so you don't want all those lumps and stuff in your in your mix now i'm going to use about a quarter cup for 2 cups of for a hot chocolate mix oh another thing with regards to your hot chocolate mix i forgot to tell you read the directions on how much you need so there are some usually the less expensive ones will be like four heaping tablespoons or four heaping teaspoons you want to make sure uh you don't really have any more than two tablespoons um less is better it's hard to get it in those bowls balls and get them together so you want to make sure that your hot chocolate instructions are for at least two tablespoons or under just a helpful tip for you there this is my green dragon tank shaw and i'm just going to put a little bit on it first use my whisk whisk her in and you want to add in a little bit at a time because if you for one if you use an alcohol that is not a 94 or 96 you're going to have a lot more water you want to be careful of that because you're going to end up making it pasty so just add it a little bit at a time if you notice it getting clumpier pasty stop if you're using the 94 96 you can get away with a lot more but as i said just do it a bit at a time if you notice it getting pasty it all stopped you can always add more later so you can uh evaporate the batch and you can always add on as a secondary level if you want to make it really really strong i however don't really like to render people unconscious but hey whatever float your boat and then i take my strainer again and sorry you want to preheat your oven to 175 degrees if you're doing this in a an electric oven you i do not recommend doing this in a gas oven some people have done it successfully others have not always err on the side of caution and flame and alcohol don't mix and you can also use a dehydrator or you can always leave it out overnight if you have to do the table dry method just leaving it out overnight you're going to want to sift it a few times through throughout the night throughout the day and there we go so i'm going to pop this into the oven at 175 on the middle rack i'm gonna leave the oven door slightly ajar i have a ceiling fan going always make sure that you have some type of ventilation going don't ever take it for granted you can do this a hundred times with no problems and then one time you do it without ventilation and there can be a problem so very very skinny so what i usually do is i spread it out on the wrap trying onto the tray nice and evenly and then i just put little dash marks in it here just just so we can heat up through and i said pop that in the oven keep the door slightly ajar and it'll probably take about 10-20 minutes for that to evaporate so what i'll do is every couple of minutes i'll go with um one of my spatulas and just move the um hot chocolate powder around and then re-flatten it out so this way it brings the heated from the bottom to the top and it helps to evaporate it quicker and if there's any large lumps you want to uh just mush them out all right so we'll be back when that's done alright so my hot chocolate is done as take it from the oven now a tr uh test that you can do to see if it's done to make sure it's done is it's only at 175 degrees not that hot if you have really sensitive skin don't do this but if you've got tougher hands just run it over your hands and let it go and then if you feel any coolness on your hands from the air that means you still have some alcohol left so throw it in a little bit longer if it's totally dry you're good to go so we're just going to set that off to the side till the end time when we're going to need that next on to our chocolate all right so for our chocolate if you are using a double boiler you want to put it on medium low as i said you don't want it to get too hot chocolate melts at a very very low temperature so i'm using my pot i'm going to add in my chocolate and i'm going to add in two tablespoons of melted infused cocoa butter if you want to learn more about how to infuse cocoa butter and tempering chocolate check out my video canada real milk chocolate and i go over all those steps and details for you so i like to melt my cocoa butter first and add it onto my chocolate and then mix it over all of my chocolate i just found that it just blends a lot better this way when i do it the other way where i use cold cocoa butter i found a few more times than not i ended up with streaking and this method i don't just a little tip i'm giving you oops that pots are wasted small so i'm just going to continue to stir that until she all melts down nicely and as i said because i'm using this melting pot i can go toddle away for a couple of minutes i would just drop my temperature down right now i'm doing this for melting the chocolate i am doing it between 50 and 55 celsius and over in this pot over here i'm just melting my salted caramel yeah the salted caramel chips you can get them uh i found them in most grocery stores a bulk barn they're really easy to come by now if anyone's going to ask me can you do this with butter or anything else coconut oil no you cannot the only thing that you can add to real chocolate is cocoa butter and the reason for that is um the temperature at which uh but the cocoa butter melts butter and coconut oil melt at a very low temperature at like 79 80 degrees it'll start to melt so if you use those your chocolate will never ever stay set at room temperature that is the reason so if you see any recipes that are using butter in that don't bother trying it don't waste your time unless you plan on keeping them in the fridge and then using them right out of the fridge then you're fine but if you want them to stay set no will not work so just a little tip for your chocolate if you're using a block chocolate you want to make sure that you cut it up really really really fine using a serrated edge knife works really well for that same thing if you're using larger chunks you want to chop them down to smaller size it helps them develop quicker and if you're using a double boiler and that you um you don't have to worry so much about um with it burning if you have really large chunks in really small chunks it takes a lot longer for those big ones to melt and you can burn your chocolate that's why i just said i found these melting pots just so nice just temperature control like i said it's just a nice toy it's definitely it's not a necessity for making chocolate it's just it's a nice to have what would be super nice to have is a tempering machine chocolate tempering machine those things are expensive especially the good ones so i'm just continuing to melt my chocolate down here and once it's all melted we're going to get it to temperature of 113 degrees fahrenheit that's for dark chocolate if you're doing milk chocolate or white chocolate it'll be about 108 109 now if you're microwaving your chocolate um with about two cups or 16 ounces you're going to start with two 30 second intervals and then drop down to 25 sorry then drop down to 20 15 10 and then continue at 10 second intervals until you reach the temperature that you need so as i said for dark chocolate 113 fahrenheit for milk or white chocolate uh 10109 so our chocolate is almost all melted so i'm just going to check the temperature right now to see where we're at i'm going to guess about a hundred 99 i was close so with your chocolate with your thermometer if you're using one of these tight always clean off the end so that you get a correct read because the chocolate will harden up on the end of your thermometer and it can cause it cause a misread so i'm just going to continue to stir this until we get to our temperature so i'm just going to check it every couple of minutes another thing to remember um is that water is chocolate's mortal enemy if you get even a drop of water in your chocolate it can seize if that does happen don't panic get your sunflower or soy lecifit and put in just a drop or two that can help uh save it it can help loosen it up so where in most cases we use those as an emulsifier in chocolate it works for its viscosity so it'll help thin out chocolate so that so always make sure that your equipment whatever you're going to use is thoroughly clean and dried um i i just i generally do not use um wooden handle uh spatulas or anything because wood can retain moisture so i've done that before where i was doing chocolate and stirring away and it seized on me because the handle was damp so yay so i tend to try to like to stick to the solid silicone uh type spoons are but i find i find work best all right so we're at 113 for the dark chocolate you want to turn your heat off take it off your heat and you want to make sure your marble um your marble stone area work area is completely clean and again 100 dry so in the previous video i showed you tabling um this is a slightly different method in the one in the other video i still used temperature to get us to that point this does not so what you do is you take half of your chocolate if i engage what half is you set your regular you set your melted chocolate off to the side and you get your straight edge uh straight edge and your offset spatula and you're going to work the two use the two the agitation is what is going to create our beta crystals that we need and this what we're going to do is we're going to work the chocolate until it gets till it thickens up so this can oops you don't do that try and stay on the table but make sure to get all the chocolate from the side get that scooted in holder the cold from the side is what helps to start thicken up your chocolate i have found this has become my favorite way for tempering might take a couple of times for you to try it but as i said if you don't temper the first time you just re-melt it do it again continue to clean off the blades my coordination is not so good our chocolate's beginning to thicken up here a little bit almost getting to where we want it to be yeah professional chocolatiers are way neater at this so you can see the chocolate starting to thicken up now it's not flooding out as quickly i'm just going to go a little bit further almost done i found this way this method far quicker and more efficient i hate the other ways i have very few times do i ever get it right so you can see our chocolate's thickened up here it's not as fluid and it's starting to harden as it goes out to the sides so this looks about where we want it to be scoop up your chocolate not those other peas get the little pieces melted there [Music] now we're going to take our the half chocolate that we have and we're going to add in our thickened chocolate again chocolatiers make this look far more impressive eyes look like what the hell am i doing but trust me it works then get your whisk put my whiskey and you're going to mix it together until it becomes one texture the same texture it all gets mixed together and melts those two different textures together and becomes one nice smooth and silky and the color's all the same that looks pretty good now we're going to get our mold and you're going to fill that up fill them up to their tops you don't have to worry about being too neat you want to be pretty quick mix get that moved around and then you can try and dump it into your pot or you just pour it onto the parchment paper and scoot it off or pour it onto the board and scoot it off so you want to drain out the excess get your straight edge spatula and you want to scoop off scrape off all this excess off you want to try and make sure your molds are nice and clean at the tops and again you can move the chocolate around and we're going to dump out the excess and again we're going to clean the excess off the top here give her a little smack down get getting any air bubbles make sure that also make sure this is even now what i like to do is to place them upside down on a parchment lined board and pop them into the fridge to set this way um you don't get this big hunk of chocolate set at the bottom of your get that mold of the way you can just take it through any excess this will save you having a big lip what we want to try and create is a nice little edge and scrape off that top then i'm going to flip this upside down on my board here i'm going to pop this in the fridge for about then with your leftover chocolate here grab your pot and we're just going to scoop it back in the pot and re-temper it again for the second round so i think you can do this with candy melts um the only problem if you don't want to do chocolate tempering in that the only problem is i don't know how well or how easily they melt with um in the hot milk or hot milk and or cream but what you could always do to find out ahead of time makes it what you can always do is just do a quick test melt you don't have to infuse anything just melt some candy melts up um into the ball shape and see how they melt in more milk they melt up nicely then absolutely you can just use candy melts and you don't have to go through all this tempering chocolate all right so while my first layer there are cooling in the refrigerator i'm just going to re-melt my chocolate back up to the 113 fahrenheit and then just re-temper it again like i said it takes you may take you a couple of times to get this but if you can get down this method honestly it's so much easier and it makes you feel more professional so see our bowls now see how nice they are nice and even so again i'm going to fill them up i don't know where i'm going get that out of the way for a minute so we want to get that mixed around get that coated and again we'll just dump out the excess on our parchment paper and then we're going to scrape off this excess again you want to try and get the um the tops here as clean as you can getting your chocolate out of your mold a lot easier i just want to kind of smack out air bubbles here a little bit and then again we're going to dump out the excess so the reason that you want to make sure to be getting out all the excess chocolate is just have a really nice um even mold of your chocolate you won't end up with a big lump of chocolate in the base of them again clean off the excess and then one more time and then we're gonna do one final scrape here and i'm going to flip her upside down onto my parchment board here and pop it in the fridge here for about 15-20 minutes and then your leftover chocolate you can just um keep in a plastic container and just save it for next time there we go you can recoup most of your chocolate especially when it's expensive you do not want to be wasting too much and the other thing you can do is just take your parchment paper if you want to make sure to get all your chocolate pretty much put that in the refrigerator once it cools up all of that will just crumble right off i however i'm not gonna bother all right so we'll let those cool up then next we'll decorate them fill them and put them together all right so on to decorating if you're going to decorate go to this step if not you can skip on to the to the filling part so we've got our molds and they're all nicely set so you want to very gently take them out this is what you want to put your gloves on because you do not want to get fingerprints all over your pretty little balls and now you'll know your chocolate chocolate is tempered by when you touch it if it instantly melts and then it is not tempered but if it stays then it's good and it's not instantly melting on your fingers then you're good if it is not tempered it's not going to be if they're not going to be as pretty and shiny they'll be a little bit dull or streaky and as well as they said as soon as you touch them they will like instantly melt on your fingers so i've just put my salted caramel into a disposable piping bag and i'm just going to cut a little hole here and then probably should do this on a wire rack duh i knew i needed one so place the model place the wire rack down and then put some parchment paper underneath that and i'm gonna pop these in the fridge let that set up for just a couple of minutes while that's setting up well let's get our hot chocolate ready so again get your strainer and um and i've got a bowl here [Music] pay attention so i'm going to dump our hot chocolate into our strainer and we'll just strain it through take out all the lumps all right so on to our final step here everything's set here so we're going to fill them up and seal them up but what i've been here is i've got some tempered chocolate that i put into a piping bag and i put a really really tiny hole at the inlet tip so you're going to flip your little guys over if you if they're a little stuck to your rack here just get a little spatula and gently scoop those off and my um hot chocolate it its um recipe is two tablespoons so i'm gonna do one into each side so these get a little tricky to to stick together and then i take some marshmallows throw those in i'm just gonna make a little pipe that around the edge here carefully come together like so and stick them together then you can just gently with your finger just scoot off the excess off the edges here and then what i'll use is where'd they go is the medium size or these are the medium size or small sorry small um muffin cups to hold them in see pretty again we want to get that nice get a little edge on it take your two make sure your designs are going the same way let's scoot them together gently not the prettiest one but oh well can't be perfect we'll use that for the tester and there you have it hot chocolate bombs so what i'm going to do right now is i'm going to heat up some milk and we're going to give her a shot give her a try see how they turn out all right so i've got some boiled milk here let's check out how our balm does i'll use the ugly one so we just plop her into our cup here and i like to use a whisk we pour our hot milk i like to do a mixture of cream and milk that is my milk i don't really like it and look at her start to melt so what i like to do is to put just about a quarter in and get her mixed up use her whisk get her all nicely mixed up let's fill her up and there we have it [Applause] yummy yummy hot chocolate bombs that was good that was a perfect amount yum yum well before i can't finish up this video because if i keep going on this hot chocolate i'm going to bid you a fair a jew so i hope you enjoyed that video thank you guys so much

bit on like how I'm feeling right now I'm feeling cold I'm feeling tired I wanted to knock out soon that's kind of what edibles do to me I have a hard time staying up on them I'm probably fifteen sixteen hundred milligrams deep first time in my life so forgive me if I don't finish it I might try my best to I just feel like if I finish you right now I'm gonna be knocking out way too early you

don't know what I'm doing I feel like I just want to go home right now but um yeah I'm tapping with you guys soon I feel like I'm flying right now you guys I'm only going 40 I'm so high so that felt so [ __ ] crazy I feel like I'm gonna die with this guy's driving right now it's not gonna drink the rest of this I hate the surfing bottom as a [ __ ] worst just trying to race right now damn I don't know about you guys the edibles to me feels like absolute [ __ ] tap I don't know why anybody takes them definitely not for fun I mean if I was feeling sick and I couldn't smoke or if I was an edible type of person I probably was just do it in moderation I would never do anything to it what I took today was 44 doses so pretty much one bottle is 22 servings when I ended up taking less 44 servings today you guys and I'm just feeling the effects of the first bottle right now so I feel like the second ball is still gonna hit me and I'm just gonna be floored we're on our way right now back to my

culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "EkalarGVJHg": "everyone's worried about catching a bowl of these days but my big concern on the recent flight was getting through security with two bars of medical grade cannabis chocolate thankfully I had no problems", "oJKnXFcpcUI": "tis I miss cannabis puree with more reviews for you today and today I've got these sublime products here elevated cannabis is a 10 milligram THC we've got this little sorrento cucumber cucumber Serrano and the desert citrus blossom sublime products I love sublime products I've talked about them numerous times again the reason being is that they're really consistent these are no different than anything else and they are low dosage again 10 milligrams can you see it there 10 milligram THC I've already taken this because I already know what they do again they're so consistent that it doesn't matter from batch to batch they're always the same and what I think is important to discuss here is how they work and why they work for me and then maybe you can decide how they're going to work for you and if they'll work for you I take these as a preemptive strike these little goodies never make me feel high I never get that I'm high from THC feeling what I do feel is a ease of anxiety so when I know I'm gonna be in a stressful situation I take these beforehand for instance I ride my bike a lot there's a lot of places out here or there is no bike lane you know people just don't care either you do not get that three feet that they are supposed to allow between you and their vehicle they don't care there's none of that so a lot of times there is no bike lane I've got like this you know what's supposed to be the shoulder but it's just kind of where the asphalt kind of trails off into gravel and that little area I have to write it as usually filled with debris and rocks and things that I have to avoid so while I look as cool as a cucumber while I seem to not be worried about anything if you were to look at my hand you would see that I would just Knight white-knuckling it you know I'm just gripping so hard but these help a lot with the anxiety and it's why I look as cool as a cucumber because these help with a lot with that I usually would take them excuse me like maybe an hour and have two hours before I knew I was gonna be in the situation and they just smooth out that edge so I'm not in a situation where I go from anxiety panic attack it is very scary riding your bike on the side of the road because people are insane anyone who rides their bike knows this and you don't have to have PTSD to have that anxiety so if you you know bright a lot like I do I'm not gonna allow my fear to stop me from living my life so these candy has helped so much with that all right so I'm done talking about how great they are this also helps a social anxiety by the way social anxiety again they won't make you feel high they won't interfere at all for me anyway because there are such a low dosage didn't they just help smooth the edges now let's talk about the flavor these two that I have I've had one before it this one I have not tried yet so I'll try here but this one if you are a fan of spicy stuff which I am I love spicy it's got a nice little heat to it it's not spicy enough for me so it's not like flaming hot level but there's a little heat you know you feel in the back of your throat as you're sucking on it and the cucumber is really nice and refreshing so this is a really good choice I have other flavors of this that I like but this one definitely is is a go-to if you like a little spice and you like a little heat definitely this one now this one I haven't had so I'm gonna try it and let you know what I think mmm they come packaged individually so whether you know this was a sample this was is what I got at 4:20 hey from Phoenix suspensory and my swag bag I was so happy that I got sublime goodies oh shoot I need my scissors hold on so I find it difficult I find it difficult to cut these open on my own I mean you can't with your teeth but there's so much easier just use some scissors you know use the tools available to you in life so such as blossom then my first thought was tangerines hmm like those little halo candies but now it's kind of devolved back into like lifesavers orange that's what it tastes like lifesavers orange so the initial yumminess in my mouth it's still good but the initial mmm tangerine kind of went to orange flavor it's good I like it I'm pretty sure something have the same effect I mean as everything else does that sublime makes yeah okay so anyway this is gonna be short one there's really nothing more for me to talk about sublime products the flavors of these candies are good they're not too sweet for a hard candy I think that's great I don't want too much sugar even though I love it and I know that's important for some of you would diabetes so not too sweet these are really great 10 milligram THC again cucumber Serrano and the desert citrus blossom both great helped a lot with anxiety if you want to get a high off of them I'd eat a bunch but keep in mind there's only five in a pack I got these for $8 I believe I eight dollars five and a five of these little candies so 50 milligram is basically for eight bucks which is not bad it's pretty much in line with everything else but again if you need the high feeling take more than one then then just figure out what your dosages for you as with everything else so I'm gonna enjoy the rest of this candy you all have a great day thanks for stopping by if you like my videos and you want to see more just subscribe to my page please maybe like the videos let me know you're watching say something every now and I feel like I'm talking to myself but I know I'm not cuz I see you guys are watching so I'm gonna say bye now because I've got more to do I got more things to talk about I'll be back in a few seconds but it won't be like that to you bye thank you", "mnr3f1UZuMU": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight animals my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and for the rest of you guys thank you so much and welcome back so I've I've been asked about chocolate in the past and I have never been able to successfully get it to set at room temperature using cannabutter then the other day when I was doing the truffle demonstration I was using the shortening to thin out our chocolate for decorating it dawned on me that shortening sets at room temperature in chocolate will stay set at room temperature so I made up a an infusion with shortening instead of butter and I do it just like the small infusion like all other ones I'll run a quick little thing for you here on it but if you want more detail on it you can check out the small infusion video so yeah so I get a small infusion of shortening and yeah I'll show you how much better that works and the reason being is butter has a melting point of fancy it's between 85 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit so basically a little room temperature a little bit warm it's going your chocolate is going to melt or sorry your butter is going to melt however shortenings melting point is 95 to 115 degrees fahrenheit so it's got a lot more stability so you know that if you've got shortening butter on the counter you notice you're shortening nice and solid where your butter might be a melted mess on all that hot day and and that's the reason is because of the higher melting point so I think that into our chocolate does not affect our chocolate and it allows it to stay set at room temperature now I'm doing this demonstration with candy melts if you want to do it with real chocolate that's not a problem but you will have to temper it I hate tempering chocolate one of these days I will do a video on how to do it exactly personally I hate it the candy melts taste great and they just work so easily so I'm going to show you that demonstration with it and so check this out so M here's our chocolate he's nice and snap and you can see it's not all melting and the squishy let's see if you can hear it hoping that came through on the micro on the thing and then for our peanut butter cups any time I am a peanut butter cups in the past all the recipes that I have I have looked up add anywhere between two to six cups of powdered sugar and I'm like that is disgusting one time I made it and it is it's so sweet all you get is sugar and with a hint of peanut butter and it still doesn't stay set at room temperature it still kind of oozes out and it just it's just not a proper peanut butter cup so off I go and do my research and stuff look up the actual ingredients in a rescreened a butter cup Wow I can make certain things work for us and I've managed to come up with this come up with this for us so check this out it's a peanut butter cup that I did a little earlier look at that Center there's no using or squishing out looks just like a peanut butter cups and they spin chocolate layers yeah that's alright I'm going to show you guys how to do this alright now with regards to doing this recipe it's really good because you have full control over how much sugar you want to use you can use just a little bit or a lot of the powdered sugar because we're going to use all-natural peanut butter and so this is great for people who are diabetic now if you can't use sugar what you can do is increase the tapioca search that we use and in a honey or maple syrup or I got I got syrup as your sweetener and yeah you can eliminate sugar as well that's because we're adding in our salt if you're on a salt reduced diet you can either eliminate it altogether or as little or as much as you like so this is really good for anybody who is restricted with diet as well as if you're a diabetic you can use the dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate use dark chocolate alright guys so let's jump into those ingredients of what we need to get started let's make some chocolate that material D car being in a smaller mason jar at two forty four forty minutes and then I've just got my shortening I've used one cup of shortening mine's yellow because I've used the butter flavor so I'm gonna be using the my shortening in place of butter for a lot of things so I decided to go with the butter flavor and a pot of water now you need the pot large enough deep enough but it is going to be able to cover your oil or your shortening once it's melted with the herb in it it's very important that your oil is always covered by water so I'm just gonna place this in here into the water and I'm gonna let that melt up just gonna boil that up and let that melt down while my herb is d carving and then we gotta cool it cool the deeds cool our herb yeah you can always use a French press instead of a mason jar it's nice because it already has the built in the screen for for helping when you have to now you can also use a French press for this I usually use the French press however I thought more people have a mason jar so I just go the mason jar method today alright so I have just added my plant material to my shortening and I've just given it a mix up there and they still mix up I'm gonna place there in the water and like I said the one thing is very important is that your water is above your shortening line you never want it to go below and the reason is is if you do your shortening is going to get hotter than what we want it to but keeping the water on the outside and completely surrounded maintains a constant temperature for what's inside if you allow that to go below your shortening will actually heat up a lot a lot higher and look and can burn your plant material which we don't want so I said I'm gonna let that go for two hours every once in a while I'm gonna come by and give her a shake up and if you're wondering I was using shake that's why I don't have any larger pieces in there and that's it and we're just gonna let I said go for two hours okay so you just want to have it on the mild simmer like that just where there's little tiny bubbles on the bottom of the pot but it is not boiling or vigorously boiling so what I said keep that temperature down a little bit patient is done put in and make sure that you strain it really well with a fine fine mesh strainer a cheesecloth or you can get one of these hold on you can get one of these bags from magical butter and it has the superfine it catches all the really fine sediment far as I said cheesecloth and that will work as well you put it into your stand mixer or if you're gonna use a hand mixer you're gonna be standing there for about 20 minutes we're gonna set this to low and we're gonna let this go for about 20 minutes as I said now if you used regular shortening yours is gonna be a lot lighter a very light light green and because I used the butter one is very yellow so mines it's gonna probably be darker than yours if you didn't use the butter but yeah just pour it into a container it will solidify and you can use it just like butter in most of your recipes all right so for our peanut butter cups what we're gonna need is about a hundred and fifty grams we're gonna make six large ones so we're gonna need about 150 grams of Hershey's chocolate if you want them to taste as close to the Rees peanut butter cup you want to use the Hershey's chocolate if you don't really care that much any milk chocolate will work and essentially what about 150 grams and for candidates about three of the small bars probably I think in the States it's like two or you can just use one large one in and around oh we got chocolate in my peanut butter oh all right we are going to need 1/2 a cup of peanut butter - the bar wrapper you're going to want an additional about quarter cup to a half cup we are going to want 1 cup of powdered or icing sugar a tablespoon of either can of butter or can of shortening now the shortening is going to give you a more solid product especially at room temperature because butter melts at a lower room temperature that'll be a little bit softer at room if you use the shortening they're going to stay firmer you're going to want a tablespoon of tapioca starch 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and about a teaspoon of milk doesn't matter what kind of milk and that's for our peanut butter cups for our chocolate bars you're gonna want either if you do not want to temper your chocolate then use the chocolate candy melts they taste great they work amazing they're pretty much idiot-proof if you do want to use real chocolate and you're experienced and you know how to temper go right ahead I've done tempering a few times I hate tempering so I'm going with the candy melts and you absolutely want to use the can of shortening not butter and as I said because you're shortening has a melting point of 95 to 115 so you are chocolates are going to stay set at room temperature that's all we need for the chocolate side so let's jump into our equipment and what we need and then we'll get this some of this stuff made up here all right so what we're going to need for our peanut butter cups are some cupcake liners either medium or large I've got the large here a cupcake pan to put these into to warm up gonna need pair of scissors and spatulas a bowl offset spatula and a spoon and your mixer with the blades for our for the peanut butter cup as well if you've got one of these is as a candy dispenser a chocolate dispenser these are great especially because we want to get these same amount and we want to do it quickly and easily now here's a little trick for you to create a whip when they normally come they don't have they're like this and you have to push them they're not automatic but you can create an automatic trigger by taking elastic just make a slip through it and then just put it across the bottom like so and now you've got an autumn trigger in that smart all right so that's it for our peanut butter cups for our chocolate we just need our mold pretty much now what you read I really do recommend getting the polycarbonate molds because they work so much you come out with a really professional-looking chocolate I don't recommend the silicone ones because one it's difficult to get your chocolate bars out of you have to peel them out quite often they break as well as you don't get quite the same shine as you do from the public cabinets or the plastic molds work really well as well so I think that's about it usually me you know I forget something I'll throw in there later but I think I've got the major stuff covered so let's jump into our making our peanut butter cups first alright so the very first thing we're gonna do is we got to cut our cups down to size so the easiest way to do this I'm gonna do six so I've got six of my liners here is fold them in half like so and then you want to cut about a half an inch or an inch off an inch off and you're just gonna go try and go evenly all the way around see now we have cups that are roughly the same size the weight side I just put them and get your tins and then the next thing we're going to do is we're going to get our chocolate our Hershey chocolate melted or your clean milk chocolate we're gonna get that melted now you can either my you can either melt it in the microwave I do mine at 30 second interval first then 20 then 15 then I finish it out at 10-second intervals until it is completely melted you can do it over a double boiler so any pot or a proper double boiler you can use or one of those candy melting pots any of those methods will work so it will work it just perfectly fine whoops I'm just gonna set that aside and if you want to if you've got if you are using the can of shortening you can add about a teaspoon or so a can of shortening to your chocolate if you'd like to but I'm just gonna get that melted up and then won't get everything put together alright so I've got my chocolate melted here it's all nice and smooth and like so so now you want to take a little bit about a teaspoon or so let's see you just drop it into the bottom we're gonna move it around now this is a little difficult to work with I find it's easier to take them out you can use the back of the spoon to go around the bottom and you want to bring it up around your edges and remember you just want to keep it a thin coat then you want to try and get as close to that top there as you can you just dip the back of the spoon in if you need a little bit more like so so I've got all the sides relatively evenly covered here drop it back into the mall and into the cake pile or the cupcake pan smack that down now if your bottom is not all filled just take a little bit more and just just lightly enough so that you just have that little light coating on the bottom so these are a bit of a pain to get doing even I'm just gonna do that again to all of them I find the offset works a lot better I'm just gonna finish the rest of these out and then we will get the peanut butter part going if you find this a little too much in the bottom you can just drop the excess all right so now that I got all the chocolate into my cups here just gonna clean off the top and then we're gonna set these aside let them set up while we make up our peanut butter filling all right so for peanut butter filling we're going to put in our half a cup of our all-natural peanut butter we are going to put in our our can of shortening but we do we want it melted and the reason that we want it melted is because if it's all if it's at room temperature and it's more than solid it may not evenly distribute all through your peanut butter it'll be little you can end up with little clumps of it so you definitely want to make sure to melt it get that in there and we are going to our to our Center we are going to add our powdered sugar our tapioca and our salt and we're going to sift that through and any hard chunks that don't go through just to start those and now we're going to need our mixer first of all so we don't end up with flying powder everywhere you just want to fold that in to your peanut butter and your can of shortening or your butter and we're going to add in our teaspoon of milk and we're just going to start our mixer on low now what will happen is it is all going to clump up like this it's gonna clump up like like this it's gonna kind of look like rinoa that's okay don't worry that's what we have the extra peanut butter for this is what we want it to do to start with so just continue to mix it until it's all broken down into little chunks like this and now we're gonna take our peanut butter with our mix and we're just going to drizzle something a little at a time until it starts to come together and form a nice mixture looks like I'm gonna need this might need a little bit more than that half cup we'll see actually I think I just used a quarter cup they're a little bit more big spoonful here just a little bit so the texture that we're looking for basically is like a peanut butter dough so we don't want it super stiff but we also don't want it really really some loose so we do want it basically like a dough like this so I do want it a little bit looser because that's a little too firm but that's the best is what we're working towards so I'm just gonna scoot it a little bit more peanut butter now so now if you've got it like this it's coming together so now we're just gonna knead it a little bit so I said it should be like dough you're just gonna need this up a little bit and then I'm just gonna take pieces of it and I'm just gonna kind of roll it trying to get it roll it into a rope here about the size of the bottom of my cup the diameter of my cups and then you're going to cut about quarter inch discs I only need sex we got a lot of dough here then we're going to take two of them and stock them together like so now if you used butter yours are going to be a little bit looser if you use the shortening they're going to be a lot firmer and that's because there's no water in shortening there is they go two to three percent of water in butter so we got those gonna get my cuffs well then we're gonna take two of those disks and squish them down your mold and then you can take your tray and you're gonna work them so you just want to make sure to fill in your cup until it's almost right to the top of the where your chocolate is cuz you know on the Reese cups it's a very very thin layer of chocolate over your top so you want the build up to almost the top you just want to leave just like a little millimeter or so of space for your chocolate topping and you want to try and make sure that's even as possible I said mine's a little bit stiffer yours if you use the butter will be smoother and they will flatten out nicely and evenly into your molds when you smack them down like so and for your extra peanut butter if you've got it you can just store it in a in any kind of airtight container and use at or at a later date trying to pop those into the fridge for about half hour now here is a peanut butter one the center that I made up earlier this I used with cannabutter so you can see it's a lot looser and more workable it's not as stiff as the one with the shortening and so this one as I said when you put it in to your mole into them into the complet cup and you smack them down they just spread out really nice so now for our chocolate bars what I've done is I added my my shortening I melted my shortening and I added it on into my chocolate and you're just gonna mix that around with it kind of all coated and we're gonna you're gonna about your chocolate in your preferred method alright so you've got your melted chocolate now it's really important to stir it well not vigorously because we don't want to create a ton of air bubbles but we want to make sure that it is well well stirred so that our shortening is properly incorporated into the chocolate and you'll know that by there will be no streaks it's going to be one uniform color and texture you won't see any kind of streaking now I've lined up just put a piece of parchment paper down so it can catch any of the excess that we scrape off so that none goes to waste and if you don't thoroughly stir it like so to make sure that the shortening is properly and well incorporated is you'll end up with streaks in your chocolate you don't want that you want to have that really pretty solid look to it okay once you're happy with your chocolate before we put it into the mold we're gonna top it out a little bit to get out some of those air bubbles so you're gonna shake it agitate it and there we go and they're just going to pour it into our molds now when you're pouring your molds again you want to do it nice and evenly fairly quickly and evenly so that you get that nice smooth if you do it in kind of sections pour a little bit shake it out you'll end up with different layer looks to it you don't want to have that basically oh look at that I calculated that pretty good and then you want to get a spatula spatula like that and you're gonna go hold it straight to the top OOP and just go straight along this will pull off your excess [Applause] off your edges I was gonna give this a final little shake and tap down any excess get out any of the excess uh uh access air bubbles want to make sure those sides are clean so you take out a nice even nice clean chocolate and once you're happy with your mold it's gonna go into the fridge for 20 for a minimum of 20 minute it needs that time to crystalline to crystalline crystallize something like that it's a technical term in chocolate to let it come back together so it needs at least I said 20 minutes in the fridge do not put it in the freezer to speed this up it needs to be the fridge so while our chocolate bars are setting we can put the tops on to our peanut butter cups so I just remounted my chocolate my the remainder of my Hershey's chocolate here and we are going to just add a little bit to the top and just smooth it out easier key spoon camera we just want a nice thin coating just seal up that top smack her down so you're just gonna smack them down until the tops are nice and even and then you're gonna pop these back into the fridge for 20 minutes to let that talk chocolates set and then we are gonna take everything out and see how everything looks all right so the chocolate bars are set now if you don't want to get fingerprints on your nice pretty chocolate you want to use latex or rubber gloves so you take them out of the refrigerator well let them sit for just about 30 seconds a minute and then we're gonna give them a good smoke whoops one broke not too hard and you need to flip them over and there we go beautiful chocolate bars and I'll show you once they get to room temperature that they will actually stay set it won't bring out the peanut butter cups and check those puppies out now here's one thing I want to show you you might see on some of the chocolate here there's some slight imperfections it's not completely smooth and clear it's nice and smooth and shiny that was because there was some my mold was not a hundred percent clean I thought it was your molds have to be really a hundred percent clean with hot soapy water and completely dry otherwise that will happen to your chocolate so well let's have a look at our peanut butter cups and we'll wrap this the puppy up oh sorry and then for your just for your chocolate or to keep them you want to use a thin some thin tin foil and just wrap them up like a little Christmas present I'm not very good at wrapping presents but there you got it and then you can always make your own wrappers just from you can print out on paper you can make your own paper wrappers for them all right so I got my peanut butter cup set now if there's any chocolate kind of stuck to the to your cupcake liner and the tin you just want to scrape that make sure that's loose and then you should be able to just take up there we got our peanut butter cups so let's have a look at one of these suckers there we go so what I do to avoid is for the edges what I would recommend them to do two rounds of coating the edges and that will help take care of that issue there and then have a look inside of them so you can see if you've made these before you would just open them up they would have squished all out and check out those insides looks just like a peanut butter cup isn't that cool and these taste so good with so much reduced sugar to all those other recipes out there and in a way that you can actually make them vegan or let's see vegan yeah if you use the vegetable shortening and you use the tapioca starch with the you can use powdered sugar I think that's not an issue but if you don't want to use powdered sugar you can increase the tapioca a little bit and use honey or maple syrup or a guard at not a car I got I got syrup one of those replacement syrups you can use that as a sweetener and avoid the sugar all together you just has a sin to have to increase that tapioca somewhat you just kind of have to work to get till you get to that text that consistency texture but other than that that's why demonstration there for you today if you have any questions at all as always please don't hesitate to ask and I gotta get this stuff off my fingers and and I

don't", "VeH8zfDrt9k": "[Music] hi welcome to infuse these the cooking show where everything is infused especially me today we're making lollipops this episode is brought to you by the body fast herbal infuse er you can save money on my favorite herbal infusion machine with the cove ruff house at the urban futurecom here's what you need to make infused lollipops you need 1 cup of granulated white sugar I have a cup of light corn syrup or a quarter cup of water and 2 to 3 tablespoons of infused tincture you can use alcohol or glycerin tinctures 2 teaspoons of flavored extract such as orange lemon mint or whatever flavor you like 6 to 8 drops of food coloring which is optional you'll also need some lollipop molds and a candy thermometer the first step is going to be to make your tincture if you don't have one already and you can use a vegetable glycerin or an alcohol tincture either way though you're going to need to deke are you for 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes then put them in the hopper of the mighty fast if you're using that machine and then you're going to add in about a liter of 151 proof alcohol you don't want to go to the hundred ninety or any stronger with the herb oil infuser machine it will burn it up and then you choose the mighty long cycle that'll give you the right temperature so that four hours later you have a nice tincture just like this then you just need to strain it through the provided hemp cloth or whatever cheesecloth however you want to strain it out put it in a jar and then you have your your infused tincture that you can use for any kind of recipes such as this here now we're gonna proceed along now with the rest of the recipe we're gonna take our two sugars our that's both the corn syrup and the white sugar or put those into a very small saucepan I'm gonna put that over a medium to medium-high heat and just let it start melting and you also want ahead and add your water and at this point what we're doing is we're just making all this syrup turn into sort of a simple syrup and then we're gonna bring it up to a boil it won't be long all of yours Sugar's will be cooked together it'll turn real clear and start boiling and at that point you want to start monitoring the temperature make sure you have a candy different a candy thermometer that will go up to over 300 degrees because that's we're gonna do we're gonna boil this it'll take a little while but watch it very carefully because it can get hot really fast once it starts getting hot but as soon as it hits 300 degrees exactly we're gonna take that off of the heat [Music] and then that part we're gonna let it start cooling down now you're going to also monitor the cooling process because when eight hits to 250 degrees Fahrenheit that's where we want to start adding in the rest of the ingredients so I'm adding I'm using orange because I want to orange flavored lollipops here so magadh about two teaspoons of the orange flavoring then I'm also I'm heading in some yellow food coloring a little bit of red food coloring to make the orange lollipops and now I'm adding in the tincture you can use two to three tablespoons here I'm adding two I don't want to be too strong but you can add in two to three and you can evaporate it down if you want to first but it's gonna be okay but you can see now when I start mixing anything together it's still 250 degrees so it's going to start evaporating and bubbling out the remaining water for you already we're just going to continue mixing that down by hand very carefully it's still very hot until you see it'll all incorporate together and become very sort of translucent and sort of unified in color and you need to move pretty quickly here because you don't want to the candy to harden up which it does pretty quickly so you can put the lollipop sticks into the molds in advance and you won't have to be rushing through it like we did there but then we're going to pour that carefully pour the candy into the molds until you cover up the sticks of the lollipops and then after you have all your molds filled up you're gonna let that chill best in the refrigerator or freezer for one to two hours till they get fully hardened [Music] and once they're fully hardened you can pop them out of the shells really easy you can use these silicone molds that I used here they're perfect for this this recipe had filled up three of the molds that came with four in the pack but just filled up three of them came with the sticks if you like that mighty fast herbal infuser and these kind of recipes please

up everybody my name is Sarah P and welcome back to the haze today I'm coming at you with another edible review today we're gonna be doing the spicy chamoy sweeter high gummy is now sweeter hi is a company I believe based in California they do a lot of different products I think they do like vaporizers edibles so on and so on on their website I couldn't find too much information on them specifically but they say they specialize in high quality lead which I think all these companies do anyway at this point these guys are the 300 milligrams on the packaging and it does not tell you which how much milligrams is in each candy strip which is the hard part but on the back to tell you the nutrition it has lots of sugar so if that's something that concerns you be aware of that but they are very very delicious let's just go into opening them they have one of these on them not one of those child safety loved ones again they don't tell you how much milligrams they're in each strip but here is one of the strips now I personally don't like sour candies I don't have a high tolerance for sours but if you do you will absolutely love them they're very similar sour points you like sour patch kids those aren't these are for you I'm sure these are gonna be good the spiciness too is also not overwhelming and if you're not really into spice this won't really hurt you it's gonna be like comparable to like those little sweet Mexican candies with the spice around it those those are the most similar to these other than the sour being like obviously really overwhelming for me this flavor on these guys are really really good I haven't tried the other flavors but the spicy and the sweet the combination is super super nice the high so for me from those guys you do get high I wanted to say that it feels like 300 milligrams I ate an entire pack of these in one day and it felt like probably like a hundred and fifty so I don't know who does their testing but yeah it's definitely if you're looking for 300 milligrams this will be a little bit of a fall short but if you're looking for 150 labeled 300 this is for you it was not overwhelming high either I didn't get those little butterflies feelings in my tummy I just started a little giggly I'm always feeling the loose and then I fell asleep which is a thing I gotta say about edibles they will make you knock out I fell asleep like 7 p.m. and woke up at 11 so if you want to sleep these are a great sleep aid honestly um I don't know why they didn't get me super high and just made me sleepy usually both come together but I don't know maybe way to hit me or maybe it was what I was doing that day but yes these will make you sleep won't make you get extremely high won't make you get paranoid will make you get in your head but if you're looking sleep these guys are a great option also for smell wise in my last standing a video a lot of people are wondering about the smell I get no THC flavor no THC smell but if you're looking for something and that can be really hot on the low somebody can take in public something that you're afraid someone might smell it in your backpack person like that you won't get this with this this you don't smell any THC no oil nothing even in the flavor you couldn't you couldn't tell the difference between this and a regular candy to be honest so yeah if I was you and I saw these guys at the dispensary it's 300 milligrams I got these for 15 bucks I would get because oh I I'll be honest a lot of these kind of packaging a lot of these kind of candies I don't pick up when I see they don't seem to hit very well for me they always seem to be disappointing but these guys were actually something I have now revisited this is the second time I bought it and I didn't I don't regret it I think they're they're they're fun so if you want something a little bit different you're tired of cushy punches you're tired of lemonade's you're tired of the whole shebang you guys see the speeder hire any other gummies I'm sure they're all the same I would pick it up so again my name is Sara P thank you so much for watching the haze please follow us at our Instagram at the haze channel also hit that subscribe button on our YouTube please leave a comment below let me know if there's an edible you want me to review I will go out and find it so thank you guys so much for

turn it on medium heat medium-high heat and you keep it there stirring until it starts to boil and then you stop stirring it till all the sugar dissolves in Sirte candy thermometer in [Music] and the instructions say don't stir after your magic potion concoction I do potion so I couldn't say it yeah that see the other one I had to stir until it reached 300 and then put the stuff in well THC starts being killed at about 300 so I always wondered why are you putting it in yeah this is much [Music] we've reached boiling yep we've reached boiling now it's time to insert a candy thermometer there I go I'll put it over by the handle maybe it'll stay a little better I like to do not stir while it's being communal diselle you can see their temperature turn that to bake your phone at the same time it's got quite a ways to go wow that's a long time yeah I think we're gonna pause this of her well", "ApOaamySTOU": "hey guys i am so excited to announce built bars new flavor raspberry cheesecake i am so excited i actually have already tried this so this isn't like a first impressions with you but i will tell you this it tastes exactly like those raspberry butter cookies that have the raspberry jelly in the center i love those cookies i will have to tell you i actually have been thinking about those cookies and when i took my first bite out of this that's exactly what reminded me of those cookies this is so good it's very fluffy very like that musketeer candy bar texture just like the cookies and cream the cookie dough like it's just the texture is so great so the macros on this is 17 grams of protein we got five grams of sugar five net carbs um 140 calories and the fat is 2.5 grams of fat so um oh my gosh i am just so excited about this flavor i'm gonna tell you i'm definitely buying a box of these i am really really just happy about being a build bar ambassador this like tops my list of like accomplishments that i have done in my life like i it's just such an exciting thing for me and i i just like can't tell you like i just feel so lucky and to be able to try new flavors early and to you know basically sample them and be able to tell you guys about them and i so good so i'm gonna take a bite and show you what it looks like on the inside because i tell you what it's it's just it's so good there's legit real pieces of raspberry so white chocolate so if you've never tried their white chocolate and you like raspberry i highly recommend this their white chocolate is incredible incredible i have tried other white chocolates or keto white chocolate and not my fave this way chocolate is so good every white chocolate bar i've tried from them is on point and with the raspberry and this white chocolate it just goes together so well so let's take a little bite oh my god oh my god i just got that that raspberry cookie taste and it's like who needs those cookies it has real chunks of raspberry in there real chunks of raspberry so you get that nice texture of the like raspberry when you're chewing it and i think that makes all the difference i think if it didn't have that texture of the raspberry it'd still probably be good let's just be real but that texture just elevates it and the white chocolate with the raspberry i'm telling you if you love those raspberry cookies you need this because i'm not kidding you i used to kill a whole box of those back in the day and oh my god this just brings me brings back that flavor for 140 calories and 17 grams of protein and five grams of net carbs you just cannot beat it so i highly highly recommend this bar i would definitely be ordering probably two boxes of these oh my god i'm buying something i'm obsessed with bull bars george and i just cannot get enough of these new flavors and this just beats it this makes it to my top five like real quick so anyway guys get yourself some of these these go live at 2 a.m eastern standard time and i will definitely be staying up and getting some but definitely use code hk socco to save 10 and just so you know you can use my code as many times as you want it's not just a one-time use thing and if there is a sale on the website you can use my code for additional off and sometimes they have freebies and everything so always get you know especially if there's a brand that you want to purchase from or you purchase a lot from you know i check daily because you never know what's going on with websites and flash sales and stuff like that so definitely i would suggest signing up for emails because things pop up so anyway get yourself some raspberry cheese cook oh my gosh if you love those butter cookies with the raspberry i'm telling you you get that taste and uh i don't need those cookies no more and this solves everything so thank you guys so much for watching let me know if you're gonna be picking up any of these raspberry cheesecakes and go belt man i am telling you go built because i they just keep topping each flavor and it's like i keep saying this is my favorite this is my favorite but it's like how can you choose when they're just so incredibly good you just you just can't and again if you haven't tried their white chocolate this is the time to try it because they don't always have the white chocolate all the time so um excelente excellente so awesome job built thank you guys so much for watching definitely pick up some build bars and i'll see you guys all later", "gRahhO7E9Rg": "what's up everybody my name is Sarah B and welcome to the haze today we were gonna be doing an edible review BAM the standard this guy is the hybrid Andrea this guy is pineapple first off let me just tell you guys I cannot find anything about this company online no website is on the box there's no no website I can find it you search their name so I have no idea where these guys come from I have no idea about their background but whatever you guys are using the balm products let's just go on the pineapple which is here in the indica the flavor that these guys have is is is the these guys I can honestly say are the best tasting gummies I've ever had obviously Medicaid they come in these little packets so this is a 200 milligrams so these guys are each 50 there's four of them and they taste they taste like they taste familiar but they are so good I love these also they don't come GUI like that my just melted I didn't make just I absolutely love these got me he's like I'm kind of obsessed I'm never going back they are also generally when it comes to your mood and how you on them you're gonna be kind of happy at least for me and my experiences have been very uplifting and they've been very positive I don't go in any type of cycle as well at least for me they're not overly strong what is really great so if you want something where you're gonna be able to like lay around your house and watch TV these are a perfect choice so if you find yourself in California or if you live in California and you're in the Southern California region at least I know that I see these from time to time and I would pick one up they also are at a really great price especially compared to sake and because you punch I only compare them because they're both gummies these you will find much cheaper again my name is Sarah P thank you so much for watching the channel the haze and again this is your guys who have cannabis

another gummy I always say don't be a dummy don't buy a gummy but today for you guys it smells good though you can smoke through the packaging I have purchased yet another gummy because people told me the flourish flourish F flourish gummies are really great and that I will actually get quite stoned off of them so this is a hundred and fifty milligram edible it has been rated by the SE labs which means that you know it really does have 150 milligrams of THC in there like the packaging a lot very fancy packaging oh so if you haven't tuned in two weeks before you probably wondering why I happen to tell with me well that's because I like to have a little fat with gummy edibles as a good way of ensuring that the THC hits your bloodstream so ask us where if any gummy review I always take a little spoonful and Nutella or spatula for and until a beforehand so that way I can take the edible and your optimal conditions and with gummies you want to be doing this under optimal conditions alright so here we go mmm great every time so I got my fat in my bite let's open up the flourish again really fancy packaging look at that that's so cool well shiny we that we so we gotta open up here and it's in four or pyramid-shaped chunks this is the mango hybrid flavor hybrid being the strange some kind of hybrid we'd strain mango being the flavor oh it smells great smells like mango let's give it a taste almost choked on it well that tastes a lot better than a lot of the other gummi edibles this tastes a lot better than like it appears or infuse creations any of those it has very little weed taste I mean it does have Sun but but totally fun mmm very jelly like a jello like texture kind of hard to chew in fact all right guys well I'm gonna finish these last two cubes here and I will see you in two hours to let you know if this SC or excuse me flourish h1 50 mango hybrid gummy is actually working keep your fingers crossed for me guys because I would really love a potent gummy I will see you in two hours to let you know thanks for watching weeds guys I am back it's been two hours since I had the flourish mango 150 milligram edible and I think I finally found the gummy for me maybe it's too early to tell what just a sample size of one I don't know if anything's different about me but man this gummy it's not perfect I'm not the highest I've ever been at 150 milligrams but I am high I am definitely high which is a lot more than I can say for even 375 milligram gummy add or candy edibles that I've had in the past and certainly higher than that I like how it tasted too I tasted pretty good um I like the packaging and I kind of like the high it's it's it's it's more of like a body sort of high whatever hybrid strain and it's kind of great pretty happy with this I've got another one to review of their 300 milligram errs coming up and I hope it is twice as strong as this one if it is I will be in seventh heaven guys I might have finally found the gummy out there for me whoever recommended the flourish gummies thank you I'm glad I tried this and I am definitely looking forward to giving the 300 milligram a shot as well fingers crossed it's not just an anomaly or a fluke and that these are really the the the real deal in gummy land but I will be sure to review more and let you know for sure guys again I'm excited I'm excited thank you so much for

extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here we\nadded a teaspoon and a quarter of food glycerin just to disperse the shatter\nin here now this is a little tricky to do so we've got to move quick here here\nwe go and basically that is it okay

store near you as of now you can make them at home but it is illegal for anyone to buy and/or sell them to the public Canada's proposed edible pot regulations have been made public and the 60-day consultation process has come to an end under the proposed federal rules a single serving would be limited to 10 milligrams of THC the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis and each serving must be individually wrapped this is considered a low to moderate dose of THC this dosage limit is sugar than in Colorado Washington or California where multiple servings are allowed per package so for example in a chocolate bar each breakable square can contain 10 milligrams each for a total of 100 milligrams pot meant for ingestion cannot have alcohol have limited caffeine and come in a plain child-resistant package the draft regulations say the products must not be appealing to youth and the packaging can't advertise dessert or confectionery flavors so no gummies shaped like bears one of the problems which were legalizing edibles were kids so kids came into the kitchen saw this wonderful nicely colored marijuana edibles and as kids to try it out the proposed rules are an attempt to address one of the main issues with edibles making sure they don't cause risk to public health especially for those who are underage but some are worried the black market will continue to thrive which are strict regulations a major cannabis edibles manufacturing California says it's been difficult to navigate within the legal market because there's still so much competition in the illicit market people that are heavy consumers of cannabis and like to ingest it can ingest you know hundreds if not thousands of milligrams of THC in a day and so if they have products that are available in the illicit market that are much cheaper and have a much higher potency they're gonna tend to go towards that so a problem with edible marijuana is that people are not used to it with edibles the effects can later and the people's oh I have now done this edible marijuana and there feel nothing and they'd more and more to avoid putting people at risk it would be better to start with low dosage and once we have clear evidence the black market is still thriving then we can reevaluate Health Canada confirms they've received 7,000 responses from Canadians industry representatives the provinces and the

this all right so dollar fifty i'd say it's in the middle of the road for a conventional style tile pre-workout it's definitely in the middle of the road definitely not cheap definitely not expensive i'd say it's in the middle of the road okay so let's get into that label time right label time because we want to know what the [ __ ] is in this thing right vitamin d3 nice to see some vitamin d3 in there it's 70 micrograms vitamin b6 7 or 7 vitamin b6 5 milligrams right vitamin b12 100 micrograms zinc 30 milligrams sodium 150 milligrams potassium 100 milligrams uh boron boron boron three milligrams so you got your vitamin d3 nice to see vitamin d3 in there you got your vitamins your your b vitamins nice to see that in there you got some sodium potassium so you got a little bit electrolytes uh the b vitamins are going to give you energy and just get your get you get you going a little bit um so citrulline malate six thousand milligrams gonna help you with pumps and blood flow beta alanine four thousand milligrams i like to see four thousand milligrams um i think 3.2 is you know this this this standard thing you know it's the conventional style it's the it's the clinical dosage blah blah blah but i actually like to see it with more that way you feel it more is more better i don't know is it is it worse to do less i would say no i think four thousand milligrams is a nice dosage though so gonna going to help with really activating build up give you that fuzzy feeling you know that something's happening that warm sensation and uh give you the tingles bcaas two to one one four thousand milligrams instantize i really don't care about bcaas in a pre-workout i think it's just kind of silly and it kind of just fills up the scooper and i just don't really like to see it in there i just think it has no real reason to even be in here just my [ __ ] thoughts all right just my thoughts be it beta pure which is a patented version of btn anhydrous can help with power output endurance and help you go longer the jam 2.5 milligrams um or 2.5 grams super solid dosage taurine 1300 milligrams super solid doses can help with overall performance and hydration tyrosine thousand milligrams can help us from the nootropic action nice dosage of that pheny this is where it gets interesting 360 milligrams of theanine theanine is like an anti-anxiety agent it kind of calms the storm a little bit um and kind of just doesn't prevent it's an anti-crash it helps you not crash after the workout and everything so the athenian is super high in this which is interesting because the caffeine is half of that so um alpha gpc 300 milligrams kind of a little bit under dosed it's uh nootropic can help you with focus and everything then you have um caffeine antihydrous immediate energy 180 milligrams which is half the amount of fenin okay gonna give you immediate energy theobromine 50 milligrams uh low dosage of that this is going to help you with overall stimulant overall performance a little bit of energy infinergy 30 milligrams super low dosage of that it's going to be a little bit sustained slow slow releasing type of caffeine and then estrogen for absorption at 25 milligrams all right so you're by asking yourself how does this thing taste this is blue raspberry flavored and this is um stevia sweeten so i didn't know a stevia sweetened before i tried it but i could tell you i knew it after that i was like man this flavor is really different interesting so let's go and do the taste test segment i'm gonna throw in that clip right now and i'll be back to wrap my final thoughts all right on my way to the gym trying transparent labs blue raspberry bulk pre-workout first time by the way i do like the shaker cup this is [ __ ] awesome it's got like a locking mechanism on the top so like you have to push the button and then pull it up it's got a push button pretty cool made by blender bottle stuff's transparent literally um no colors none of that [ __ ] one scoop 12 ounces taste test here we go okay it's a little um it's a little bitter a little tart not the greatest blue ride i've ever had in my life but shake it up a little bit more i can't tell if it's sweet with stevia right now i think that's what's causing the bitterness i'm about to look at the label i think this is sweet with stevia there's no way it's okay not amazing yeah it's just drinkable um it's not entirely enjoyable drinkable uh as far as ratings yeah keeping it real over here guys i'll give it i give it a 6.75 it's uh it's definitely below average so um 6.75 and other than that let's get back to the uh the effects section of the review all right as you can see honestly i was not a fan of the flavor it's just barely drinkable that stevia just comes in and just it uh it stays there it stays there it stays there on your taste buds you know is it horrible no is it good no is it drinkable yes so it's in the drinkable category guys it's in the drinkable category definitely has that bitterness and um that bitterness stevia tastes and it kind of does linger on your taste buds but as tj was saying who the [ __ ] cares about flavor and who the [ __ ] cares about the label it's all about what happens the effects and how it actually plays in the [ __ ] gym right doesn't [ __ ] matter right it just depends on the god damn effects in the [ __ ] gym okay all right so enough talking about that let's get into the actual effects um i always take notes when i when i do reviews and it kind of just keeps me standard on uh on all my reviews because you know however i'm feeling that day might might be subjective so that's why i like to run it a couple days two days sometimes is 20 days is about the minimum i'd like to run something um if the two of them are very consistent then i'll just call it two if two of them are inclusive like one was a little bit different the other then i'll do a third day just to kind of make sure so like i said i took this for two days and i'm gonna go over each category real quick and tell you what i thought so let's start off the beta alanine it is medium to high bed allen you definitely feel it it's medium to high um as far as the feeling you definitely get the itchies the scratches the whole [ __ ] itchy and scratchy the [ __ ] simpsons you get all that right medium to high on that so you're definitely going to feel the beta alanine all right so the low to medium energy as you can see the energy was only at 180 milligrams plus the theanine right so it's not super energy if it's not super crazy energy it's not even medium energy it's low to medium energy but it is smooth it doesn't actually hit you at all really it just comes in slowly and then leaves slowly all right so medium pumps gotta call pumps solid medium pumps okay medium sense of urgency medium focus medium motivation and um no mood support there's no anything that gets you in the good so you know the good happy feeling there's no like antidepressant type thing feeling like [ __ ] none of that it's just no mood support whatsoever and um what else did i note here i noted that um oh the taste lingers in the pre-workout for sure i think i already talked about that a little bit ago the taste does linger like you know i was in the gym drinking my bcaas and [ __ ] and i'm like man there's it's still in my taste buds a little bit so that stevia does linger a little bit okay on the pre-workout but most people don't care about the flavor and pre-workout some people do i do care about it to an extent is it an end i'll be all know um and where would i classify this pre-workout as i would classify it honestly as a solid daily driver a solid low stem daily driver is what i should say okay um so it does hit all the angles that you're typically looking for in a pre-workout this is not for stem junkies this is for uh this is for beginners and intermediates um and that's my thoughts um it's definitely good for cycling off all the crazy stims and [ __ ] like that um yeah so the only thing i could really say is that i didn't like about this product because i don't like the bcaas in here and i don't like and i didn't like the taste of the pre-workout overall um you know i wasn't enjoying the the taste over it but if you guys want to pick this up like i said use opera men on their website and get you 10 percent off transparent labs is doing some [ __ ] over there uh they're transparent and they keep everything open so you got to give them credit for that and other than that there is no artificial colors or anything like that i forgot to mention that um and it is naturally flavored so that's probably why it doesn't taste the greatest so i mean you can't you can't really bash them too much when they're with the whole natural route natural flavoring and stevia what do you expect especially with ingredients that you have to try to mask so it is what it is hope you guys enjoyed this video make

you're going to need some gushers eggs to put them in tincture and a syringe needle all you need to do is use your syringe needle to get some tincture and put it into each of your gushers now if you measure out your tincture in advance you can know approximately how much is in each so if you do a tablespoon of tincture you can divide it by however many gushers you end up filling and that's how you can figure out how many milligrams is in each gusher i have not yet tried this with coconut oil but i believe it would work as long as you melted enough so the syringe would be able to pull it up

"- [Chase] So when's the\nlast time you took acid? - Actually, yesterday morning. - [Chase] Some people would be surprised that a mom would take\ndrugs on a regular basis. - That's good, I'm covering it quite well. (laughing) - [Chase] Taking a tiny amount of what have long been\nconsidered recreational drugs is known as microdosing, and it's the latest trend. - There are claims it\ncan improve creativity and concentration, but not\nmany studies have been done into the effects of microdosing, and it's illegal. - [Chase] Office workers are\ntrying it for efficiency, parents for anxiety, and\nSilicon Valley tech bros are using it as the\nlatest productivity hack. - You can put microdoses\nof LSD in your cereal, and people will call you a pioneer. - [Chase] But does this\ntiny hit of psychedelics actually work, or is it\nall just in our minds? (upbeat music) - [Teresa] This is my middle age mom-ness with my Vera Bradley pouch. - [Chase] I love it. (Teresa laughing) - My name's Teresa, I'm a mom, and I work in tech. I grew up on the East\nCoast in North Carolina. Born into a pretty conservative family. Maybe I was dropped off\nby hippies, I don't know, 'cause I completely\ndidn't turn out that way. - Microdosing LSD, like Teresa is doing may be popular now, but the drug has a long\nand complicated history. It begins in 1938 when a Swiss chemist by the name of Albert Hoffman created LSD by mistake. He then ingested it five years\nlater for the first time. And from there the drug took off. By the late 1940s, LSD was\nbeing studied around the world and used for psychological therapy. The study of psilocybin\nmushrooms soon followed. In the 1950s, the CIA used LSD in hopes of discovering\nmind controlling properties. Yeah, that didn't pan out. In the 60s, while psychedelics gave birth to the counter-culture movement. At that time, LSD was legal. But stories of bad trips, a\nvolatile political climate, and the beginning of the war on drugs led to it being outlawed. And the conversation began to shift from the drug's potential benefits, to its perceived harm. - America's public enemy\nnumber one is drug abuse. - There is nothing\ngrownup or sophisticated in taking an LSD trip at all, they're just being complete fools. (crowd cheering) - [Chase] Shockingly, outlawing LSD didn't actually stop people from doing it, and experimenting with it. But the current trend of taking microdoses to unlock creativity and\ncrank up productivity really took off in 2011, when James Fadiman published his book, \"The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide\". - Since it became illegal,\n26 million Americans have tried LSD. - Fadiman said the regular use of small doses of psychedelics, usually one tenth of a recreational dose, had the ability to boost mood, and increase productivity, without the perception altering effects. - I was introduced to\nmicrodosing about a year ago. After having children, I had been on and off anti-depressants for about 10 years. The anti-depressant I was taking kind of takes you out of the lows. But it really doesn't\nlike spark creativity. I sometimes will do microdosing when I have to be in a very\nintense social environment where I feel like I really have to be up. It kind of helps me\nget me out of my shell, and a little less self conscious. It's all the great\neffects of psychedelics, without the, what I would call, the debilitating effects. - To be clear, this is illegal. And because of that, Teresa\nand other microdosers are largely doing it on their own. And because it's illegal, understanding its potential benefits has long been put on the back burner. But the conversation is shifting, and it's opening the\ndoor to early studies, like one being led by Dr. David Erritzoe, a clinical psychiatrist at\nthe Imperial College London. He's found a way to\nnavigate around the system to study the drugs anyway. And he's doing it legally. - We are not doing any sort\nof controlled clinical trial. We are doing online prospective\nnaturalistic surveys. So we are basically tapping\ninto real people's real use of their own drugs. - Dr. Erritzoe is asking participants to use their own drugs in their own home, and set up their own experiments. Then report the results back to his team. - We are making this sort\nof intermediate trial that's between completely\nuncontrolled survey, and a clinical trial. - This is not a lab-based clinical trial. Conditions aren't carefully controlled, and it relies on self reporting. But Dr. Erritzoe hopes his study, due to be published in 2021, can help kickstart the science and be the seed for proper trials. - Whether or not the microdosing will perform better than placebo, we don't know. A lot of people don't respond\nto conventional therapies for depression, for anxiety, for post-traumatic stress. I'm curious about, does it work? What does it work for? How do we optimize it? How do we make it safe? And then they can generate\nhypothesis for future funding, for proper trials on a larger scale, if it turns out that it looks promising. - [Chase] In the meantime, advocates for microdosing like Teresa say they will continue to do it, because it's transformed their lives. - It does change your mind. It breaks down these barriers. I think in modern society, we're really hitting up\nagainst those established sort of social norms. And I think that's scary for a\nlot of people in our society. - There are so many people\nsuffering mental health. It can potentially help\nmillions of people, and therefore it is important to get extra tools in our toolboxes in terms of ways of trying to\naddress it and help people. - Microdosing helped me find\nclarity over the past year. I was just sort of\nresigned to the fact that maybe my career had like\ngone into like a low gear. It really gave me the next level energy to sort of fight those assumptions. Thinking about ways to move forward, and be more creative versus\ndwelling on the past. - Thanks for watching. For more Dope Science content, check out our website.

"all right so today I'm going to show you some snaps that you can take to college with you that I personally take with me the first thing and these are easy transportable things either Scooby Snacks there are 80 calories for one package and they normally come in a big box I think 20 from their box I love them then Quaker peanut butter chocolate chewy dip bars are so so so so good and I'll go ahead and show you the bar and I'll put it in a ziplock baggie that's what it looks like it has quite a bit of peanut butter on it that's what looks like in the middle so you can see the chocolate chips and the granola then these are the absolute best bars ever these are the chewy bar kids and they have them in peanut butter and jelly flavor which i think is gross but you know whatever peanut butter peanut butter and jelly floats your boat go for it oh these the peanut butter ones are 140 calories this is only a hundred because as chocolate on the bottom and a chocolate drizzle it's really really really good I like them too what next alright little little muffin there Little Debbie and they look exactly like they're in the package so I'm not going to open them then one package is 190 calories for four muffins which isn't really that great but they're so good and if you only eat if you count your calories you can easily add these in next I have peanut butter cups from Trader Joe's I just need to be your knees you get three of these for 180 calories and I'll show you one they smell so the smell of an Oreo just wonderful I'm gonna eat them next are the mix their dark chocolate and then when you bite into them it's mint they're so social so good they're pretty small you only get actually get six pieces for a hundred and seventy calories so that's actually a lot better than I was thinking that's what the middle looks like no so good it's unreal and this maximal squish like these I took a sandwich box these were three for $1 at Walmart and you can put as many as you want in there Yuma crackers peanut butter crackers or great snacks take and that they don't get all smushed up because nobody wants to eat a smashed up cracker next we have dark chocolate and milk chocolate covered two cones these are amazing um you get Oh almond sorry you get 1/4 of a cup for 200 calories that's what it looks like they're so good here's the dark chocolate okay last one we have emerald breakfast on the go they have these in several different flavors but I like the s'mores oh my gosh these are so good we enriched for them to Walmart we looked for them at Kroger we looked for them everywhere but that we finally found them today at Meijer and we bought four boxes they were a two for five you get one pouch of 200 calories and I would not if you have children I would not recommend giving this to your young children in the back of the car or something because it will go everywhere for doubt okay these I can't even explain to you the deliciousness okay so the first thing you have our honey roasted peanuts in here you have cocoa roasted almonds for the chocolate part of the s'more you have granola clusters which are so good that I just I love granola you add milk chocolate candies and mittens to be honest graham cracker squares these are their kind of look we're but they taste really good mini marshmallows and then you have shaved coconut you this does actually not taste like coconut at all if it didn't say shaved coconut on the package I would never know that this is misshaped coconut because I can get taste like white chocolate I thought it was just another chocolate element of the it really doesn't have a flavor I don't think you got it just tastes like playing like a plain crunchy piece to eat with the others so so so so good I would so highly recommend these and you get quite a bit for 200 calories and a lot of those calories come from the peanuts and almonds and the make marshmallows and everything else that's in it but I'll save it in the sandwich box maybe and this isn't one that I would normally put in the sandwich box but I wanted to open and show you so this is the cup that I tank I got it at Walmart for five dollars I think it has a nice twist on cap and it has that little little stopper on the straw so it doesn't slide out I'll show you a cheap little drink that I make to take to MIT to take with me you just take some ice then you can use an orange a lime a lemon it doesn't matter I'm gonna save the lime or a lemon I mean and lemons right now I bought this for 50 Cent's and you can just take it and slice it up and I don't like to leave it in slices like this because the straw it's hard to maneuver it around pull slices so just to put them into slices like that you can squeeze them in you can let it sit let it sit for about 30 minutes in the fridge or overnight what I would recommend is letting it sit overnight and then adding ice that morning is what I would do that way the lemonade you skits", "anTFOftvGTI":

see how much I got left one two three four five six seven eight eight left it's 40 milligrams I have enjoyed 60 milligrams and I've taken those at night this is a nice indica helped me to sleep let's see I think the first time no each time I had six for my head seven either way I've taken 25 to 35 milligrams and I feel it's consistent it's good I do recommend the Camino I recommend all Cuba products they deliver potencies their flavor is phenomenal they do that they nail that however when I buy again personally we're good look at this that's a fair amount of gummies one two three four five six seven eight here a lot at eight oh yeah I think I did actually anyway that's a fair amount of gummies to eat but that being said everybody's tolerance is a little different you know my tolerance is less than some more than others I know people who can eat a lot more edibles than me I know people that if they had half to a quarter of this they would get late and probably fall asleep so with all these edible reviews this isn't me talking my experience is how much I take what works for me the most important thing you can do for yourself is experimentally but you know take a couple see if it works that's what I did at first now I know my sweet spot is like 20 to 30 ish depending what I'm doing if I just want a nice little kick nice little feel calm down I have to but right now I'm go for two for five that's thirty milligrams of delicious wildberry indica it reminds me of those Welsh's fruit snacks the wild berry ones I don't know if you've had those flavor is really good I really like their packaging too on this one especially got like a pink Scott pink outdoors got like water running trees it's supposed to transport you to what did I say California state of mind overall five stars because it's a legit product but personally I don't know if I'll buy again just because I have other edibles I like a little more nothing against them I'm definitely gonna get the sativa however I think it's like a pineapple habanero something like that maybe the mango habanero something with some spice in there which I'm excited to try because I love spice I love mixing sweet and spice but I'm going too long here I'm gonna come back to you in about an hour and a half talk to you when uh these indicus kicked in I will label Oh get ready for bed and I'll see you guys okay so I'm gonna be completely transparent here with you I didn't take six of these last night lay down with my girl watch black mirror if you haven't seen that show it's pretty badass anyway I've even finished the episode and I knocked out after six of these it was like a 15 hour work dad maybe that play part in it but like I said the previous two times I've had the you know 25 to 30 it did the trick it mellowed me out i chilled for a while the hay woke up ready to get it feeling great today got a couple truebloods meetings one for the true buds tank top I am excited about and then another one with a local cannabis company and I don't want to save their name because we haven't really committed to anything but should have some fun videos coming through that soon I'll catch you guys on the next one I do give this five stars I do highly recommend it and maybe pass out got Java that's what I want with an indica especially if I'm eating it late at night like Sam I get ready for bed I didn't think I was actually gonna fall asleep and go to bed but it happened it happens when I take it to you I'll stay up I'll make sure to stay up and give you a full review on that one yeah camino a wild berries and i like how for the effect it says chill I feel that the Camino truly encompasses that chill factor just like you it's actually turning in I'll see you on the next one coming at you yeah this is worse than Mary Jane I we ain't do this for my stoners and from my cannabis enthusiast talking edibles ain't bringing comedy let's get it time to pass it to the left and we can have a smoke session hey yeah true love for my troopers light it up and I'm on it this might take me way back sweet man I got five on it and the cutter sativa anything that you need break it down like the weed", "cmNZR1AteH4": "okay so these uh put these edibles recently was a freebie I think they're feels like that but sour gummy kind of stuff it's from those lol edibles companies 300 milligrams I thought this was cool it actually says the strain so ya know to pop these open and check them out I notice there's some stuff here that isn't filled out but I almost think this packaging is in preparation for next year when it when cannabis is actually legal so anyways we'll check him out that's a new strain for me I've never heard of that Pablo Escobar ROG so yeah we'll open these up and take a look okay so the first thing I noticed immediately after opening this is the smell he's just incredibly strong really smelled like weed it's not gummy it's like one one big whoa I thought it was one big piece okay so it's a bunch of little pieces my mom like they're really sweet with a little bit sour on them I don't even taste the herb just working to really smell it it's crazy that's what they look like and I will eat these and get back with you in an hour or so [Music] yeah died within an hour so once the party started and didn't let you know how they are someone be there okay so it's only been about 20 minutes in but so like I said I'll check back in with you here in an hour I just wanted to say that I can feel at least the start of those kicking in 2025 minutes after eating and that's pretty quick longer them than other people so we'll see goes on these I'm used to taking like 250 milligrams like taken for her dose and those said 300 so should be pretty close to what I'm used to stick let me get that in through the end a minute there's been a few okay so it's been a little more than an hour I was waiting to see if it was kicking and any more than I did so it seems like I don't know if just the strain doesn't do it for me or if the milligrams are incorrect or off I don't know but I felt a little bit of an effect at the beginning of eating those and and then nothing after that so I don't think I would buy those yeah cuz I've tried another animal at like 250 milligrams they work for me for may have something to do with the gummy the gummy stuff maybe maybe there's those double digest as well for me or it affect me as well but it seems like the baked goods that have butter and then really affect me whereas these gummy things with just the extract I don't really feel it where I don't metabolize so anyways just one of the way I know my take on those those sour gummies that had the Escobar og from lol lol animals wasn't wasn't one I would buy again but that's okay it was a freebie so it's good to learn now I rather than actually paying for one you don't like there you go thanks for watching hope you liked it", "e6xIaIWI8l8": "it's true buzz TV back with the medical milk-chocolate 120 milligram hybrid bar I'm about to crack into and try for the first time I'll go in for a close-up of the package [Music] [Music] [Music] pretty damn good tasting like keep a bar may have a rival no I just ate one for three just 30 milligrams silly that let's say I come back to you in an hour and a half really message", "Vu774A5ckG8": "so why is afternoon squad

went away but fantastic flavor now like i said not my preferred flavor but it was still pretty good i was actually quite surprised so my overall view of the macaroni cheese is what it looks like red a

tomorrow peace out [Music]", "KU64fZTL2eo": "first of all I want to say I have never done Matt I know my my spelt I feel like I should clarify I am dropped with Alvarado Claire I don't use to have a huge meth problem right I've never done that I've also never skied before which you know is a bit of Carlos in in Colorado you know it's like they say a Colorado family that's happy not skiing is like a Catholic family that's happy [Applause] I can but in erskine I've never done meth before I thought about it never done it and here's why like I said Colorado used a huge meth problem but that is until the Colorado antiemetic project okay which was a seriously psays commercial was billboards which drove many shoots down in Colorado like 90% this is true with the tried and true method of scaring the [ __ ] out of teens mostly right and there were there were a lot of like versions of it but my favorite was there was a billboard right next to my high school which was a picture of just like the gross grungy sink splat covered in blood okay and it said at the top you never think you try to peel off your own skin [Music] meth will change that first of all very effective right like I will never do that as a result of that I'm hoping that you will ever do that as a result of that and maybe some use it's too late I'm saying you look like you can hide but I'm saying you look like you could be possibly the biggest myself too though you know I mean to wear skinny popular but you never see me try to feel our own skin meth will change that what I would love to see would be like a similar style of PSA but for like way less dangerous drugs you know like you never think you try to peel break with your teeth and then use the peel grape sort of like lick bomb on your lips because it looks stupid or chapped we will change that with a stranger about these girls Palestinian conflict in Wendy's for drinks will change that or like or like even everything you try to sort and categorize the entire party size back of flamin hot she goes by size and shape at all [Music] and sing with me that tapes mostly great [Music] deformation it drives clear not from my demeanor I had two teachers when I was at youth who tried to get my parents to put me on adderall to like tell me picture what I was like as I could like picture like Sid from Toy Story meets Chicken Little like do but in a hurry and I have those glasses right but not just the glasses I had glasses with like that strength action strapped right back here right because I was lived a very active lifestyle okay I was doing this a lot apparently with my head and there also they were flexible glasses rent like literally the wires in the classes would bend right because my parents didn't trust me and so there was and there was another girl in my class in the first grade her name was Rachel Wilson and she also had glasses and one day I was just playing with my glasses just bending them as one doesn't want to do and she was I kind of like how do you do that I was like I'm just do it she was like oh snap I went to the principal's office I'm kidding I'm kidding she's rich it was yeah I don't know my heaven on man I am done much cocaine and I've like weed though I've never gotten like crazy with it when an exception which is that when I was back home in Denver over this last Christmas I was hanging on my friend sacks basement he told me Oh Sam by the way that is 50 milligrams for those of you who don't regularly eat marijuana gummies think about like this like in terms of alcohol like eating a 50 milligram gummy is like if instead of doing like a couple shots of alcohol to like kick off your night if instead you just like slam your head in a minivan doing are doing around like it's inscrutable passage maybe the gummy puts on the movie 24 days later and passes out 20 dessert that's life if a zombie movie was written by someone who had just taken a 50 milligrams gummy okay so I'm losing my mind zombies are getting hacked up with machetes that one skinny dudes hooking people's eyes down zombies are eating people's necks and then the climax of the movie this dude who's like chained to a military base and it's grimy zombies it's like it's just people killing people and I look over at my past our friend Zach and I'm like he's of people right settle down when it comes to peace for this girlfriend I'm standing there [Music] because we make eye contact right she like pushes some water thank you and we make contact and I'm like I know that I'm flying other higher than I've ever been but I like I feel like I get closer to earth and we just like we don't we don't say anything but we just like and I'm like I'm so conflicted cuz I'm like I'm in love but I don't know how to tell my friend my friend Zach doesn't have a girlfriend he does have a two-and-a-half-year-old a border collie named Daisy whom I spooned for anywhere from 15 minutes to seven and a half hours [Music] run away so that you can escape society and the shackles of expectations put upon you we will change that [Applause]", "uNqrdej35Es": "hey everybody welcome to ask the anabolic duck starring the anabolic doc Thomas O'Connor brought to you by his website's anabolic dot-com and metabolic dot-com both of which you can get copy of America on steroids a time to heal also available on amazon.com how are you dr. O'Connor sittin up in the rain up here in the rain as you are across town yeah and we're doing good busy you know loving my videos on depot on trend or freaking just blowing out of those out of the roofs I love your videos about d-ball and trends so much I'm totally ripping them off for these videos that's how good they are but I try to make I'm going to try to make this very different so people are like I already watched doctors video it was awesome but I don't need to watch it again with this enough later on so I'm gonna start off before we get into like the good and the bad about d-ball I'll volunteer my first d-ball experiences if you want to or if you don't want to that's up to you you know this is a your how much you're willing to duvall you might lose your contract with Nike or something yeah t-ball was the first drug I tried to get ahold of ten years before I actually started using steroids I was only 17 my Vince was a 16 no I was 17 and I was going to a kickboxing place and there was a kid there so I was like 17 there was a kid there was like 19 he was jacked and he had all these nits all over his back in his shoulders and like mad because I was working out and I was not getting very good results so like wow you know what do you do is like oh are you steroids like oh [ __ ] I said can you get me some steroids he goes yeah yeah what do you want to go I don't know what what's good he goes oh how about some d-ball ago he bought a dynamo okay that sounds great a pill there's no shot okay hook me up so I gave him like a hundred bucks or hundred twenty bucks you know like my week to pay it looking at Burger King or ever the hell I was the time I got a bottle I started taking it and nothing happened I went through the whole I I went through the whole bottle over the course of like a month and so later I figure out his like breath mints he had sold me or something oh my god there's no seal on the bottle I shouldn't I wasn't more I didn't know so I never touched D ball again I know that wasn't real diva so later on I was I was getting ready for my 30th birthday I got in just the only time I've ever gotten in really good shape for anything that wasn't a contest I did a couple TV commercials for valor weightlifting gloves I did a couple photo shoots for ironman magazine but anyway the point is that's when I got I had been off gear 97 was my big year where I started using gear and I was on most of that year off and on then I took off all of 98 most of 99 but then when I decided was going to get in shape again I said I better get some better get holding some good steroids because I want to look good for these of these shoots and there was I wonder if you've heard of this there was a veterinary form of d-ball that was injectable called reform it be yeah so we had a lot of that going around the LA area where I was from Mexico oh and the guy who sold it to me said you know you don't even have to inject this you can just drink it so it was not meant to be ingested I don't think but I was uh I was taking the syringe loading it up to whatever and then squirting in my mouth and it was disgusting but uh yeah from then on off and on after that I started incorporating everyone sound d-ball I always enjoyed it I thought it was a good drug Paul it's just like that's the breakfast of champions I mean that was the drug that we don't want to say the names but you know the old big guys there Arnie and all these guys I mean I mean that they only had a few drugs it was deep anavar right there was terrible one of course and I'm doing I'm doing all these videos historically I'm reading so I read all over the place on these things and I thought I knew stuff or that I read it and I put it through my brain of what I've heard from thousands of men that have told me is the doc what like their experiences and I'm putting it all together with a chemical structure and the metabolism in the kidney and and I'm as you relearn and relive and you read something you know even like Llewellyn's textbook and in other places all over the Internet you learn more and more and you put it together yeah so but with it with the clinical experiences I have from all the men like stories like that it's just it's unreal it's just unbelievable and so you know I'm sure you gave some historical perspective in your video but to refresh people's memory that was the first stirring that was actually developed but by in the United States by dr. John Ziegler he was well and Ziegler because we were getting our asses kicked at the Olympics John Ziegler man John Ziegler here's the story which is good it's a great story he was at the nineteen oh my god Ron sixty-two he was it was before I was born he was at he would saw the right it's always the Russians he saw the Russians at the world games I assume weightlifting because he was also a coach of other things too but the big stuff that York barbell Club that that's that's right that was basically the US Olympic weightlifting yachting Center in Pennsylvania and he was and there was a video there's a there's some historic video about that you know later on in probably 20 years ago and about that so he was with the Russians somewhere outside America and the story goes he saw the Russian athletes having problems peeing pissing because they had angiogenic and then we're doing suspension testosterone suspension injections Ron hmm they were doing suspension cuz I don't think we had and I could be corrected I don't think we had esters then I don't think we got sipping a blender the next his eyes I do the history I'll be doing testosterone estrous next and HGH everything else I'll do this for three weeks and it's really fun I can't believe how much people care more about my videos on steroids that might good know about heart disease but this is just what it is I'm not fighting the market so and so so Ziegler saw these men cap being catheterized in their penis with catheters but here's the thing I'm not saying the guy in his deathbed he's gonna is a lying but there's no way it's not possible because Ron men to this day do steroids testosterone drone suspension they do testosterone esters how many young men at Bible and competitions are weightlifting competitions or even the local gym in there under the age of thirty are having problems pissing so what was what was nothin was giving these Russian athletes such a problem was it Pro so listen listen listen so this is why the anabolic this is why I love being the anabolic targets because it's medical so if you look at anabolic androgenic steroids right AAS there's anabolic which is muscle building and those androgenic which are male secondary sex characteristics we're men we're not the brightest bulbs on the tree we're that's why we're men so we look like men we have brows we have the face we have the hair loss of hair obviously as we get older and more testosterone hair loss mind Minds thinning - and and we have male bodies our voices are like this and we're not the smartest creatures and we have sex okay so those are called androgenic properties when you're in the womb you have that differentiate the fetus into a male/female DHT we who needs it then you go quiet you're a young boy but you're different than a young girl and then you go into puberty there's nothing more to say when you're when you go through puberty you're going on your own gear right right so that's why you get pimples and you're getting your voice is changing and my little you know what my kid is 13 listening this I heard him talking the other day I go that sounds familiar I go oh he sounds like a like a hot chick on gear female bodybuilder yeah I said you said that and it's comical cuz like he sounds like your chick on gear I don't want to tell him that he'll punch me it'll be coming in any minute so it's so Ziegler's saw the angiogenic effects of testosterone but I wonder maybe one guy was catheterizing and he thought he went back to the drawing board this is a true story he supposedly went back to the drawing board with the pharmaceutical companies he kind of teased out a bunch of companies he got a contract with with their chemists and he said let's make a compound that's more anabolic unless angiogenic done and this it was developed specifically it was gonna be a secret thing what they weren't gonna put it on the market right that's exactly right that's it so so and then within a few years quickly it went on to market and then he over the course of ten years became disgusted disenfranchised and he quit he moved to and then he was again steroids and then D Paul stayed out the t-ball I mean Dianabol I mean it's was the breakfast of champions because it was used in the beginning they didn't think it was cheating it was just like it makes it really strong and fast and big and now no one's gonna use depo if you're if you're a sprinter you're gonna use anavar than winter although and you know it's true no why is that but because you're a sprinter you don't want puffy blow dienes and water weight bogging you down I suppose so it's a stir it's an estrogenic steroid so as I'm doing these histories Ron I'm even myself relearning the chemical properties that are inherent and why they end up in the streets being used the way they do so this was developed in the early 60s so we're looking at over fifty years ago and it's still very very popular so why why would you say then is what are the the beneficial problem - in a ball that make it so well known so widely loved and used so it's very and I I researched all this and all my right and I talk I talk - you know I have some goo I have my own gurus right I take care of gurus and they know they gonna when they come into my care they go doc I know you don't like us we're gurus you know steroid coaches because you guys could come under my care I'm a human I take care of anyone but they kind of do feel embarrassed because they've been killing people for probably ten years but giving they've been telling guys you know like I mean take master on-task 600 take I think a lot of guys I hope they're not doctors they're not gonna get sued they're not gonna lose your licenses but because they don't have licenses and you know what someone who say to me you know what doc I go because they come to me and they ask me talk I know I feel some of them are getting they're stopping getting away from it some of the guys are diseased and they were sick and they feel like [ __ ] so they're dying themself and they just feel bad because it's bad and and you know I guess it for Catholic they're gonna go to church and and the fact that the priest will relieve them I mean Ron I'm trying to be honest but you're [ __ ] killing people but they're not doctors so guys are getting away from you know what they say to me you know what [ __ ] I'm not a doctor I tell these guys what to do but shame on them for listening to me I mean you know they're I think any I don't agree with the practice but I mean it's it's it is what it is there-there are necessary part of the equation now and athletes because the drug the drug use has escalated to the point that's the point where it's at now we're on you know eight to twelve different drugs at a time for calling us guys don't know a lot of people don't want to do the research they don't want to know what do I need to take how much when so they'll pay that they'll pay these gurus to figure it all out for them just map it out say okay here's their cycle for the next three weeks here's then change it to this change to that and you know the Guru's tell this is a big be the Guru I'm going to answer the call ways launch off to things but if this is relevant content obviously for people the gurus in the beginning don't feel like they're doing anything wrong because they just feel that it's not really dangerous and then over time the Guru's that I take care of now they're in their 40s and 50s and they realize that it's wrong because they're sick and now so you to answer a question the gurus tell told me when I was doing my research doc deep balls a staple bro deep balls cheapest [ __ ] and it works like a charm and that's so for a bulking no one's cutting up with D ball Ron that's stupid you know that but D ball is a relevant poor part of pace someone who was forget bodybuilders power someone who wants to get big and strong and bulking its you're bulking drug of choice is Dianabol and like I said so many people have fear of needles or an issue with needles so that's why pro hormones are still being used as widely as they are and that's why D ball it never went out of style it never will go out of style it's cheap in a lot I know so many people who've done D Paul only cycles because they feel that's safer because there's no needle you know and that's what I talked about I said you know so that's in the beginning of my summary I said Jesus Christ this is such a such a horrible thing so many people not in America the guys outside American steroid users at least historically have been kind of smart enough if I could say that to realize they don't do or else that they always knew remember back in the 80s run in the 90s guys would be in the bar the bouncers and they would be on they would drink water because they I was amazed up in Syracuse upstate New York me and the bouncer is when I was doing my stuff I was up there we're all walking around drinking water I had a few beers and and I was like why you guys drinking water cuz we're on steroids we don't want to hurt our livers it's that good stuff or what I mean they shouldn't be drinking on the job anyway but true true but in that night that's a good question I don't want to keep veering off in a tangent but if someone is using if they're on a cycle of Anna drawl or D ball some some oral agent like this that is HEPA toxic you know obviously they should avoid alcohol on top of that but how much more damage would they be doing are they aren't they already doing plenty of damage regardless we don't know and the end of our video coming out next week I talked about it's really not that liver toxic it was yeah it runs antivirus metabolize primarily through the kidneys hmm it's a very and I talked about the chemical properties in the reason why and I didn't even know this even the anabolic dock didn't know this stuff okay so the doctor testosterone who were calling dr. George twice so he left a comment under your d-ball video on your YouTube channel anabolic doc he said methane Dione and it was a nomenclature of it another medic like it anyway it's his last last sentence there that I want to challenge you challenge him and challenge you because I'm curious if this is true he says take insulin it can avoid the first pass through the liver so doctor dr. Julie ADO's thinks you can avoid a lot of the liver damage if you stick the stick the pill under your tongue and let it sit there for five or ten minutes instead of swallowing it so this is such a good question I can't get I have two answers one answer is he's true it's right he's correct it bypasses what's called the portal cable system it bypasses the small bowel effect of what's called the first pass effect yeah so what bypasses food that goes through the small bowel it comes out of your stomach and everything that's picked up in the capillary bed of the small bowel the first part in the second part of the duodenum is where everything comes out amino acids and other you know food constituents fats glucose so and so forth monomers of glucose they go into their small bowel they go race shuttle right to the liver so for the first pass effect dr. T is completely right so when you take it sublingually it dissolves into the lymphatics and there is a steroid a testosterone derivative called testosterone undec innate that's made with an with it's an oral it's a test it's all andreal yeah it's in Europe we talked about that and that dissolves to the lymphatics and I've researched this in my research I was kind of launching off onto that researching every I could research for hours and that does go through the lymphatics and it repeatedly stays out of the portal cable and therefore it doesn't affect the liver at all so he is correct but dr. t we both need to consult the services of a board-certified hepatologist was a liver expert it's a gastroenterologist who is a specialist in liver only and we I wonder after if you when you take d-ball sublingually and the initial the initial a fact is definitely not going to go directly into the liver because it's not going it's going through the lymphatics of the sublingual under the tongue so and we have drugs and do this but i wonder when it's circulating through the body subsequently it's going to go through the liver right so so the bro science there would just leap to the conclusion of well I just I'm cutting my liver damage in half if I do it this way I I don't I want to ask George dr. T we need to ask this and the standard hepatologist is not going to know because he's probably gonna go like this because all the doctors that we ask these questions to they go like this and these are Harvard these are guys at heart this is why the anabolic doc had to come into play because I research real steroid medical questions with actual real doctors and I ask them the questions and with some things we don't even really know well here's a D ball is used in a lot of bulking cycles yeah and it's especially used in the first few weeks because if a guy's been off you know it sucks being off everyone every gear user hates that period where you have two crews nobody ever seems to come off at all completely anymore they all hate cruising if you tell a guy now you got to be on 250 milligrams for ten to 12 weeks and let your receptors bounce back cause like it's like miserable they're like did so I have friends that that's like the worst part of their years was [ __ ] mo I'm getting smaller I'm getting fatter I'm getting a weaker I couldn't even get four or five in a squat last night bra anyway they're dying to get back on gear and not only that they're dying to like get big and strong again boom as fast as paano well they'll do their soup you need their equipoise or whatever they'll do all their long est' of shots but at the same time they'll immediately start D ball or Anna draw so if they have something that's working right away that they can feel and see within Wow days so I can't quite do it did I even have a question with that my question would be I know you're not about designing cycles although I saw somebody on your issue somebody commented they want to know if that's part of your consultation services if you can design steroid cycles for people but uh fortunately I have so many comments on there I don't forget I'm not even even looking at them that's fine that's fine I mean itis it I better I better not look there's some good ones a lot of people don't love what you're doing there's a lot of gradual Ettore thanks for doing these but there are some questions people that want more gear gear knowledge maybe I guess this is question more for the drug gurus because it's more bro science but if you are from a point of view you know the physiology of how steroids work does it even you does it even make sense to do that I mean if you're if you're injecting sip you need and then another another thing you're stacking with a deck or in equipoise or something it's going to take a couple weeks for you to really feel what's going on but it's going to happen sooner or later is there any reason in your mind for someone who's trying to be as healthy as possible to use orals at all so I mean there no one no there's no Studies on this so if they're trying to be healthy they're using steroids they're taking a risk I mean it's kind of a I mean it's kind of a question of like if you're doing steroids you're gonna be subjecting yourself to some risk how much risk are you taking if you do one and of our Tavel today probably not much risk but you're not going to get much benefit either so if you step it up and you're doing in term uh schooler steroids and most steroid users you know do in a muscular steroids and they don't do orals you know that right so the most most stirred users will do like I said they'll use the world's but they don't use them throughout the whole course of the 12 to 20 weeks of their cycle they will use it in the introductory phase because they want to they want to get some results back they want that fullness that but they use it within a month so they'll do that half yes alko poised image all right like that's like boy man if you if you got anything in ya you're gonna get strong I mean that's like whatever your genetics are whatever your psycho whatever you're doing you're benching I mean I'm a power lifter so I've been around this further in the biggest guys in the world underground for decades you're right test Anna draw I interviewed some famous people I just don't want to say names because some of them not even alive right now and you know what they told me they did back and these are the top power lifters in the world you know what they did testosterone and anavar a lot of it a lot of and you know what that those are that's a combination now anavar is actually I'm not gonna give the secrets I did a whole video I did a lot of research for that video it's gonna be coming out next week but we filmed it today and it's B it's edited and it's gonna be edited and we put table of contents in the front so people who have no patients can be jumping too so that's about that was my guys that was my guys thought and we're doing and that's maybe why we're we're happened we're going viral with all this stuff right now it's where we're making it so people can get through the whole thing and then YouTube we're even rewards that it's all stupid it's all so still it's like I do videos that are important but the steroid gurus are blowing up the heart videos are doing okay but but so - so guys are doing steroids if you're doing an oral agent steroid two things happen that can hurt your health it definitely hits goes to the liver and I've definitely seen liver cysts I've seen transaminase elevations and I've seen it's called Coley static disease where the bilirubin levels are gonna go up transiently which is that's frickin scary and dangerous and I've seen it that when you stop those agents it does I'm not I'm not here to Bowl shippi they all go down I've seen proudly I mean cuz I'm the anabolic doc I have seen probably a dozen cases over ten years of severe liver disease including one guy liver cancer but but he had hepatitis C and and so he has gonna he he can get liver cancer from that so it's never a clean deal but liver disease is there guys go on and off the the worst case I saw was a man from from Saudi Arabia area for an Arab Emirates he was living on oral steroids Torretta ball turned ball Torretta ball he did it for like a year and a half he just didn't he is scared of needles yeah I think it happens more outside the country and he end up going to I think I told the story he end up in Hopkins John Hopkins and he had he had a pattice pili osis and he had these huge blood filled cysts and they actually had to do they had to get in there and cut him out and drain them and he was in the ICU for about two weeks then he came to me in a limousine because he has a few dollars you know he said he's like what he's an oil Sheik and literally he's a young man and he was he loved being on I mean call him crazy he loved steroids this is ten years ago and I never heard from him since but that was no joke so he lived on oral steroids for a year and a half but but it's like but you know to us in America we know not to do it but it seems like to the guys outside America now we have YouTube and you know there's no YouTube around ten years ago I guess or it wasn't big so he wasn't watching it so he didn't know so the dangerous you know if you're gonna do oral steroids guys keep it down I mean like it's that's you you and then it does debilitate and I'm gonna watch my videos for the details how it work because it does debilitate your cholesterol panel but if you're young and you have no plaque in the artery no heart disease no one seems to give a [ __ ] it's an if it enlarges your heart and it causes dysfunction to your heart my usual stuff LVH dis diastolic dysfunction endothelial dysfunction you're not gonna give a [ __ ] when you're 23 or 33 but collectively over years by running a lot of cycles of oral steroids its oral steroids you're toxic Ron come on now this was a follow-up question but you just mentioned this so wonder you're in the comments section here to Hannibal breakfast of champions video a guy named Bruno Rossini said can we expect cholestatic syndrome with all all 17 alkylated drugs or more common with Dianabol no not with anavar and i learned this myself because the the the the change because of the structure because of where the it's a DHT derivative right anavar is a DHT derivative diana balls a testosterone derivative isn't that cool I mean I'm doing this I'm making build a well and proud you know so a lot of bro science guys are gonna be cheering for me right now you know and it's it's like this is real science so because of those structural changes to gonna watch the end of our video it doesn't go through the liver that much it may this anavar mediates this married rug is metabolized and when it's metabolizing it's transforming and it's going into pro hormones right it's changing its form d8 testosterone DHT testosterone aromatization estradiol right Ron so your body's doing this in organs in the capillary base in the in the glandular tissue in the brain there's conversion all over the body guys it's super complicated this meso animal Anna drawn d-ball our liver toxic no question and other oral steroids as many of them that they have different degrees of liver toxicity anavar so the answer to that question is no and I'm just I'm a scientific historical guy I'm not telling you do anavar I'm just telling you the anavar is not as liver toxic by any means - despite the transaminases going up that you're not going to get damaged histological damage to the kidney a paddle sight to the liver to the - that functional liver cell compared to an Aurora or those other but they're all 17 alpha alkylated but the alkylation that methylation or alkylation ethyl or methyl group I some guy was smashing me for the doc you said wall no dude no I even checked it with caps I checked it 17 alpha alkylation you could when you alkylate it can be done with a methyl or ethyl group boom okay that's organic chemistry it's 17 carbon and that's alkylation 17 alpha alkylation we say it could be a methyl or an ethyl group and for that for on these drugs I was talking about us it's a methyl group that's added now I'm a science geek so I mean and if I'm wrong let's go I mean please chemists please correct me I want to know if I'm wrong on that I'm not a I'm not a biochemist I'm a doctor well you know all about the heart so here's a good another comment from your under which you haven't know maybe yeah I don't know this kid says I assume he's a kid Steve Adams said I tried d-ball once four hours later I started having chest pains inside a gym I never had a chest pains in my life have you ever heard of someone taking it Oh Derek no no no heart damage was that no no I mean I mean but it's but here's the here's the take-home message on that Ron roid rages real guys try it's called trend okay steroids effect every man everyone has a fingerprint every man's gonna will get a different effect and women obviously too but people take steroids win for hours are you gonna be I mean within four hours it's gonna be in your brain to some degree because it's if it's that's the peak of the concentration that's why he balls taking one once a day or twice a day right Ron yeah so it's like so it's like that's gonna convert and and go into your brain and did that mean is he so sensitive I'm not mad not joking now is that man so sensitive that he did one pill and then four hours later was that a placebo effect or was he with I mean oh and then did he feel like you said I don't there's no I never argue patients it's like okay that's how you feel but does the science support that that was probably having did you have a heart attack no you didn't have already died but so that's the answer to that is there's no way it doesn't work I wish some of these things actually did have quicker effects because you know what you want to see people you wouldn't see people abusing them it's actually I've heard a lot of recommendations bro science recommendations that to take your orals your oral steroids like thirty like a pre-workout 30 minutes before you workout yeah that's they believe that that's going to the drug will be circulating it indefinitely it peak concentration during your workout and give you maximum benefit for for whatever so that act that actually is true that does work oh yeah well guys I am this comes to anecdotally from the powerlifting world guys do Jack drops Yeah right off the bat and and they do suspension you know in the morning like in the backroom gearing up and getting ready and I mean and they take an ax drawl in the morning the liquid drops and they want they want this three or four or five hours later this they want this peak they time it and there's no Studies on this but don't tell the top strongest men in the world that the check drops and the deep ball liquid the liquid drop or depot on Anna draw and the suspension don't tell them don't tell me that's not working for them because they're squatting a thousand pounds raw now check drops just to let people know from what I remember it's a it was a veterinary drug that with suspension of methyl test which was yeah the very first before long before Dianabol there was methyl test I believe that's right very toxic very crude form of liquid testosterone it's good yep it's a liquid form it's an oral form testosterone it dissipates within hours I mean it's a Scott it's not it's not sustainable that's why they kept that's the chemical it didn't work but it was used veterinarian they used it to get Bulls like massively crazy and fertile and horny I believe or roosters or animals for fur mating I mean I'm not kidding so reader I mean maybe I'll do a video on check drops I heard you read the new muscle fitness that came out with the guy with the kettlebell on the cover you had something in there now you were part of one of the articles but there was an ad in the back this is I know I'm going off again it's 78 year old Latin Lover secret it was some pill from Italy from a from a you know some plant or something that is basically they claimed it was viagra I was just like oh my god who would actually in this day and age when anybody in there anybody in their grandma that could get a hold of viagra cialis easily why would you why would you spend money on these scurrilous it's yeah it's this but I but it's but steroids do go to the brain no Ron they these guys they get more aggressive I mean and they focus it though and they they like the of the it's a high they get high on it so take-home message these people out there who've never tried d-ball they're gonna use steroids anyway what would you you're not going to recommend obviously is anything D but if no label if they're going to use steroids would you say D ball is a safer option not a safe option stay away would you talk I can't say I mean you know I can't even give but I mean D balls these harsh and then in the end what I see is I see the a side effect I see is Anna Boch steroid-induced hypogonadism right so guys guys do just a little D ball a little bit again cuz they don't you're right though the newbie guy doesn't want to do the injection so he does the he does the PAP tot he does the SARM this is what's happening he does this arm he does the prohormone and then he does the oral winstrol oral anavar d ball or annual or some some combination of orals and he the first couple cycles either depending on who he is and what he is and if it wasn't like you said like gum drops like you first had either works a little bit or a lot bit and it's some amazing come on it's some transformation for this man who's an average guy somewhere in the world and he go he gets stronger in the [ __ ] gym I mean this is like a blessing and a curse and then where does he do he goes back for more and then he goes back come on Ron look at you today you know that's the problem though Ron you're gonna go back for more and then when they come off they come Ron we got three consults last night on line I have 25 guys I will get to you guys I take care of my first patients first and then I take the guy sir I have a waiting list it's just how it's gonna be it's too bad and and I'm gonna hire a doctor sooner or later but I just don't want to hire anyone right now I don't want to put up with anyone okay so so get in line but and I but I'm humble for my patients and my guys they're their guys come to me they don't give a [ __ ] about their heart health they don't guys come to me because they have sexual problems after doing steroids done I only get new patients for one app I get a small fraction of guys that actually care about their heart and they're all there 35 and 40 and older I should say maybe 25% most of my business Ron guys do steroids they they come on and off and they go holy [ __ ] this ain't good okay I I got problems gotta go see the Anna Bob doc and then that's what I do Ron because but is it true if you go on so it turned up doc I did my PCT or I didn't do my PCT and we can talk for ten hours on that you know they they end up coming off everything and from a little anavar to a little prohormone I mean the storms are useless guys this please widths arms are useless I mean they're basically useless guys in the end of the day they're not Samus it's actually a steroid you're taking if it works and if it's armed okay it works a little bit you're gonna end up doing steroids okay please don't so when you do you're gonna come off you're gonna have that withdrawal syndrome Ron and they're gonna you're not gonna feel like like Superman and you're not gonna have you're not gonna be interested in sex or worse your sexual function it ain't can I go you know you're gonna do a text you're out of the guy who saw you say you know what bro I need more or Ron and then you're gonna go into the then you're gonna start injecting right Ron yeah yeah and then you're gonna feel like a million bucks and then the problem solved because you're just gonna live on tests and blossom coos forever okay you ready for a fun question that was on that I'm ready this was on the D ball is nothing to a deep wall but this is such a great question I had to throw it at you okay so this guy says I'm really seriously thinking ejecting hewmet rope 12 milligram cartridge kit 7-day pen injection directly into my penis I saw that make my penis grow what's the side effects what's your guys thoughts on that so I guess he was looking for input from everyone that come at your video but yeah what injecting growth hormone into your penis you know make your point not recommending that's not record and that's off-label use yeah that's nice but Ryan I've heard my four guys do it though okay it doesn't do anything they get they can get penile I mean I have men unfortunately that need to take injections for the penis to get an erection have you heard of that yeah cabbage act was the yeah I don't know what they use now but that was what the he's back itself prosody so it's there's different forms of that medicine okay and there's a few different forms and I prescribed it carefully for some men and usually they're older men or they have serious erectile dysfunction status post bypass heart surgery or prostate cancer removal or they just maybe they've used so much steroids over their life or they have depression or severe erectile dysfunction where the the pills you know cialis and viagra don't work I have these pet Ronnie there's no joking I'm all joking aside this is serious stuff so I prescribed for some men not many the cabbage act and different combinations because we have pharmacies that will make it much cheaper and it's very effective but you're injecting a small insulin syringe of this medicine into the side of your penis rod like like you'd be doing with with that human growth hormone so that's really not funny to me I mean that guy thinks it's funny it's like you're gonna get you thinks it's funny I think he's wondering if it'll really work I don't know it's not gonna watch useless and you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna damage your penis please don't do that sir you're gonna damage your penis and you're gonna get fibrosis so the guy so and then there's there's Peyronie's disease there's five bro I mean you know rod this is no mess with the penis guy and if you and it's just my are warning if you're gonna if you're gonna enter the world of steroid world and you're gonna cross this line and do orals and then you're gonna cross this line if you're gonna come into the world there will be some certainly some feelings of strength and power and euphoria that's why it's done and you'll be in the club where you'll be on testosterone forever and ever and ever you'll never ever come off testosterone ever right right right diabetics don't ever come off of insulin nope and and even if the early diabetic loses a ton of weight they could probably come off insulin in the beginning depending on who it is that's what I understand your point but if you're if you're a massive steroid user and you have shut down your pituitary and your hypothalamus and your gonads connection and you lose weight and you try to come off steroids and you try doing every PCT cycle no no man you're dusted I saw a guy today I talked to probably six guys today he's been with me for ten years 19 through labs for them forever we tried doing labs every four to six months you know I do it based on what I think is right based on what's going on it's always about number one is the right thing for the patients always number one it's easy what's the right thing to do to do that for them some men don't have good medical insurance so I don't need to do it every four to six months but maybe every every year every and that's that's fine so I did the guys labs I didn't do him in about eight months and he stayed away his testosterone was 66 whoo he's he's a oldest guy he's 40-something 45 he's a good-looking man did steroids for a very long time he came to me ten years ago when he was in his I don't know mid-30s and he just wanted to have me give him you know tea or tea and he I pulled him off testosterone in the beginning he tanked and I said you you're gonna need this and he's like doc please I've been on for 15 20 years just just keeping on testosterone so he came off Ron for six months guys do this and he just goes you know what doc I just got tired of it it's there's always some pressure from the family members I think and that pisses me off but so you don't even stop there TRT yes so so I saw his number today and I saw his number last week and I when we were my office calls the guys to set up the reviews you know on the phone or in person keep Florida here it's all I do so I look I go dude sir have you seen her testosterone he goes yeah I went back on after that doc it was like two weeks ago and I go what did you do he goes I was off for like six months I go why'd you do that and he goes I just want to see I go how'd you feel he goes horrible he thought magically his body was gonna regain the ability to produce testosterone again right this is why this show I don't give a [ __ ] if we have ten guys one guy or 100 or ten million guys watching he's brain he was off for six months and his testosterone was 66 I mean how do you how can you live like that because he must have been exhausted he must have been last flat no sex you know it goes that you know it's a guy that you wonder like is he having sex does he care about sex and hey man that's your life man that's that's not my life right I mean you know you that's up to you doc do I have to have sex holy crap are you kids I mean theoretically like priests don't have sex I mean I mean that's true I mean I don't have any priests on gear yeah that would be good priests on gear you know that's actually good for them right they should be on gear oh wait no they should be off gear and they should have no sex drive wait a minute I have seen some some guys that were anybody but I bet there have been guys who were studying for the priesthood that we're all great I'm not buying me I'm not gonna name names because I don't want anyone get mad at me but I've seen I have seen that so that's it Ron there's nothing more to saw so that's you know if you're on if you go on steroids this is the message of the show buyer beware you're gonna be probably on it forevers if you cross a certain line now you're gonna do your next video on anavar is that next video is gonna be launched monday night next Monday night it's anavar I won't tell you the full title because it's really cool it could be the history the pharmacokinetics the the incredible manufacturing history can I give you a title maybe my titles better than what you had in mind what do you got Anna bar dot dot not just for chicks I will reference you I'll refer you'll get some of the royalties and yours probably probably at a better title that it's a basic title they're basic because the the thumbnail is very basic and that's it I have a feeling that's gonna be a great video because that's a huge interest in that drug huge interest it is it's it's weed I film it this morning it took me like an hour and a half because I had I keep cutting them and I have to keep the dogs bark downstairs and the door got I was coming to the end now sometimes I just stop and my editor just cuts it out but I'm such a fanatic that I sometimes get up turn the freakin thing off and I redo the whole thing so I was on the third run to the end going this is great I'm insane I'm fired up I'm getting every my I'm getting every chemical detail all my thoughts are coming out it's tight we're going through I'm not stuttering too much and then downstairs the dog Victor starts speaking a ball squeak squeak-squeak-squeak speech me freaking dog I flipped out ran downstairs took the ball out of his mouth this is that giant poodle yes okay that's your buddy that's the one Post mountain biking yeah that's my that's my mountain bike dog all right doctor thank you so much Dianabol the breakfast of champions go to the doctors video a video page on YouTube anabolic doc a lot more science in that video than what you just heard

Los Angeles today we're talking about edibles customers come in here with all sorts of different requests whether that be dietary requests or different methods of ingestion or uptake or effect whatever you're comfortable with chances are we've got it for our first edible I want to talk about gummies gummies are the most popular edible and we've got the kiva camino gummies today they're cannabis infused gummies but they also add terpenes which is unique that gives it more of a indica or sativa feel just really nice tasting Class E gummies these are wild berry it got a pineapple habanero flavor a blend I'm apricot and my personal favorite the sparkling pear Prosecco next we've got sublingual strips sublingual strips are a small tab that you put in your mouth and let dissolve on your tongue you may know cookies and brownies as your typical ingestion method but what's unique about these is that those other edibles take up to two hours to take effect whereas sublingual effects you can start feeling it in 15 to 40 minutes you don't run into that this isn't hitting it's been an hour and nothing's working I'm gonna slam some more and then two hours it all hits and you're done and finally we've got tea now cannabis and tea have been a match made in heaven since time immemorial I find that this slightly caffeinated green tea is a really nice chill but focused way of ingestion it's absorbed through the stomach so this is another faster method than digestion and what I find with tea is that as you sip it it comes on in sips as opposed to like a boom there are different types of tea this is a caffeinated green tea there's non-caffeinated herbal tea this has a little blend of CBD as well really nice for chilling out so those are some of my favorite edibles on the market right now feel free to come by the can we stop in and check them out yourself", "eJhA-Ob0nPA": "hello tiny reviewer friend today we're reviewing another easter theme there are eggs here and bunnies here to show that this is an easter themed video so they're all easter themed on the frame of this and i hope you enjoy it because this is reese's milk chocolate peanut butter eggs instead of peanut butter cups so let's turn this over because there's reese's peanut butter eggs on the bottom lisa's peanut butter eggs nutrition facts and ingredients uh contains look for the word contain but there's peanut butter for sure which means there's peanuts so if you're allergic to peanuts i'll taste it for you but there isn't such thing as a container in that but i listed one peanuts so we're gonna take only one i wanna taste more than that all right let's just pour all of these out and see what colors we have oh these are themed they're not really full eggs like like that but they're still half because they can stand hey you guys can buy like 10 000 bags of these and hide them around your room and ask your kids or pets to find them anyway that's a nice tradition for you maybe i'll save one of these a few of these and ask my father to hide them and i can go around the house hunting all right there's the greens the mouse and i'm gonna try um my favorite color blue now you know a little bit more about me my father's gonna ask for green probably mama's gonna ask for this because her favorite color is purple but there's not a purple egg but pink is close enough so let's peel open this wrapper this wrapper is so cute it's like tin foil oh it ripped that's fine there's an egg it's kind of greasy but i'll taste it first no my fries asking me for something and that's showing that this is an egg cut in half peanut butter now let's taste it i'm gonna put in one it's like bite peanut butter cups but only an egg shape it's super soft i mean it's super soft it melts in my mouth i'm gonna eat another one after dinner and you guys can also crumple these up and make little jewels and ask your kids to play dress up with them i'm a bit over beyond with that age i'm nine years old i'm not really supposed to be doing those kinds right now i'm supposed to be studying for middle school um that's a better thing for me but anyways you know like these i need to just toss them around i hit the floor my mother will vacuum it up no time it's okay i actually like it you guys can make lots of things out of these eggs take these together and make a full egg since one two three four five six my phone and i ate one which means they're eight you guys can actually put them together and if they're two if two of these make one eight divided by two equals four which means you guys can make four of these eggs if you guys want to that's my breath it blew that away but anyways well just give you some suggestions to spend your family with east just spending time with your family in easter because that's what everything is all about for example a very ugly flower but anyways you know what i mean if you guys enjoyed this video please subscribe and press the like

edibles because I noticed that in the video and the first video I posted about this edible a lot of people were telling me this isn't what they were getting so poor oh wow like the first five times I went to go purchase this in DC they came in a cube shape like this there was just like cubes and very chewy like they're just like a barian gummy type of edible now this is the first time so I've been purchasing these things for a couple of months now and this is the first time I'm actually getting the pack that people are talking about which look exactly like the original sour patch kids and they look like this okay so I'm just gonna eat one right now this is the first time I'm seeing them looking tasting and feeling like actual sour patch occasion I have to admit that when I tried these compared to the ones I had been getting before these the ones that look like sour patch is are less powerful less potent I got what I would eat like - I really wouldn't feel anything but these I would need like a half of one of a half of one of these squares and it would be good the texture is different as well so I really don't know what's going on according to both packages they both have the same ingredients they both say they are in compliance with the CA prop 215 SB 4 xx section blah blah blah I'm sure there's some type of DC law but I don't know um so yeah maybe I would have to eat more of the sour patch kids ones in order to feel something but the other ones we're buying like I am not sure why they're such a difference but yeah I just wanted to make it update to let you guys know that I did I finally know what you're talking about when you're saying oh my pad looks just like the sour patch cake okay I get it I know I know what you're talking talking about now but when I like I said like when I first started getting these for the first time they look like the squares like this this is like what I was introduced to when I was interested introduce this Tony fetch as a product so yeah I'm wonder with that Bell no idea everybody look it up anyway if you have any questions comment below and I will get back to you of course yeah and have a good one here", "GlCw8icMXRQ": "[Music] my friends welcome to wheats the marijuana a show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at a new product new brand and we are taking a look at I don't actually know the name of this brand I think it's the master bud teller doesn't have an oh sorry the master baker 420 and they're lovingly named multiple Bayer Gazans 200 milligrams again from the master baker 420 very small edible company Emily seen them out a couple of places the gummy bears look a little weird never seen gummy bears that look quite like that very shitty packaging generic little prop 265 label seems to be prop 215 label cheap little ziploc bag with some cheap little stickers on it never a good sign no ingredients no laboratory testing also very bad sign but it was a more expensive than then you would imagine at 15 bucks for 200 milligrams for gummy edibles is a little bit higher that's a little bit more than so like you're at a pure or infused creations normally for that price so hopefully it'll be good I don't have a lot of faith I generally find to be gum needs to be not very good I've found a few exceptions to that rule but again the exceptions that prove the rule and generally shitty packaging no laboratory testing are pretty big indicators that something's gonna be a pretty shitty shitty product but will give it its fair shake hopefully they taste good and hopefully they'll get me high at 200 milligrams they certainly should so I'll go ahead and shut up give them a taste and if you guys have never tuned into a wheats root review before the way they work is I'm gonna eat the product some number of it in front of you maybe not the whole thing don't wanna bore you to death and then I'll come back to you guys in two and actually let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so okay nice little tear open packaging easy to open it's always a plus so here are our gummy bears very again weird we are looking gummy bears it's not focusing very well there but nothing like I've ever seen before a lot of like crystallized sugar on them let's give it a taste mmm not bad certainly taste better than infused creations or at a pure it doesn't have that really astringent cannabis taste there's a little bit of a cannabis aftertaste but it's not nearly as bad again as the sort of more egregious companies yeah not bad slight cannabis taste but not gonna make you gag so guys I'm gonna finish off these multiple bear gasp limbs which I do kind of like that name and then I'll be sure to come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how we're feeling so thanks for watching weeds and I will see you guys in just a bit peace welcome back to weeds guys there have been no bear gazans to speak of certainly not multiple bear Gazans not that I really know what a bear gasm is but I assume it's kind of like getting high or having a normal gasm orgasm and this is nothing like that this is like having shitty gummy bears and then not much else happening after that yeah there's not much to say about these they're bad they don't taste as bad as a tepee roar infused creations or some of the other really awful tasting gummies out there but they're just as weak as those in terms of potency and even shittier packaging and maybe a little bit more expensive than those as well so uh straight-up no thank you when it comes to the master baker 420 I think I might try some more of their products review some more cuz I think they have some things that are more confectionery in nature your brownies your cookies we'll see if those are any better but a really bad start so far for the master baker 420 with the fun named but not so hot of a product multiple bear Gazans 200 milligrams that's a total total pass for me if you guys see these skip them no problem saying that well that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys sorry for the bummer hopefully next time we'll have something a little bit more fun for you I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "RjYfaCoq8-8": "happy Wednesday it's Ali and I am back

nutritionist well no [ __ ] today we'll meet my favorite Chocolate Chunk cookies yes I'd like a chocolate chip cookie those little chocolate chips just won't do so I like to make it chunky me today's episode is sponsored by backbone and also the marijuana crime drama a sea of green check it out fully loaded on our YouTube channel you can also get it on DVD shut up and take my money now if you're like me chocolate Aulick I like to use chocolate chucks I like my chocolate today's recipe will be infused with Keith's very commonly on hand for most smokers usually collected at the bottom of your grinder you want to keep it in an airtight container I keep mine in a mason jar and keep it away from the light I like to go to the light no keep is one of the easiest ways to get THC into your edible if you're like me you probably have a lot you want to decarboxylate the Keith I am so confused right now it's just THC a and you need the heat to activate it just like you would when you're rolling your weed in the joint and you light that first hit got a big enough joint there right you need the heat to get high and we want to get high want to pre-heat your oven to 300 degrees so in order to decarboxylate the key you're going to use an oven safe Bowl we're going to use some parchment paper it's contained in the parchment paper which makes it easier and I've already pre-measured my two grams of Keith and I'm just gonna put it right in here with this piece of paper and you want to spread it as evenly as you possibly can to put it in the middle right you want to set the timer for seven minutes you want to allow your Keef to completely cool before adding it to any of your recipes a good rule of thumb is D carb your Keith before gathering your ingredients that way it'll have enough time to cool by the time you need it mmm smells delicious for this recipe we're going to use two cans of Keith two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour a teaspoon of salt a teaspoon of baking soda three quarter cups of granulated sugar 3/4 cups of PAP dark brown sugar one teaspoon of vanilla extract two sticks of unsalted butter softened and two eight now let's get to baking in order to make the cookies you want to pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees we're gonna add the softened butter the granulated sugar the dark brown sugar and the vanilla extract along with the key in the mixing bowl carbs wise it's gonna set me back don't even give a [ __ ] we're gonna add a teaspoon of kosher salt you spilled the salt and a teaspoon of baking soda and then you just want to gently mix it we're gonna take the butter and put it right in the mixing bowl now we're gonna add 3/4 cup of granulated sugar mm-hmm that must be the sugar oh gold that's gold the dark brown sugar you'll probably need a spatula for this one since it's tightly packed yes and a teaspoon of vanilla extract [Music] hold your parchment paper and add the kief to the mix the great thing about parchment paper is that the kief doesn't stick to it now we're gonna cream the butter the sugar the vanilla extract and the keith's in our stand mixer or you want to touch the mixing bowl to the stand make sure it locks in place and you're gonna use your whisk attachment to make the cookies you want to blend the ingredients well until it forms a nice creamy mixture turn it off halfway and make sure you scrape the sides of the bowl we don't want to lose any of that swipe swipe swipe swipe swipe swish [Music] now we're gonna add the eggs one by one if you recall from the brownie episode we do it one by one in case there was a bad egg then we don't ruin the whole mix she was a bad egg [Music] you also want to make sure you scrape all of this down when you add the eggs to make sure everything gets well combined add the mixture with the flour baking soda and salt after that comes the chocolate chucks hmm you know what I need a little chocolate pick-me-up make sure you lower the bowl when you add the flour you want to start the mixer off slow so that the flour doesn't go flying everywhere [Music] scrape the sides of the bowl so you make sure you get all the flour into the mixture now it's time to add the chocolate chunks [Applause] waiting for cookies now it's time to portion the cookies make sure you clean off the whisk we don't want to lose any of this yummy goodness you can eat that you can use a small scooper or a table spoon whatever you have at home you want to use an ungreased cookie sheet or baking sheet or like I use parchment paper you want to have enough space around the edges for the cookie to spread please I'm gonna need you to spread I'm gonna try to get a good amount of the chocolate chunks along with the cookie mixture that way you ensure that all the cookies have chocolate chunks in them and the last ones aren't just sugar cookies once you've portioned out all your cookies depending on how small or how large you make them you can figure out how much THC is in each serving plugging that back in he takes the derivative and he solves the equation crowd goes wild it's also secondary Tomich THC percentages in your Keef again if you smoke high grade weed your THC should be at higher levels and if you smoke that schwag who does that then you're probably closer to the 20% mark we have a thousand milligrams of THC in this recipe we've made 43 cookies with two grams of keith's giving us a total of 23 milligrams of THC per cookie I have five numbers sitting all around me here we'll put these in that 375 degree oven for nine to eleven minutes until they're golden brown once they're golden brown will allow them to cool for two minutes on the stove and then move them over to a baking cooling rack cookies it's not that sniffing it's not for you let them cool on the stovetop for two minutes and then move them to a wire rack to completely cool now that the cookies have cooled on the stovetop for two minutes we'll move them on the cooling rack for them to completely cool once the cookies have completely cooled you can store them in an airtight container leave them on your countertop or put them in the freezer the last longer thank you for watching episode 3 of new medical edibles here you have it our chocolate chunk cookies made with Keith at 23 milligrams per dosage cookie thank you to our sponsors spackle and the marijuana crime drama a sea

you through a bit of a wringer a few tests to see how the how the Korova bar fix you you want to read us what's on the package they're basically the warning label states medical cannabis edibles may cause drowsiness keep out of reach of children and pets do not operate a motor vehicle while taking this medication there's really no warning about one's own fate would you say you have a rather high cannabis tolerance when it comes to edibles very confident you enjoy them yes but this one this one's a thousand grams 20 doses and the mark does say 5150 on it what does that mean to my understanding that is the code for psychotic behavior please need to take proper action it does okay well then uh yeah let's go ahead and start this [ __ ] challenge [Music] take a deep breath [Applause] check it out that is pretty sweet moist it is very moist and kind of tell there's like two different kind of chocolate layers in there this thing so they really did a good job making that is delicious [Music] show us the Keen mouth it squeeze it is yeah I have 20 doses of THC you're currently going into my stomach which will soon take effect into my system we'll see how that goes keep you posted as you can see it is gone it is absolutely delicious and what's the other miss this day goes to [Music] 30 it was all ingested waiting around feel like something's gonna happen no it's early better we got the ambulance number we had that burrito so [ __ ] hope a lot of chocolate feeling anything yet slight tingle tingle feel like you're gonna [ __ ] your pants yeah it's a possibility right that's always a possibility yeah so much chocolate it 10:30 in the morning yeah so I'm assuming that's what that is [Music] feeling invincible right now alright [Music] [Applause] yeah how you feeling [Music] [Music] I feel like you can hit that bottle that's number two still got it nice arms outstretched and look at the sky with your balance not too bad not too bad now you need to count from one to twenty five counting only every third number and backwards last count down twenty-five backwards counting every third number okay five point you yeah for one okay that was a marginal pause but we'll call it a bus so you're not feeling it no I just feel it's not okay but we're we're two and a half hours in you know this is and your eyes look fine I feel funny from the things okay maybe maybe it has taken effect three looks like the pelvic bone of an animal you better choose one of them yeah it looks like - distorted Eskimos playing patty-cake I could go with that this was a saint edge amazing I was like I was like Jesus and save by what yeah it looks like someone exposing herself to me hehe our cat that's what that looks like now monsters swooping down to eat the helpless puppy dog who now looks like people having sex see from below that's interesting no these are hard yeah it looks like something a brain damage kids my drawing class yeah it looks like a pulsing heart ripped from the chest of its victim not really whoa Indian shamans dancing around the fire personality and in fact you're probably the kind of person that pulled the wings off ice with you a little everyone likes you this is because your life is such a mess that everyone else is relieved that they aren't you if you aspire to become a CEO of a large powerful company this is unlikely since you are looking rarely leave your parents basements your primarily function at work is to serve as a bad example but at least you do very well very very well okay your personal motto is practice makes perfect but since nobody is perfect you might as well stop wasting your time [ __ ] these two so how do you feel now hey do you like the bar a good bar b bar you'd recommend it I was to your granny no would you recommend the whole bar necessarily cause it tastes so good do you probably chop it up into and you'll still get a pretty damn good right I bet ten seconds left give me another 30 seconds now go find it or the

on the THC on the bar 1100 CW analytical really did a great job good layout here you can see my hidden THC camp 1133 so breakdown of the bacteria the mold the yeast as far as pain relief and stuff like that I mean hands down it's a great bar if you're trying to get something out of it as far as like messing up your day or really getting screwed up and stuff like that it's not that kind of bar have a lot of water handy the next day I did have a splitting headache for about the majority of the day to anyone out there who would like to repeat this sort of thing or try it for yourself have

called muscle chef with two fs muscle chef and this is hazelnut protein spread white chocolate and regular hazelnut chocolate and cocoa what was it no no it's coco oh coco or coco coco anyways anyways um this stuff's on amazon so i was on my amazon next thing you know i'm like protein spreads and i'm like what the [ __ ] and i seen that this was um i seen that this was on amazon but i've never seen it before so i was like all right what is it so the price point on this bad boy is um i think it's twelve dollars for two pack so it's six dollars a piece not expense not expensive at all but guess what it doesn't have amazon prime so you have to pay for shipping which kind of sucks because if you had amazon prime you can get this for twelve dollars at six dollars a piece after shipping that's pretty fair but the delivery was like 5.99 so this end up being like 18 or 19 for a two pack which is about the same price point as like the bomar butters and everything else like ten dollars better get some stuff while you're shopping pretty much like you got to make it worth it unfortunately so and we'll let you know if it's worth it yeah so um yeah so that is the price point so the macros is the same 180 calories you have 13 fat you got eight carbs three fiber six sugar and seven grams protein and you're probably asking yourself where is this where's this stuff made it says country origin of turkey so this was made in turkey this isn't the european european lady you could tell it's got a european label it's got um yeah it's got a european label it's definitely interesting yeah it's different languages where's the ingredients at oh it's right there uh whey protein is the protein source and what sugar sweetener they use actually it's super basic sugar beet you use some sugar beet action that's it it's actually pretty basic what's yours pretty basic pretty basic whey protein hazelnut hazelnut vegetable white chocolate cocoa skim milk sugar beet lots of thinner vanilla flavoring so it's pretty basic so all made without lard all right yeah so we're gonna bust it open okay texture is on the point definitely like a i like it i don't know what it what would you call this texture oh it's like uh is it almost like the real deal it looks like to be like wow it's uh everyone saw the spoon enough uh yeah but it's pretty interesting like i like it look at that boom there you go do the haze on that first side apparently hazelnut first you're a big fan of um nutella right i do the real stuff boom definitely can't tell that there's any protein in there you can't tell no way no no way no way got jokes up in this place it almost tastes like chocolate pudding oh yes is that what it tastes like to you except a little bit more more denser more dense obviously with the texture but i would say it's got like a chocolate pudding feel as far as it tastes i mean it's got cocoa so that's where we're getting the chocolate but i love this yeah better than bulmar no better than walmart the texture is better than bulmar but the taste is better boomer that's what i'm saying the taste it depends because bulmar has like a marshmallow type of taste yeah it does and this is more like the real deal i would say as far as the texture this is the white one very similar very similar i think this might be a little bit more denser than the actually yeah it is it's like it won't give it all it's like you scoop it and it's there it's not going anywhere anytime soon like so anyways there's the white chocolate one that's a big spoon just do a little lick a little lick white chocolate hazelnut i didn't know that was a thing by the way that's just straight up pure white chocolate sugar not mad not mad yeah it tastes like white chocolate just straight up white chocolate that's games as you can tell she likes it it tastes like white chocolate it's really good with protein i think they're doing some [ __ ] over there at turkey i think they're doing some turkey actually now they're both contaminated they don't matter so what are you thinking i'm okay giving them the same mom ratings yeah same rings hmm it's really just like a white chocolate spread like let me look up nutella's actual flavor michaels because i don't know nutella's macros well for one it does have a decent amount of fat well it's nuts what did you expect yeah it's only got seven protein so it's not crazy bummer has like ten but for what it is it's not bad i really like him i forgot i don't have service down here so let's hope yeah you ain't got no service down here nutella 200 uh calories it's got 12 grams of fat same fat it's got 21 grams of sugar holy [ __ ] and then 2 grams of protein so there's less carbs way less carbs than this and more way less carbs same three three of the carbs are fiber here yeah so i think for what it is it's like super solid super solid yeah the cocoa it's a very big contender to the nutella like bulmar is its own thing it doesn't line up with nutella this one actually does i agree but i do like the bowmer one i do like it it's super soft it's like a thought it's so good so is this one it's good it is it's something the texture difference is totally different i think for the price point they're actually on point right yeah i suggest that i suggest them um ratings you got something yeah i think you're that looks like 10. i could see it in her eyes i think ready three two one nine yeah i'm giving it a nine it's pretty solid it's beautiful she likes it i like it she doesn't like things a lot so i would take this one as a good suggestion beautiful cultural check it out check it out on amazon guys check it out beautiful white chocolate straight or white chocolate can't even tell there's protein that's ganging that's coming that's good coming from her because she's always like it's got a protein taste or something hey in this day and age things you know 20 21 now it's 20 21 it should be mashed up by now yeah i don't want to taste no protein we're not back in the 80s yeah all right shit's growing i'm bringing that portion back shit's been growing since then so 100 hope you guys enjoyed this video if you guys tried these out let me

marijuana has been legalized in Colorado and business is thriving edible cannabis products account for almost half of the nearly 70 million dollars a month earned by local marijuana businesses according to the Colorado Department of Revenue but the market has not avoided controversy over consumption and accidental ingestion have generated considerable negative press so I travel to Denver to learn more about what goes into the production of these sweet and savory pop goodies and to find out is anything being done to resolve its issues today we are with Julie at sweetgrass kitchen Julie is one of the pioneers of the edible cannabis movement hi Julie hello thanks for being here so I heard you are going to let me cook some products right so let's go I'm gonna start baking you ready for me I wish I could the marijuana Enforcement Division requires all employees to have a badge in order to work a licensed marijuana facility I think it's because my paralegal Greg told you I'm a terrible cook so I don't believe you but can I at least help out you got it Oh may I help terrific so what's the next step Julie as we've got to put on our hair nets our gloves and our aprons and we can get started hi gang sweet cross kitchen specializes in butter based edible products we make brownies cookies and a seasonal pumpkin pie both on the medical side and the recreational side so when you say that pot is in your food it's actually in the butter right Hanna water is made when cannabis flowers Lauren fine silver this you are the head chef here at sweetgrass kitchen yeah and you're giving up your duties for the day to me okay so chef do you mind if I help out a little yes we we can help oversee the process okay keep close eye on me ah okay so what are we doing here we're making single serving peanut butter cookies today okay so tell me what to do I'm ready let's go are you guys scared a little bit he's going into a field and hit the bottom of the bowl at something that's very important is that we mix all of our products thoroughly and that ensures that the final product is to Majin s what's the recommended dosage for a consumer someone who buys the products I recommend that if you've never tried edibles before or it's been a really long time to start with five milligrams or less and wait at least two hours if you aren't feeling the effects yet you can always eat more I always tell people you can always eat more you can never eat less Julie I've added half of my dry ingredients what's next after this the next step is portioning out the products into single serving cookies and because you don't have a badge and because portion control is extremely important we're gonna have to let chef Lauren and her team take it from here something that has been a concern in the edibles market in Colorado is overconsumption and accidental ingestion the edible industry is 45% of the market right now the backlash has mostly been with edibles and while you can say okay I recommend my consumer only have half a cookie or one cookie if it's your first time there's no way to control what someone eats right right who in take the pot out of the equation if you send me home with a box of cookies who is just going to eat one there's certainly a responsibility on the consumer level to redirections and of course follow them something that the cannabis Business Alliance and the edibles council has done to minimize overconsumption is create an edibles education handout what we found were four most important points were start with one serving or less wait up to 2 hours don't mix with alcohol or other controlled substances and of course keep out of reach of children and pets and in the original child-resistant packaging in March 2014 according to a report by the Denver Police Levi's fam bah a college student visiting from Wyoming jumped to his death from his hotel room after eating six times the recommended dosage for edibles to sweetgrass kitchen cookie wrappers were found in the hotel room the coroner ruled the death accidental the incident with Levi Samba was was very tragic but it's important to remember that marijuana was not the cause of death when you say marijuana marijuana wasn't the cause of death and maybe I'm just speaking as a lawyer an autopsy was performed on the young man and the autopsy revealed that marijuana was in fact the cause of death well a significant contributor is is that what was in the autopsy report marijuana is not a toxic substance it there's no amount of marijuana that can actually poison someone to the point of death some say that's not true American scientist magazine reported that consuming 100 to 1000 times the effective dose of marijuana could in fact lead to death and while that makes marijuana less toxic than alcohol the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment wants to ban the majority of edibles saying they violate the laws requirement to prevent marketing to children since marijuana has been legalized for recreational use there have been many reports of children accidentally ingesting the product and then ending up in the emergency room that is true and certainly a valid concern accidental ingestion by children is something that that the industry has worked very hard towards minimizing through very strict packaging requirements including child resistant packaging very stringent labeling requirements but the good news is that in the past several months there hasn't been a hospitalization of a child so what that shows me is that people are now becoming more aware of the intensity of these products and the importance of keeping it out of reach of children we reached out to Children's Hospital Colorado and they had a different take saying they've treated 14 children this year seven of whom required intensive care the hospital predicts it will treat double a number of children as they did in 2013 and as for sweetgrass kitchen their staff has quadrupled and their profits have increased five hundred percent since recreational marijuana has been legalized", "3YOpDXVcqlg": "i-i-i i'm wavy and focus s like they dream that money grows and I wave G that here it goes in the deja I know these waves like like crazy I'm crazy too obsessed like for the assessment here it goes like waving money be like daydream like money dream that way be safe guys it stops at me but today come on you just finished one review for you CBD my apologies here sorry to her apology which don't know what video is going to come out for us so we're just gonna say on both videos but make sure you check out both of the videos they should both be coming out today so depending on which one is which it's not the next day but today what we are reviewing is some edible candies so these ones are amazing the red one they look red but they're not now cola hard squares so they're color squares and these ones they're a bit big record but basically these ones are more like caramel hard crunchy sweet basically they look like coffees but it's not more like a hard caramel crunches sweets so we've got eat what we didn't have a 10 in each that's our fault basically oh yeah okay nice long as there is 200 million pounds in 10 above so every time there's 200 milligrams so what we're going to do today is five of these ones and four of them ones I'm going to just let you know what if you like or you might have six of these and put them to do that so we'll just get into it anyway and then don't think there's no smell these knowledge smell that sweet candies but on appearance and literally these look Oh Papa's millions of Jews go to speak shop and you should get pregnancy but that was to stuck together day if you wonder why I'm saving them basically we've got event coming up kind of this event so obviously when we get hired on their or received in nine of them to get high down there and we've got ten here folks so we've got five offs with caramel candies and got five of the colas so that's gonna we're just gonna munch these so we're gonna taste each one and let you guys know the flavor on appearance it definite gets a tank on the parents definitely nice shape they are all even all the same size so you know you get an even amount on each one so you know someone's not hugging you or something but yeah really nice so it gets a 10 on the parents so we're going to try the color one nice definiteiy stir causes hauntings here while all say we've certain a divorce depending on how people make them if they made them with oils that their tastes very sour that's when the whole is activated or EB closing on his own is very sour so he's a sweet with that sour plant matter taste but it's not got part muttering it's just a resin so it's more of a resin taste but the only way I can explain it to people it's like a black mark oils resident wax it all comes from cloud is the inside of our captive so for them people that don't know same it's like vegetable oil and things like that this is really nice it's really taste the Cola and then the oils you can really they're strong very strong in tulip more probably get into it more stronger it gets so the coal of one just labor very nice flavor not too sweet you can taste the Toto a little bit not too much and not overpowering there's a little bit hidden because the resins a little overpowering overthinking to do a little bit more flavor but it's still on fire with normal speakers it's just that is that obviously he didn't know of certain tolerances so this definitely on the cooler side of them gets a pen so you might get a 10 out of the whole lot in a minute so we'll just drive Patera mile 1/2 car last week in the heart literally just like this week's the news I just wheat your shot when you're a kid your hard caramel sweets and on top this needs work bit like the bah humbugs but they were like top it tastes exactly the same just with that hidden surprise with the resin these are more buttery got a nice buttery flavor these are less presently tasting and because the is like a creamy sweet time off buttery taste that's taken over the resin with the other one that's because there are more sweet tasting sweet instead of being a caramely but every nice taste this one so one's more overpowering in the airport he's in yes I could eat these all day and not even noticed I'm eating but edible you could chuck one of these to something for them someone I thought I've been smoked cool I've never happened before and like nougat Chuck wants someone and they won't even notice anything cause of it so the caramel ones are the better ones they both get a tenth of favor awesome you taste that resin and you can taste flavors of the sweet and it lasts like parboil sweet in your mouth exactly the same they don't crumble like some powerful sweet I've had off some people as little temperatures wrong and stuff fall back um really nice so what we're gonna do now we must stop the video Pierre complete and then went to Rusty's we'll come back in about our power because it takes an hour for Oedipus to kick in I don't know if these I've linked with powerful sweetie bars and the

nice 400 milligrams this morning that floats and feelings it's not like very very high as when I think that 615 evokes in lean that was different but this is what I mean by very high for someone that

"Oy5-J81wPTc": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying some fudge from Devin's a Mackinac Island fudge company I have the chocolate fudge the chocolate cherry double dark caramel sea salt fudge and this one is the mint chocolate swirl fudge these were 369 each edge rural King and we actually bought eight of these wedges so there will be another review to come so hopefully we love these this is just chocolate fudge the original Mackinac Island budge no gluten no high fructose corn syrup no trans fat manufactured by more their confections in Mackinaw City Michigan two ounces 57 grams there are three and a half servings in this wedge and it's 230 calories don't happen I think you just have to tear us here yeah I think because it's in the back because they've taken it in like today so do you want scissors would that make it easier so we have a bake up like our platter here that Kevin stole from his mother years ago how did that thing parts ones information about Westinghouse yeah made in Bridgeport Connecticut no genuine Mel Mike no no Kevin's mom made peanut brittle on this years ago and I just never got good back so this is regular tribal but that's much softer than I was expecting it to be mm-hmm that's good bud excellent very rich chocolate flavor Delta the sugar graininess - that's like something you bomb when you're on the hallway somewhere you know yeah that it get your forwards and you go to the foot factory or whatever yeah that is genuine fudge it's really good it is very very go ahead just agile enough calories it is very very just fitting for very rich very creamy delicious chocolate yes so this is 210 calories 457 grams and it's the chocolate cherry that monster you hear the growling is that we don't we don't storing these are pug and some people that have never watched our videos before they're like is that someone snorting like the one it's something it is a but he's an old bug if you've ever seen the neverending story that's what we know looks like I don't piece of cherry in here I think it's good so as good as the first one but um it's um I'm not gonna watch cheery like a little bit I get this little humps of skin and stuff yeah I definitely get the texture I got a good piece of cherry um but um it's because the chocolate is so very strong you don't taste the cherry the cherries not it's in there and I definitely get a hint of the flavor just not a lot of it because it's covered up by that chocolate yeah it's so good it is very good but I do like the chocolate better I don't like the texture of just the pure chocolate without any interference of anything else yeah I do too detective that smooth creamy texture better without the little hunks of cherry yes it's so good this is the double dark caramel sea salt and I'm wondering tragically yeah I only see that caramel up at the target and right in the middle it is 230 calories how much is that for one Alex or something that's 457 grams 2 ounces no um I'm gonna try to get to the call the top Kevin and I usually anytime we're on vacation that's something that that we've done most the time now is a wool Passa budge so any time we go to Walt Disney right we've got fudge and the magic came down sticky Magic Kingdom has a place that sells fudge and we always get budge there is it the goopy boys no on Main Street oh no it's not thought that it's like the Main Street Bakery or confectionery something like that but then also when we've been like into the United Kingdom we've also bought bench there as well extras crystals salt that's good I wonder what that feel just a chocolate taste line how do you get the the salt oh mama fools all oh really yeah I didn't know it's all near the chocolate is it same talk mm-hmm I love the chocolate it's delicious but yeah what you get but there's not much difference between unless you get that job I got a really good salty caramel flower oh yeah there you go mm-hmm you just got didn't you get something that like don't flower it's very very salty oh but you have to give you have to actually get a piece of the cone yeah they vote they only put a little bit on the top and yeah there's one little piece in the middle right there but that's all that I see yeah the rest was just talking yeah so honestly I wish yeah I just hold fly with chocolate I wish they put more yeah they needed a little marbled it's a very excellent they didn't yes si como la vie salt flavor who've been which you just don't get a lot of it this is fifty seven grams 2 ounces is 230 calories as well and this is the mint chocolate squirrel is definitely green yeah looks like light up yeah this is normal cuz then I'm like a plate of you yeah there's a lighter it almost blends in with the plate good immediate boss of me you gotta love the texture get that fine grain yes of the sugar I'm on the lawn of toothpaste II yeah yeah it's right there yeah honestly I don't mind it it's not like it tastes bad or anything but I probably wouldn't get that one again because it it does taste primarily like to see it reminds me of those you know the little the little mint the peppermint balls those soft ones mm-hmm that's what that kind of reminds me of it said that kind of flavor Gesine you really like that I like it but it's still not what I would want to I wouldn't buy because I wouldn't want a whole slab of this mint right if I got a small square of mint and rush chocolate I'll be fine 369 so I mean that's really not that bad no I know it sounds like a lot no we paid $10 or $15 for a little bitty Birchbox yeah fudge is very expensive it's very priceless of supertrees yeah I think this is a great price for this fudge and so the chocolate would be the one I would go to just the just the regular chocolate and that surprises me because normally I'm all for the the mixing my second choice would be the sea salt caramel just because it's basic same flavor gasps little burst of Komal occasionally I agree and the one I wouldn't get would be the map only because it's not good it's just because it's so strong yeah it's not that one you don't know if you absolutely love mint though like you could eat knit like consoling all day long well I do love them yes so this I think this is a hit for us definitely so I can't wait to try the next four so if you have heard of Devon's mocking all fudge company if you've had this let us know which one is your favorite and thanks for watching [Music]", "SG7EE3sX51Q": "Iron tablets, difficult to absorb by the body but here's everything pharmacists learn to help you get the most out of this tablet and if you can guess the name of this iron tablet? leave a comment below and I'll let you know if you're correct so, you've been prescribed iron tablets because you're anaemic or you're at risk of becoming anaemic iron is needed for the production of haemoglobin which is super important because it carries oxygen from our lungs to the rest of our body in our blood cells which is why too little iron can make you breathless, tired, lacking energy, pale and may even cause heart palpitations so now that we know the basics let's talk about how to get the most out of your iron supplement take your iron supplement on an empty stomach so that's one hour before food or two hours after food and research shows that if you take your iron supplement with a drink containing vitamin C like orange juice it can actually improve the absorption iron is difficult to absorb in the gut and this is massively reduced by the presence of food, tea and milk so avoid these one hour before and one hour after taking your iron supplement some medication also reduce the absorption of iron supplements for example antacids iron supplements can also reduce the absorption of many other medicines so for example levothyroxine is one of them and certain antibiotics too so to see the full list and what to do about it I've left a link in the description below feel free to check it out now you've tried to take your iron supplement on an\nempty stomach but it's leaving you with loads of side effects like tummy pain, constipation, diarrhoea and feeling sick the good news is that these usually go after your body gets used to it but if they're not going and you can't cope with it then speak to your pharmacist or your doctor about these following options option 1! check with your prescriber if they're happy for you to reduce your dose and build it back up slowly to the prescribed dose\nthat way your body has more time to adjust option 2! speak to your prescriber as they may be able to prescribe you an alternative iron supplement with a lower strength and option 3! you've tried 1 and 2 and they haven't helped you're still getting side effects well speak to your prescriber or pharmacist about taking your iron supplement after food to reduce the stomach irritation lastly iron supplements can make your\nstools darker and sometimes black which can be a bit of a shock but remember it's completely normal and harmless always check any medication you purchase\nwith your pharmacist or doctor to make sure it's okay for you to you use please remember to always read the information leaflet that comes with your medicines and if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask your pharmacist and that's it you're now an iron supplement pro! let me know if you found any

of the dispensaries and stuff out here I picked up this mystery baking company new canvas infused green apple strips there's a hundred milligrams in the whole bag and each piece is about ten milligrams so here you go right here nice little strip ten milligrams in here so since there's only 10 milligrams per piece and only 100 milligrams in the bag I kind of got to eat like the whole bag to get an effect which since I have a high tolerance this product is not the best for me it tastes delicious it's an awesome taste I love eating them but it just as imprudent enough if you're new to cannabis and cannabis edibles then this might be a nice one for you because it tastes good it's only ten milligrams for anyone that's accustomed to taking in cannabis not the best option go with something a little stronger not saying this company's bad just this product is not the best for someone that has a high tolerance so that's my review on the cannabis infused gummy strips by mystery baking company 100 milligrams and whole bag ten milligrams apiece not a huge fan tastes delicious though they taste they taste awesome they're so good I love eating them they just don't really give me the effect that I want", "26LRTorzvBg": "goes to God here aha marijuana today we're doing another review want some enemies they should save you a book I got from high level health and downtown Denver and these were recommended to me because I was looking for an edible and try something new and I was asking for something that was vegan because usually a lot of edibles or chocolate base and it's milk chocolate so they're not vegan case you didn't know I'm vegan so I got you sweets ours here these are made by Eddie pewter and they're basically just like sour patch candies but um they're edibles with we like I said in the last video so um these are there's 10 10 milligram pieces now 10 milligrams is the base dose that they've actually established now here in Colorado because there's been some people out of freaked out with edibles so they say that the standard dose for an adult would be 10 milligrams and wait about an hour or two and then you can go from there you have to develop your tolerance now just because you have a high smoking tolerance does not mean that you will have a high edible tolerance this is a whole different kind of high it's ingested its processed by the body differently so just because you're dab or just because you're smoke all day doesn't mean you can come and take five or six of these and things it's okay now these particular edibles are rated at eighty eight point seven percent THC so it's actually higher than the concentrate that I did the review on yesterday now like I said these are ten milligrams there's ten in the jar I initially took one because I'm kind of new to the audible thing about hours who later I didn't feel anything so I took another one still didn't feel anything so the next day I woke up and I took three and I still didn't feel anything so I can do mad let means I have five left now and because I've worked my way up and I've been responsible we're going to go ahead and take these five today in this video and I'm gonna do a little review on the taste and show you guys the texture and everything what's going on and I'm gonna come back in about an hour or two and let you guys know and five was the right dose for me now unless you know I'm not just jumping up and being irresponsible also did some research already and people the kind of neutered down the dosage is for people that are new to smoking and things like that and I actually remember I think I said verbatim in some form ten milligrams will even get your grandmother high and they said for an average smoker about twenty five to fifty milligrams it's probably about an accurate dosage to get where you want to be so as I said we're gonna go ahead and try these five here now I'll try them the other day and they taste like if you were to take it I hated some wax or any kind of concentrate or oil I saw definitely very concentrated as I just said a moment ago these are actually at a higher percentage than concentrate that I did a review on yesterday I've got a few here I don't believe the flavors are different I got some some yellows and some greens and some blues here consuming on there and see the little sugars just like a little sour patch kidding me so Cheers I'm good pop now first it is really sour but then the sugar comes takes over in the Whedon tasting this is better I've had flour per pie flour prepared edibles before um brown using cookies and things like that in the past and this taste is a lot more pleasant it's a lot stronger and I mean I just like the taste of concentrates better than flour now but um pretty good pretty solid no one sticking your teeth as bad as most this is a positive for me but um one time just will remind you guys I don't think you can buy these and just pop a whole handful of them because and you will freak out I got a will teach you a lot different if you've ever been to high before anybody serving it too high they know exactly what I'm talking about these last two ring and pop these down playing a sentiment check back with you guys here and buy our oohs whoo and see how we're feeling and these still don't work come to conclusion the edibles aren't quite for me I'm gonna take a couple more trips out of the bait sound good okay I'm at these back up check back with you guys here in about an hour or two ghost God mile-high marijuana signing up I was some guys back now it's been a couple hours trying his uh Eddie Pierre of sweet and sour now if you remember we took five of them and I'm actually ashamed to say didn't really get stolen again this time um I got really tired though and I actually found out that these are actually uh indica heavy and that's probably why I had the tired feeling but I definitely didn't feel like I was ripped and I'm definitely preferring the flowers and the concentrates at this time however in a couple of weeks and we'll go ahead and know I'm gonna get a little bit more a higher dosages and I'm gonna get something that's the Teva heavy and we'll try that out but as we promised go ahead and rip the rest of this job Walsh berries and um we've got another video coming up real soon I made another little stop today and I got something special for you and these guys are gonna like that so that means that unfortunately what's the game I don't I don't think edibles really work from you and I got a I got a fast metabolism and I'm onna they work this time but we're gonna try them doing a couple weeks one last time though with this odd job balls berries there's nobody love this you guys know the deal though man comment like subscribe share all that let me know what you want to see me do any strange you guys might win let me buy I mean I got it all on my disposal here right now so anything you guys want to see me review just let me know certain things aren't like medical like I don't think I think achieved she was I think those are medical only so you know just let me know hit me up in the comments once again no ghost of God mile high marijuana signing out", "5BXoeB5n-YE": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I am super super super excited because we are taking another look at flourish the first time we have taken a look at flourish in almost a year we are going to be reviewing their new flavor their hybrid grand-jury n-- gummies so a mixture of tangerine and cranberry really excited about this if you've seen in my florist reviews before these are my favorite gummies hands-down there are no gummies that come even close to the magnificence of flourish I love them love them love them a lot and I hope that this cran Jurina gummy does the trick as well so this is a 300 milligram edible picked it up for the leave $20 at my dispensary so a pretty good deal for a 300 milligram edible and it is for show it is a if it's like any of the other so it's gonna be tasty and it is going to be potent on the back here you got everything you want to see you've got your nutrition information your ingredients all that wonderful stuff there on the back this is a hybrid variety so it doesn't tell us what strain but this is a hybrid strain that they used so let's go ahead and open it up here and take a look at what we got oh it's different than it used to be this is not the way they used to have a package they used to have a package in one thing now there are four individually packaged gummies just like this still in there ziggurat shape let's go ahead and open up this cran doreen hybrid here and give it a taste new smells wonderful smells so good hmm now there is a slight weed taste to this one which I actually encouraged by means that there might be as all of that milligram \u00e4j-- as promised but it still tastes really good good solid fruity flavor like the texture like everything about it mm well flourish hits it out of the park again when it comes to the taste texture packaging all that love the packaging love this little box love it all but the most important part is it still gonna get me high cuz it's been a year who knows if they've changed the formula what the case may be for that guys you're gonna have to wait two hours oh no you're not gonna have to wait two hours I'm gonna have to wait two hours I'm gonna come back to you guys and let you know exactly how this flourish cran Doreen 300 milligram has landed I'm gonna finish those other two pieces off and for you guys it'll be just a couple of seconds so thanks for watching wheats and I will see you in just a bit several hours since I've had the hybrid flourish 300 milligram cran Jurina gummy and I am pleased as punch to say it is as potent as it ever was another knock it out of the park homerun sports metaphor for flourish I really like this one real quick it didn't have the most cannabis II taste of any of the flourish gummies I've ever had then again it's a 300 milligram edible certainly that potent at least in my estimation I got me up to like eight and a half somewhere in that range or maybe even a little higher and that was actually spread out over about five hours I only had about the first half of it over two hours and then took the second half two hours later just in the circumstances I was in it has sustained me there's 300 milligram edible has kept me high for about going on about five hours now so really we're impressed with its longevity with this flourish again just the taste outside the cannabis part was good I like the consistency like the like the texture of the gummy it's so much better than at a pure or infused creations even with that slight cannabis taste in terms of that bitterness that awful as cerebral cannabis tastes it's not present here just a slight cannabis taste and I'm harping on it too much it's just I surprised me I've never really tasted any cannabis in their products before but there was it was here but it lets you know it's gonna be as potent as it is I really really enjoyed this one another absolute - thumbs up for flourish for me sorry I've been rambling a little bit but before I go I want to share with you guys my little cherry on top something that is not necessarily weed related but could be really weed related that you guys might want to check out and on this cherry on top I want to share with you an excellent movie from 2017 one of my favorites from 2017 and that is Briggs bbear starring Kyle Mooney of the Saturday Night Live Fame he always plays this sort of dorky guy long kind of curly hair anyways it's the story of a guy who lives in a fallout shelter and every day gets a new tape of his hero Briggs B bear who tells him a different story and adventure about his galactic life and it's about this kid's obsession with this bear that he knows brings B bear and I don't want to spoil too much more because the movie goes in unexpected places and it is easily spoiled so if you are at all interested in something and this probably goes pretty well with weed to be honest so if you're interested in something that's gonna be a little bit different than most movies that you've seen be sure to check out brings to bear I want to make sure that it let you know that this is one of the most optimistic heartwarming movies I've seen in some I'm there are adult situations and language and all that in there but this is not a cynical mean-spirited movie even though it does feature some again adult situations check it out again Briggs to be there really really enjoyed that one and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you making it to the very very end guys thank you so much and we will see you guys all on the next review peace", "zcBKa_CaRkc": "this is it I am freaking me I'd like to do and I'm gonna change into this and what else I'm gonna take my valium in a little bit guys sorry yeah they're gonna come in and brief us about the embryos that and all that good stuff so that's

picture of our embryo of our baby so we have two more I thought we had four three two we have only two more and we're gonna have all of them all of them because at first were like oh my gosh what are

many people Keaney and then what I answered the transfers complete how do you feel how do you feel okay you see yeah I know you said you was like cramping right when he was putting the catheter in oh my god I look so high right now I feel the effects of the vicodin look at my eyes but I have my baby bugs on Friday we're gonna code to make sure that the baby's stuck just relaxation until the valium wears off I I'm gonna get my iPad and just chill maybe just gonna take it really easy I'm not gonna lift anything heavy I'm not gonna do any crazy exercises I might do Tai Chi but I am gonna do a lot of meditation and reading I'm actually about to start training and a neuro linguistic programming guy someone becomes certified in that so I can help people and I'm learning hypnosis and yeah that's what I'm gonna focus on throughout this process guys it's nothing crazy it was a little like that I didn't really feel anything they pretty much just used like the device that opens you up like when you have a pap smear they cleaned up the cervix with a swab and then they put in one catheter first and they took that one out they placed the real one and just to make sure that there's a good entry point and then they put the embryo inside yeah I'm gonna take a nap see you guys later because I have to do the progesterone oil later on tonight but this valium feels amazing I feel like I'm on cloud nine I just can't believe there's a baby here I just can't believe it like see now it's hitting me remember like on the last vlog that I did I was like it hasn't really hit me yet but like just knowing that the embryo is in here and Isaac was just so happy one of you gave me really great advice especially because it's an emotional journey and it's a long journey to we've been through so much to get to this point um and she told me that even on the days where I feel like just emotional and just not happy I just have to remind myself that this is a blessing it is we're about to do progesterone and oil injection we have some in here you can see it's kind of oily and thick we have alcohol pad to clean the area this is the mixed seed needle and this is the needle that's going to be injected whoa that's going in your butt I thought this was gonna be the needle that goes in my in my hip I should say technically but it's not so what I learned I think it works let's put it sideways and you minimize the air bubbles I don't know it might be just me that I'm saying that but it seems to work for us there's the second time that I'm doing this and it seems to work but it still works what do you need this no oh why is that hurting just damn it because the rubbing is hurting and think irritated okay hold on please hold on I feel like it's not enough what do you think so am I going down right here on three no not on three whoa please don't not yet I'm not ready okay cool you let me know do you know where cuz it can go like do you know where because it gives you let me show you I have to be like in this vicinity right here you can't be all the way over here because that you can hit like a nerve okay okay hold on let me compose myself I'm not ready for you to have that needle by my body babe oh no I'm just trying to aim is it gonna be close to here right right here right you're gonna pull it down no moving your hand up all right let me see again playing down the middle down a little okay on three okay one two no blood let's go I'm going slow okay going slow don't push too I'm done how did it did it how do you feel yeah Dan there's only a little speck of blood right there you guys can you see the blood thank you babe sir was good yes you're like the best I didn't feel anything oh nothing no nothing nothing done yes yes hard part is over I'm so glad I we you don't have to go to this every day there is some big me to even though it's not as thick as the one that you take out the whoo I'm just gonna follow what the nurse said the ice really makes me feel like I don't feel anything and only tomorrow is probably when I'm gonna feel a little bit of soreness but it's really important to also rub rub the area just rub it out so the medicine goes and remember how I told you on my last vlog that I hadn't hit me yet what was happening well it's hitting me today and I filmed the video yesterday and I was like it's not hitting me I feel like I haven't really grasped the idea of what's happening and today it's just all the difference I'm also not going to drink any more coffee it's getting really hot it's pretty um I'm just going to finish having a relaxing night and I have dinner and then Isaac's bedtime starts at 7:00 as he likes to take a whole hour to settle down because when it's bedtime guys I'm sure your kids are the same way when it's time to go to sleep they want cereal they want water they want to read books they wanted two things they don't want to do all day they want a shower they take a long time brushing their teeth it takes us a whole hour for our whole like I need to start at 7:00 so he can be in bed by 8:00 o'clock and he can be sleeping by 8:10 8:15 so yeah it's almost time for that so anyways please make sure if you have any family or friends who are currently going through this and you would like to share this video with them or if you yourself have a youtube channel about your journey I know I came across one on my last video which I thought was wonderful and you should leave a comment with your YouTube channel if you're doing that as well because it's pretty awesome just seeing other couples going through the same thing and their perspective and how they're handling it I will see you guys on my next vlog you [Music]", "Lx1es3XK7vk": "hey everybody gets me for girly here and we're back for the third day of the 20 days of 4/20 I'll get that right eventually today day number three I told you we're gonna do a trio of edibles so sure enough we're coming at you with some Dixie citrus blast gummies now I've had gummies from this company a couple times before I think the last time I had them they were like the sour ones so maybe more of that little citric acid type of like twang and your your gums you know but these are the citrus ones and they have one or two other flavors but not the sour this time over at relief and Burton but majors relief that is but you know I figured I loved all the citrus strains so I'll probably love this one too and sure enough well I'll give you a little spoiler this isn't my first Bagley's so I do sure love them and the one thing I don't like about all the froley proof packaging is that right there but you know it is what it is don't eat the silica package just you know fYI these come in at I think 20 milligrams for peace it's 200 milligrams per bag and they're pretty tasty tasty now these say it's made with high-quality sativa oil sativa indica distillate is that what we're talking about cuz you know it's hard to really make that claim when you don't have any terpenes left in it but they work and they work really well and I'll be honest I taste pretty darn good too so shout out to Dixie I think that's made by Joyce labs absolute southern here mmm now if you like that lemon the orange kind of that flavor gummies give these a try pretty tasty until next time guys good luck going grow big", "dvPFDZ9BIxM": "hi this is Brad white from the medicine shop in New Philadelphia Ohio today we're going to talk about suppositories and the different devices that you may get your prescription dispensed in we have two forms of suppository molds that we use commonly there is our blue supposed strip mold in the white plastic molds both molds can be used either rectally or vaginally depending on the method that the doctor wants to prescribe a product in and I'm going to show you first how to use the blue molds the blue molds when you get them if you tug gently from side to side you will see that it creates a little bit of space for the suppository then all you have to do is take your thumb and you can hold it on either side and push up and the suppository will pop right out okay so depending on the size they make two sizes of these this is the smaller size all you don't have to use your scissors you don't have to get knives out and cutting anything just tug gently on these like this and give it a push at the bottom and they'll pop right out okay now on the white molds they're a little different these are plastic and these are meant to be pulled apart they're perforated here on the edges so what you can do is you can tear them gently like this and they will come apart and then at the bottom I guess toward the pointy side there's a place that you can pull the plastic part and the way these work is just like this it's like peeling open a candy bar you just gently peel these back and that will expose the suppository it's important to make sure that when you have medication like this that you keep it out of reach of children when you insert a suppository either vaginally rectally it's also that idea to let them up to room temperature most often when we dispense these four you will have a note for you to keep them in the refrigerator because they will melt at body temperature so it's important in the summertime not to leave these in your car because they will melt and make a mess it may also damage the medication that's in them if it gets too warm so inserting a suppository there vaginally directly once the room to warm temperature it's a good idea to run them under just a little bit of water to get some moisture on the tip so that they slide in easier and when you push them in rectally or vaginally you generally want to push them in past the first knuckle on your finger to make sure they're in there rectally you want to push them in past the sphincter muscle and you'll feel the resistance once the suppository gets through your muscle vaginally you want to make sure that you push it you insert the suppository at least up to the first knuckle on your finger to make sure it stays in it's ideal to do vaginal and rectal product application or insertion in the evening when you're going to be reclining but it is possible to do it throughout the day you may just want to lay down for 10 or 15 minutes after insertions if you have any other questions about vaginal or rectal suppositories you can give us a call at the medicine shop our numbers"}
