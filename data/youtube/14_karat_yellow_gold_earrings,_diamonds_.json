relationships over his how many years here at QVC and has access to stones that nobody else has these are those stones only they're set in such a way to make them look like even more than they already are but that's a 1 & a half carat total in these stud earrings set in 14 karat gold it will not be reordered because it cannot no more of these exist however as you can see on your screen you'll see on myself Jenna and here in front of me here while I tell you this is one and a half carat total weight you think I am mistaken because what they look like are really double that and Peyton will explain all I need to tell you is that you have your choice of white or yellow gold and six easy payments of 400 $16.50 there are very few of these to go around and when they're gone that is a very good thought discoveries means we went into in this case one of the great diamond dealers in New York and we said tell us what you have you know tell us what you've been holding on to the biggest thing about a vault discovery is we wanted at the price when it went in the vault not when it comes out of the vault so here he had a parcel of three-quarter carat stones and it's very unusual to have 0.75 plus in a partial sense but really because usually they you know use the lighter stones or whatever but here they were full 3/4 carats so we took all he had he'd really didn't have that many and we made these incredible earrings and when you can see him when you look at them each one is a three-quarter carat single stone but because of the way it's set and the metalwork around it it has the look of a carat and a half each each so a total carat weight look of 3 carats of diamond earrings because really when you start with such a high quality diamond immediately your eye is betrayed into thinking that it is more substantial than it is but then when you set it in gold and really the gold itself for lack of a better term the gold is faceted and so what you end up with is a seamless look you're I cannot tell where the diamond end and the precious metal begins which means to your eye this is one and a half carat stone which means to your eye this is three carats in total weight for the price that you see on your screen but for this quality of diamonds pain to get one and a half carat in each stud the cost would be yes exactly but you know what we don't want to be little because these are large diamond to begin you know when you're talking about a three-quarter carat solitaire in each year I mean that's a carat and a half to large diamonds and again we followed with a GI a you know it's very very important to us these are genuine natural diamonds you see the sparkle you see the fire you see the brilliance three-quarter carat in each year but the look of one and a half carat these are the stud earrings that I think most of us have had on that maybe someday list you know forever for lifetimes and you think that they're out of your reach I acknowledge it's still an investment if you're ready to make that investment don't you want to get the best don't you want to get more than you paid for don't you want to get those pieces that yeah you're happy to show them off on special occasions but you wear them every single day which you can by the way because these it's important for us to tell you this screw back on these as well which we don't have on all of our earrings when we get into this kind of carat weight when we get into solid gold you need that security and you've got that in these we have an update to give you on what was already a low quantity if you want the white we have three remaining three because if you want the yellow I have five remaining that's not three dozen and five dozen that is three and five there are eight of you coast-to-coast who will be able to partake of this in all gold so we'll give you one final look same story I told you with the holiday rings earlier your choice in gold I don't want to say it doesn't matter because your preference matters but really when we think about it this is all about the diamond and so choose whichever one you find you prefer but ultimately no and this is important to reiterate as we close at this presentation the price that you are paying is a very very old diamond price right that's part of why the price was in the vault too and we released it and preserved it and passed it on to you the white is gone three of them remain in the yellow please get to the phone soon if you want to be one of those lucky three to get some of the best diamond earrings you'll ever own still to come and it's already popular this is the", "RWJBj0xHTf0": "that was after the coffee full of coffee that was nada so when we started the show I was talking about our 18 karat gold hoops and glanced over at Mary to see what earring she was wearing and she did the smart thing she was wearing diamonds mmm like let's just go ahead and get a look at that these are the half carat total weight diamond stud earrings by if any others so pretty on you well she's so pretty behemoth oh you are lovely when you see them up close and you see the cluster design of these diamonds you will understand now why that half carat really does radiate even more to the eye than a half carat affinity is our own signature brand of diamonds here at QVC if you've not heard of it before it doesn't mean that it is like diamonds these are genuine eye clean diamonds and what really blows my mind Mary these are customer top-rated diamond earrings top-rated like I know if you're making the investment on diamond earrings you're opening up that box and going alright QVC show me what you got right cuz I gave you that much money I want to see something that's gonna take my breath away it took your breath away and what I saw and your reviews over and over and over again was the word sparkle Sparkle Sparkle I can't believe the sparkle two color choices in the gold bed in which the diamonds lie hmm but isn't it funny why you're looking at them right now look like almost exact same earring because there's so much diamonds I'm sorry they kind of cover up the gold a little bit I'll pour us through your choice of white or yellow gold you know just go with your typical preference you love the white it's likely because it creates a much more unbroken clean look in the diamonds and then the yellow gold lovers because you love yellow gold right and that's what you typically wear not only did we take a hundred and fifty dollars off markdown on diamonds we then divided that into six easy payments so these diamond stud earrings can be yours for fifty eight dollars and 17 cents they will not be reordered they cannot be reordered and maintain this kind of a value Wow I just I know I looking at the light bounce off of those diamonds I mean there's just nothing like it and this is your everyday earring I mean I wear the same pair of earrings every single day because they have a great story and I love them dearly these could be your story you can pick these up taking advantage of those six easy payments and think of it you can wear them forever you can absolutely wear them forever if you have a fancy occasion great but if you don't wear them every day they're just subtle enough so that they're not so in-your-face but they are dressy enough because hi they're diamonds you can wear them to any fancy occasion when we come back I do want to kind of get a little bit tighter and show you that close-up of what's happening with the diamonds you see that right there it is that cluster design the halo design or a bouquet whatever you want to call it in these individual diamonds when we take diamonds down to these smaller carat weights individually and they still do this do you see that sunburst of light well that's because you're starting out with such great diamonds to begin with when you cluster them together hahaha that's on fire light bulbs what do they do right they absolutely radiate and regardless of if you're choosing the white or yellow gold those gold prongs of course hold the diamond securely but add to the radiance of these that's why I would argue stud earrings like this in many ways their properties are better than a solitaire because in a solitaire really the only way to get that kind of a breathtaking Sparkle is to have a flawless diamond and they're not cheap well here you still have such great quality and diamonds only because they're individually faceted and then cluster together the light just does that mmm which is why they look so great on Mary and Dianna and you and they come home for $58 and 17 cents that's just the icing on the cake as far as I'm concerned I mean you've got me I'm in I wanted to have everybody see the size just because I think that always is such a nice perspective sure especially when we talk about these carat weights like what does that mean you saw them on Mary and Diana but we're at about a quarter of an inch from top to bottom and I just love it every time the light just is off it like that and then you know what it's worth doing - I know about to wrap this up I was gonna yeah good you've got honey great just so you can see how much gold is in there as well and then that post in clutch that's all gold - now I need to give you an update on how many we have if you want the yellow gold one dozen remaining and how many fewer than a dozen in the white and great thank you for showing that because remember we got all those branches of gold 14-carat gold holding up those diamonds as well so in every way nothing's been scaled back well that's a lie the price has been scaled back yay great point by a hundred and fifty dollars get them home as beautiful as they look here on the screen under these lights you've got to get it in sunlight incandescent light your own night and if they don't make you think what all of those top rated customers think sparkle Sparkle Sparkle oh my gosh send them back right

of all the primary carats of gold some 10 14 and 18 and what I mean by that guys as in gold jewelry generally it's going to be either 10 14 or 18 karat now also in this video we're gonna teach you how to calculate the value of each one of these as well as figure out the value for any carrot of gold whether it's 22 or 8 or any of the other carats out there all the way down to even 1 and additionally after this video is over you're gonna know exactly how to tell how much the goal than anything is worth as long as you know exactly what the carat is it's actually pretty darn simple so let's get into it and guys really quickly before we get started I do want to say if you like this video and you want to see more like this make sure you subscribe so you don't miss out in the future okay so in front of us guys we have 10 14 and 18 karat gold this is a gold and these are gold wedding bands right here and this is a pair of 18 karat gold earrings so to figure out what exactly the carrot of gold value is is actually pretty darn simple because all you have to actually know is that 24 karat is pure gold and I think most people that know anything about gold know that 24 karat is pure that's as pure as it gets and because of that it's actually really simple to find out the value of any other carat of gold so what we did is we actually got the calculator here and we're gonna show you very very simply so if we know that 24 karat is pure we can use one to represent a whole or in other words a 24 karat piece now if we divide this number by 24 you will see that each karat is point zero four one six six six six six percent pure or in other words point zero four one seven percent pure so now that we know that we can say okay well I have a 10 carat ring so this number times 10 there is the purity of 10 karat gold 0.41 7 do you see what I'm saying very very simple or we can take this number we'll take 1 divided by 24 again and then we can multiply it by 14 for 14-karat and now we know that 14-karat is 0.58 3% P R or in other words 50 8.33% peer and we can do the same for 18 karat and actually 18 karats pretty simple math but if you take one divided by 24 and then multiply it by 18 you can see that 18 carat is 75% pure which makes sense if you were to say you know divide 24 into four parts 18 carat would be three of those parts so you get the idea is 75% so knowing that you can actually calculate how much gold is in anything so if we take 1 divided by 24 let's say we have an 8 carat ring so we'll multiply that number by 8 we know that 8 carat is 33.33% pure now knowing that math makes it very very simple to find out the value of gold so all we have to do now is get a scale so we're gonna get our scale out we're going to turn it on so we're gonna go ahead and start with this 10 carat gold ring right here this is actually my own wedding ring and it is 10 karat gold and the reason I have a 10 carat gold wedding ring is because you know I work with my hands sometimes and I wanted something strong and since 10 carat gold there's only 41.7% pure as we now know it must be filled with other metals that are much more strong than gold is so it can resist a little bit more damage a little bit more wear and tear so knowing the math that we have we're gonna go ahead and put this on the scale and we can see that this ring weighs 0.26 ounces Troy so we'll go ahead and clear out our calculator and now let's do the math and figure out what the value of this ring is so today gold is sitting at 17 hundred and thirty dollars an ounce now ten karat gold is 41 point seven percent pure so we just take 17 30 and we multiply it by 0.4 one seven and that tells us that 10 karat gold is worth seven hundred and twenty one dollars and forty-one cents per troy ounce now we can simply multiply that by 0.26 because we have 0.26 ounces and as you can see our ring is worth one hundred and eighty-seven dollars and 57 cents now you might be curious how that relates in grams since jewelry as we know is generally winning grams and so I'm gonna show you that the math is actually the same it just takes an extra step so we'll go ahead and switch our scale mode to grams and as you can see the ring weighs 8.1 so to get this number it's actually just as easy you just need one extra step we know that a gram there it takes 30 1.1 grams to get one ounce a troy so all we have to do is take r1 and then we're gonna divide it by 24 and then we're gonna multiply that by 10 for 10 karat now we're gonna multiply that by spot so 1700 and 30 and we get to our 720 dollars and eighty three cents now we just divide that number by 31 point one and now we know that 10 karat gold melts for twenty three dollars and almost 18 cents per gram now we just multiply that by eight point one and as you can see again we have one hundred and eighty-seven dollars and this time 74 cents it's slightly more precise because it's weight on grams instead of ounces troy and other than that it's the same it's within cents of the other way of doing it so this math can be applied to anything so without getting into the ten and fourteen carat ring here let's go ahead we'll get our scale back on because it's shut off for being timeout let's imagine that this ring is 14 karat gold well the math can be applied the same way so we're gonna take 1 divided by 24 we're going to multiply that by 14 now we're gonna multiply that by spot so 1700 and 30 and now we know that 14-karat gold melts for one thousand and nine dollars and seventeen cents now we just divide that by 31 point one and then we multiply that by what it weighs in grams eight point one and as you can see two hundred and sixty two dollars and eighty three cents so in 10 carat this ring is worth one hundred and eighty-seven dollars and fourteen carat it's worth two hundred and sixty two dollars because 14-karat obviously is more pure so the beauty of doing the math is that it can be applied to literally any care to gold so knowing simply that 24 karat gold is pure and if you divide one by 24 and then multiply it by the carat you get the exact percentage purity of gold you can literally use this math for anything in fact let's do one more example will say that our ring is now eight carat so and United States something you may or may not know in the United States for something to be marketed as gold jewelry it has to be at least 40 percent pure so 10 karat is the minimum basically for us gold marketed as jewelry 9 karat goes below 40 percent so 10 karat is basically the number it has to be in the United States for it to be marketed as gold jewelry but let's say we have a European 8 karat gold ring those things do exist so let's go ahead and do the math again so we're going to it's very simple we're gonna take 1 divided by 24 BAM point four one six times eight multiply that by spot seventeen hundred and thirty now we're gonna take that number divided by thirty one point one we're gonna multiply that number by eight point one very quickly we know at eight carat this is 150 dollars and nineteen cents worth of gold so as you can see it can be applied to any gold ring if you know the carat you can easily figure out what the value is with very very simple math so 10 carat 14-karat 18-karat eight carat 22 carat 24 carat it doesn't really matter this method right here makes it very very simple to figure out the value of any carrot of gold so guys that is what I had for you today and as the scale just said it's set by and I will say buy as well but I do want to say thank you very much for watching the video and we hope to see you next time thank you so much for watching the video guys I just want to quickly give a huge shout out to my awesome channel members and support

or if you already have that you want to upsize so if we ever brought you a two carat total weight diamond earrings set in gorgeous 14-karat white gold we might have one and it promised Lea would never gonna happen I mean she's never say never but I worked here a long time I was the baby how was tired at 24 in 1986 I'll be 58 next Tuesday and I'm telling you this is a quality and a look and a lab-grown diamond that the one and I have to say across the board I think the one way that it makes most sense to buy your first lab-grown diamond if you're a little hesitant is do it in a stud earring because it is a classic diamond moment that you're getting in a lab created firelight diamond moment here at an crazy tiny miniscule fraction of the price point and when we brought this is the only piece in the show that we brought back from one of our first shows with Michelle that two carat total weight is $1200 off the QVC price on sale it is $2,100 off the comparable retail value $2,100 off and we have it on six easy payments of 580 3:17 we also have it on nine months special financing so with that again cute card that's easy to get you can even stretch it out a little longer but don't wait on that to karat and I'm not surprised that that's a road-going because I know in my life I will never have two carat diamond stud earrings like this that are you know mined from the earth because there's too many of us I want to go to yeah like back to Hawaii and break another toe and see another turtle I mean it's all worth it what you're paying for and the reason that they are so much sorry you were so nice to me when I hurt my back about not jay-z yeah well I can't see a turtle I said a turtle chain really yeah you know it wasn't right it was so we're talking about I don't know let's start again lab-grown diamonds look like they are okay so the reason that the ones from Mother Nature are so much more expensive when you get to this level because remember these are I clean they're very slightly included eyes I've never cheered so much up very slightly included is because of the rarity factor and the scarcity of those in this these kind of sizes you come from Mother Nature okay right so what you get with firelight is you get bigger stones you get brighter stones and bolder looks for less I mean when you look at the color in that maybe I mean the dispersion of light the colors I mean this is what we love about our diamonds these are I clean now on any of these earrings that are half karat stones or above right they're gonna be laser inscribed again one there's no additional charge for that that's just something that we do because we want you to be able to identify your diamond beautiful these are diamonds lab-grown are these are diamonds I mean you're not settling here you're not saying okay I can't afford this I'm going to get that I mean this is that moment where you say I'm going to have these beautiful two carat diamond earrings in my ear no one is gonna look at Blair and say hey Blair are you in a lab grown diamond they're just gonna look at Blair and saying how chic she is how elegant she is and I love that men and women bought these stud earrings yeah we brought them out for the very first time the two carat total weight is super popular it went the first time what size do you have on Blair do you know are you in the one carat total weight maybe the very this it looks like the one I think yeah I think it is okay like the one carat total weight so let me show you what we have you we have a half carat total weight that's fifty eight dollars and seventeen cents a month on easy pay that is a beautiful gift maybe for someone a little bit younger you know you talked about your grandmother and I love you know when something Clara well weight that is so weird I can't look at you because I'm going to talk about the Nutcracker and you know her name is Clara thank you right back that's great grandma is here right now I'm going to see a cardinal in a second so as a young dancer we were not to where stud earrings onstage and then when you got to be a little bit older and got a bigger part you got to wear studs and it was kind of like going into your pointe shoes for the first time having the chance to wear a stud earring onstage was always like that I have arrived moment so maybe you have a young lady or you know maybe you have someone that works in the medical industry maybe there's something that wears a lot of turtlenecks and scarves and doesn't wear and want to have anything dangling that is that half carat total weight and this earring is $58 and seventeen cents a month on easy paper diamonds okay Heinen's yeah lab-grown Lateran diamonds if we had a mind I'm in here that was measuring that big with my you know with half carat total weight where would we be so go there go comparison shopping yeah right go online call a friend who's in the business the next one we have is the one carat total weight so that's a half carat and other ear so now we start with the inscribing right Michelle right absolutely actual is it on the girl of the girdle of the style yep so you won't see it it won't be alert but with a loop with a jeweler's loupe and you want to have your prongs checked on your diamonds and you know that every now and again anyway so especially diamond earrings which you're going to be wearing a lot you might be sleeping in them and things like that right and so that one is 159 83 then we have a rare size one and a half which I actually really appreciate because if you're like I don't know if I don't want to go all the way to the two I want something bigger than a one carat that's 75 points three quarters of a carat in either ear that's 280 317 a month and again still have nine months special financing and free shipping and handling and then very limited to this is wherever you weren't surprised day one when everybody no time the two I mean we knew you'd respond well I just didn't know it's gonna go quite that fast I mean it was lightning that day look at the beautiful colors I thought you might be interested in seeing the baskets you get to see so much of the diamond do you see that other diamond is more exposed it's a four prong setting so you saw more of the light more of the diamonds but a good secure setting again these were designed by an actual jeweler by a designer one of the world's best and not every stud earring is the same if you're spending thirty four dollars for a cz it is I'm sorry not the same is what you're getting in the thyroid program and so I really want you to understand that it makes a difference it's not all the same everybody in everything rather in this world comes in good better and best and everybody has different needs right so to me this is a great solution right you can wear them for business or pleasure you leave them in you can wear them all the time if you want less in your life but more Sparkle for your dollar right firelight lab-grown diamonds are the way to go it really are and people what are customers who are I always say the savviest shoe beauty and jewelry shoppers around you guys know your stuff and you're very vocal about what you love and what you don't love right this has been a program that you have embraced and loved and the people that have gotten at home have just loved it I mean I also know that this is something that is never going out of style ever ever ever I mean when we used to do we used to do jewelry shows go it was like build your wardrobe so you needed your pearls you needed a good why love it we shouldn't wait a bangle bracelet and a good diamond stud earring but back in the day we did not sell diamond stud earrings and yes we have a beautiful collection of affinity diamonds on QVC but I love how Michelle says since these are lab-grown were able to give you these acres maybe seeing bigger gorgeous stones at prices thanks to easy pay and thanks to nine months special financing are within that collection so with Valentine's Day right around the corner and don't wait for somebody to buy it for you on you buy it for yourself may buy it for somebody you love yeah I can't even imagine if I were waiting for him to think that we have a deal I pick out what I want in jewelry uh-huh and then he wraps it and I just say oh you nailed it right and it works for all of us I do make him wrap it but that's a whole nother story but you know gentlemen you don't have to go into the jewelry store you don't have to wait in line and be intimidated and you know so oftentimes when people do go in they might have a budget of 349 dollars right right but you walk out overspending right I respect that at QVC you make the decision you control it a little bit more right so you feel less pressure and we want you to be absolutely 100% happy my husband was the president of the local Chamber of Commerce one time and he went to an event anyone a $500 gift card to a local jeweler and the gentleman that was Eckstrom said don't even go give us three and so much more and your wife works at QVC so that and I think my husband actually was working here at the time so well you don't go there this is I mean and I love the fact that you can start someone out like I think of my girls and when I bought them fine jewelry all from here I also always buy them something for each show that they're in so they can look back 30 years from now and say yeah I got Kara rhodochrosite earrings because she was in Evita and wrote a CRO site is the national gem of Argentina it always has to have a meaning and diamonds to do they have such meaning they are unconquerable she can do anything but for Valentine's Day these arrows were tipped and died there you go right in April's diamond month and you got your birthday in the month of April and you always had your like oh my gosh I can never go big and bold with my birthstone now you can you can

channel what's the same lets show us them for you those will never go out of style stud diamond earrings I think is a staple in every woman's wardrobe it's something that we all would love to own and have here's where QVC steps in and says we can make that happen and we can make it happen in a big way these are at a clearance price when I tell you the savings that you're going to get on these earrings they're all on six easy payments they have just been reduced so you're getting the first crack at them and there's no reorder on them plus that easy pay goes away at the end of the day we've got some sizes for you to choose from right now you're looking at the quarter carat weight and it's six easy payments of $28.30 these are one hundred and forty six dollars off of the regular QVC price let's go here to the center these are half a carat the next ones are half a carat total weight and these are on six easy payments of fifty-two dollars and eighty three cents these are two hundred and sixty-five dollars off of the regular QVC price and by the way they're set in a very generous amount of 14-karat gold on two tiers two plates tall prongs let's go over here to the one carat this is what I want one carat six payments of 115 dollars and fifty cents and these are three hundred and seventy seven dollars off of the regular QVC price that's the sale three hundred and seventy seven dollars off of the QVC price done in 14 karat white gold yellow gold or rose gold your choice paetynn I went through those choices but I need you to tell me what these look like the one carat is meant to look like what right the quarter care okay the quarter carat are the size of a three-quarter carat solitaire each each so that would be a total of a carat to have in your ears okay the look of a carat and a half so that's pretty fabulous what about the half carat the half carat it's a size of a 1 and 3/4 solitaire in each ear are a total of Wow three and a half carats it's a lot of dough much what was that Frank one more time last call on yellow all sizes yellow gold all sizes last call painting what about the big ones you know trying to hear the big one each earring each ring earring is the size of a three carat solitaire so that would be the look of six carats of diamonds okay so yeah you just took my breath away these are these are all full cut time off all cut diamonds you know you showed earlier how these diamonds are set they're set so close together that you don't see any space between the diamonds this is what patrons talking I just took two of our diamonique stones and what we what they do is I mean this has to be so like microscopically done where you don't see they take them and they just put the two facets that come together right up against each other and that way you never ever see that are the problem the space that you see there it looks like looks like a facet of the larger diamond so it really is an incredible piece these are all white natural diamonds lots of 14-karat gold your choice of yellow white or Rose this is a classic and will never go out of style the six easy payments that you're getting today is only today because that goes away at the end of the day but there's no reorder on them okay Chandra that's they'll take a look at our earrings right now this is what this is the look we love we love this classic it looks like one large diamond in each year you know these are all full cut diamonds of finest 58 facets brilliant cut they have the most Sparkle and brilliance but the way that they're cut each one is precision cut and precision set under a microscope you know a lot of times a diamond person will just count out okay 50 diamonds he's going to set those diamonds not here you have to match each set in each ear because they're precision cut for that earring this looks so good with the naked eye I'm know I'm gonna tell you the next shot that you're going to see it's under HD camera and that is basically you're looking at it under my or scope that you see things on our HD cameras and your these these fandangled televisions that you don't see with the naked eye you don't see in real life right I always give the example of the little bit of hair on my knuckles can you see here on my knuckles oh no you can't in real life but on TV when I go like this I look like oh you know I should be on Planet of the Apes but I'm not gonna get rid of that cuz I don't wanna have to braid it when I'm 90 so but that's what I mean it's on TV you see things that you don't see with the naked eye so when you get these home honestly paint with the naked eye you see these look unbelievable unbelievably real I'm sorry what did you say Frank Oh yellow gold is now completely gone your choice of yellow gold white gold or rose gold the white now is last call in all sizes of carat weights and in the Rose two dozen left in each size that's it that's it by the way that's just the basket holding it the diamonds are set in white gold Wow okay so there's no reorder on those no reorder", "DG0vxF2z3kM": "I'VE I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN WEARING I'VE BEEN WEARING THIS I'VE BEEN WEARING THIS\nPAIR I'VE BEEN WEARING THIS\nPAIR CUT

you are about this and I I don't think I've ever started a today's special value presentation with a sold-out update that literally happens seconds ago so my apologies in advance you see four choices there in our lab ground diamond 14 karat gold studs one of them is sold out it's the third from the left I'll break down all the sizes for you this is what is very important for you to understand these are all full cut stones and every single one incorporates the expertise from the Gemological Institute of America they are diamonds they are lab-grown diamonds that we are bringing to you for the first time ever and because of our excitement and your excitement over it we are going straight to making it a today's special value you asked for bigger stones heavier carat weights more affordable prices lab-grown diamonds are frankly out in the marketplace but QVC wasn't gonna do it until we could do them right and better than anybody else this is Jay three six four two one three to be clear right out of the gate guys these are not simulated gemstones they ship for free you have 30 days to wear them and enjoy them before you make your mind up for sure but many of you have already done exactly that call us qvc.com to place your order and if you are using your cue card you get nine months of interest free special financing michelle lau i always joke when i look at my card i go grow you got so many certifications behind you i don't even know where to begin but she is certified most specifically from the GI a with reference and specificity to diamonds themselves so michelle it is a delight to have you here i'm sucks IM loaded full of questions that i've been trying to do all my homework on behalf of our friends at home but before we get into this i want to show everybody the sizes that we have available one of them sold out its waitlist available and then we're gonna start picking Michelle's brain and getting excited finally over the stones you've been asking for that we haven't been able to bring to you up until now guys can I show the choices before we go off to that value comparison because I want everybody to see these up close it's important think about what you have been hoping for waiting for when it comes to mind diamonds and now what we have available in lab-grown here it is in the half carat it is the most affordable click question the Michelle are these diamonds their diamond their lab-grown diamonds here we go here's the half carat 349 dollars six easy monthly payments of 58 dollars and 17 cents they are prong set in 14 karat white gold next up is the one carat 959 you're easy pay is 159 and change and just so you know that's three hundred and forty dollars less than what we are eventually going to charge for this I'll show you those retail comparisons in just a second now I will bring the cameras or ask our cameras to come over to the one and a half carat choice unfortunately it is sold out here's the good news we have opened up waitlist availability if it becomes available in the next few weeks you are the first to put your name on them and they will ship to you at the same price that they are selling for today at 1699 two easy payments of 283 and then this is the gen coffee sighs it's the shell outside it is the is it available in larger carat weight yes please but I am just like you and I've been holding out for color clarity hardness but unfortunately have not seen the affordability until today one carat each ear $34.99 I invite you and no other retailer does this to Google and shop around your ez pay here is 583 17 and the whopping one carat in each ear J 3 6 4 2 1 3 okay value comparison is coming up now keep in mind this value comparison we shop around because like I said before we are not the only ones to offer lab-grown diamonds but your comparable retail values range from 579 mm that's a $230 difference up to $5,500 plus we are saving you over $2000 that is a comparison by the way lab-grown diamonds to lab-grown diamonds six easy monthly payments across the board if it helps you and you see these on Blair and are going yes please she is wearing the one and a half carat and that is the one that is on waitlist so it's probably best player if we switch you out here pretty soon okay questions abound on this one it is the latest innovation and technology or as I like to say human nature catching up with mother nature right being able to finally do what up until now we were only able to accidentally discover or search the earth for we now create ourselves so Michelle Wie not be more grateful to have you here today but I know this is something you've been chomping at the bit to talk about we're so excited and so overwhelmed with your response you know these are different than mined diamonds mined diamonds come from the earth they come from the dirt these are grown in a laboratory under very controlled circumstances in fact we have really incorporated the GIS expertise which you mentioned emotional guidance and strict guidelines and we want to go through and just compare for a moment the two for you the firelight lab-grown diamonds and natural mined diamonds my favorite is that first one because everybody throughout the building has been asking me to us I've been wearing these earrings and they go hey I heard about this TSV but I'm confused is it a diamond yes yes they are both diamonds and by that we mean same physical chemical optical properties as a diamond that I might be lucky enough to find in a mine thousands of people of the earth exactly same composition crystal structure check and check check and check okay do I have to baby these no they are a ten on the Mohs scale just like mine diamonds up do I have to baby these they are scratch resistant just like a mine diamond okay here's where some of the differentiation comes from right origin lab versus mine mm-hmm grown in the earth well we kind of already covered that lab versus mine here's the biggie is it simulated no it is not made to look like a diamond it is a diamond is a diamond grown in a laboratory firelight gives you everything you've been asking for and more you've been asking for bigger bolder brighter stones and it's taken us a long time you mentioned that we wanted to wait until the right time to give you this John until recently there were no larger sized in lab grown diamonds De Beers is actually the company that started this whole thing they've been doing research and development on it for years and the stones were small and beautiful but now the technology has advanced much like cellphones or any other technology to the point where we can bring you the one and a half or we can bring you the two carat like what I have on so these weren't available interestingly our friend John our producers in my areas cuz that's just look great they are so bright you know the girl and me just goes crazy I look at the light you know you just look at the shine to those diamonds alright seek your breath I definitely want to go in that direction next right because as beautiful as these are and here's where I am so grateful that we have the highest of high definition cameras right and we go there is the sparkle there's the beauty but what I don't see are inclusions are yellow discolorations or cloudiness here is why or one of the reasons apart from the afford a bit by the way this is the one carat 1/2 carat in each ear alright let's talk about color and clarity here because our very educated friends and thank heavens for you at home have been putting us to the test and asking us the questions as you should about the color and clarity of these stones and so I defer to you miss yeah I want to show you what we use in our affinity shows and we've got one coming up next week where we have naturally mined diamonds this is the chart that was the color scale it was actually developed by the Gemological Institute of America now you can see at the very top tier at the top line on the right hand side this is where our fire light lab-grown diamonds live they live in a near colorless range so the technology is so good the inclusions are so small if any at all that that's where they live in near colorless very slightly included so again getting back to this the g i-- a scale GAA also does cover color cover clarity excuse me in affinity we promise i - or better in this line in the fire light line I can promise you very slightly included in the range now this isn't something that we made up this is our not our standard of operations this is coming directly from the Gemological Institute of America they brought in the scale so they do they use the scale in a little different way for lab-grown than they do for mined from the earth just to help to differentiate the - among other things I love that we can show that to you and we can prove and put this out there and challenge you to enjoy these when I've been meeting over these and I've had many meetings overlap grown diamonds and so excited to share the whole hour with you I kept thinking there's a woman at home who's just like me right I am a busy working single mom but darned if diamonds aren't always at the top of my list right we always have expense of taste but when the time is right for me to buy diamonds I want to be able to look and go that is the brightest cleanest most beautiful stone I've ever seen there's the challenge because to get stones that look like this and be able say to say that they are diamonds it comes with a real hefty price tag right I'm finally able to wear diamonds and know what I'm wearing know where they came from look with my naked eye and go hey that's a diamond and B I don't even can tell whether they're lab grown or mined and have that price point that you at home have been begging for so let's come back in these are purchased by the way that you make for the rest of your life these don't turn am I correct that these don't turn yellow they don't go cloudy they're diamonds there's lab-grown diamonds and so no and in fact you care for them in exactly the same way which I'm assuming is gonna be another question that people are gonna ask how do I care for them you can put them in an ultrasonic you can care for them exactly as you would your mind diamonds these are grown in a laboratory they are chemically physically optically diamonds through and through I'm gonna actually I know we usually start with the you know smaller of the carat weights but I mean come on there's a diamond show and I will show you all of them because honestly I mean we're looking at different price points and they vary greatly and I acknowledge that while I'm talking about affordability it's still an investment and I get it but if you are making that investment today I hope that you are going with the one that really makes your heart race your mouth water and getting excited so here it is in the two carat now we have a gosh we have a hundred and forty remaining and the two carat total weight for the day that's it a hundred and forty remaining so that's one full carat in each year all full cut absolutely stunning set in 14 karat white gold now again I will only briefly mention that we have the one and a half carat in fact in a second I'm gonna put the one and a half carat in one of my ears so you can see the difference between that and the one carat today so that I can show you that the difference I mean obviously you can tell but is not so much so that I would think it would stop you from getting the one carat the one and a half carat is weightless only that said there not all that many that we can even make available via waitlist as well but if you place your order you are not charged until it ships next we have the one carat that's a half carat in each ear EasyPay on the half carat in each ear the one carat total is 159 and remember if you shop with your cue card that actually breaks it down to about one hundred and six dollars a month if you spread it out over that night look at that flash carat more women will worry and wanting to upgrade to the perfect carrot that's what I'm wearing the other carat weight okay incredibly popular understandably so gift for a graduate Christmas gift guys if you are watching she wants them yes so I will help you out there the answer is yes no let's get something for the house what the translation is and woman she's being nice right second piercing here's the half carat total weights that's a quarter carat each ear doesn't look like that because of the color and the clarity that we boast today the EasyPay on the half carat total is fifty eight dollars and seventeen cents let's show you that price comparison again and we'll dig a little bit deeper as well here's where we get to brag it has taken us thirty three years we could have done this a few years ago we wouldn't have had the two carat we could have done this a few years ago they wouldn't have looked as beautiful we would have had the one and we wouldn't have had the one and a half for the one alright so your retail value comparison is where I ask you to shop around and remember this is just shopping around from lab-grown diamonds to lab-grown diamonds and look at your price comparison I'm glad you mentioned that you know if because I do represent affinity as well from the mine or from the lab you know we offer you a choice and isn't it wonderful to have a choice on what type of ayman you want to buy but if you go to our website at QVC calm you can actually look at comparable natural diamond studs and you can see for yourself or again go out and do your research I think it's important that you do compare it's very important by the way two things to tell you one if you shop with your cue card as I mentioned you have nine months to pay this off so you can do that math that way you can spread it out evenly over the nine months you can make the minimum payment and do the rest of it the variance completely up to you lots of information there QVC comm is where you will find all of these details but here's something else you should know that is available at QVC com certificate of authenticity for every item that I'm showing you in the show if you search that item number c-calm you will print a product specific certificate of authenticity to go back to this we mean business when we talk about GI a knowledge and Corporation following their strict guidelines giving you what you've asked for answering your questions and giving you the best of the best because ultimately I can hand over all the information in the world if it doesn't make you smile if it doesn't make you stata make your tracks really does you got to get excited when you see them and you will you're gonna love it now we're working on some special packaging for this in the future right now it's going to come in your traditional QVC packaging we didn't want to wait we wanted to get these to you just as quick as we could so guys I wonder if you can do a one shot of me so I can show you I switched into one carrot and then the one and a half all right and you can actually play the game yourself I'll give you the answer in a second but one of my ears has the one carat total weight and one has the one and a half and I do that because the one and a half is now waitlist eligible only and that doesn't mean you can't order it but it means it won't ship right away so here is it will come in close I believe this is your one carat yes okay so this is the one carat total weight so remember that's a half carat each year gosh they're so pretty I'm sorry I'm getting distracted look all sparkly and shiny and then this is gonna be the one in half all right and pardon my earpiece is there less stairs to be made there's no mistake to maintain so use that maybe as some help if you're kind of shopping between the two and obviously the price differential is there as well just to kind of help you out I", "8u1hXhUt9Kk": "yeah all right Payton Kelly is here with us for these what we're about halfway through our two hours of affinity diamonds now here's the thing Payton you've been a gemologist and well you've been a gemstone lover all your life right yep and we could probably say he's seen just about everything but when he picks up a piece like this and he goes Jen these these stones these I just they're gorgeous this is my pick of the show if I get a pic this is great but I know it's got to be hard this is it now it's my one of my favorites as well simply because yesterday and I checked yesterday these earrings were 688 dollars you were looking at a half carat total weight and 14 karat gold yesterday 688 look at your clearance price on your screen it's the one in red 378 dollars we have taken 310 dollars off of the QVC price on this halo design absolute stunner of which just the center alone has the look of a three-quarter carat solitaire in your choice and I'll turn it to the side see that you can see because you really have to look at it from the side to even notice a lot of gold but there is a difference in and a lot of 14 karat yellow gold the clutch - or we have for you the white gold as well and I'll turn that one to the side so that you can see that one your choice there's not a bad one in the bunch because ultimately it is all about yes wow look at the sparkle and the brilliance I don't even know where to start there you know when I look at this the reason it's my pick is because the diamond quality is unbelievable but the workmanship is absolutely incredible you have nine diamonds you can't even call this a cluster when you have nine diamonds precision cut very very precision cut and they're special type of setting micro pave but even more special where they're said so close that the girdles are almost touching of each diamond so when you see it and here you know it's on high def it's blowing up a hundred times you know it has the look of a larger diamond a three-quarter carat so when you're looking at it and when I'm singing it on your ear I say one large stone in this night just from two feet away but then of course you have the diamond halo around it which is kind of like an extra nice little bonus I mean look I love when we show you jewelry like this from like six feet away right you see them on Jenna and you go boy this is gorgeous earrings and when you start to come in a little bit closer you look at that and you go I mean I'm I'm not a gemologist I'm not overly educated when it comes to stone so I'm just doing the I'm a Shopaholic look and I'm sitting here trying to dial up what I think the price would be and guess what mentally I see it as closer to that retail value without retail value over a thousand dollars our clearance price is three hundred and seventy eight dollars it just absolutely blows my mind well I think there's no more classic rich diamond look than a pair of solitaire earrings and not many of us can afford I could afford a three-quarter carat diamond each year but here you have the look of a total weight of a care and a half but that's just a sinner right exactly all right I will tell you if you want the white we have a hundred and forty remaining if you want the yellow 130 and that is it because it's clearance price we have to bid farewell to it when it does sell out it cannot be reordered nor could it be reordered at this kind of a value and that's really what it's all about and the same thing I was saying before Payton about big single solitaire stones I mean if if you're like me you save up maybe for the solitaire but likely what you're able to get does not have the color cut clarity carat weight look of this in a single stone so this is how you get what most of us are only hoping for is a solitaire but I would argue even more because the solitaire doesn't do this see this it doesn't do that it doesn't do that you know now love things when they're customer top-rated because that means that you know they love it just as much as I do or you love it just as much as I do well to I mean when you think about jewelry everybody's opinion is different right if you've got something that is supposed to do a single job right it's a screwdriver it's supposed to do one job and if people say it does that job great its customer top-rated that's one thing jewelry it comes down to so much more than just it's doing its job but what is it doing for you do you see it as something beautiful do you see it as having high quality did you see it as a great value and people again and again were saying just that about these earrings before they were 378 dollars by the way and now that it's at that great value you go yep you've got the backing of other people you have the backing of QVC with a 30-day money-back guarantee now you've got free shipping and handling and now you have a savings of 310 dollars off of the QVC price so here's another one of those what I call the Easter eggs in your show right you're sitting around you're waiting for the real real amazing deals on the pure pieces the gold and the Diamonds and here it is I think if you have ever wanted a pair of stud diamond stud earrings I mean the workmanship here the beauty of the diamonds you know when you look at these diamonds and you see the cluster in the center you see the look of one large diamond but you really see the finest of affinity you see the color and the clarity but here the cut is so important you have the brightness which is a reflection off the diamond you have the fire and look at the fire the fire the colors flashes a color that you see coming from within the diamond but Sparkle to me is the most important and when you see those light and dark areas coming from within the diamond you know the diamond is cut extremely well and I just can't get past the fact that when you you look at them yourself and you really would have to get them about as close and hi-def is that you see on your screen right there to even discern one stone from the next and it goes back to what we said before if you have round brilliance that's great but they have to be cut in such a way that they can like you said I've seen you show larger examples where the girls are close together right it's a real master to set even more skill than just cutting a single stone right you have to be able to cut the family all right let me give you an update we started with 350 of these if you want the yellow six dozen remain if you want the white three dozen of you across the entire country will get to partake of a clearance price which was once 688 dollars is now 378 dollars I can read Jenna's looks and I know that she loves those what do you think Jenna the ring and the earrings so we have Jenna's pick of the show now - she's gonna get her unrolling absolute", "zQdu1qSXUt0": "every second there are so many choices in this the key to all of them is gold gold and gold all of these rings are set in gold celebrating 30 years which is how we did it originally with Dominique set in precious metal world's finest simulated diamond so it's yellow gold or white gold mm-hmm you have your choice of carat size or carat weight and then your choice of cut right okay those three things yellow white carat weight or size and then the cut of the individual stone set that up so here the one carat two carats or three carats I'm gonna start big or go home I'll just don't like it right here I'm really good at it cuts Meg you help me out I'll go like this I'll hold these up and then you go for it all right we're gonna go side to side here so that's the oh okay that's the pear shape that we're looking at right there right there are three care in the pear shape then there's a fancy heart that is a specialty cut and boy boy is it difficult to do then the oval oh I'm having a moment with ovals right now I think it's classic like the round but it'll long gates on the finger you're gonna love the oval look at the color that gold it's beautiful all of these are under 160 crazy crazy crazy even if you're getting the large three carat here's the second row alright so in the second row we have that beautiful emerald cut for you you have a step cutting where you can peer right into that stone it's crisp it's clean it's gorgeous here comes the middle there's the middle one with our cushion cut so think about a princess cut but it's a little bit more rounded of a pillow shape it's very very soft in its look but it's a durable stone also cuz it's diamonique six prongs on the Marquise mm Wow or keys back in a big way is it it is it's making a big big comeback okay and we're not finished yet one carrot - carrot three carat size and all of these Chuck choices Wow go big or go home okay that's a three carat round look at that baby that sure is again six prongs no one is going to second-guess if that is a diamond or a diamond eek because they see the six prongs they may say hey is that real you say it sure is real gold it is indeed real gold and next to that is the ash machine now there if you ever want to see what an asscher-cut looks like it's a step cut so it's on like a princess cut you see the corners are angled and it's a step cut so it's extraordinarily unique shape and cut of a stone that's your Asher and next to that is the princess and they see the difference dramatic princess is a square shape or that square silhouette but then it's faceted Aaron like a round stone right so you get that sparkle if you love brilliance to your stones then you look for cuts that are like the round brilliant the princess cut even the oval cut in the Marquise the pear shape and the heart will have that for you oh if you love step cuts though your choice is here you want to be thinking about the Asher the emerald yeah and then did you have one more Asher I think those are probably are too sexy that's in there yeah okay now I want to do kind of the same thing if I could in the white gold to Karen again so it's one carrot - carrot three carrot I can do white or yellow in any of these choices and then simply get the cut that you want all of it on six easy payments so the one carrot starts at six easy payments of 23 2004 24 and then your stepping up when it comes to the three carat if you'd like to do it to the six easy payments of $26 you can't go wrong and look at the difference in white true actual white gold not plaid but white gold so this is giving you more of that white-hot feeling right it's it's crisp and it's clean if you just like that sparkle to sort of feel uninterrupted that's what you're going to love from this white gold look look at simple that bandit I mean that in the best possible sense like no fooling around it looks like a platinum band but it's a it's a white gold band so so the so if you want to size this you could take this to a half size it's real gold it's honest to goodness real beautiful gold those are the three choices up top next one done in white gold here we go there's the Emerald again for you this is a two-carat we're looking at now that is your cushion in the center and after that you will have the Marquis so maybe this is your chance to get that replacement ring so when you're traveling you can wear a ring with confidence but maybe you're looking for that upgrade ring too at the bottom you'll see the round you're loving this one by the way white gold round loving my producers letting me know white gold a sure so right up front don't wait five six seven eight nine and ten white gold big beautiful two carat princess cut what is it two carat princess cut cost not a one carat but a two carat I mean I remember back in the day out yeah carat and a quarter I know it well was $5,500 and that was almost 20 years ago depending on the quality of the stone the color of the stone right I mean this could be absolute fortune a fortune in the last minute here we go with the one care and a great way to start but most people go with the three there's the one in the last minute you know what let's come back to the three I do you know what I want to do here's what we should do Erin let me take these guys right here mm-hmm and show the difference between the one and three just in case you're wondering what's that all about yeah that's what it's all about so that's it is believability really important to you and you want to stick with your one care because that's what you were married with go for it but if you want to have that chance to try what would that upgrade look like one day what is it just for fun go ahead and have that one that you put on for fancy occasions if you want special occasions or every day to day because you wear it with confidence it's diamonique coming with that lifetime guarantee j60 eight five three six easy payments of 23 in change all of it featured price and brought to you yeah we you see what Blair did Blair went right for the big guy Blair did you have the band ring to go with it stay tuned stay tuned we're coming right back we are past the nine thousand mark for our today's special value we'll give it a look in a second it's coming back in the second hour not gonna have time for this presentation about available j28 zero to two for the 100 fasted two carat total weight stud earrings in 14 karat gold that's four easy payments of

our diamond assortment a wonderful opportunity to see what affinity diamond is all about so these are a floral motif as you can see here and you have a choice between a 1 carat total weight or a half carat total weight these are on clearance so let me just clarify for you what we're talking here for the half carat total weights you've got a quarter carat per ear these are a 599 dollar earring where we're taking a hundred and fifty dollars off the price on clearance they're for 49 or five payments of $89.99 which i think is an unbelievable value again in that case it's about a $300 price drop plus you're getting easy pay as you can see it gives you the illusion of a big solitaire but what you have are all of these stones that are all set nicely together that create a little bit of that illusion of a bigger look yeah I'm glad you brought that up because these are actually although they look very traditional they're really modern and a little bit edgy see that Center diamond is pressure set it's being held in place by the diamonds around it so it floats there in the middle and the reason that's important is there's not as much metal around it to impede the light yes so the brilliance on these is they're really off the charts these are just the perfect perfect gift all brilliant cut 57 facets in each of the diamonds again known for their incredible fire and their incredible sparkle and it does give you the look of one big solitaire I like to call it the icy floral collection yeah they're looking a little Edelweiss or little you know I see flowers popping through the snow the colors are just off the charts if you want to light you want a color show these diamonds are bright bright bright look at those all done in 14 karat gold this is the one carat total weight so half carat per earring not a lot of stones on these I mean we didn't make luster 50 stones to put these together I mean I think you can see you really only have I think 7 stones per ear that create this look and the table it's got a nice proportion to the depth of the diamonds you know I looped these not long ago and I was really impressed with the cutting and to me it's one of the things that gets overlooked a lot in our discussions is cutting cutting is really important yeah you can have the nicest material and if it's not cut to the proper proportions in diamonds it loses light or leaks light that's when you start to see bowties or dark spots within diamond right so that's why we're willing to pay more for great cutting these are again cut by one of our favorite manufacturers and the light show goes on for days you're gonna love it I think I need to try them on sure it's a hard decision honestly because both sizes are really powerful yes the one carat it does not overpower your look yes but the smaller version gives you so much sparkle that you think well maybe I don't need the bigger ones in this case I don't know it's really up to you every diamond is tested before it's set again we talk about our affiliation with the Gemological Institute of America I am a diamond graduate they're learning about diamonds is a constant you know growing process it wasn't easy it's taken me a lot of years but I've learned so much about it and we're changing every day and not only here in affinity but as a community the diamond dealers the diamond brokers the miners everybody involved we're really upping our game and I think you're gonna see things like this happening more frequently here at QVC our buying team is really on top of it cut pretty just simple right always appropriate yes never never wrong you know if you're trying to figure out what do I put with it you'll never be out of place if you have on a beautiful diamond stud never overdone never underdone and here's the thing if you were to buy this as a solitaire 1/2 carat solitaire 1 carat solitaire total weight you know you're spending a lot more than 800 and $49 for sure you're spending a lot more than on the smaller size than four hundred and $49 but look at the look that you get I mean it's just it's pretty it's classic which I love I'm a classic girl I think you all know that if you shop with me here over the years I'm I am never claimed to be a trendsetter and that is fine with me yeah I just like to look appropriate I like to dress my age I like to look neat I like to be pulled together maybe I play with color a little bit I'll always throw on a cool shoe and but for my jewelry especially my investment jewelry pieces let's keep it classic right stay classy San Diego so keep this classic keep it forever keep this so that every time you open up that jewelry box you don't think I don't know what I was thinking when I bought those but instead oh I'm so glad I splurged on those I'm so lucky I found those at a clearance price yeah I never thought I was gonna be able to own diamond earrings and here you can do it so you get one carat total weight or half carat total weight the yellow gold choices are completely gone I have a dozen left in the white and that's in each size the half carat and the full carat and because it's clearance when they're gone they're gone

a half in each in ear ear the way this has been faceted and the way these I mean the eye that is a close-up shot of a pair of earrings huge diamond earring huge that looks like a carrot and a half in each ear and if anybody gets any closer they better buy you dinner look out what's going on here paintin well each one is a three-quarter carat diamond very large diamond each one is a solitaire these are not clusters you know we do great clusters these are single diamonds each diamond is a three-quarter carat total weight of one and a half carats but the way they're set the way that we faceted the gold all the way around it and then put those four prongs on the outside it's each one is a size of a one and a half carat or a total of three carats in both ears only 200 of these are available that means 100 in yellow 100 and white there is no reorder on this item there is no reorder on this item it gives the look of one and a half carats in each year let me just clarify this is these are diamonds a one and a half carat stone I know I know from you know asking someone to marry me years ago what a one on a quarter carat costs right what a one carat cost one and a half carat can cost you five grand just one single stone for one stone so again what can we get you what is going on here how was this done that's a three-quarter carat solitaire that's a single stone not a cluster that's one large diamond but then look at the way they did the goal brilliantly it's called a miracle stud because you have the faceting all the way around it in the metal which has a high glow high gloss high polish and it looks makes it like the diamond is as large as the entire thing so it looks like it's the size of a one and a half carat solitaire does absolutely does like there is no way that you do not see a setting within that you do not see the fastener within because the fire the dispersion the bending of light and the beauty and you could see it in the gold again we started with 200 of these it's now six easy payments of for 1650 paper so it's incredible it's incredible and there you see the brilliance in the yellow as well right oh absolutely you know what we're so proud of these we put a screw back on the back and that's what you find on your finest diamond earrings you see that that's very very secure it's not just a clutch that slides on that asus croute what we call a screw back that where it does screw on and screws off extremely secure that's what you should always have in a fine diamond earring and you've got them here so they were never going to lose that never it's always going to be there I want to show these on Kate so you can see size though this is the scale story again it's one and a half carat but it's got the look of three carats right right right right you know these are the biggest earrings the biggest solitaire earrings we have ever been able to do this was a vault discovery which excuse me which means there was one parcel of these diamonds we made up every single pair we could when these are gone they're gone they just you just can't get these back you're anywhere near this price these are the only samples we have that's how new and exciting this is right so okay the models are very upset Kate's putting them right now but she's pouting slightly just getting it over yes but she's sharing she's putting them on right now she's going to put them on in the yellow this story of this miracle stud is another example of trying to to maximize what can be a costly proposition a buying diamond earrings and I realized look this is six easy payments of for 1650 but this is from the earth this is from volcanic eruptions millions and millions and millions of years ago and these are real diamonds so when you wear these their last call in the yellow gold last call in the yellow gold you will have these forever three dozen remaining when we say diamonds are forever these are huge I remember the first diamond earrings I ever bought my girlfriend who's now my wife I was living in LA as an actor is eating soup out of a can yep and and you could almost they were so small they almost fell through the whole year but they were dying but they were real diamonds they're real dive that's what matter you know what for me it was like really important try to do the diamond thing right look at the size of these look at that there's the look of a one and a half carat look of a one and a half carat the difference in a one when you go up a half carat a quarter carat they go up exponentially absolutely so to maximize all of this is incredible and there is the shot of these brand new diamond earrings love them or turn there within 30 days bringing them home you will see these and you'll see scale in just a second NJ 3 24 602 they are gorgeous well without even without the miracle stud head you know these would be very very important earrings they each stone is a three-quarter carat solitaire that's very important that's not a cluster that's one single stone in each year and look at the look when you look at that that is a look of a one and a half carat solitaire in each year total of three carats and that's the point that's the point that's close right I mean that that's as close as shot as most people will see and yet make a mistake the colors of these stones are still going to be beautiful let's talk color and let's talk why they're so white and why affinity diamond right right right well we're very proud of infinity these are these are near colorless which means when you look at the stone from the side you don't see any body color but it has the great attributes of the cut you have the brilliance which is the light reflecting off the surface you have the sparkle that light and dark coming from within and you have the fire you want to see those colors of the rainbow coming in now because of the size of these these are extremely large you could say some small inclusions in the stone now if you want the yellow it is sold out however you can get in our wait list but technically it's gone no surprise why one dozen remaining in the white that's it only one dozen remaining I told you we were going to show you things we've never showed no we're in the last 30 seconds people just joining us what is this three-quarter carat earrings miracle stud special heavy goal setting makes gives it the look of a carrot and a half in each ear this is a solitaire this is not a cluster that's a single stone there is no reorder on this item we will not be able to get this back on this price no reorder on it and is this the vault discoveries of all discoveries of all discover discovery as we go into the great boats we went into a great diamond cutter in New York he had one parcel of three quarter carat stones we went through them we sorted them out we came up with just a very few pair this is what we're talking about we can't reorder these go online look and see", "w5ST092sDrM": "oh yeah we'll just stay here it's pretty and everything you know because re with us and oh she changed okay so it's time to talk about these oh it's a first look - all right what does that mean it's kind of self-explanatory we present a lot of items here at keep you seeing a lot of times you see them throughout the day or on multiple days this is your first time seeing these earrings ever and I'm trying to fit who here they are because you know me I'm gonna grab the bigger of them okay these are the floral studs in your choice of white or yellow gold they are choice of half carat or one carat this is another one where I say you're not compromising by getting the half carat oh no I'm not going look at the tiny ones nope they're all big it's just your level of big that you love in this fresh girly but not overly so floral design it really kind of is like you have to call it floral to see the floral yeah does that make sense that otherwise I just see it is this beautiful cluster of diamonds in your choice of either $539 these are sale prices so you know what that means they go up at the end of the day $539 for the half carat $9.99 for the 1 carat everybody gets six easy pays everybody with a cue card gets 12 months special financing here we go white and yellow gold and when you first saw that shot dialed up you may have thought you were looking at the bigger of the two this is a half carat so there's very sizeable you know what I mean like I think whether your hair is short or long I think I'll go right usually you know as smaller earring we say for shorter yeah but no no no no they will find their way through smaller one doesn't get lost okay so there's the yellow gold these are the half carat look at the sparkle you know you know I'm turning it back and forth to show you the gold but also for other reasons some pow pow pow now okay here's the one carat but do you see what I mean when I say it could be a single stone but when you have multiples of each color I to clarity they all have fire in life so you can make the case for dare I say better than that single stone when they are not depressed that oh I meant to talk about this too we were talking about the today's special value because it's the same story right to your point if that were one single stone it would have 58 facets 57 or 58 facets depending on who is cutting it that's nice don't get me wrong but you've got a series of gems here seven I think in all six around and one in the middle so seven times you know sixty facets is four it's almost four huh almost 400 facets in that piece as opposed to 58 and that's why that's why allies are myth diamonds yeah but when they're mommy like this each color I to clarity I am doing something right now that I almost never do what's that and that's put on the smaller choice really whether the relief does I usually go all out right and this is the half carat and darned if you don't see a whole lot of light there and do you see what I mean when I say technically we call these the floral studs do you see a flower right now it looks like a single stone that is the most radiant beautiful e faceted one diamond and trust me if that were the case and these were you know a quarter carat or a half carat each they wouldn't be 539 and 999 so to me that's the beauty of it oh my gosh oh I have less than a minute remaining and that kind of kills me so can I wait before we do I just want to show you inside profile here again this is your half carat so you can kind of see that setting that's gonna sit nice and flush to the ear but all of them are beautifully prong set but you don't see the prongs and you don't see the gold that's gorgeous this ruins me you know really up springtime I live down in Austin Texas for about a year and a half and I loved it there and one of the things I love about Austin he's all the wild flowers that are blooming along the the freeways right and I look at these earrings and it takes me there in my mind and that that feeling of seeing all that beautiful color oh yeah he's there I was 10 years in San Antonio and it was always a long blue but it's easy kid out you pop them in the middle of the bluebonnets because you're happy that's right Jay three six one six zero seven price goes up at the end of the day let us know if you want one carat a half white or yellow gold okay [Music]", "gDSERkzK9rU": "so

questions about this new category the buzz wait a minute what about simulated what's the story what's the natural story what is lab-grown you were in great hands the trust and 33 year history of QVC is here to help you among other people we have Michelle loud Michelle I want to get this right you are a diamond graduate from the Gemological Institute of America I am you are I am and this is a big moment there's a mess we have my good friend and host on QVC Nancy Hornbeck who is a graduate gemologist from the Gemological Institute of America good evening Nancy hello hello I'm super excited you are on QVC's Facebook page or on you your own Facebook page I'm not showing my own Facebook page Nancy learn about QVC come on over there I'm gonna answer any kind of questions you have because I know these guys are also gonna answer your questions but you might have some more and so that is why I'm here to help field anything you might know because this is very exciting I'm super excited about this there's a lot to be excited about so here we go all right here we go Michelle you ready for this so ready okay people who have been waiting and wondering I'll just throw it out there what is a lab-grown diamond very simply it's a diamond you asked for it highly anticipated you wanted bigger bolder brighter and we are really delivering here today Rick and we are delivering it here today for the first time ever it is is it a simulated diamond it is absolutely not let me be clear it is a diamond these are diamonds these are lab-grown diamonds you either get your diamonds from a mine from the dirt or you get them from the lab these are from the lab these are from the lab yeah the analogy I used earlier Nancy I were talking about talking about for weeks our buyers have not slept for the past months making this thing happen this is this has literally been months in the making is that if you received right now a dozen roses right Oh am I giving my wife a dozen beautiful roses would my wife say oh these are the most beautiful green house roses I've ever seen she'd say they're beautiful rose you see that beautiful roses right so how is this done what can you share about the process of well it's a very high-tech thing okay I mean it again has been years in the making it and all began with the beers they've been at this for a long time of course de beer is synonymous with diamonds we decided that when we wanted to go forward with this it had to be at the right time until recently you couldn't make anything bigger than a half carat now the technology is advanced so much we can give you the one and a half carats we can give you the two carat presentations we we think that we really blew the doors off of this guess what so my producer Brian upstairs this is in real time this is in real time right now these just launched this is the half carat total weight the most affordable saving two hundred and thirty dollars but guess what's in second place guess what's in second place the two carat the big guy saving two thousand dollars that's one carat in each year do these have and here's the big question the same physical chemical and optical characteristics as a natural mind diamond yes they do exactly exactly the same so what about well you know what here's what I'm going to do this is a wonderful little graphic for those of you who are just joining us right now who often said you know what I looked at diamonds I love diamonds simulated diamonds are great but I it's an anniversary I want to treat myself I want to step up to larger and bigger but I can never afford to do that what's the difference this checklist will clarify it and give the purists out there reason to do some major shopping right now the first check up top Michelle is it a diamond yes check check the same physical Mical and optical characteristics and properties as a mine diamond can I get a yes the same composition and crystal structure yes so all of that is what you're getting what about hardness the mosaic deal what is that nine ten okay so dr. Moe developed this back in the 1800s and it stands today it gauges the scratch-resistant sea of gemstones both attend perfect scores a scratch-resistant yes but take a look at where the checks differ ones grown in a lab ones grown in the earth the Roses story right things wild in the backyard in the in the woods or in that greenhouse that's the check but look at the bottom one they're both red X's is it simulated mine diamonds not simulated lab fire light lab grown diamonds no no they're not so here we go with a brand-new today's special value and your questions and so many people I spoke to my friend barb who works in office land right here at QVC she's one of the executives and should we were working on this talking about and she was really a new to it she looked at her wedding ring beautiful wedding ring she looked at the difference she looked at the earrings and she said I think I might want to upgrade I think I might want to step up here I'm Kara did the same thing perfect I see a day look at these gorgeous gorgeous diamonds that happen to be lab grown they're stunning and they're set in white gold yeah fire light is my new favorite thing I mean they are so incredibly beautiful bigger bolder brighter you know when we decided we want to get into this and again I mentioned we wanted to get into it at the right time we went to one of the world's largest diamond producers to make this happen this company is completely vertically integrated so again we make it very value conscious for you you get so much for your money with these but you get so much look such a big look bigger bolder solitaires but it's a rigorous process and we were very sticky about it we made sure that we incorporated the GI A's expertise and their vigorous processes in the making of this so the GI A's expertise of this process absolutely going to one of the largest diamond you might come time and suppliers is that fair to say fair word diamond suppliers that helped bring this to reality so not some different planet we went to this is part of them buying diamond world in terms of the supplier that we worked with there's simply lab grown here we go with the choices all set beautiful prong all done in gold white gold there you see the beautiful post and back all done in white gold there you see full cut stones what about the color and the clarity that I can expect with these as I take a look at the half carat that is most popular for six easy payments starting at 58 seventeen and I will tell you this a 30 day return policy on this there is no risk what is the color and the clarity that she can expect when she gets it at home so we're talking near colorless diamonds this is what you've been asking for in our affinity culture shot again near colorless also very slightly included the only way you're ever gonna see an inclusion is with a loop or a microscope or with advanced testing that's the only way that you might see something I mean this is all intents and purposes I clean and I clean diamonds so here we go with the care and a half that's the one that you are wearing carat and and a half total wig and I'll put that next to the two carat so that you can see the difference so there you see three quarters of a carat in one ear and there you see the full carat in one ear now I will give you the update already guess what we are now in just launching this brand it's never been on QVC before in 33 years big industry news right you think we've there's 10,000 of it in the choice that you have there's a hundred and forty that we have Wow not a thousand there's a hundred and forty pairs in the eighty million homes that were broadcasting in right now that you can have and love I bring it home she tries it on she wears that she gets compliments she's treating herself right now it might be an empty-nester like my wife and i are are right now as fewer than 200 now in the to care oh these are going quickly there's also nine months special financing if you want to put this on the cue card highly recommend you doing that put it on the cue card make the minimum payments and if you do no interest will be charged to your account she brings it home she wears it and now she says okay I'm going for this I have no risk she takes it to a respected jeweler hmm somebody that she trusts and they put it under what's called a loop a Jewelers loop right what will they see Wow is that a beautiful diamond is that a beautiful one is that a beautiful diamond right that happens to be lab-grown they're either mined or they're lab-grown but they will not release a simulated diamond they will see immediately a simulated diamond we're gonna say wow what a diamond in another kind another kind of stone that is simulated they could see it and diked and autonomy immediately it might be something like you know it might be doubly refractive or you know as a gemologist you're trained to look at certain things I will tell you what I am trained in diamonds there's no doubt about it I've looked at a lot of them in my lifetime yes but let's not talk about me let's talk about the president of the company that is the vertical diamond manufacturer the one that is one of the largest in the world alright the wife of this gentleman said I don't want anything to do with lab with lab-grown right he said I challenge you to tell the difference he put down a $10,000 diamond and he put down a fire light diamond she could not tell the difference now this woman is surrounded in diamonds for the last 30 years this is crazy she's now wearing them and loving them we sent our Quality Assurance people to their offices right to take a look at the product the woman was so impressed and now she was been with QVC for a very long time okay Lucy went there bought some hopes some of the hoops that you might see tonight and says how much she loves them you said there were a number of people here behind the scenes that we're going crazy for these I'm telling you you need to see these yeah our buyer okay let's make you so happy Morgan and Cindy even would but working non-stop and Cindy said something today that was great she said you know when it comes to the diamond world we've always talked about color cut clarity carat weight right and now there's the other choice it's mine or lab simple as that yeah either way you're getting a diamond that happens to be lab grown here comes the choices again here comes the opportunity this is brand new make your choice bring it home and try these studs on I think it's the perfect choice they're round they're full cut and here comes the easy pay and here comes now the big big Wow as we're showing you these retails when I say comparable retail value I am NOT comparing this to a mine diamond which would be Oh a lot more oh yeah I am comparing it now to a lab grown in the market and it's taking off and retailed like crazy and that two carat is $5,500 because it's a lab grown diamond diamond fire light take a look at this that's a two thousand dollar difference it's on six easy payments nine-month financing 583 with a 30-day return policy to take home try on white gold as your setting but one and a half carat normally it's 2500 and that is when we do our comparable retail value shopping that is through the legal department someone could be a little higher or somebody get a little lower that is the median or that is the average right that we have found in the marketplace similar carat weight a similar clarity cut a cot clarity 2500 so look at the story here we are going to blow everybody away there's gonna be a lot of retailers that are not happy with QVC right now because we went to one of the biggest diamond suppliers in the world and said hey yeah guess what we're ready to create our own firelight lab-grown now the one and a half there are now 120 remaining and then they're gone for the day and then they're gone for the day that's it 120 care and a half you know what it's normally 2500 what would that be 75 points and 75 points in natural mine diamonds that are near colorless can you imagine it would be a fortune a fortune if you're an empty nester like me you want to retire someday or maybe you are retired you say you know I want diamonds I want to treat myself I want to get these and have them forever how about this go for it for under 17 but if you want the one carat they're available right now that's on sixty to be able to 159 83 and the half K", "IUvJ5pxY9AQ": "fine diamond jewelry from the diamond store only the finest conflict-free

make your final decisions I think it's the way to go and these next earrings this is these are classics we have a half a carat in total weight or three quarters and carat because our 1 carats gone nine months special financing so let me start off with what do I have over here with myself so these are the half carat choice and they do come in either the yellow gold or the white gold choice the one half a carat is going to be one 1483 on our best EasyPay six easy payments and special financing around seventy seven dollars for nine months but when we go over here to the three quarters of a carat right in front of Jose that will be one sixty one fifty on easy pay or 107 67 with a special financing we have to tell you what the look of because you might be looking at those thinking wait a second that's not that's not a half a carat that's not that's not a quarter carat in that er in that area actually we want to put them together so that you have a little bit of a side-by-side comparison because when we're putting these together these are our this is where our designers really outdo themselves because this is a cluster look and what we've been able to do is we're using all full cut diamonds and when you look at let's say a one carat diamond you're looking at 58 facets when we're putting these together there are multiple diamonds here so we're using a larger center stone and then clustering very very very closely those additional diamonds around it so you are getting 57 facets her diamond here what does that do that gives you even more fire that gives you even more brilliance that gives you even more sparkle we've also added those those sorry the settings yeah the prong oh my goodness my back medicine is kicking in the prongs so it gives you the look at a distance not even a near distance one single stone what does that mean the earring that Nancy's holding right there is a half a carat but the total look is 2 carats so that actually is one carat the look of one carat per year right and so this one actually is because this is a total carat weight of a half a carat this is gonna be a quarter carat of diamonds in each ear correct correct okay just wanna make sure we got that clear you're getting a look of one carat of one carat / yeah / that's pretty awesome so it's a little confusing okay so we wanted to make sure so we're gonna go to the 3/4 now the three quarter carat total carat weight looks like a carrot and a half in each ear for the look of three carats now if you go out in the marketplace and you try to price 3 carats diamonds yeah it's not gonna be what you're seeing right not even close we're talking thousands of dollars if you've got to go with you got to go with what we're talking about here apples to apple H in color and at least I - and clarity which is all that's I clean and near colorless diamonds you got to go with that too as well right absolutely doing but every detail of this as you can see I you know which yeah which size do you have on honey this she's got the bigger one on she's got okay she's got so she's got the three-quarter carat I believe I got I actually have on the half carat size with my oh oh look at you well it's on the other side of your face so I would I have two on this side okay - are you actually look Nancy is wearing her entire wardrobe of earrings why not you should I got you know what these are pieces that are made to build your wardrobe of jewelry and you're now actually wearing your two more classic pieces so Nancy's wearing that gorgeous inside-out hoop and then above that she's wearing the half carat but again that the look of one carrot pretty oh that looks gorgeous right oh my gosh okay so these earrings are a one day only price and that price of these goes away at the end of the day today not to be seen for at least six months so take advantage of that yellow gold has already sold out on those diamond earrings now these guys were still okay we're feature priced and but eventually the feature price is going to go up to a regular QVC price so a half a carat will be 689 you three-quarter carat is six at 969 but pay for it over six months or pay for over nine months and I'll give you the nine months special financing for your half carat that's gonna be seventy six dollars and 56 cents for the 3/4 of a carat 107 67 on nine a month special financing and again if you don't have a cue card sign up for one this is an amazing opportunity because we do sometimes do like flash easy pay sales on our QVC credit card where you say everything is on five easy pay and then you're like wow so it's another fun thing to actually have that but go ahead and sign up for that alright it's J's five eight zero five six is your item number there oh don't forget the one day only I got to give you a scoop on that right so full carat so half carat in each year eight nine", "oV8alEEGD-4": "APPRAISED APPRAISED AT APPRAISED AT $965.

able to bring you this kind of quality in sizes and stones today Payton like we've never been able to do before and this earring is a great example of that we've offered you stud looks in earrings for a long time and I say stud looks because we were able to work with some master cutters to create this illusion of a full stone when in fact if you looked super closely it was actually a whole bunch of little stones clustered together together to give you that illusion we've heard you you've said you know what I trust QVC I'm loving the quality of affinity that I'm purchasing from you give me what I want and that is I want the full stone exactly I want what I'm seeing in the jewelry stores but that I know they're charging me so much more than they should I I trust the quality that QVC could bring to me in full carat stones can you do that for me here and so that's what we've done your first choice is shape we have round and we have princess cuts your second choice is size and let me just look and see so if we start down here down on the other end of the table I'll take you through our sizes so it's choice of shape rounder princess choice of metal 14 karat white or 14 karat yellow and then sizes of stone right here is your most affordable price point can I tell you the very first pair of diamond earrings I ever received were this size right here it happened they were a lovely gift from the family of the boy that I dated in college when I graduated from college as a matter of fact and they were very special for graduation and they were lovely that's a nice size harder size diamond for two hundred and ninety-nine dollars Payton think about this girls you'll drop four hundred bucks for a Dooney and Bourke handbag no problem this is diamonds diamonds for 299 dollars they're a nice size smaller size obviously quarter carat total weight but also think about this these are great if you already have a larger stone and you want a smaller stone for that second piercing these are a beautiful first pair of diamond earrings my daughter's gonna be 16 in May to be perfect for her and at a price point where you know listen I'd be heartbroken if something happened to them it wouldn't be as devastating as some other purchases you might make so great way to get started with real diamond stud earrings right here on QVC if you want it a little larger it's diamonds a little bit showy or we can do that for you so these are a half carat total weight so each stone in this set round or princess cut is going to be a quarter carat single stone each beautiful size totally wearable look at the brilliance the real thing everybody these are this is not a simulated diamonds line Payton these are real natural real stones natural diamonds and I'm glad you said you pointed out these are single stones those are large single stones single stones and then okay you're ready to go for it maybe it's a milestone birthday maybe it's just because you feel like it we did bring in one carat total weight so that's half a carat per ear in your round or your princess cut these are the ones I tried on backstage and you took them all I swapped out for the long day because I love those two they're so beautiful these are set the way diamonds and Fifth Avenue stores are set Peyton I mean really these have been created to give our customer that Fifth Avenue jewelry store experience at prices with easy pay that might finally allow them to have that dream come true they are set a little bit higher and in four prongs so you really see the beauty of the diamonds and look at the princess cut you know one of the most popular styles today among the younger ladies yes no they're loving their princess because that's what they're asking for in the solitaires and their bridal sets well if we made a list of top five jewelry pieces every woman should own I would even say hi Amy by the way thanks for rushing in look at those on Amy oh they're so beautiful I'm not sure which size you have Amy do you know you don't know hey Jerry do you know what size Amy's wearing which of those you pulled for her can you tell Peyton it's hard I don't want to give the right you know sometimes on TV that half-carat so those are quarter carat each right that's your middle so mid price point everybody $6.99 and six easy payments but here's what I want you to think about I mean this is so special for QVC brand-new today in gold in shapes we don't have a lot of these because again like most diamond retailers you know you're lucky to get what you can get sometimes and the higher the demands for quality Peyton the fewer pairs we can have there are well also it's the weight you know when we're saying a full one carat that is a full one carat yes if you bought these out in a mall store they could weigh 96 points they could be 95 points they wouldn't be that full carat right and the half carat or the quarter carat it's the same thing so you're guaranteed that but also the affinity quality of diamonds that's our quality genuine natural diamonds they're absolutely stunning beautiful it's a special treat yes as I was saying earlier top five jewelry item every woman should own I'd say top three I think for a long time as we settle for diamonique which is beautiful I don't want to knock diamonique at all but a lot of that was because we could never offer this in the real before now we can 299 great way to treat yourself to diamond stud earrings you've always wanted to do that for a daughter a granddaughter a graduation a sweet 16 here's your chance to do that but if you really want to kind of treat yourself special for an anniversary or a big birthday do that one full carat if you can that's six payments of 333 dollars and change now on the other end of the diamond spectrum we have a pave look for you in colored diamonds so these are $99 this is a great", "gYqrghKoLEo": "THREE--LAMAR THREE--LAMAR SCOTT THREE--LAMAR SCOTT DONNA THREE--LAMAR SCOTT

THEY WILL BE", "CDVohm0C8eA": "by the way it just to let you know every item in the show is sale priced and so that means a lot we actually kicked off a big event here at QVC today through Sunday where there's gonna be 32 full hours of sale priced gold and fine jewelry pieces so you'll see gemstones tomorrow is a lot of the hours I'll be with you from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. tomorrow with all gold pieces some with stones some without more diamonique don't have a bar diamonique tomorrow as well in that show but this is exciting now here's the thing I want you to look at the price tag you're looking at $35 or $45 and you're gonna say no way mm-hmm you're gonna be able to buy gold for $35 it's true if you want the one carat size you can get this at $35 in either 14 karat yellow gold or 14 karat white gold if you want the two carat size in the round or the two carat size in the princess then we have it for a price tag of $45 so basically what it amounts to is in the round we only have one well excuse me in the round shape we have one carat or two carats and in the princess cut we only have the two carat size and that's the total weight so it's actually one carat on each earring if you're getting the two carat total weight right so choose princess around one carat or two carats and then you get to do choose them without a color of the gold 14 karat yellow gold or 14 karat white gold so you have three big decisions but here's what I'm gonna say first-come first-served that's at $35 for a 14 karat gold pair of earrings that look like diamonds or $45 for the two carat size that's unheard of that's amazing it really truly is this would be a perfect time for anyone who's watching and may be experiencing diamonique for the first time yes to really give it a try and understand what the world's finest and stimulant will look like in person and to have it in precious gold by the way I'm going to show you both the one care and the two care in the round just so you can see the difference in the size so this is the one carat total weight half carat on each earring mm-hm and then this is the two carat size which is one carat on each earring don't want to be done - I think you know for a lot of people they have double pierced ears yes so they might put you know by both of these sizes and then put one at the bottom and one up a little higher certainly you do do that with the round the princess cut though is only in the two carat size and I think that makes more sense in many ways because when you break down a princess cut to a one carat it's it you gotta have at least a large enough size to be seen you know sure you definitely will I think that half a carat in each ear is probably a great starter point maybe you're looking to start a daughter a granddaughters collection of jewelry that's a great way to do that and then you also again if you're starting someone's jewelry collection giving them also the gift of a lifetime guarantee on the piece that's right that's a really big deal what do you think the probably number one most lost piece of jewelry is I'm just saying I've done it I lost a diamond stud earring friends that is not fun no well so that's why at 35 dollars and forty-five dollars 35 if you're getting the one care at forty five at the two carat you can have a lifetime guarantee you have the world's finest simulated diamond and I already need to give you an update on the one carat size in the rounds we have white gold only in the one carat total weight round and fewer than a hundred remain $35 these are your gifts for the holidays yeah I don't know if you're gonna get this price again it's a sale price so unless we're having a sale event you don't get that kind of price tag all the time and so here's your options I want to slide this over if I may this is the one carat rounds only in white gold here are the one carat rounds in white gold yellow gold and rose gold I forgot to say that just don't on me there's rose gold in here too and then you have the two carat total weight in the princess cut the white gold yellow gold and the rose gold get these at these sale prices take advantage of that they are the most affordable stud earrings in diamonique and gold that we offer we also have the cutest little petite hoops and these are", "OJQG0Fv8PYA": "welcome to certified jewelry just inform our

brilliant of any diamond and then they turn it into a square so it's still just as brilliant and you can see that and it's kind of more of a modern cut a lot of the Brides today or picking the princess cuts for their engagement rings yeah by the way white gold is most limited in all of the choices all the choices here so you can get we we we didn't want to show you absolutely every single one but you get the idea the the white gold is available in the round and the princess got yellow gold available in the round of the princess cut and varying sizes so it breaks up all excuse me into

way but therefore on QVC to sale price look at the QVC price of this $19.99 Payton the QVC price on the big guy is $19.99 two grand two grand so as you go up yes it's more expensive but dare I say the

were extremely popular when they when we they did when we debuted them because of the exceptional value that you're getting here this is an 8 millimeter size ball too by the way which if you've ever shopped for pearls and we talked millimeter sized is anything but wimpy so these are not for the little babies that you put when they first get their ears pierced in there oh no this is all for you it's 25% off so it is at a clearance price it's $12 savings look at it though when I say less than 50 I mean really less than a 50 it's 32 dollars and 96 cents for genuine gold jewelry not costume jewelry and it's not gold-plated it is gold through and through don't you just love it look at how it kicks off the shine look at the texture on that really really just pretty this is your opportunity to get a pair home for you and then think of all the women that you have to celebrate with Mother's Day with Easter gifts with birthday gifts for spring and summer this is your chance to stock up maybe bridesmaids gifts to give them genuine gold for being in your wedding I think is fantastic they're gorgeous and you know what's really cool about this when you think about the diamond cutting I'm gonna take one right here and Adam I my little box and I'll show it to you close-up it's one thing about you diamond cutting is to start with you're gonna have to have a thicker amount of gold because you have to hammer it and if it was too thin of a sheet of gold and you'd press on that to give it the diamond cutting and this textured effect you'd you'd cut right through it so you're already starting off with a thicker piece of gold then normally you would if it was just a regular ball earring so it can't be tissue thin so here's a stud that's not boring it's not playing it safe oh and by the way it is post in clutch but here's another thing a lot of you might expect at this price point of $32 to have a plastic back oh no that is genuine gold as well so this is gold through and through again just to do the backing and gold would be is expensive but you're getting it for such a great deal again this is costume jewelry prices for genuine gold something that how great would this be for a young woman in your life your young granddaughter or teenage daughter to start introducing her to the world and your luck may be of gold jewelry and what it means and how it just totally elevates you when you slip something real on real diamonds real gemstones real gold there's just an allure about it there's just a sophistication about it it just can change your attitude that you're putting something special on but this is special for everyday this is t-shirt and jeans this is a little summer dress this is sweats this is if you love to work out and still have some earrings and a lot of women do this is what you wear your Zumba class this is what you wear can still wear to yoga or pilates right perfect Zumba there you go mama yeah and look at again they're not getting lost it's a sweet size at eight millimeter they're not heavy they're lightweight again that's the savings of twelve dollars your backing is even in the 14 karat gold if you wanted to talk size if 8 millimeter doesn't mean much to you a quarter of an inch how does that work so very professional how about for graduation you give this as a gift and you say wear this on your job interviews because it's professional it's commanding it's the real deal it's take me serious I love it 200 now spoken for great clearance price but once it's gone that's it can't come back can't come back at that price

the light it's like Sun setting on the water of a pond or the lake or the ocean in the morning you know how it gets that glisten effect that's exactly what this necklace reminds me of so so pretty so

the size of a one carat solitaire really so if you had so you have the look here of two carats of diamonds they're not half carat size okay but look at the way these are set look at the large center stone very very large you can see the great quality look at the rainbow you see the rainbow colors that shows you how finely it's cut and that it's surrounded by a little bit smaller but all still full cut the most brain of any diamond and then we put four prongs on the outside is if it's holding in that one large stone okay that's just your half carat size comes in yellow gold or white gold

time coming a long time coming this is", "V-KNRU9HCCg": "man oh man oh man all right a diamond is forever and these earrings will be forever when you talk about like diamond education here how do we how do we get how do they how do they get to the surface Michelle how do they get to the surface so that could they can I found I think that's a really good conversation to have when you're looking at something is soft and sweet as pink because it act like comes out of chaos I mean there's a moral to that story right out of chaos often times them something beautiful and they come from the volcanic activity so they come from hundreds of miles deep within the earth and they grow over billions of years you know a diamond is just carbon that was put under intense pressure and it turns into this beautiful creation you know this again is known for that thought that weakness in color but it does come up through these kimberlite pike in in volcanic activity and comes very rapidly surface it form very rarely do you find it pink very rarely do you find it natural yellow you can't take a white diamond and just make it pink yes you can't take a white diamond and make it yellow it has to have an internal characteristic to become that so it they're really miracles of nature billions of years old which to me is really humbling Rick if you think about it like when you go to the museum and you're looking at the dinosaur bones or some of the things that are behind glass oh my gosh they're billions of years old you hold a diamond close to your heart will see your heart line on your ring finger that goes directly to that heart and it's billions of years old I mean the romanticism surrounding diamonds they you really can't overlook that I know you and I joke around about how we're not really selling diamonds we're talking romance and that is so true with a diamond ring yeah but you they respect the age I wish I wish that that that respects was had with some of the younger hosts with me right Erica you know what I mean like they they had respect and he gave exactly they don't say he's you know that he's these billions of years old and we would need to respect him more they think it's a whole different story not a minute these are also and I think really really beautifully set these piece pink diamonds in it rose gold which allows the subtlety of that and you don't we don't ever over promise in that if you're seeing natural if someone says natural pink diamonds and they're bubblegum pink they're probably not natural pink diamonds are lying there's something wrong there's something wrong so but what we do is you take that that's a really soft pink and set it in that rose gold and it just it's like wearing a you know blue shirt to bring out your blue eyes it just kind of enhances it a little bit and very subtly right right I mean it's really is a blush it's like a very soft thing different from a color gemstone in that you get again dispersion of light in addition to the color so you do it the soft pink but you will find the rainbow effect that you've come to know and love with white diamonds there too you'll see the rainbow color but the dominating color body color is this beautiful soft I love the stud earrings so I think it's so classy it's so right you'll be able to live in these you can wear them anywhere all the time and they're made really well the post is nice and long it's better butterfly clutch back the halo design is another classic this became very popular during the Art Deco period of history and it still continues to be really really strong with the halo surrounding that and it just feels like a mound like fireball diamond gate 3 6 5 0 9 0 18 months financing on this one by the way so make the minimum payments pay it off at the end of 18 months so a year from now you have another six months to pay it off and if you do pay it up which you will then no interest is charged to your account whatsoever that's a good story diamonds your best friend you know I heard a friend of mine recently said because of what's going on you mentioned this earlier Michele that they were going to go on this trip to Japan and their words like

day long on QVC main channel so I hope you'll join Rick at midnight and just be tuning in all day or just go to QVC comm and check it out Erin Mosley is with me and she is also a jewelry expert has been all around the world helping women and men's shoes beautiful jewelry whether it's with full of diamonds whether it's gold or that's platinum whether it's just some beautiful silver piece but you're now representing our worlds famous and most beautiful simulated diamond the diamond eight we love this thank you I love it too I'm a lucky gal this is exciting this is super exciting when I saw these I love the sizes totally unexpected haven't seen anything like this petite especially in the smallest size but in this these are set in gold these have lifetime let manufacturer's warranty on every diamonique stone even though you're getting set of three so taking about twenty dollars a pair so four easy payments of $14.99 they're brand-new today they come to you in yellow gold white gold a rose gold they come beautifully boxed and presented and three sizes 1/5 of a carat so 10 points a tenth of a carat in each year right how super sweet I'll measure that in a second we have a half a carat so quarter carat in each year and then we have the full carat which is half a carat in each year mm-hmm do we see a half a carat a lot Oakville carat rather a lot we don't see a ton of half carat in total weight and we certainly don't see the fifth of a carat we certainly don't see that that's the first time I think I've ever seen that and I know I think this is sort of that's one of the reasons why it's unusual to have but it's really special and probably what's been missing in your jewelry box because we had a lot of requests from a lot of you who say I love my diamonique I love the believability to it so I want those carat weights that look like these are diamonds I would have in my collection and the way Nancy's wearing them is fantastic if you have multiple piercings to be able to add that little bit there be the baby up there that's the baby one that's that part of the fifth of a carat that's a part of the half a carat okay I want to show you that thank you for that that looks great I love that accent more of a statement earring now on the same in same breath I have on the smallest one and you know me I am a diamond eek stud gal I love big stud earrings I put these on because these are the ones that I would reach for when I was running errands when I put my ball cap on in a more casual day you need to have those quieter pieces that you can wear in those casual moments then at the same time think about the appropriateness that across the generations like if you would love to gift diamonique to your granddaughter your niece or your daughter who's always said oh I love your jewelry of such beautiful jewelry a great way to get her started and it comes in this really pretty box sweet box buy I would you know I was just thinking about this is from when my daughter gets her ears pierced what she's not going to until she turns a teenager this is the what I would give her you're in gold first of all and there that's the other point to which every talk like gold through and through really important for a lot of you in your ears and three color choices so you can get the white set like I have here there's the yellow and the Rose we don't have any other sets of diamonique stud earrings Nancy in the entire assortment in 14-karat gold that's it right here let me give you some sizes so that you can see so this comes about 1/16 of an inch just a little bit more than that in that for the fifth of a carat the half a carat comes in around an eighth of an inch and then your full carat comes in about 3/16 of an inch there J three five seven four seven six these are new and it's exciting to have this on the klondike gold or sale because they're in gold mm-hmm and they have a post and butterfly back I'm very sweet you don't need a big one at them in an earring like this either no I think it's a nice substantial it's a nice feel on the ear and it allows you to have that luxury of gold but pairing it with the comfort knowing that you're wearing diamond eek not diamonds so you don't have the weight on your shoulders of oh gosh I better be careful where I wear my diamond earrings what if I ever lost one where the diamond eek through every facet of your life that's why we love to share it with you because it should be a part of your everyday life don't you know sure save the diamonds for the special occasions I want you to wear

here to review first off we're going to review the diamond stud earrings which are a round cut and roughly a third of a carat set in 14 karat gold now nothing says Happy Mother's Day like diamond earrings we've searched high load to get you the most comprehensive price comparison online for a pair of one-third carat diamond stud earrings set in 14 karat white gold out of the 10 sites that we reviewed world Jules calm came in at the best price at 250 919 you heard me 259 dollars 19 cents it also has the best quality diamonds as you can see you're getting an SI 2 clarity diamonds which is at least one great better than all the other offerings we found next next was a tie with blue nile and ice calm both were very reputable online dealers however even though they both came in at three hundred fifty dollars blue now takes second place because their diamonds are of an eye color and a I 1 clarity which are one grade better than I saw columns offerings last but not least we've got Sam's Club which offers a unique offering because their earrings has a framed design as you can see the diamond is in kind of a frame if you will along with more carrots their set comes in at a whopping point three eight carats they are slightly more at four hundred thirty dollars 90 cents after an estimated eight percent sales tax however the choice is yours here make your mom proud with a new set of diamond stud earrings", "d_4mmQH1uYg": "it's expected about these I love these gemstone choices the design execution is just absolutely exquisite so let's talk about this do you love morganite do you love blue zircon or tanzanite because those are gonna be your three choices and we're going to go through the prices are just a little bit different because of kind of the rarity and things of the stone so we'll talk about that but their cushion cut gemstone and diamond stud earring all set in 14 karat gold now if you are picking up on the tanzanite 220 $9.83 on our easy payment as well so six easy payments that's a 456 dollar savings the morganite and the blue zircon are they're gonna be the hundred and thirty-three dollars so the the tanzanite a little bit elevated but gosh look at that color in the cushion cut so let's take a closer look to at each color because this is gonna be the blue zircon that was like turks and caicos oh yes right there's nothing like an energy and this it's like an electric it's like that color is plugged in and then framed in that gorgeous diamond halo for me diamonds and blue stones are just perfect really it's like bread and butter it's like tea and crumpets knew you were gonna say perfectly together today I do because it's that claret you've got the clarity of the white diamonds and the blues and the white it's a perfect accompaniment but then what's interesting is with the morganite it gives it a whole different feel because you've got this rose gold then you've got the morganite and you've got the diamonds and it's just this soft pallet of shades which is o delightful it is the perfect combination and complement to morganite because it's almost like the metal disappears and all you see is that gorgeous kind of peachy blush stone why we love morganite is it's so that it I can't tell you I used to have clients come in and they would want to do gorgeous morganite earrings and I had nothing for them that's that's part of the reason I love the jewelry and the opportunity that we have here at QVC and the partnership to bring pieces like this in because it was really hard and it's classic design illnesses like a little button earring here's something to bear in mind as well we work very closely with the GI a which is the Gemological Institute of America and they are kind of like a body that makes sure what a stone is is what exactly what it says it is so we have a very close relationship with them so you've got the confidence that when you buy something you're getting the real deal and that is important when you're investing your good money into a piece of jewelry it's important you're getting something that well I mean Tanana is my favorite gemstone hands down meet you yeah why I have to you do tanzanite and another one I'm not gonna talk about it cuz we don't have any of it Oh tanzanite it's in my top I can't I don't have an exact favorite because it would be like picking a favorite child tanzanite is very special stone okay so blue zircon morganite tanzanite 133 dollars on easy payments starting in your morganite near blue zircon your tanzanite is gonna be 220 $9.83 it's about two and a half carats of morganite 2.6 carats of tanzanite but 4 carats the blues are so here is that pendant and this is the perfect partner to me the piece we were just looking at so now are you going to go", "f9JTxGhN2I8": "okay he's asking for Bon Jovi tickets this year did you get him I don't know it's not Christmas yeah well I thought you could ask March yeah no okay so you know these are our beautiful 14 karat yellow goes all celebrate to it let's do it absolutely okay now that's a little weird I'm embarrassed to talk about so they've got a little bit of that diamond cutting on them actually not a little bit an awful lot and these are only forty-one dollars and 82 cents they are eight millimeter in size j33 one two seven four nice size are gonna sit up nice and high they're not going to get lost in big hair you have big hair over there missing 12 but that quarter inch there remember the picture I took of him in the yeah the Hall of Fame yeah when I was there and I said yeah that's what a real friend does and that's what I'm saying what I'm saying that's awesome okay you want to talk about the diamond cutting on those you know what I love that that's very difficult to do but I will say this that there's a lot of gold on them because they've done diamond cutting on it you've got to start with a thick wall of gold you can't do that with the little chintzy thin paper wofe T you know piece of gold so have a lot of faith that these are substantial because when I look at that price tag Nancy I go oh yeah you know you can't even get cheap costume jewelry for forty one dollars Nietzsche says let alone gold so these are appropriate for every event every age every everyone yes perfect they look beautiful on you thank you so neat and tailored and pretty now I I have a pair of the just high polished gold studs and I love those and if you want just a little bit dressier stud that you don't have in your jewelry wardrobe this is gonna really fit the bill look at how pretty that diamond cutting is it is pretty unique it's almost like a swirl there's a swirl pattern to it so it has this intricate texturing detail that you know you don't see coming and going these are easy they're affordable they're gold don't let the price fool you this is not bull plating gold filled this is 14-karat gold an eight millimeter that's a nice sign it is quarter inch and just so you know the post sits right in the middle of that gold studs so they'll fit really well and they're very well balanced and of course it's a butterfly back that you're getting there as well forty-one dollars and 82 cents at a feature price at some point that feature price will be gone but I did notice there was no easy pay so she can get easy pay though well yeah definitely use that cue card grab the easy pay you're in like flint about $41 82 cents that's a great price you don't like the in like Flynn already 200 now gone on j33 one to sell or I know so nice that I know we're about ready to go to this San Marco but let me show this real quickly we'll just be all right with you if I came out for the hearing yeah I'll just show you that where that post is real quickly I love that it's in the middle yeah of the Year at the top yeah your ears have seen better you hear you see they're better days like I say these girls mm-hmm so I know I'm just saying I didn't we're really happy earrings on the 80s you do wear earrings maybe no heavy earrings oh wow no I wear ear wear earrings okay they're not super Sally it's time for a top four", "wWUnQwcTWj8": "is in the history of QVC jewelry in the 33 years we've been here over 20 years ago we debuted our affinity diamond line and today for the first time ever we're debuting our firelight lab-grown diamond jewelry collection they're set in 14 karat gold all done in white gold so it's appropriate that it's in this gold show they're on six easy payments free shipping and handling and nine-month financing now I said it at midnight I said you know what by the time I come back in the afternoon at 3 o'clock in the afternoon with our guest Michelle Lau all of the choices may not be here because we didn't bring that many in in this launch and I was correct we're out of one of the choices already it's not what we call our wait list and so comes in within 45 days we can bring it to you if not it's sold out but half our quantity for the entire day has now been spoken for michelle is I want to get this right is a diamond graduate from the GI a the Gemological Institute of America you know diamond jewelry like nobody else is amazing having you here from the GI as well I can't wait to see her later Oh welcome in to this presentation okay it they are gorgeous they are beautiful I'm gonna tell you what the choices are to dress up dress down to our everyday wear to a wedding or wear to work or where cuz you want to treat yourself these are lab grown diamonds there is the most affordable choice and the most affordable choice is going to be the half carat and the half carat is saving you 230 dollars lab-grown diamonds the lab-grown diamonds all right we started the day with 900 so there's 300 oh man my producers telling me real-time there are 300 now remaining and then we step up to what's called the one carat that's a half carat in each year so it's one care total way they are near colorless we're gonna get into the specs in a second but they're absolutely stunningly beautiful it's a combination of beauty the size and then budget as well and finally not for the faint of heart but here we go and when although you may get some sticker shock right here for 60-degree minutes of 583 17 that's one carat in each ear these are lab grown diamonds that's right indeed diamonds they indeed they are and j-3 641 through if you were to compare these two naturally mine diamonds that $34.99 wouldn't even come close in fact here we go this is lab-grown diamond to lab-grown done we did a comparable retail value shop on these these normally half carat will be five hundred and seventy $9.99 there's the two hundred and thirty dollar savings 13:23 the retail value on the one carat we now save three hundred and sixty four you see the one and a half they're sold out so we're jumping right to the next one hundred not one thousand but one hundred people that can get the two carat total weight Mary how are my supermodel Mary happens to be wearing one of them in one of her ears normally that's fifty five hundred dollars lab-grown to lab-grown this is now six easy payments of five eighty three seventeen to set all that up stunningly beautiful here's where we need to start for those of you who know what's going on here with this lab-grown story it's all the buzz in the entire jewelry industry really is and there's been a lot of people that have been waiting and wondering when will QVC have it they've been asking facebooking us and it's here now but for those of you who aren't all that familiar but you're curious you're really curious like my friend barb my friend Kara who worked they were like huh I'm thinking about picking these up let us clarify right now what is a lab-grown diamond it's a diamond grown in a laboratory plain and simply you just have another choice these days well let's get a little more specific let's get a little more specific about but the structure of it but you know the characteristics of it what can we say it's a diamond in fact we have prepared a little something for you as we go right on down the list with fire light being in the first row and mined diamonds from the dirt in the other in the other road is it a diamond check same physical chemical and optical properties check same composition crystal structure hardness all of those things scratch-resistant diamond diamond do you see fire light and mine diamonds they're all identical there's only one difference once going on a lab one's grown in the earth the bottom there's two red X's is it simulated it is absolutely not simulated so the analogy I used last night at midnight was you know if you get a dozen roses I get my wife Amy a dozen roses is she gonna say oh these are the most beautiful green house roses I've ever received no she's going to say these are the most beautiful roses roses grown in a greenhouse roses grown quote unquote naturally in the woods somewhere right yeah that's the story here that's the analogy and what we have is absolute stunning beauty so that when you see when you wear you are wearing a diamond that was grown in a lab that's the only difference and that's why people are now drawn to it because they're they love it they love the possibility but frankly as you take you know what let's take a look at Mary again because Mary when you see Mary in a second you're gonna see Mary with could you show this smaller one in one ear Mary if you would right okay you love love love and by the way that's going very quickly but maybe when you two years ago five years ago anniversary we wanted to treat yourself that's what you could afford and you looked at the price of a natural mine diamond in what would be one carat in each ear near colorless and you looked at that price and you said maybe I should buy a car instead right you couldn't afford it this is for the woman who wants to say you know what finally I can get it I can do it I need a 2 carat I can get it to carat point I can do it in lab and you know there's so many Millennials now getting married getting engaged and they're saying look I look for cut clarity carat weight right I look for all seasons and there's one other choice don't want it natural or do I want it laughs and they're saying you know what I'm going lab all the way because what I can get now here's what we want to tell you as well what is that relationship because I know that you are GA GI a a diamond graduate the GI a what is this relationship with this story and the GI a well you know we have a really strong relationship with the dia and what we've done with the fire light diamond lab-grown diamond line is we've actually incorporated the GI A's expertise into our quality standards we even go as far as the the clarity and the colorless the diamond saw him get a little tongue-tied so let me show you what I'm talking about though this part that we usually use with our affinity diamonds right our natural diamonds and there's a place in my heart for both of these at the very top tier to the right is where you find the near colorless diamond I mean we're talking about top tier quality again these are near colorless now when you look at the clarity scale also developed by the GI a to talk about diamonds where are we by the way in the color scale well we are colorless but when you talk about in near colorless diamond you know usually for most of us it becomes out of our budget to afford something like right this is within our scope and very slightly included now this is a major overhaul from what you're traditionally seeing in television shopping this is a really big deal to be able to get I clean diamonds lab-grown diamonds and to have it scale out that high is really something CQ BC uses the range that the GI a established for lab-grown diamonds we didn't just make this up or decide that we were just gonna call it that we went with the Gemological Institute of America who is a world leader and we set that bar very very high when we're doing it for the first time ever and those of you who have been waiting and waiting I think when is QVC gonna do this I trust QVC yeah I trust a 30-day return policy I trust the fact that when I get these home I can try them on wear them love them these are lab grown what lab-grown diamond diamonds these are not simulated diamonds which is why we're so excited so lab-grown diamonds versus lab-grown diamonds in the marketplace because they're out there here's where we really came into play look at the graphic that shows the retail value story of and this is like apples to apples this is clarity cut carat weight right to clarity cut carat weight when it comes to lab grown elsewhere normally that 2 carat carat and each year would be five thousand five hundred and thirty-five dollars and you know what people are paying for it every day because they can finally do it cuz that's so much less well yeah it's like natural Mountain the natural mine diamonds but we have it for literally two thousand dollars less but only for the next how many people with 120 remaining and that's it and we're already sold out of the one and a half care when you go to the one carrot which is the sweet spot for a lot of people to step up that would be not 1300 but that would be 60 see payments of 159 however the most affordable I'm gonna put my toe in the water I'm gonna try these out go for it the half carrot they're beautiful the cut is there they are full cut stones they are set in white gold that's a white gold back in what white gold butterfly clutch all white gold all full cut all near colorless all very very slightly included we started the day and a half carat with close to 900 300 now remaining and then they're going on sold-out and we're gonna have another sellout in our first ever today's special value from our lab created story I love that roses story if it's green house roses or if it's in a while it's still a rose it's still a rose by any other name would smell as sweet here's my big question to you and a lot of people asked this last night if I get these I know that the same physical chemical optical characteristics as a mined diamond exactly the same what if I take it to a jeweler when I get it home I know I've got 30 days to to play with this 30 days to wear it out so that jewelers gonna grab his loupe he's gonna grab his microscope he's gonna look inside into the interior that diamond you know and he's gonna say he's gonna say that's a beautiful diamond it's lab-grown but it looks absolutely stunning right now the only way that you're ever gonna know that it's lab-grown is that it is in laser inscribed on the girdle of the gemstone and we do that for a full disclosure that's what QVC is all about which is awesome and nobody will be able to see it unless again they're a jeweler looking under a microscope but it's there for peace of mind and you know what the feeling you get when you get and you wear beautiful jewelry I mean how close can we get on these guys they look stunningly beautiful and this is closer than you're ever gonna get with most diamond jewelry that you wear right and you're gonna see them and you're gonna see are there inclusions with the naked eye and you take a look at at a bag or a mediocre colored diamond and put it next to a near colorless stone it's exponentially different yes this is the sparkle the refraction the beauty the bending of light that you love and are you know so happy about that you are proud to wear and are proud to wear for years and years and years to come so the romance factor here you know getting something for yourself or if you're getting these as a gift for somebody that you love you know they're gonna fit you know they're gonna be stunningly beautiful and when you give them you will be giving them a lab-grown diamond indeed you will 364 2 1 3 so for those people who are shopping one of the choices has already sold out the care and a half I told you that that was gonna happen hey this is probably gonna be the next one to go 300 remaining in the half carat and then you go up to the full carat and then you jump up to the to care difference in price totally get that but the difference in savings from retail value as well bigger bolder but use your cute card you can put these on nine-month financing if you want to and the writer as well bigger bolder and brighter because you've been telling us you've been wanting I put bigger bolder brighter and budget I put B because it's now within your budget perfect and you know what the nine-month financing and your cue card might help with that meaning make the minimum payments no extra interest charge to your account the buzz is here and we have them and we wanted to make sure that when we do firelight which is our brand within this world that we did it right where did they come from how who did we partner with in making this happen okay so what happens very important or this is happening almost every day I was getting emails our buying team is getting emails you as our customer wanted bigger solitaires and this is an issue I mean it's difficult and very expensive in mind from the dirt diamonds so the market two years ago three years ago you couldn't have gotten this size in lab-grown it's changed a lot technologically so yes they are bigger bolder brighter so what did we do we went to one of the top diamond suppliers for affinity we made this exclusive collection for you to debut here today let's just get that again we went to the supplier the diamond world it gives us affinity natural mined diamonds yeah so this is literally same world I mean these guys it's Dimond these guys know what they're doing they know diamonds and they are this is their integrity their reputation if they're gonna get into the lab grown world right they want to make sure right it's gonna be right yes and that's what we did I'm so I'm so proud and I think when you get these and you wear these you will love it as well you know you want to do some comparing of lab-grown in our fire light lab-grown diamond collection with this two carat and affinity on QVC calm right now no we don't even carry them we don't carry these in natural mined diamonds right I mean on that size right the two carat no the two carat no we don't because they're beautiful yeah there would be well check out apples to apples and why you are getting these and when people are wearing them take a look at Merrigan beautiful and maybe will give you the little head turn to give you a sense of which one am I getting there's the one care I mean the half carat and there's the two carat they all look great she's got one in one year and one in the other I love that what about over time what about lab-grown diamonds over time they will not change they will not you know you know how with and by the way cubic zirconia is a diamond simulant it is not a diamond dominique is not a diamond product it's very pretty product but it's not a diamond so you know how sometimes crystal or paste or cz or whatever it is will get cloudy or look dingy over time this will never turn this is a diamond these are lab-grown diamonds they are indeed the buzz is there in the industry and we wanted to give you color cut clarity and we wanted to give you in this case a lab-grown diamond and do it within your budget and they're absolutely gorgeous and we're so proud to be kicking these", "TwBMch-5iNg": "had to take them I know that there there's isn't the only two

they were on all day and they were gone they were sold out completely we wanted to go out into retail and say nobody's gonna do what we're gonna do here nobody can come close and what is going to be these diamond cluster stud earrings they're done in 14 karat gold they're done in 14 karat white 14 karat yellow gold so your choices are very simple do you want the half carat total weight or do you want the full carat total way right and do you want them in white or yellow and do you want them in the round or do you want them in the cushion cut the round or in the cushion cut there you see the difference in the cushion and I'll show you the difference in the round as well all these are different my matter of white gold or yellow gold that's the only choice you have to make here and here come the round choice if you have them already we would love love love to hear from you and 1/8 over three nine five one six zero one but here comes the comparable retail value it's on your screen these are we got to show that a lot if we could $1,700 the one carat total weight these are and these were come what's called comp shopped right so they need to be exactly the same for us to be able to use exactly the same your exams color clarity the whole story every total every one big box what would go all around in cop shop and then put them together and get the average and get the average these are $1,700 a range they're now back for six easy payments of 161 sixty-six do you have these earrings are you wearing them right now what do you have a three nine five one six zero one truly we'd love to hear from you what would the story is on the retail value right cop shop retail value the big guys right literally are the or the price of the retail value of the half karat correct you could get for the price of the half karat you could afford to get now a full care full carat look earrings okay now that I set this story up we'd love to hear from you again there's the difference let's talk about what our buyers wanted to bring to our viewers well we wanted to something that was truly special we wanted to take the most powerful the most popular category in earrings which is that stud but we didn't want to do a basic stud we wanted to do something that was really unique that was really special here we would actually allow you to wear the earring from day to evening and Deanna is actually wearing the two different sizes so we're gonna turn sideways a little bit for me my love there you go stop carrot but that half carat is the look of four carats right - until - and - when she turns the other way that is the one carat and that is the center cluster is the look of 2.6 for total look of 9 carats that is why these were so incredibly popular love love love not only are they gorgeous not only are they wearable not only are they practical not only can you wear them from a job interview to a dinner party to a wedding the we went to the biggest diamond manufacturer in the world and had these put together for us by an incredible designer now we talked about me being in New York if I walk down the street to 57th Street there are three of the biggest jewelry manufacturers heist and in the world he's worked for two of them so that not only are we bringing you amazing quality amazing clarity and color but we're also bringing you that design aspect okay so now you know the retail value the retail value of the Kabul retail value you could literally get there it's $900 for the small ones you can get the large ones now for 969 or six easy payments of 161 never have we been able to show Beauty and-and-and differentiation like this these were a major hit but let us talk now about the quality of the stones because again you're stepping up to these earrings and these are going to be heirloom earrings a lifetime earrings what's the color what's the clarity you're still going I - you're still going near colorless stones you're still going the the sparkle and the beauty and the full cut that you want or diamonds to be right that you want your diamonds to be for six easy payments they're just back in stock they sold out completely again call us if you have them what do you have a 395 160 or one cuz we've brought them in on that day and they said goodbye you love did you wear them for special occasion do you wear them every day let's come back to the hole to to the halo design especially when it come you know what go big or go home let's go for these big guys right here look at this look at these these are done in the white gold that's it for six easy payments of 161 you can't go wrong so that's the one carat but the center cluster is the look of 2.6 for a total look with the halo of nine carats the price of a 9 carat pair of studs is astronomical and what we've done we've been able to do that Center cluster slightly elevated and done a gorgeous halo now harue who designed this yearing for us was the originator of that halo effect many many years ago the originator of the author of the halo people just were not doing it so we went to the best and when we I was able to spend almost two hours speaking with harue and I asked him about that Center cluster and not only are they cut and paired together so that it creates a seamless look so that's why it looks like one single stone he also put them so closely together using a technique called compositing which puts them so closely together that dirt grime hairspray the makeup that's left on your hands can't get into the groups so you always see the clearest brightest diamond on your hand that blew my mind because from a design perspective when you do when you get dressed you put on your makeup and what's the last thing you do you put on your earrings when you put on your hairspray that coats the the diamond we want to make sure that these shine and sparkle so let me give you the update here on what are going to be the half carat if you're looking for the half carat my producer is letting me know there's half carat full carat round cushion white gold yellow gold here's what you're reacting to like now and this is the the the $900 retail value that you're seeing us-korean you're reacting to the half karat and the white gold so if you'd like them they are most limited half karat white gold are the most affordable they're talking about every day and here they are cushion and round white gold I want to make sure I've got them white gold and white gold you will love love love them when you get them home I think the cushion cut is fantastic is right on trend but the round will never ever be out of style they're all gonna be matching stones each color very clear beautiful beautiful bright near colorless stones and again four six easy payments of $80 the retail value is about $900 or over $900 on what is going to be just the half carat alone but $1,700 when it comes to the full carat we brought this and we're proud of these earrings and we think that you're not going to be disappointed well and when we talk about because we are making investments in your diamond jewelry but when we talk about cost per wear these are that earring that you can wear day to night now there is not an occasion where these are not appropriate this is a perfect way to upgrade your stud perhaps you perhaps you already have a stud take those studs out clean them up you know hand them down to your daughter your granddaughter and upgrade yet so that you have this new upgraded pecan I tell you that if you stay right there Deana I thought those were the were the one carat that's a half carat I know but look at that that they get like it's not a small here it's not a small earring I mean that for what is a $900 retail value $80 on any major credit card bring them home try them on the post is gold the backing is going to be 14 karat give white gold or yellow gold you can't go wrong the round in the half carat in the white gold something you don't want to miss out on right now they sold out in their debut and we have the Meccan we did the comp shop again the retail value 1720 dollars and I was so not surprised at that right because when you look quality of diamonds and you look but it's going to be the carat weight in these pieces and the fact that you're getting two of them it's not one ring this is - IRRI earrings you got a lot of jewelry here and the fact that because of that larger footprint perhaps you have an extended your hole this actually gives you great coverage whether you choose the round or the cushion I happen to love the cushion I'm not a cushion guy for whatever reason I find them so attractive self finish so polished liked around your around good go I don't know your call but for prefer my money if you're saying you know what I don't know about about nine sixty nine right now hey I have an incredible gift an anniversary gift saying you love love love love love or you want to elbow your hubby right now and say hey honey you know what you just did what you bought me my anniversary earrings he's gonna be happy cuz you're gonna be happy for eighty dollars and 82 cents they are there in this one the metal is really I'm telling you it's secondary I'll put up at the yellow next to the white which ones which Michelin's yellow gold which is about diamonds it's all about the diamonds baby all about the diamonds if you want them in the round in the half carat don't wait in yellow gold or white gold you're loving that white however that's most limited and it's most popular sold out the last time they were on the air two three five five zero three seven would you like to break this up over nine months do it go forward don't give us the money right now put it on the cute card enjoy enjoy and by the way if you're wondering what kind of interest is going on there if you make the payments within nine months nada no interest if paid in full within nine months that's pretty good we're

earrings do you have at home do you have a lot I know I have a lot too but the one pair that sees the most time in my ear are the ones that I can wear to absolutely every occasion and every event and everyday regular where they are the earrings that I think are the best money that I've ever spent because they're the ones that are always appropriate for any of said occasions and you're looking at them right now a diamond cluster stud earring is always appropriate always perfect always fabulous no matter whether you're going to the boardroom whether you're going to a wedding whether you're going to a graduation you're going shopping you just walk it around the house these are always perfect and appropriate that's why it's money well spent it's j58 zero five six what I love about this is QVC gave us some different choices first choose your metal so we have white gold and yellow gold and these are done in 14 karat gold very important this is a classic this is one that everyone wants to get and it's that diamond stud earring choose your color white gold or yellow gold once you do that let's talk about carat weight because you're gonna be able to choose that as well we have the half carat total weight and the half carat total weight right here is on six easy payments of one hundred and fourteen dollars and eighty three cents but painting it has the look of a few carats a carat meeting a carat and ensuring a total of two carats it'll look like one carat in each ear what does that sound like it sounds like a tune of about a quarter of an inch from side to side and a quarter of an inch up and down that's a big look guys let's move over here to the three-quarter carat choice that's on six easy payments of 160 $1.50 and that has the look of what in each year one and a half carats in each year are a total of three carats oh I love that sound that's a good sound lastly the one carat of diamonds total is on six easy payments of 216.50 cents but it looks like two carats in each year total of four carats I like that along with that so here's the thing you guys please don't be mislead if I tell you that these are one carat of diamonds don't think that they look like one carat in each year they look a lot bigger if you want a one carat look in your ear you need to come way back here and buy the half characters those who look like one carat if you're looking for the classic on one carat stud in my ear get the half carats because that's what these will look like for you I don't want you to go all the way up here to the one carat thinking I've always won a carat of diamonds in my ear buy these and they come home and you go these are ginormous that's not what I wanted which I'd love to meet you because I've never met a woman like that in my life that would say these are ginormous diamonds are they're too big for me I don't know that girl so I'd love to meet you but tell me more about the oh wait wait I just have to tell you these sold we sold out of the half inch and the three half carat and the three-quarter carat back in December we just now got more of the back end they all of them are on six easy payments we are going to also offer a special financing of nine months on this one and they are still at a low featured price - Chantelle which ones are you wearing as she knew I was gonna ask her then she's like you think you're wearing the quarter carat okay so the three-quarter carat or the half carat the small the medium or large you think the smallest one I think yours that's the look of a woman that's a look at one pair one carat from here Chantelle is wearing the smallest ones available that's what I was telling you if you want that one carat look don't buy the one carat by the half carat yes that's what it looks like how do we do that magic well and maybe we can do a close-up on Chantal because I really want you to see these number one how beautiful they are but when you look at them from a distance you have the look of one large stone when you get very close and you see them very very close what do you have okay you have one large diamond in the center and then you have a little bit smaller diamonds around that but you don't see that look at that and that's again very very close as Rick Domar would say if you get that close you better pay for dinner when you see that look at that you don't see individual diamonds you see the look of one large diamond and there's also four 14 karat gold prongs on the outside holding those stones in okay the half carat Chantal the ones you're wearing those are the most popular by far right now ladies I don't blame them I do not blame you they look when you saw Chantal did you say oh Jesus I'm wearing them too Peyton what size am I wearing I don't even know with you what do you think the big two carats in each year get there but look at how white one right they twinkle look at that I mean they're white they're bright they're brilliant they're exciting this is what I meant this is all you need you put these on leave them on never take them off because they're gonna be perfect for the wedding that you're going to they're going to be perfect for at the office

you testimonial line is open it's eight hundred three nine five one six zero one but you know that I'm a big fan of kitchen but you also know that my soul is with jewelry but we have an expert here with us this morning her name is Michelle Lau and I am so excited to work with her for the first time today because we've kind of been social friends for a little bit meaning on Instagram but I know I feel like we've already spent time together hello my friend good morning talk about diamonds today my gosh okay let me just tell you if I know you may have spent some time with Michelle if you have not she is a gem and jewelry expert she is a diamond graduate with the GI a you're also dca certified which means diamond Council of America okay thank you she's also a member of the ICA here's what I know about that ICA is not something that you have to be invited to be a member and sponsored there's only 700 people yeah it's a really small group but it's a really cool group we're small but we're mighty you know we're located all over the globe and there's miners there's lapidaries there's I mean sorcerer's there's like it's amazing this network of people really fun I'm honored to be included well we're honored to have you here so QVC thank you because these diamonds okay these are beautiful hoops yes we have the precious medal of gold but can you walk us through your we need to know more about these diamonds cuz these are genuine these are beautiful cut let's talk about the clarity and everything about them all right well this is our affinity quality we love this quality we're talking about H near colorless so in a diamond if you get a degrade it's getting the best you can get you're getting the top grade right so it's D EF which is colorless and then GHI which is near colorless most people can't tell the difference when they look at the two I spent the better part of the month of January last year grading diamonds looking at different colors and diamonds and I'll tell you what it's really difficult to tell the difference but once you get past that catalyst near colorless it goes all the way to Z or Zed so it starts at D and goes to Z H is awesome let's just put it that way all right it's the thing that we dream of owning you know and it's fantastic we also guarantee a minimum of i2 clarity so it's I - or better H near colorless or better in affinity these are powerful beautiful match you mentioned GI a certified it's not just a spot check every now and again it's every single diamond before they're set in metal because sometimes metal can kind of skew how a diamond actually looks sure so we've got a really strong affiliation with the GI a every diamond that comes through our doors here at QVC has been scrutinized by them and when you take a look at them I've got on which size I have on the third largest I've owned the 202 Karen mmm-hmm because it just felt like that was appropriate but what you think why not can play with diamonds you should I want you to remember that we have six easy payments here and I want you to see that these tilts so it's a 45 degree angle there's actually something very special about how these were designed and who designed them yes the design is amazing in fact people have been raving about it other designers have been coming to me and between shows and saying you only have to help people to understand this because it's so crazy I mean you think about an inside-out who we love them right you've got diamonds in the front diamonds on the inside kind of like this up against one another but what if you could tip at a 45-degree angle the diamonds in the back well you would see them from more angles and every diamond would have more light so the light actually comes in from three different ways in this design and so the diamonds look bigger they look brighter and whiter because of the light let's face it we don't want to look at the diamonds really what we want to see is the colors we want us to the colors the sparkle the brilliance and you see more of it with this design I just turned these so that you could see these are all four sizes on my finger so the first one right here you see that we've got it available for you in that half carats a good idea to do and then we have the one carat the two carat and then this right here is the way you want to go now I'm gonna slide this over my finger just to show you these have an inside-out design so it's easiest to show you on the largest because look at all oh my gosh all five carats so you see how they're slightly tilted there but then when you have it in your ear there's a little something for everybody that's looking and then there's a little something for you because those in the back actually tilt outward yeah they you wear them so they flare outward they fan out word away from your face which just lights up your face and illuminates it the diamonds also get bigger as you go up in size so yeah that's that's what stopped me in my tracks when I was looking at these before the show oh what's got that backwards this is from top to bottom in the largest size it's about an inch from top to bottom but I also wanted to show you while you were here this is how they open and close super easy to get on and off and you never see a post all you see is beautiful diamond dollz and sparkle you know sometimes the things you don't see are really important in jewelry design like the fittings and the findings in her ooh who's the designer here he really takes extra special attention to detail like if you look at the hinge at the bottom for example you don't see a hinge at all it feels really smooth to the touch on the outside but when you open it up again it allows you to walk into those hoops so to really wear them comfortably so yes there is a left and a right to the earring and you wear them so that the diamonds on the backside fan out so you get more sparkle you get more shine and more beauty now the gentleman that did design this is one of the best in jewelry designers around the around the world you know when you go to New York Mary and there's a block in New York City were three big Titans of jewelry come to you yes right yes these designs for two out of three of them and in fact his earring designs are legendary there's a design in one of those stores that's been on the market and a best seller for them for 27 years Mike he knows what he's doing the silky finish on the inside the way the diamonds are bead set and secure bead set and pave by the way are basically the same setting although with bead set you've got larger prongs and larger stones usually in in the bead setting so you're getting just such a big look from a gentleman who really knows his stuff no we won't one step further Mary we said okay if we're gonna be dealing with this designer we better manufacture it right right so we went to one of the biggest diamond to manufacturers and jewelry manufacturers in the world to get this done and the reason we did that as they could stay at our quality standards right but get us a better overall you know price because how many stores do you know that Woodstock hoops like this oh you know not for this price I'll tell you the fact that when we have affinity here at QVC and I know so many of you love affinity diamonds and this is what we can guarantee you is this level of quality not only with the Diamonds themselves but with the stones I also have to say I have on that to carat size in my ear and right on TV I want to take that one out and I want to put in the size that you just saw in Blair this is the half carat so tuck it into your ear obviously rights are in the bestseller so far I know look at that so it just changes up the look doesn't it it just has it that little bit of every day but that little bit of sparkle isn't it funny to to even talk about diamonds it's like an everyday sort of life for me I know but now just to remind you the half carat is available in 14 karat white gold or 14 karat yellow gold here's the breakdown again just to remind you that the half carat is on six easy payments of 74 and 83 since that's an incredible value for this amount of diamond this amount of precious metal then in the 1 carat size we have six easy payments of 140 150 then in the 2 carat size we have six easy payments of two 4983 and in that five carat size that is our most limited at this time it's less than six hundred and sixty seven dollars couple of things I want to remind you Mother's Day is May 12th wedding season is right around the corner this is a lovely way to commemorate of course an event but it's also such a great way to be able to commemorate your love and if you're giving these as a gift that's fantastic way to budget in but this is permission with this easy pay and with the special financing to pick them up for yourself you know I understand I don't ever want to ask anybody to shop outside of their budget but when you take a look at this and you take a look at your budget you take a look at the breakdown of the easy payment plans this is that day and this is that time to be able to work it in now we're approaching a thousand order just since its launch this is customization these are true diamonds and these are absolutely elegant it is the first affinity today's special value of 2019 and it is the first time that we're offering this design but because I am in love with gemstones um and we have Michelle right here with us I would also like to talk about the clarity of these stones do that absolutely so we determined that the the color is near colorless in h okay we also offer all of our affinity pieces in I to clarity or better so I to clarity is fantastic especially when you're looking at clusters of stones to have them so consistent in these pieces what you see is from stone to stone to stone all of them look like a symphony a song so again it all spells out from very very slightly included to slightly included - I - which stands for included okay you with your naked eye if you got right up on them someone's nibbling on your neck you know with a loop then maybe they would see something but yeah with a snivelling on your neck now what are the odds of that now I always say unless you're hanging out with you know jewelers or something with a loop in their pocket you're probably pretty safe but the in the short of it what you get here when you buy affinity and when you take a look at these beautiful earrings is you get bright brilliant beautiful diamonds in gorgeous craftsmanship and another question that we had Mary is people said are they real diamonds are they natural diamonds because that becomes a growing concern in the marketplace today they are and that's why that every single diamond checked aspect with the G ia is really important it should be important to you if it's not in your home more about it I'm sure in the news and times to come but we are very ethical that way our association with the Gemological Institute of America which is a nonprofit organization we stand with them and beside them to make sure that you get even more than what you expect when you open your package when you put on the different well I'm in the studio I'm putting on different sizes I know our models are know Michelle is there there really is no way to tell they feel so good in your ear which size that you have on choose your favorite I can tell you this value go ahead and search around go ahead and look and see if you can find one that's better and I would be shocked if you could these are exclusive to QVC you can't find them anywhere else the diamonds are tilted at a 45 degree angle what's the first thing we do when we look at a gemstone of course we tilt it we hold it out in front of us we tilt it we look at it and lightly it does the work its showcased for us beautifully that smile on Blair's face says it you know what it's 8 o'clock in the morning everybody at QVC has been awake for days and still smiling because the Diamonds give you that flash of light right where you need it on your face also let me tell you I have an update for you in the 5 carat that's the one that's closest to me the largest that we have in", "ldm7cZeb6Ew": "so i recently purchased a pair of solitaire studs um half a carat total weight from james allen and they finally came in so i

"ZlNmcJ9XCnU": "what's going on everyone its frame which code you find jewelry so a personal jeweler in this video we're doing the most quickest basic way to clean your gold jeweler your jewelry this is very easy to do at home in case your chains your pieces get dull and you need a quick freshen up now this is a three part series this one is the easiest to do and a lot of you guys can try it most you guys probably already do this yourselves the next one we'll take it up and uh not and then the following will be more on a professional level too so you guys can really see how these pieces get cleaned and looking restored like brand new you buy your chains you buy your jewelry it's sparkly it's shining that's how it should be everything needs to be cleaned up if you think about it your dog needs washed your car needs to be cleaned I hope you guys are cleaning yourselves on a regular basis you guys get the point you buy something and eventually you wear it a lot it needs to be clean so we have to address that show you guys how it's done or at least how I do it and how I recommend it so what that means it let's get started when you spend all this money on jewelry you want to wear it that's what you're spending it for if you're just buying gold to invest it then put it in your safe buy pants buy bars it's a better Buy but when we're talking chains when we're talking the Rings you've got to keep it clean because you'd be shocked and I will show you guys what how it this gold collects dirt over time and how it just kind of keeps it in depends on the link depends on the piece some are easier to clean than others but the two pieces we're gonna use our bulk bracelets a two and a half millimeter Franco I will show you guys a side by side of a brand new one verse one that's been worn every single day for four months and then also a three-and-a-half millimeter rope bracelets side by side of a brand new rope laces you guys can see because when you get it it's nice it's shiny it's great you put it on sometimes you don't really notice how dirty it's getting until you see a brand new one so you've definitely got to keep up and keep these pieces clean freshen up this jewelry we're gonna use a method that is very easy and straightforward takes you no time at all that's why I recommend it to you guys and you'll see it does a great job we're gonna need a bowl of water I put in the microwave for 30 seconds be careful that water is hot when you take it out and then you squeeze a couple drops of Dawn dish so if you just need a mild detergent it's not gonna affect diamonds gold anything like that and you let those chains anything you're cleaning just sit in there for a little bit this is more of it's not a chore it's a spa day for your jewelry it works hard to make you look good to make you feel good easily these chains make me from a four to a 4.3 so you've got to put in the time of work to keep them shining because they work for you at the end of the day now after you let it sit you take them out and careful that water is hot and you just scrub them now the thing is you don't want an old toothbrush that's like really stiff and hard you're gonna scratch that gold you won't scratch diamonds but you'll scratch that gold because gold is soft so you've got to make sure that sponge is soft as well as if you're using a sponge I like sponge or toothbrush the toothbrush is better because it kind of gets into those crevices and really doesn't just like if you're brushing your teeth so but make sure that bristle is pretty soft when you're scrubbing and just take your time and work it now you don't have to like put your back into this scrubbing process if you scrub it like 10 times harder it's not really gonna make a difference so just take your time with it and not try to rush it and put a lot of pressure into scrubbing it and just work with it and go up and down that chain try to get inside those links and get that dirt out because that dirt like how we found the gold inside rocks inside crevices that's where that dirts gonna go it's gonna go to where the crevices are and just trap and hide in there which is the bad thing so you gotta do your best the best you can with this method to work all that dirt out but after a nice scrub-a-dub-dub you put it back in the tub all that's left to do really is just rinse it off with water just to get the soap up and then towel dry this process you really don't even need when I get out of the shower I don't even dry my chains it's gold it's good to go that's why I spend money for gold just so I could have at that convenience this is really just for the video and of course like after you clean something you want to just dry it really nice it's like the the cherry on top of that you did a good job it's so you sleep better at night okay and that's pretty much it guys it's a very simple process of I wasn't filming this it would take me like two minutes so if you're going out to dinner you just need a freshen up your change or jewelry it takes such a little time and really we're doing this method for is that surface area the top part that the oils and lotions it really does out diamonds doles out gold and you'll see the shine come back now as far as in between the links like a rope train that's gonna require the next step another video for me to show you guys in case you want to invest in some cleaning equipment to get a better clean this has its limitations of course it's not going to make it completely brand new but from time to time you could just use this because it does not take any time at all to do it and you just kind of get that luster back whether you're talking diamonds or gold so it works pretty well in my opinion let me know if you try it or if you've tried it what you think of it and if your jewelry goes back to looking nice and clean thank you guys for watching let me know if you have any questions that's it for today's video and we will see you on our next jewelry video", "LPMRMeHWHW8": "hello thank you for taking a look at my auction you are looking at an estate pair of diamond dangle earrings set in 14 karat yellow gold each

buying diamonds today you know trusting that they're going to get extraordinary quality that's right you're getting in here in again comparatively speaking brand-new today and one of the most affordable diamonds in the show your first pair of Michael Beaudry earrings half carat total whites using one and a half carat total weight on these set in white gold five six seven or whatever I'm sorry in these earrings all done in your choice of white or yellow gold in j 3 2 2 599 beautiful so in your Couture do you do a lot of earrings is it we can choose what's the start no it again collectors collect they want they want a you know a full range of pieces from earrings two bracelets to cuff links and and gents rings and yeah so it's really endless and if you notice these articulate so on the pendant and the earrings they're not stiff see they've got some movement to them and that's very important when you when you have a piece of jewelry on you want it to move and you don't want it to get stuck you know when you have something that looks stiff on why not realize it until you get it home or wear it it's just not comfortable so these first of all they have to pass my wife and she's very very keen on she's a girl's girl so she's very keen on items that are comfortable and again not too heavy on the ear they've got beautiful backs so the backs are easy to engage their safe and again we learn all of this from the thousands of pieces that we've done handmade for collectors all over the world the backs of your brand new earrings fewer than two dozen remaining in each color another incredible gift and as a gift boy you really as a guy or someone giving a gift of diamonds to someone else you can't go wrong with earrings because you know there they are there they are you know they're going to be beautiful they're great in this case they're not I mean overdone and yet they're not so I remember the first time I got moving woman is now my wife earrings years ago in LA in the elected diamond district the gold district down in downtown LA yeah right and it's like they were so small and was fell through the hole in her ear and she was appreciative of them but they were just the designer for they were incredibly incredibly tiny you can see these I mean these are really traumatic injury they really are a great scale I mean that this is something you can wear everyday but not so every day that you don't see them and they have you know they catch the light they have that fineness when you think of you know going out on the town where you go see a play in New York you can wear these right but so many women come in and they say why where am I going to wear this in my town I can't wear to the grocery store guarantee you wear these to the grocery store every day call them every day diamonds they're here for 60 t payments of 194 83 so for so many of you who are thinking about you know putting your toe in the water in this world of Michael Beaudry mastered diamond cutter diamond designer and cutter to a-list celebrities and those people people have like planes and stuff you know I mean I'm not in that world you can now you have something

of diamonds or 30 points approximately maybe just shy of a third of a carat there are the morganite these are all cushion cut we really didn't even get a chance to talk about that because there's so much to talk about on the stone but those are cushion cut stones fancy cut stones and then we also of course have the tanzanite earrings which you will hopefully see shortly the tanzanite earrings with the Diamonds 30 points of diamonds one thousand six hundred forty nine dollars or six payments of two seventy four eighty three with a cute card you can again do the 12-month special financing on the morganite and the blue zircon earrings you can get them home for nine seventy nine or six payments of 163 17 or about $80 a month let's see which one is is that right here okay because let's just straighten these little guys out they decided to go Kitty Wampus on us the one nice thing about the cushion cut and I'll show you is that you can wear it look at let's see I think I got this you can wear it more on a baseball diamond shape if you want to or you can wear it more in like a cushion shape it's up to you tell me about this Christian cut so the cushion cut is actually one of the more challenging cuts because you lose more rough on this cut versus any other cut versus princess round emerald cut radiant cut the cushion cut is the lowest yield meaning that you really are going to lose a lot of rough so that's why you don't see it very often except in really high-end find quality designer brands jewelry things like this I want to also point out something else that I feel is very important now you have to be comfortable within your budget and all of this but I want to just say if you want the matching sets yes this is from the same site holder the same mining area the same area of the world it is all the same so it's a perfect match I just have to make sure you understand that that's so appreciate I want to show you the pendant because this pendant here they are these actually I don't believe they don't come with a chain so you can put your rose gold or your white gold chain on them once again I want you to see that you're getting 30 points of diamond",

finance charges 15 years in the business shop with confidence", "MzB9HdFbe38": "so today's video is review of my Costco diamond jewelry I have three pieces to share with you today the first being my engagement ring which I actually did a video on that prior and as well as two pairs of earrings both of those earrings are wedding gifts for my husband on our wedding day and I actually wore one of those earrings for my wedding day fucking-a photographed really well and I highly recommend that piece every diamond PC buy from Costco includes an article of description the clarity of Costco diamonds are always be s2 or greater and the color it's always I or greater so at least you're going to get that standard of quality from Costco so here we have a 14-karat white gold and diamond cluster earrings each earring set was one round brilliant cut diamond weighing approximately 0.14 it's surrounded by six smaller round brilliant cut diamonds the total diamond weight of the earrings is 1.25 carats so I'm currently wearing the larger earrings right here so these earrings retail for 1800 which is not too bad considering that you'd get a total carat count of 1.25 carats next we have the 14-karat white gold and diamond floral earring each earring set with 11 round brilliant cut diamonds the total diamond weight of the earrings is 0.45 carats or greater so I actually wear these earrings on a daily basis because they're nice and small and I don't feel them and I also like the fact that they are kind of flat so they don't stick out on your ear so when you're sleeping at night you don't have like this big diamond stud kind of poking into you so I really like that about these earrings these earrings retail for 650 and purchase them in store I'm not sure if we still have them online I'll try to find them online but yeah definitely check out your local Costco if you're interested it got these somewhat recently within the past year or so so they may still have it next we have 14-karat white gold and diamond ring the ring is set with two round brilliant cut diamonds each weighing approximately 0.48 carats and 54 smaller round brilliant cut diamond the total diamond weight is 1.5 carats or greater so this ring retails for $3,400 and you can reference my previous video on this ring as well if you want more information on that but my husband actually picked it up from me in Portland Oregon where they don't have sales tax so he was able to save even more so this is actually my second wedding ring my first wedding rings are actually a Tiffany ring which I also have a video on that as well if you're interested so here's a size comparison between these two now your Costco earring or ring purchase will come in one of these boxes so this is the protective outer layer and inside as your standard mahogany Brown tone wooden jewelry box so I actually have three of these boxes because both my ring animal pairs of earrings in one of these boxes and yeah it looks just like this and of course also and not yellow box would be the article of description as I showed you previously now that Costco jewelry boxes differ quite a bit in comparison to the Tiffany jewelry box as you can see the Tiffany one it's a nice suede material it's much smaller in fact and the hinge is a lot smoother right here so yeah all the others the Tiffany box is much more compact and easy to hold there's no jagged edges as of recently the past year Tiffany has rebranded their jewelry boxes to become this iconic Tiffany blue color and right now we just have a push closure that will open up your box like such and here's the Costco box in comparison honestly I think the packaging is kind of cheap for Costco I know it's Costco and you are trying to save a buck however I mean this situation is just not that classy if you're trying to give someone a gift because my box is already broken right here as you can see and yeah it's very cheaply made and this box if you look on the bottom and occu says Made in China not surprisingly so yeah I would say got in one drawback to purchasing jewelry from Costco and that the presentation is not the greatest", "_iYDeGyq3pY": "you love that bracelet we also have the Australian opal and diamond stud earrings or a ring for you we have this at j5 7053 the clearance price here is 219 dollars and then we also have it for you six easy payments of thirty-six dollars fifty cents if you go for the ring it is point 9 carats of Australian opal and if you go for the stud earrings one point three carats total so both of them beautifully done both of them just have this great kind of swirl it's like you know when you go to get that soft serve ice cream the only thing better than chocolate and vanilla together is going to be like Australian opal and diamond swirled together so you can see on Donna here now wat some ice cream you can see how the Diamonds just swirl right around the top and the bottom and then continue on either side onto that split shank 14 karat yellow gold nice high polished ez thin thin band here for you so it's comfortable to wear it's not too big it's not too small it's a nice size cabochons to where's my where's my trusty ruler here you're looking here at about a half an inch long and about three quarters of an inch wide so it's got a nice presence on the hand as you just saw on Donna it's an easy ring to wear it doesn't sit up too high you also get a really nice presence here for the 14 karat yellow gold there's a warmth there's a richness but then as you move you can also say shield up just a little bit the plays of the greens and the yellows and the blues and the reds and it's just something very fun there's something very feminine to about this ring kind of organic and I love how it just kind of circles around and around it's like when you throw that rock in and it kind of ripples it's that kind of feel but it just keeps going around and around so we have the ring for you but we also have the the earrings and the earrings I am wearing their lightweight they're easy these can absolutely be everyday earrings there's no reason why these should have to sit in a jewelry box and they shouldn't because these are actually our only Australian opal stud earrings in our entire assortment now here look at that the Reds the greens and with the Australian opal you really want to see that gorgeous red but you also see the 14 karat gold this reminds me you know I going to my great grandmother's house she had this beautiful old Victorian home and there were some spectacular mirrors hung up on the wall and this has that same kind of a shape there's definitely you know a bit of a Victorian feel to this something a little bit you know it feels like a collector's piece something that's been handed down now I do want to say that these are for pierced ears you can see the post in clutch and back nice size here by the way half an inch long three eighths of an inch wide bezel-set so just really beautifully framed and I love that you kind of just get that pillow effect of that 14 karat gold and then much like the ring the diamonds just swirl around it because you know what's better than a gemstone than adding in gorgeous diamonds all the way around you get the glow and the fire of the diamonds but then you're also going to be getting that beautiful rich play of color that comes from that Australian opal easy to wear we have the ring for you by the way in size 5 7 8 9 10 or 11 and then if you want the earrings of course it's one size fits all just make sure that it is for pierced ears and that's the beauty of earrings if you are thinking gift for somebody maybe a birthday and anniversary it's easy to do because no size is necessary to know but it's an Australian opal it's fun this is when you get it home and you know for six easy payments of thirty-six dollars fifty cents you're getting home something that every time you look at it there's almost like a crystal feel to it it's just like little little shimmies little shavings of color and that means it goes with everything that you wear but it's also fun and you know if maybe you're wearing it at work and you know we I'm not saying that this happens but maybe there's those times they know you zone out during work and maybe it's that conference call that just goes on like five minutes too long sit down and you look at the ring and you say oh well later I see some blue I see some green I say some yellow and believe it or not I'm here and hearing that the ring is the most popular option tonight out of the two but you get to play it's fun to look at you have fewer than 150 in either the earring or in the ring so we don't have a whole lot to go around here and it's the first time we've got it for you on six easy payments so another fun to try and get it home and of course taking a look at that clearance price that means there's no reorder so we want to make sure that you're getting at home and with fewer than 150 left not a whole lot to go around so you've got the choice of the ring or the choice of the earrings both of them six easy payments thirty-six dollars fifty cents and I want to focus on the ring here for a minute because I do want to give you like a nice close up here it really is gorgeously done you even have some nice under gallery work here a little bit of open work here on the bottom and doesn't that is just a sash of diamonds that is just that beautiful sash heading down and then aha we see the Greens that you can see some Reds at the bottom it's just it's fun it's different it's you know we all think the rainbow to me is that sign of hope the rainbows that sign of good luck that rainbow is the site you know that that sign of there is beauty that there is something special waiting ahead and of course perhaps the pot of gold on the other side well here you get the rainbow you get the gold and you get the diamonds you kind of get it all you become your own little special leprechaun I'm Irish I can't help but this is where my mind goes it's just beautifully done it's different and if you've never tried an Australian opal to get one home in a clearance price I would say go ahead and do it it's a 30-day return policy so get it home see how it speaks to you and every one is going to be just a touch different everyone is going to show the colors in a different place everyone's going to have different hints of green and of the Reds and of the Blues if you'd like the ring we have it for you sizes 5 7 8 9 10 11 and then we also have the earrings for you six easy payments thirty-six dollars fifty cents in today's that first day on those six easy payments if you're just joining us first of all thanks for stopping by i know everybody

in here comes Katya let's start with what she's wearing and I believe she's wearing that textured finish yeah tell me about that the textures finish is a diamond cut finish and the diamond cut gives a much more shiny because catch the light in different way and reflect in your face oh man that diamond cut is beautiful and it's almost a diamond cut quilted pattern right yes look like a quilt like a blanket quilt yeah it's just beautiful and that is brand-new today I'm telling you this is off the charts brand-new starts at five see payments of Oh 37 and then it goes to 49 depending on which size you're getting that's how it jumps up from one time teen to 249 but again all brand-new and all beautiful looking for classic high polished and need a brand new pair of high polished hoops you're good to go thank you brother man do that looking for but don't know I want to show you these man these are great man this is gonna be the diamond cut and what is going to be the one and a half in that in that yellow gold yes this one is a nominal torsion design is a two wire twisted so makes dynamism in the jaw this design is the same design that you can see in Florence in the main entrance at the Dodoma Florence dome there is two columns with the same torsion oh really that is a fun Florentine design the Florentine design yeah again there's that twisted rope are you loving absolutely loving that's in the one and a half inch right that's stunning yellow gold those are brand-new in a one day only normally three hundred and ten dollars would be the QVC price not here and not now only here at this price high polished there it is and that what we might call the beautiful beautiful twisted hoop and then it finally I've got it now in the yellow and the white and there's the diamond cut hoop now that is done with a diamond on the end of a tool right yes excited makes cuts right into the actual is it there is a tool with the diamond on the tip some diamond cutting are unmade some with

two together well it's gonna be twisted in that rope design right yeah just twist those just got twisted I won't call it rope anymore and this is gonna be the diamond cut the is not rope right a rope is another kind of twisted and diamond cut of the classic now in Italy is very on-trend hoop earrings there is fashion sometime come back and now in this moment in Milan all the women love the classic hoop earrings so it's just a matter of taste if you want the torsion design or the diamond cut well there you go and we do have the classic which is great that we're giving you this all of these are on sale all nine of them so by that I mean the Sun won't be more than that actually wouldn't it because you got one two three right and you have them in all of these choices that people are shopping

four one and a half one and then the two-inch there you see the prices and brand-new again Italian beauty an Italian gold all the way it's really interesting when it comes to how these might be worn as well yeah you know is I want to tell you one thing the process is a tubing process inside the gold is a low so it's very comfortable because there's not too much heavy very comfortable in the air not gonna be too heavy any year yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't want that the women go around the city like this you know yeah you won't have to go get your earlobes fixed because you're right right yeah exactly right and yet they're going to be in like when it comes to the high polish well give some love to the high polishes for a second they're going to be really really clean looking and just to give you a sense of scale the difference between the one and the one and a half right and then they - it's a one one and a half and two doesn't sound like much but in terms of the look of the earring it's actually pretty dramatic the change however if you're shopping right now they're all here that's the great news the bad news is it all goes away at the end of our day and the other good news this will work beautifully with something called today's special value that now 2,200 people have already shopped for we're coming right back right after this [Music]", "uLBEEo_AIcQ": "GENUINE GENUINE

come back keep one eye it's gonna be a lot of fun Erin Mosley is here among my favorite things to present here at QVC is dime unique because basically it makes dreams come true for women coast to coast and puts things in our hands on our hands in our ears that a lot of us are just always thinking maybe someday right two carat diamond earrings set in gold would be how much and I mean like the good stones right like the ones that are just absolutely flawless those are them maybe sunday some days this is the 100 facet in other words it does not get any more beautiful more radiant than listen diamonique two carat in total weight that's one carrot / ear if you're into the believability factor it's there to set in cast 14 karat gold three easy payments of eighteen dollars and sixty-seven cents more than 23,000 orders have already been placed on these it doesn't surprise me at all because it's just like the kind of guy to have or maybe a great first purchase from diamonique and we have them in choices of goal which is great as well and what I love what jaleesa was telling us earlier and I wrote it down because I thought that's a really good statement you get credit for the gold in other words it's not just these little four or six prongs their prongs said but look at this rope texturing yeah on all the stones so that it is clearly a gold piece of jewelry as well and I actually like to buy my studs and diamonique in gold when we have that choice I try to get a new color yeah I do love however that you you see it you see that beautiful band of gold that rope texturing going around because I have the four prong rose gold ones and although they're subtle and they're sparkly I don't really see much of that right you're the only one who knows right exactly so here's the yellow gold then we have it in white oh and it's almost like when you do it in the white the stone looks even bigger yeah it's just sort of Maggie I because the eager I it doesn't stop it just sort of breaks all the way down to it spreads out to the end so we're most limited in the rose and I'm thrilled that we included that because I know we don't always do and you but you know what when we bring in rows and earrings yeah you all go for it and I love that you do because it's so fresh and flattering to have the rose gold near the face it just sort of melts into the skin implementer e2 everyone's skin tone I always say for the same reason that we love to put a little bit of blush on our cheeks it's because it's that flush it's flattering and the rose gold gives you that same feel now obviously it's exciting to choose our choice of gold here and you get to add a little bit of color personality but we get to add Sparkle personality with a specialty cut in the hundred facet of diamonique and this is really it's something different where we've taken the classic look if you will which is the 58 facet and this is something that you'll see in all diamonds in general and diamonique it's done for a reason because it maximizes the brilliance well we thought one day if this looks great and if we buy diamonique because we love the sparkle what if we went and we added some more facets and we went from 58 to 100 and suddenly you had even more opportunity for the light to bounce inside of that stone off of the additional facets to sparkle back out at you we even added some subtly to the crown if you will hear not completely on the table top because we didn't want to take away from the traditional look of a diamond but it allows the light even more opportunities to enter in bounce off of those windows or those mirrors and then sparkle and that is what you want in your ears and that's what it does right i mean we're wearing stud earrings but look at the brilliance look at the shine on this so you get credit for what you're picking up in a like a good carat weight but not one where people are going to go that's not real yes that they looking up that's beautiful right so it is in such a versatile piece that we've got some truly fashion pieces we've got like a double hoop coming up in the show too but really you're looking for that core piece and then make the investment in goal but I say that investment with a smile because you're picking it up for eighteen dollars and change per month and you'll wear it for the rest of your days I know that because it comes with a lifetime warranty as well so let's give you an update on your choices remember we've got three colors of gold here but there are fewer than 100 in the Rose choice it almost always is the most limited to start and frequently the first to go and it looks like that's the case again final 200 in the white which has been the most popular out of all of our three choices a Dave looks radiant without the jewelry always but with this it's like that perfect it's she's making the case for less is more Sun yes right that's right it's that little kiss of diamonique in each of the earlobes and we're probably about 15 20 feet away from her and look at how you'll see yeah I can see them in her ears I see that hint of sparkle she looks so incredibly put together and all it took was that simple stud earring and more people are asking for those would you had an entire hour of gold jewelry on our big gold day California Gold Rush and everything was in diamonique I was so gratified to see that because I know for years people have been begging for the return of diamonique and gold because they're saying if its lifetime warranty if I'm really supposed to wear it just like I wear genuine diamond jewelry then I want it in the very best metal I want it in 14 karat gold and that's exactly what we've given you and that includes the post and the clutch as well it's all 14k so there's the yellow gold there's your white remember the most popular but now is getting limited and the most limited with only four dozen remaining is the rose gold j 280 2244 the only 100 facet in the show haha now I mentioned that we had these double hoops coming up this will actually be the first", "YvIcCPRlOuQ": "E TOP I SHOW BEHIND THE SCENES ACQUISITION I HAVE A FAVORITE ASK IS IT

boys the night is something that we brought to you per your request you were out there you were looking at it in other places QVC actually stepped on the break for a while because we wanted to make sure we had the quality that we could be proud of and you could be proud of when you got it home we're here we've arrived we're ready there you only missed two shows this is the third show ever that's how new and exciting this is now you're gonna get to choose white or yellow gold you're going to tell us whether you prefer a one carat a two carat a 3.5 carat or a 4.5 carat six easy pace is our best EasyPay plan and we're talking about a cushion cut on this and I'll go ahead and swing it around but take a look at them these again are investment pieces this is what I call your aspirational piece yep when you when you want that pair of stud earrings and again you you have to decide what where you want to cap out so to speak or you know you you want to be on the practical side of things or you need something a little extra special for your daughter's graduation or whatever the case may be this is the product that you want to have my wife has a pair of stud diamond earrings that have been in the drawer now no exaggeration for going on nine years because ever since I introduced her to moissanite that's all she is worn my daughters when they wear their studs this is what they wear and I'm from the jewelry world so I've had the good fortune to to be able to buy diamond earrings but they they feel comfortable at these they wear them day in and day out they get compliments on them every day and they maintain this look they do they're hard they wear like diamonds they feel like diamonds they're even brighter there's more scintillation there's more bounce back with them and they're set in gold in 14 karat white or yellow gold which to say that gold actually takes a backseat to a stone but you're seeing I mean look at our beautiful Stacey and how gorgeous these are and this is that little black dress this never goes out of style and you were talking about your wife and being lucky enough and I know a lot of you are lucky enough to have natural diamond earrings what are you going to travel with them or do you have them in this state in a vault or the safety deposit box because they were such an investment thousands of dollars well this is an opportunity to be able to get something that I realize this is an investment I mean these are more this is the happy medium between diamonique which we love and a diamond of this quality which would be thousands upon thousands of dollars particularly in an earring I would be nervous about wearing that since I you know have lost more than one earring and you only lose something you absolutely love of course so this is an opportunity although I would still say maybe add it to your insurance policy if you have that and you're worried about it this is an opportunity to gift for anniversaries for graduations for retirement just because it is something that you absolutely have always wanted this quality moissanite you have a 30 day unconditional money back guarantee and if you get it home and you go oh maybe I want the two carat instead of the one carat use your QVC return label if we have it available we will exchange it because that is the same item number and it won't cost you a penny more remind me for someone who maybe tom is not out there looking for stud earrings not looking for the cushion cut and maybe looking to buy for their granddaughter why is it that we should choose the cushion cut I think that's just more it's more you know for the younger younger kids they want something a little different than what mom has or or what they've always recognized and seen you know not everybody wants to be dictated what to buy and how much you're supposed to spend on it year after year after year they want to make their own decisions and they want something just a little different the cushion cut is very it's it's not that far off from around but it's just a little different shape and again the brilliance is is very very strong within a cushion cut the yellow gold in every carat weight is very limited last call on that yellow gold in one carat two carats this is the two carat so we have one carrot - carrot let's get to the three point five I think that's interesting three point five because it usually goes one carrot - carrot three carrot for carrot and it's just because of a little difference in the weight as far as if you want to look at the size itself the size demonstrates a three or and or a four carat your your weight is just a little different and when it comes to a cushion it has to be cut such so it's got it it's strictly about the weight factor and then last but not least the 4.5 carat I mean you can get that home for a hundred and fifty dollars and seventy five cents own it for a lifetime where it day in and day out let it be your signature earring if you would like to that's the beauty of it these know no color no style these are timeless the quality is here on them you have 30 days to get at home and the yellow gold almost completely sold out don't be afraid of the white gold J three six one two four eight here's another update this was brand new today we took a look at it a little bit earlier but I don't blame you I'd want to see what else is in the show too", "6pv6OAVLGco": "these three hours we've been talking gold jewelry many of these pieces available at clearance prices or on Easy Pay some great offers so we're going to get into the most affordable item in this three hour show it's our diamond-cut ball stud earrings already over 100 spoken for 32 dollars and ninety six cents for 14 karat gold ball studs which by the way are not those little itty-bitty tiny like your six-month-old would wear them ball studs these are eight millimeter big bold get noticed fall studs that we went the extra distance extra mile and did diamond cutting so these have some texture to them the diamond cutting allows for a little sparkle and so once these are sold out they will not be back especially since they've been marked down twenty-five percent these were almost fifty dollars previously so to get them at $32 and change these are go to earrings these are the earrings that you can always count on to work no matter what you have on whether it is that little black dress too you've got on some crop pants and a t-shirt these are the earrings that you can reach for and be confident that you know what they work these are nice if you need a little coverage on the earlobe maybe you have piercings that are a little bit more stretched out this covers them almost like a button earring would because i'm there at eight millimeter size they're almost read like a button earring and i just want to give you the little side profile because these stand out quite nicely to look at this so these have presence from the front from the side and that it is a clutch on the back it's a post and clutch finding i would recommend if you can maybe pick up the cliq secure clutch that we saw earlier the little backing this will make sure that this earring always sets up nice and high for you but it also makes sure that you know what you never lose an earring because these click secure backings make sure that the earring doesn't slip out so just a little heads up those are available for you three these have now been ordered so that's more than half of what we have available or bad available at the start of the show these are great at this price for maybe a young woman that's being introduced to find jewelry you know young young women they get their ears pierced maybe early it's nice to give them something that's not just base jewelry and that base Joey that's what will irritate the ear if you've ever worn an earring where it made the piercing turn a little green or a little black that's because you were having a reaction to the metal this is 14-karat gold so it's more gold than other alloys so it's always nice especially when we're talking about an earring where you have a piercing it's through the skin yes I do have these on as well and they're so classic I think these these look cute on everyone hi Kathleen Kirkwood how are you what do you think my little ball studs okay that you're a very classic woman she's like very classic woman and so I could see Kathleen she's coming up at am style you got a little dick tracy's in the mix all right I have you know I'm gonna get that leopard one I saw you on it with the other day she's coming up so stick around if you don't know what a dick tracy's is it's genius fashion solution alright so that's coming up our guys are like wait I'm good yeah so you got to stick around that's up at 7am in a.m style so if you maybe wear pearl studs if you wear diamond studs this is just another option for you that warm glittery gold ball stud and you know what sometimes maybe the diamond stud that might be a little bit much for work depending on where you work maybe the pearl stud maybe that's a little too you know formal for whatever is going on this is going to work whether it's a more formal too relaxed or informal occasion which I love j33 1274 is your item number we started with 500 pairs we have less than a hundred and that's it never to be seen again all right so it's time for a vault discovery we're going to discover it with the help of our friend Peyton Kelly our resident gemologist here at QVC he always brings us the finest gemstone pieces here and so our next piece is a baby pink spinel and diamond band ring set in 14 karat gold and this is the only day this month of March that it's been available on easy pay like there's been no easy pay option whatsoever not two not three not six not nothing so take advantage of those five installments of about seventy eight dollars a month on your cue card or credit card and I welcome back pay great to be here all right so thanks for you may be a long haul you know what I have stones like this to talk about and rings like this to talk about it's just such a pleasure because this is actually a new mine find this mine was only discovered early in 2015 okay and we've been able to bring one other ring here what we do is I gather the stones they cut all the stones they sort the stones very few of them are actually of this quality and this kind of like to them and you know we I call it neon pink spinel because look at the glow that it has coming from within it look at the color of it this was discovered in a very remote villa village in Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique and when they found them they were like wow what is what do we have because when you look at them what do you see you see that intense pink color but you also see the life you know spinel has many properties of diamond so it has a lot of brilliance and a lot of sparkle and fire coming from within it so when you have that kind of intense color of pink mixed with those kind of properties of the stone what do you see big diamond is looking diamonds intense pink diamonds and then to enhance it even further you did add kind of this halo on", "w_MKYy055VU": "T NINETY NINE SEVEN NINETY NINE.

carat of genuine natural diamonds and this at a clearance price of three hundred and forty nine dollars so you're saving well over two hundred dollars today and this is on our best easy payment plan diamond earrings for around sixty dollars a month on your credit card that's two dollars a day all right you're paying more for your latte grande venti whatever drink every morning at the coffee shop and this you'll always have something to show for it these beautiful earrings so let's talk about the design so these are hoop earrings and they feature bead set diamonds with a white rhodium plating so really makes those diamonds pop the hoop earring is somewhat of an oval shape but it's like three earrings in one so they've taken three hoop earrings and kind of overlapped and created this bypass look and it all comes together at the top with a snap bar closure so the look is very modern contemporary the sparkle and the shine and richness of 14 karat gold rich that glossy yellow and the earrings if you are hoop collector like myself they certainly have their own flavor and personality they don't look like another hoop earring nobody's saying there's that same old hoop she wears all the time this one certainly different and I can't wait for you to see it on Stacey because when you notice this sizing this is that kind of Goldilocks it's not a big huge 2 inch this is a one inch diamond hoop so it's very everyday wearable if it were bigger that would make me say well you know maybe that's for after five this is for you know date night this is an earring you can easily wear into the office it's seven tenths of a carat of diamonds and by the way affinity is a line that it's all about bringing you the best quality in diamonds in stones so we have very very high standards so when we say a seventh of a carat of diamonds it's an industry standard to actually be able to bring you less than the stated carat amount out in retail we don't do that here at QVC when we say a seventh of a carat it's a minimal of a seventh of a carrot so the stones they're always I clean that means you won't see any inclusions they're also that coveted blue white color so they're bright they're white they're shiny they reflect the light and then when you pair that with gold diamonds set in gold that's a great pairing and it's a unique hoop style it's like three separate hoops in one earring so it has a lot of dimension very sculptural I think its current and as you see them on Stacy they're quite that Goldilocks eyes just perfect they're hitting her you're at the right place on the face j32 8255 we had one other affinity diamond jewelry piece if you're just joining us take a look we had a diamond tennis bracelet earlier in the show oh no that really we only have one oh my goodness so apparently this is the last one we have 18 inch diamond bracelet left to go around what's special about this diamond bracelet we partnered with the GI a to guarantee at least an H color and vs quality and clarity on the stones that's why you're seeing all of this fire set an 18 karat white gold so this is like the highest top quality and it's on six easy payments if you want to pick this up there's only one to go around is it for you is it your ultimate Mother's Day gift come true maybe every year you say to the husband I'd love the diamond tennis bracelet I would love a diamond tennis bracelet it's still on the list hopefully this is the year if you said you know what we've got my diamond tennis bracelet I'm good there Gabrielle but I don't have any diamond hoops this is the real deal these are genuine natural diamonds and then we set them in this gorgeous gold hoop it's a one inch shoot by the way and then if you measure just the front width this is about a quarter of an inch wide so as you saw on Stacy these aren't bold these aren't oversized and chunky quite comfortable to wear I might add they're not going to pull and tug on your piercing so they're very comfortable to wear and this because of that one inch size I think works for year nine to five as well as your playtime and your special occasion so it's a nice way to add a little sparkle to your hoop game only about five dozen remain in this affinity diamond hoop earring all right but it's almost three o'clock here on the East Coast that means midnight on the west coast and time for",

love this because again if you want your gold your true gold this is it more than 25,000 have been sold here on QVC you're going to get your choice of your color of gold in this set of studs QVC price 73 dollars and fifty cents but we're going to give you five easy payments of fourteen dollars and seventy cents all you have to do is order with a credit card we let you break up the price and pay for it while you wear them while you love them isn't that awesome no interest charge and you're going to get them right away and this would be great if you are going to give it as a gift you know maybe actually I'm thinking if you bought the easy gift we had earlier with a set of two stud earrings in the epiphany and in the 14 karat gold plated you can give those as a gift because it came in that pretty box and then this is the set to buy for you because you're getting that all 14 karat gold right okay so here are your choice of colors we have the 14 karat yellow gold that you're seeing then we have the 14 karat rose gold and then we have the 14 karat white gold so 2 carats total I mentioned one carat for each year these are prong set clear round 100 facet dominique stones and we'll show you the beauty of 100 facet but let me just turn this to the side right here because then you can see this is a post and clutch so they are for pierced ears only just so you know that post and clutch also in all 14 karat gold so there you can see that perfectly it's going to come in a gift box so if you are going to get these turn this around Wow hello hi honey come home to mom I love it because they're also going to come in a box so here's the box and just how beautiful I mean gosh you're going to open this up and and she's going to see or you're going to see all that sparkle and shine ah absolutely lovely okay so diamonique 100 facet it's truly double the sparkle double the fire double the pleasure and i'm going to show you the difference and why that might mean something to you even you you don't need it in a big stone it's something to appreciate even in the smallest I shouldn't say smallest the most delicate size stone still you're getting a carrot here for your ears it's a nice size so this when jeweler's go to cut in this case a round stone your typical cut is 58 facets and it's so funny I'm always I'm always kind of weirded out when I first grabbed this 58 cut facet stone because I it's beautiful I mean look at that that's gorgeous that's a regular diamonique that's how we'll give it to you standard 5857 facets but our designers and our buying team said you know we want to kick it up a notch we want to make it more special can you do more and our master cutters for the diamond eek who also cut real diamonds same master cutters said alright we put them up to the challenge came out with a 100 facet now huh which one you want 58 are the hundred yeah no brainer right this look at that I mean look at the beauty look at how much more of that we had in Palo who called in that rainbow effect of those colors that flash when it hits the light and here here it is you can see it in our animation looks like a crown which really represents royalty and dignity it's that 100 facet it's all that fire and when you talk about diamonique you're always going to be talking about the world's finest simulated diamond but rated eternally flawless what does that mean with the naked eye you can't see one flaw even a trained eye you can't see the flaws it'd be very difficult to find then you go too near colorless so the whitest of white now yellow hue to it nothing off color it's not going to look dirty it's going to be so crisp and clean that is the only kind of diamonique that you will ever get with us and in this case you're getting the 100 facet so then you're getting double of that beauty but look at it one carat it's that universal size that works well for any asian for any long hair short hair you name it it's the one carrot that you want it's that believability nobody's gonna go who does she think she is kidding okay she's a retired well maybe you retired with a lot of money and you could afford it but you know what you don't have to worry about it it's a simple study you wear every day and if you would lose it you don't have to cry over it right so you buy the diamonique it's you know your your biggest meeting or your everyday going to the office maybe you work in a conservative place you can't wear fashion jewelry so you wear a stud and you wear something beautiful like this remember you have your choice of color here so you have your choice and this is all gold 14 karat yellow gold 14 karat rose gold and then the 14 karat white gold is your choice going to come gift box for you ready to give for the holiday season or any special occasion that's what a stud is it's that quintessential piece that every woman should have in her wardrobe but it doesn't now have to be real diamonds we don't have to worry about shelling a couple hundred dollars to own a pair of the earrings it's classic there really is nothing more classic than a pair of diamond studs and these capture that sophisticated look at a fraction of the cost and why 14 karat gold you might be saying well I could get the plated that were a little less expensive online or earlier in the show in the set that we had well because it's the earring you'll have for years and years you know it's that gift to that if you are going to give it to somebody you love when you give it in a true 14 karat gold says you know what you're worth it to me and maybe it's just worth it to yourself to treat yourself to that kind of that gold Margot you shouldn't say goldmark maybe i'll say hallmark instead because i don't want to sound silly playing off the gold here that hallmark of style is when you have something in a solid gold piece but really pretty on just simple again long hair short hair it's just going to pop because there's so much brilliance and fire I think am I wearing these pair I couldn't remember what I put on I might have on the set earlier from the show I do I do okay because these are the princess cut this is going to come in a round cut in the round 100 facet maybe I can grab if we have time we have about a minute here if I can find them in my tray might raise a hot mess right now here we go you know what I'm going to do I'm going to put the gold the yellow gold on for you so you can see and before I put it on I just want to show that you can see that yellow it's hard on the display but you can see how pretty that yellow is and how soft in a true 14-karat it is okay so now I'm going to take it away i'm going to put in my ear so you can see just how pretty it is and i love studs because yes office-appropriate if you work in a very kind of conservative atmosphere but that everyday pset should you just want to go out to a picnic or barbecue in shorts and a t-shirt or jeans and a t-shirt you have your studs on it's it's just makes you look sophisticated elevated so there they are beautiful size because it's that sweet spot it's the believability that you want and I think you know Dominique has earned that respect especially from our loyal customers are obviously from our loyal customers it's not the right one is this again did I put the wrong one in oh yes because it's the princess cut my apologies oh they were hidden underneath my cloth that's why I couldn't find them alright we're going to have to wrap I'll put them on my ears so you can look while i present the next item", "2HiYzMhAq9M": "I earn and

get them from the lab these are from the lab these are from the lab yeah then the analogy I used earlier Nancy I were talking about talking before weeks our buyers have not slept for the past couple months that's making this thing happen this is this has literally been months in the making is that if you received right now a dozen roses right now am I giving my wife a dozen beautiful roses would my wife say oh these are the most beautiful", "9JRCPeMaC6Y": "what a show this is thanks for your calls are we on Facebook right now we did a Facebook live earlier today with me and Antonella she's a nut by the way she's this woman - not in the best possible sense we hear we had a lot of fun giving stuff away Facebook great way to see us agree with a shop qvc.com a great way to shop but we're live now in Westchester Pia in our gem day and we're in the myth of a very exciting hour let us fix these up help me fix yourself but you got it just make sure that we're trillion ting up where we should be with all these there we go wow wow wow cans and I couldn't be 7:56 okay these are gonna vary in terms of the choices one of them is gonna be tan tonight one of them is going to be blue zircon Madeira citrine and then pink zircon all right all here when it comes to our friend of the tanzanite that's kind of three dozen can be had the Madeira citrine sixties agreements of $87 most affordable is gonna be that Madeira citrine pink zarkon's gonna be I think 593 I think right as is the blue zircon 593 all right check with our order enter representative operator standing by stunningly beautiful once-in-a-lifetime earrings yeah and I really wanted to bring the trillion back I mean this is a stone that's always been really important to me especially with something like tanzanite but it looks great with all the colored stones simply because it you can get lost in it like a house of mirrors if it's cut right you know the way that three sides come to one point is so much more challenging to cut than bringing everything down to one point and I say a brilliant cut around you set that bad boy up on a round on a machine and next you know it's done with a trillion you're still doing a lot of these by hand in some cases hours and hours and hours to cut one stone and again I think they just really nailed it with this design blue zircon most limited by the way $98 if you want to pick it up so this is a first look this is our fresh from the fair item we're not calling it fresh from the fair we used to call the fresh from the fair but this is we don't have this in stock right now model not here model not wearing it because these are the samples we have so if you're shopping right now in the moment our buyers saw it and said okay we need this in our gem day can we get it by gem day they said no we can't get it by djembe so all you're doing is reserving there's a 30 day return policy when it shipped to you and it shipped to you on the 27th of this month if you want to go for it right there you see the prices on your screen this is our fresh from the fair opportunity and take a look oh man take a look at that blue zircon it's like custom ordering right now right imagine the fact that you're calling in now and ordering something and then they're calling and having your stones cut alright is that not cool like while you're shopping they're going alright let's see what we can do so yeah I love that we're doing this right too by the way showing these guys in one right the two colors then the Blues on the other side let's focus on these because they're gorgeous there's that Madeira citrine which is absolutely stunning most affordable by the way and be and saturated stones yeah and this is a gemstone that comes from the the name itself is from the Portuguese the Portuguese area there's a mine there called the Madeira minds from the Madeira islands and it represents like a Portuguese wine the similar color of that so that's where this name comes from and you have to technically have the stone fall within a color parameter to be called Madeira citrine and that's what you have here it's not the yellow citrine it's not the gold it's true - like up I like to describe it as honey or butterscotch just because I don't know both of those taste good to me but they that's kind of that warm glow and if it's cut right you're gonna still get the golden glow inside of it okay now that you see those now we're coming back because this is fresh from the fair this is stunning and this is like nobody in America has these these are brand-new here are blue stories tanzanite if you want to do it if 18 remaining 18 pairs remaining remaining blue zircon one half dozen six remaining here comes the blue zircon story this is on six easy payments of 98 dollars this is 2 carats 60 points so that means in the blue zircon that means a carat 30 points in each year right yeah blue zircon is a heavy a heavier gemstone it's the same size you're not going to tell the difference in your ear but just when you actually weigh it on a very you know accurate scale that comes out a little bit heavier on the density but that blue zircon get ready that's gonna light up the room that's the one that comes doubly refractive on the on the the lighting that comes through and it's gonna shine twice as much and smart more twice as much you've been on a cruise or two in your life right you can imagine wearing this through the Caribbean right I'm dress up night alright crew down captain's cocktail party on the from meeting the captain and captain's friends I'll look at those earrings blue eyes and the color of the sea here come the other two colors if you'd like to do it just about a hundred like a few dozen of those that right yeah two dozen the Madeira citrine and 30 left in the pink and they're sold out so this advance order not paying until it shipped 30-day return policy surrounded by diamonds and why is that trillion cut so alluring and just so just so perfect it's better than around isn't it yeah I mean it's it's different right I mean in this or no disrespect I think the first earrings you all bought were probably round star just like my wife and and I respect that but as you move on in life and you start to add to your collection I think we can all appreciate kind of getting outside the box and buying a fancy cut so a trillion shape is a fancy cut and it does have incredible you know fire and scintillation when it's cut properly and it's balanced if you don't balance out a stone and we you know we have to go

into the zircon is incredible the way that the stone will Sparkle you will see it in person but you're never going to really capture it on video because the way the light is just going crazy earlier we had the camera down there and the diamonds were focused and the stone was looking a little kind of wonky that's only because there's so much reflection of light but it's really tough to catch case it is that when you studied a you know did to get to become a gemologist what was wonky one of them where they were it was a very technical term called wall", "q3LqHYzOZlQ": "if you're looking for one

bending of light as these just just omit this beautiful beautiful rays of sunshine and color and light this is without a doubt one of the stars of the day let me set this up cushion cluster cushion being the silhouette shape cluster being the cluster of real diamonds real bright white diamonds in 14-karat gold there are two choices one is a white gold one as a yellow gold really doesn't matter which one you get because they're both going to rock but if you love and if that's important to you I'll give you the update in just a little bit started with 500 we literally have and though in the white fewer than five dozen not five thousand five dozen but in the yellow seven remaining and then we take it away price is about to go away this may never come back again it's a limited quantity here and now okay bring it down Rick relax a little bit I don't know when I get excited I do the same thing easy payments of $91 and 66 cents Michelle's back the air shell when we debuted these we brought him on there were almost 1100 us and 99 regular QVC price but we showed a graphic I distinctly remember it that the retail value was almost I was like $1,700 that's right so that 1100 was $600 less they repeat that the regular QC price it was a steal when we debuted these these are now 50% off that sold our price off of our price this is not against those guys of retail this is us versus us and I'm telling you you will never ever be disappointed with these for years and years and years to come tell me about as our diamond expert quality of diamonds well these are definitely affinity quality in fact brought in is really one of the signatures of last year this is one of the high pot high spots honestly of last year when they were brought out I mean the phone lines were just absolutely madness at the full price we're double dipping in that price and what are you looking at you're looking at H near colorless quality and you're also seeing I - or better clarity so you talk about a diamond earring that can take you nine to five and five to nine I mean you're gonna have a good time in these earrings trust me and they're gonna just brighten up your face and put a sparkle in your eyes Michelle what do you love the yellow do you love the yellow gold Oh we'll see what I mean they're sold out everybody that's all right the white I'll go better with my wedding set anything white will be beautiful and the white is here for the next few dozen people limited quantity now and look at them on Kenisha these are three cables away at dinner these are Oh walk into a room these are beautiful at that distance these are not teeny tiny stud earrings doesn't even do it justice to call them stud earrings there's so much more and they're not teeny tiny diamonds with you know their large pieces in fact when I spoke with the vendor about these these very earrings they were actually designed to give you four times the look so they're one carat in total weight but they're gonna look like four carats in total weight I can't afford a four carat solitaire but I would actually prefer this for fire the reason for that is those diamonds are synergistic they love one another they're having a conversation they're throwing colors and light to one another it's like we're gonna ball back and forth right I mean those things are dancing let's face it the dancing diamonds indeed and two dozen remaining white only now do you wear them in the diamond shape or do you wear them the way a laser has it well guess what you choose so literally it's just the way you you put them on your ear because of the back right it doesn't matter it doesn't matter they're so delicate you go wrong no and I love that the center cushion stands up higher than the halo they're all the rage right now and again it has to do with the royal family really that they're the ones who really brought the halo back although it's been around for a long time tell me now as we're giving you one full carat face up white near colorless stones not highly included diamonds we're gonna wrap up one dozen remaining we got to get out of here 91 66 what did you want to know sleep well unless you ask me to Fort Worth yeah yeah coming back with today's value right absolutely indeed okay more to come another one day only still to come", "iPOL-9f-RNk": "with what was less than at midnight the single most exciting launch in jewelry in over 20 years since we gave you definitive diamonds on QVC yes we have simulated diamonds that's not what these are these are firelight lab-grown diamonds they are indeed and we have them now as a today's special value our buyers are buying team we love this so much love the idea so much and in working with this diamond supplier one of the most respected on the planet Earth we said it's not a show it's not an item we're going right to today's special value and when you see the price comparisons we're gonna compare not to mine diamonds we're gonna compare to other lab-grown diamonds and we're going to say buh-bye see you later other guys we're here we started with 4 choices there are now three remaining and this is the final look at it it's on six easy payments free shipping and handling and most importantly a 30 day return policy there's nothing to lose here whatsoever we're going to start out and get like as close to shot as we possibly can in the history of QVC jewelry with the half carat total weight come on in come on in 180 can be had near colorless the single best value of the day there stunningly beautiful we're gonna then move to the full carat in half carat in each year full carat Nancy's wear them now 580 can be had it's been most popular all day this is the ultimate trade up well yeah we bought deeper in it for that reason is what people want people want to trade up to that perfect in fact that's what we call it that perfect one carat pair well let's now trade up in a big way for those of you out there saying okay I'm not kidding around here I've always dreamed about having diamonds but I want one carat in each year near colorless stunningly beautiful very slightly included this is yet to carat total weight all with an opportunity set and white gold to bring them home and wear them absolutely every day but here's what I got to tell you you're about to see this little graphic here and this is the Wow the left hand side that's the comp shop the comparable retail value that our merchandising team has to do we go and see what it is that's lab-grown to labrum that's not even mind mine would be much more expensive yes the comparable retail value 579 well I'll do the math for you saving two hundred and thirty dollars here if you're getting the half carat but you don't want to wait on those because those are going quickly it's on $58 and seventy five cents seventeen cents the one carat normally 13:23 we have it for a savings of three hundred and sixty four dollars six easy payments that's also on 12 month financing the one and a half carat it's on weightless but technically it is sold out that's jumping into the two carat that two carat 5500 saving two grand that's the biggest savings dollar-wise two grand now you're paying for them I get it but you're getting diamonds lab-grown diamonds excuse me clarification lab grown diamonds for a lifetime here a diamond is a girl's best friend a diamond is forever lab-grown diamonds from that are fire light they are forever and a day I just made that up I like it write that down that's good that is the comparison and here comes Aida and she is not fooling around I'd which did you choose again okay you did the Hat half carat okay I think you got that's right right which is a quarter carat in each ear okay as people are making their choice did you google did you frugal I hope you look around did you were you were you shopping all day and we're saying ah man I feel so great in beautiful jewelry I want these as a gift from me to me I'm an empty nester now and I want to treat myself I'm elbowing my husband to get me a great gift that I can wear absolutely every day he's become the 80/20 earrings they you know I wear 20% of my jewelry 80% of the time these are the ones you wear to the parent-teacher conference you wear to church I took a nap in these you took a nap and they're comfortable not a problem at all not a problem they're set in white gold and will go to the phones in a second because we've taken a lot of great calls but I got to give you the update this is the final presentation by the way this is it one is already sold out we've never ever done this before the half carat 1300 is what you've spoken for already today but if you want to have carat now or down to the final hundred and forty-eight remaining that is it 148 and QVC were a rocket that is it and then they're gone and the bangles are go that ring is gone the other earrings see you later it's been a crazy day here half carat one carat total weight or two 550 remaining right here but this guy guess what there are six dozen remaining six dozen of the big Papa Big Mama right here okay is it a simulated stone absolutely not here comes that checklist everybody as you're you've googled you've you've been on I don't know how much else we can show in terms of clarification we got Nancy we got you know I graduate Amala gist from the GI a a diamond graduate of the GI a is it a diamond absolutely it is as same optical chemical properties as a mine diamond yes what about the crystal structure and the stuff that's the same yes what about the more skill what is the more scale the Mohs scale judges the scratch-resistant C of gemstones has been in place since the 1800s it's not going anywhere these two diamonds both diamonds one lab-grown and one from the earth are both the perfect ten now I like this graph too because it shows where other things fall into place there's a huge distance between corundum which is a nine and diamonds which are a ten the latter does not take even steps up the ladder okay you're getting something that's everlasting in beautiful check check check check check the only thing that's not checked is the bottom - is it simulated no fire like no is it simulated in mind no we are not simulated this is a lab-grown diamond so here we go as you're shopping it's gonna retain that color it is near colorless so we'll show you a GI in a little bit after we show these on you who's wearing what I want to show you and I want to show you my dear so let's definitely do that Michelle let's show your ear what are you wearing okay I like the two carat I really do well I'll tell you one of the reasons I like it we haven't even talked about yet today it's a perfect size to go in an earring jacket I've got some really great earring jackets and I usually put pearls in them this is about the size of a good size pearl so I can use them in my earring cold-cut stunningly beautiful white gold white gold post white gold back over here and we're gonna get the shot ready for Aida here I want show you this this comparison though in the value story here comes the value if you if we were to go on get retail values on mine diamonds it would blow your mind and this size one carat in each ear of near colorless full cut the very small inclusions on you go guys it doesn't just go up in price in a steady way no like it goes up exponentially the larger that you can good word exponentially well look at the two carat lab the lab 5500 we have our fire light line better more beautiful brighter bigger it's now six easy payments of 583 a couple dozen remaining of those one and a half carats sold out the half carat however the way to dip your toe in the water if you want it 90 remaining we started the show with 800 of them Wow 300 of its uses 90 remaining so these aren't going to sell out I wouldn't wait I'm telling these are going to go I don't know when they're coming back but as we its perfect everyday size for everybody yeah and those are by the way that's the one thing about these when you see these on Aida those are not small diamonds no like diamonds like mine diamonds mean less color come in a lot smaller sizes than what you're seeing now those are beautiful size you can see them from across the room they sparkle like beautiful diamonds because they're lab created diamonds the bigger the bolder the brighter the more beautiful and the other be within your budget finally within your budget you know who's coming through on a day like today and this is really speaking to you who are watching who are on Facebook with Nancy right now who were skeptical is the purest the diamond purest is cut you know the like I like my gut like they don't go simulated my own finiti shoppers your affinity diamond shop right are saying you know what I'll try it I can't afford this singular size I can maybe be doing a cluster a sort of cluster a sort of halo but no not in the single stud for this price I can't come close to it I want to trade up everybody my friend barb earlier today wonderful as she looked a couple of weeks ago she looked at her ring and she looked at her and she looked at her color of her ring you know that's the other thing yeah the color of your diamond hate to say you see it next to these until you sit next to a near colorless stone it's great it's like it's like you know standard TV wedding ring on when I went down to the manufacturer to visit to see these for the first time my poor wedding ring I was like oh my god it's like it's in a shadow what collected it and I mean it's a nice ring and it's a nice beautiful it is but i nuts my husband that day I said I guess I know what I want for the holidays right so I'm telling you you guys you've got to get this on your hand you've got to get this on your wrist you've got to get it around your neck and see what it's about you know you know what the thing about we talked with friends earlier today as well about cost per wear Nancy like how often do you wear something you know the bridesmaids dress kind of a one-and-done good luck you paid good money for it this is something that you can totally you're a mom you're going to the parent-teacher conference you're going to church you're going to work here you're going to a meeting you can go absolutely anywhere you are going these are going to pay for themselves in the number of times that you wear them don't you agree yes for sure and by the way this is the half carat size that's the 1 carat carat one carat mmm again half carat and one carat so I'm gonna geek out a little bit if that's ok because I had somebody somebody question that these are the same chemical makeup of a diamond which I understand like a mine diamond and I get that and the comment was there's but there's no nitrogen in these diamonds and that's what they find in nature but very rarely will you have a diamond they're called the type 2 diamonds will not have the nitrogen in them maybe a little bit or none at all so I just want you to know that does occur in nature but very rarely it doesn't have the nitrogen in it so I just wanted to kind of point that out for those of you who are purists and that's a great question and it's a great comment I love that I do - well these are people that really know diamonds are watching answers they're buying into this which I really love because they're shoppers to be let's put let's search you're going wait a minute nitrogen and what in the heck are they talking about let me put a little graphic over the checklist again if you're just joining us this is this is big and we this has been cleared legal the whole thing and I just wanted to I this was me I said how can I simplify this for her you know to me cuz I'm smart sharpest tool in the shed I don't know Nike I like to see it laid out like this the fire like to mind is it a diamond check check there you go there's the optical chemical physical properties check check same composition crystal structure check check most skill we just talked about it check scratches this and all those stories the hardest substance known to man the diamond all that kind of stuff lab grown it's their only difference there's the check and there's the red X one's going to lab ones growing in the earth bottom two simulated simulated no and no so is it tulips oh those are wonderful too or those are wonderful roses thank you so much for those green house roses nobody says that they sit success thank you for the beautiful roses thank you for the beautiful roses here it comes no this is a mind lab-grown time and remind Ivan know you know we're gonna say it's gorgeous here is the story with one already on waitlist we're in final quantities in the last look at our

today we worked with one of the biggest diamond suppliers diamond purveyors purveyors on earth yeah right of our biggest suppliers for affinity or affinity diamond supplies us with mined diamonds yeah

because the silver is lighter you can get more volume it's like cutting up let's say drugs that people want more volume so they cut it up and they do this type of stuff these are beads that are used for casting that's what you're seeing in here this is how you make gold chains what you want to realize from this video is that whatever you own is 14k or 10k you always own pure gold inside your

just go with you because one you know look at the realms when you see this that's the size of a one and a quarter carat stone in each year and again these diamonds are extremely fine minimum of Si two are better five dozen can be that are better when you see that center stone these are again a precision cut for the center of your earrings yeah those stones were not just cut and sorted and just set

know what I Meg there's nine-month financing available but after we show the cushion and then we'll show the the pair and then we'll show the heart I also want to show then that color wheel again and a little bit if we can kind of gear that up because it really speaks to what you are buying we have never had finer in this partnership with the Gemological Institute of America the few remaining in the heart that heart is probably fewer than two dozen paiting they're not going to be back when I come back today these are none carry out what are we what are we buying here pay through our partnership with the GI a when you're talking about color color chart starts at D which is completely colorless because all the way to Z which is light brown or light yellow what we went with is H color and H color is considered near colorless and when you see how high it is on the scale and then when you see three together when you see a D and H and a Z together look at the comparison do you see a difference between H and D when we're talking about colorless in near colorless near colorless means you do not see any brown or any yellow and look how beautiful that stone is that's the body color of it that's not the sparkle and fire okay six zero zero two one item number these are fantastic and there's so almost impossible to do with these large stones they'd be cost prohibitive for 99% of the popular about the 1% yeah that that's who would be you know people who own planes would be buying an actual three carat sizes or one and a half carry these are more brilliant and sparkly and more beautiful than a single stone because a single stone is not going to have this much Brigance old ironic the stone why this one has every single stone has brilliance and fire full cut precision cut you saw that color near colorless and then with the naked eye you can't see the HSI to are better which means you're not gonna see any inclusions you take it have it in praise go to from a microscope yes you will see some small inclusions 3/8 by 3/8 they're perfect I mean what occasion everyday diamonds absolutely special occasion you've got it reunion coming up this this summer yes

we did two tennis bracelets in 18 karat we did we did all volts Christ exactly both discoveries and here when you see this we had to do this in 18 karat gold because number one the diamonds are so fine you know earlier when we showed the chart this is vs2 are better extremely fine diamonds very slight is what V S stands for which means when you look through a loop or microscope you're gonna have to look a long time to find anything in these diamonds they are this fine and when you see the center of this that is the size of a three carat solitaire so when you see that and how is that done when you look at the quality of this does and you look at the color of the stones and again normally when you see baguettes you don't see colors of the rainbow and you see that Rick and every single

which is 75% gold and 25% alloy which would include nickel zinc and other metals these other alloy metals specifically nickel make the metal white and durable and hard most white gold jewelry comes with a rhodium plating around the outside it's a shiny metal that is a member of the Platinum family and now this is done to give it a wider appearance and protect it from color loss over time because also over time this plating wears away and the gold gets this yellowish tinge as it oxidizes but don't worry rhe polishing and replating with this rhodium on the white gold will restore its original appearance just like the day you got it now that means it's important to choose a jeweler that offers a lifetime of free rhodium plating as my favorite jeweler does in the link below this video it's one of the many reasons why I like them white gold is significantly less expensive than platinum which is the other common white metal we will get to in just a bit for engagement rings if your engagement ring is gonna have white gold or any white metal I wouldn't go with less than I colored diamond because lower than that and the yellow in the diamond starts to stand out when compared to the ring metal you can watch my video on color comparisons if you want to know more on the color of diamonds but now let's go to white 14 karat gold 14 karat white gold contains 58.5% gold which is almost 20% less than 18 karat gold now because it's less gold it means it contains more alloy metals which come with some disadvantages and some advantages for example 14 karat is harder and more resistant to wear tear and scratches than 18 karat gold because that alloy makes it stronger so if you're an athlete or a manual laborer and you're gonna be wearing your ring during these activities you might want to go with 14 karat gold over 18 karat gold the problem with white gold 14 karat is that they usually have more nickel for the wider appearance which also means it's more susceptible to causing allergic reactions and just so you know women tend to be a little more allergic to metals than men do 18 karat gold has more rich yellow in it so 14 karat has less chance of it turning that Tingy yellow over time the great thing is that 14 karat is even less expensive than 18 karat white gold because of its smaller gold content 18 karat is already less expensive than platinum which we will see but the thing is 18 karat is actually a little more valuable if you are into that 18 karat yellow gold yellow gold was the most common metal early on for centuries with engagement rings pure gold graded at 24 carats is naturally yellow so it only makes sense that 18 karat yellow gold over time will retain its more yellow gold color 18 karat yellow gold like white gold is composed of 75% gold alloyed with 25% other metals the advantages of yellow gold are that it doesn't corrode and tarnish and rust so you can count on it for it to provide lasting beauty also some skin tones are more favorable to yellow gold over white gold there are different thoughts on how yellow gold complements different color graded diamonds some people claim that yellow gold can make a diamond look wider because of its heavy contrary with the Whitestone then the other thought is that the diamond will reflect more yellow light if it's surrounded by a yellow gold band I will put two different comparisons up on the screen and let you decide if you think yellow makes the diamond look more white or more yellow but there are two different thoughts on this and don't worry I will explain later how you can get the best of both worlds if you want contrast but yet the diamond not to reflect as much yellow but first let's move on to 14 carat gold 14 karat yellow gold like white gold is composed of 58.5% gold which enhances its durability because of the extra alloys in it and its resistance to wear however unlike white gold it uses less nickel in it which decreases the chances of you being allergic to the metal and once again because it is 14 karat is less expensive than 18 karat because it has less gold which will make it less valuable but also less expensive 14 karat yellow gold also has a less yellow look than 18 karat thus 18 carat gold has a more rich yellow color than 14 karat athletes and manual labourers once again that are going to wear their ring during their activities may still want to go with 14 karat gold as it will have more resistance to their activities 14 karat rose gold unlike yellow and white gold rose gold is normally just sold in the 14-karat because there is no real advantage to the 18 karat rose gold rose gold is now very popular in trendy and it's achieved by mixing gold and copper amongst other alloy metals the higher the amount of copper in the gold the more pronounced the red color a common alloy content for rose gold is composed of once again 58.5% gold and 42% copper and silver it doesn't really need an 18k because most prefer the color of the 14k and it is harder without the increase in allergenicity like the white gold we talk earlier over time it will get slightly more red and darker due to its oxidation if you like vintage looks this could be actually beneficial - the good news is the 14-karat white gold the yellow 14 karat and the 14 karat rose gold are always almost all similar in price which is less expensive platinum is usually 95 percent platinum which is a dense metal it can make it feel about two to four times more heavy so it might weigh a little on your hand an added bonus of Platinum's 90 to 95 percent purity is that it is rarely going to cause allergic reaction and is therefore an ideal metal of choice for people with contact allergies now platinum is a rare and valuable metal and because of supply and demand that makes it more expensive due to its limited quantities this is why platinum is more expensive than the other precious metals we've looked at today it's price per weight is about the same as gold but because it's so dense it makes it more expensive platinum is malleable at very high temperatures but has a higher tensile strength what may seem counterintuitive is that it can get scratched more easily than 14-karat and obviously 18 carat gold though the prongs holding in the diamond are stronger with platinum it's just tends to get scratched more often than of even in 14-karat gold a patent of finish is also an issue with platinum if patent a finish is when platinum loses its luster from wear and tear it can make the ring look a little darker over time and some people think this gives the diamond a more vintage look and other people just don't like the look of it re polishing is possible so you need once again a jeweler that will do this for free to return it to its original luster if you're working with harsh chemicals once again the ability for root polishing is good with platinum so it might be a metal that works for you and because of the different ways white gold and platinum oxidize over time and show wear and tear stacking rings with a wedding ring should always be the same metal because they will look the same at first but over time that identical look will change as wear and tear happens because they don't wear at the same rate now aside from being hypoallergenic platinum is incredibly durable and it can last for generations making it a perfect heirloom piece in the United States every piece of platinum jewelry sold must carry a purity stamp the 950 plat on it indicates a 95% purity and 900 plat indicates a 90% period and in the US anything less than 90 percent pure platinum cannot be sold as platinum jewelry black gold is most commonly achieved by rhodium plating white gold rings in black rhodium with this color normally you're fully going for contrast with the diamond so the more colorless the diamond the better but even yellow diamonds will look very white in contrast if you get a black engagement it's not my cup of tea for both the original appearance but also it quickly looks really worn as any scratch will remove the plating layer to reveal the white gold below it two-toned rings are simply just combining two types of metal in your ring there are two main reasons for having a two-toned ring first you may just simply like the design and the appearance of a two-tone ring but second and most commonly is you may like the positive features of two different metal types or colors and you want to use the different properties of both to your benefit you may have actually thought of this already during my video you wish that you can have one property of one and one property of another the most common example of combining the benefits for a two-tone ring is if you like a yellow or rose gold ring but you go the prongs that go over the diamond to be colored because it takes away from the diamonds of white and bright appearance in this case you can add a white metal for the diamond setting or crown head and a colored metal for the band and you get that color contrast without it reflecting too much of the color from the band and the prongs through the diamond because those prongs are going to be a white metal instead of the colored metal that is in the rest of the engagement this is so desirable that the website I have linked to below uses this technique on a lot of their colored diamond rings now make sure you watch my video about different ring styles and my video on how to not get ripped off when looking for diamonds also you can watch my video on the tips to give you the best marriage proposal I would not miss that one either now special thanks to James Allen comm an online jewelry retailer who lent us a lot of the diamonds that were used in this video don't forget that link below

multiple pierced ears take a look at these stud earrings when you think about buying gold jewelry at this price tag i mean that's where you go no it no it's not it's gold-plated or no it's not no no it's 14 karat gold guys and these are strong and you choose and look at the prices anywhere from 36 and 80 cents to 69.80 you can choose polished or diamond cut so that's not the only choice though so here's the polish and the diamond cut and what we're calling the five millimeter i'm going to throw in my ruler so we can take a look at that and see that these are coming in at four payments of nine dollars and 20 cents and by the way of course they have a side profile and they've got oomph to them so you choose whether you want the five millimeter in polished or diamond cut for payments of 9.20 let me show you now the seven millimeter i'll scoot you over seven millimeter polished or diamond cut and that's on four payments of 13.45 and i'm gonna give you a little measurement there again so you can kind of see what seven millimeters is and then lastly nine millimeter this is the nine millimeter on four easy payments of 17.45 cents i'm gonna pop those in my ear for you and again in the high polish or in the diamond cutting but the nine millimeter i mean you're reaching to that south c pearl kind of a size i mean you're reaching at that half inch mark quarter inch mark sorry let me pull this up and i'm going to put i'm going to put i'll put one of these on for you i believe i'm going to be putting on the nine millimeter because that'd be how i roll um and standby that's tv talker hold on i had to learn that that is j3 here we go it's in come to mama yeah i put this one in my my second piercing oh i like that that's really big and bold look at that i mean i love this is the largest one that i have on and i did it in my second piercing that is really nice i love that you know what i love about and watch if i can get this shot right here you know what i love about it it's like an instant facelift when you put on a button okay watch this okay so i have a dangle and sometimes a dangle can pull you down when you do a stud and a button whoop do you see that it all just kind of goes right up as opposed to you know sometimes with that that's really really cool i'm going to leave that in so you have your choice in cut so you can do a high polish or you can do a diamond cutting and then you're going to choose your size maybe i'll go ahead and put another one on too because it would be nice to be a little bit straight up and normal as much as i can be this is again at a sale price and it's the only presentation of the day these are so simple they're so easy they're so affordable when my last show started the one on gems i did talk about having pieces that you know what maybe it's your time it's your that big anniversary it's that brand new grandbaby or your first child and there's no way to kind of strike a mark on that because the brick and mortar stores are closed and you're not quite sure who to trust online to buy something to memorialize it well you know what here we are at qvc and we have pieces here that are once in a lifetime purchases and then there are pieces that we have here that are more um you know kind of scratch that jewelry itch kind of a thing so having trouble i don't think i put anything in this second piercing in a

keep trying um imperial gold do you guys do we have this necklace for me to wear the imperial gold i didn't see it in my tray and i wanted to put it on", "lOPoOi2aEDM": "again in advance of our gold jewelry sell on Friday on that day you will see some knockout Wow superstar bold designer pieces and then you're gonna see the ones that we tuned in for because we know we need the stud earrings we know that we might need a rope necklace that might be a big value on the day I'm just saying from eternal these are the stud earrings that I think every actually girl and woman should have in her wardrobe first piercings second piercing maybe it's you know you're 12 years old starting out with brand-new earrings and Stacy Pearlman is brac to bring them to us only here's the thing we have them in high polish and diamond cut as well as a range of sizes so you can have that more petite look or a bold one all at the same time so one of the most affordable items you're gonna see in the entire show and probably on the day on Friday so 44 98 if you are going with the smallest of them that's gonna be your 5 millimeter but small does not mean forgettable or not noticeable we'll show you that in a second then we also have them available in the seven millimeter and that's gonna be 64 98 next up and you want to go big and bold that's the 9 millimeter and we have those at just 84 dollars and 98 cents so your easy paid will not exceed $14 and you can see you get your choice of diamond cut or high polish or because of that great easy pain maybe you're going with both Jay 3-6-5 993 Stacy it's great to have these I keep calling them like gold essentials because I feel like nine times out of 10 that's the kind of jewelry that we grab but the core essentials that we know will always look appropriate a great investment and will always work and really be timeless which is what I think we want when we're investing in our gold so you can see I am just enjoying I am doing the 5 millimeter good because I'm going back and then not like absolutely I'm doing two piercings and I have the high polish and the diamond cut for you to see so what I want to know is that these have all been hand diamond-cut and all hand high polish and I tell you that because you really need thick walls of gold in order to do that diamond cutting or the gold would just split if you went if you did not have thick walls of gold so really these are very full and they're robust so it's a way to do an earring that you can wear everyday that sits on the ear provides beautiful coverage sits up front and center which I love no pulling no hanging no drooping but gives you that everyday look and then if you've already have the high polish and you're looking for that little extra sparkle and radiance I love that we're offering it to you as well in the diamond cutting so I did a little shifter ooh here because I don't want to confuse anybody sorry I'm sorry for messing up what really was a beautiful process unconsciously I'm kind of utilitarian when it comes to this so I would love to just show you the three different sizes so these are the high polish in all three sizes five millimeter seven millimeter and nine millimeter and then if we come in obviously that's just the smooth and then in the diamond cut which I mean again I always say when it's a thousand dollars I'm not gonna say you should get three of them but if we have them this affordable and we have them in diamond cut maybe you get like the small in the diamond cut and the high polished in the larger size so there it is in the five and then oh I didn't reverse here's the seven and then there it is in the nine millimeter and look at the presence of that 9 millimeter I mean you could have real good you could've Wow look they're full its robust but not overpowering which is just that great in your core everyday essential it's also important I think that you do see them on me I just pop them on they're not heavy so they're not going to tilt down they're not gonna pitch forward in the ear but you still get credit for the gold and you don't even feel them in the ears but tell me day in and day out I mean everybody has a different job or lifestyle whatever but I think most days this is the kind of earring that you grab or maybe if it's that second piercing you get the smaller of them but it's a costume jewelry price tag that's what I love and by that I mean it's the kind of like oh that's cute jewelry I'll pick it up it's $45 and then a year from now you look at it it's like tarnished and you know or out of style gold is forever and this price though is like not just entry point for something that's kind of forgettable it's what most women would say well if I had to narrow down my jewelry collection to five pieces I keep the stud earrings that's right I mean truly we can reference back to the black heels you love your black pants you love the black dress you love that is what 14 karat gold studs do for you do you see that six easy pay that's the price that's the part that makes us ridiculous and most of you are going with the five millimeter which is the smallest of all of them but again the smallest and we'll see them on Stacy here in a second two does not meet because I've seen like stud earrings that look like they might actually get pulled in the ear piercing itself because they're so they look like they're newborn earrings right you know and I'm like if you love them and you can actually wear them without them disappearing but my piercings at the point where I could pull it out the other side they're so tiny but that five millimeter is still a presence in fact one that I think if you're the woman who goes you know I just don't wear a whole lot of jewelry this is the jewelry that you wear so I love for our cameras to show you our choices one more time remember this sale price expires soon this is brand-new today it's new today but it never goes out of style five millimeter seven millimeter nine millimeter and that's in the high polish also I've noticed that I touched mine a whole bunch of times and I don't even see like smudges of fingerprints just saying here's the diamond cut doing a little bit of sparkle looks like you dipped it in diamonds there's the five millimeter the seven millimeter and the nine but none of them have easy pace higher than $15 J three six five nine nine three all of them in the yellow gold to just let us know size and finish polish or diamond cut alright like you're really customizing your look exactly I love yeah I think you kind of need a couple because I never go to the same one over and over again so this is a tree", "JBRRxRmyUHk": "YOU ON LAST NIGHT OR SOMETHING?

might be just what do you love about these I love a design that always works mmm Tamiya ball stud is just a quintessential always appropriate piece of that statement that workhorse in your jewelry wardrobe I'm having fun with mine I have the today's special value in the one inch and in my second piercing I have the six millimeter just to show you a little bit of layered a little bit of you know a little bit thank you it looks really nice two iconic designs yeah I mean a hoop and a ball stud and we bring you these from Turkey here's what I love about these the presence is great no matter which size you get they do not get lost they sit up really nice and high and give beautiful coverage over your piercing which is important I think to me I like that when there's no pulling it really covers late then we give you I love these days here we go to the custom you know create your own jewelry wardrobe so now you have the sizes to choose from and the texture so a classic high polished beautiful ball stud is always perfect but look at the diamond cutting you think about the thick walls of gold that are needed to go into the gold with that precision tool to give it all that faceting that light explosion what you're seeing now on Blair is that you're seeing that high polished design look how elegant very beautiful finish just always classic always works could I have you put the diamond cutting in the other ear just for a moment so we can see both because sometimes you're wondering well I don't know which one should I get and the other thing I want to tell you is that the exact same manufacturer that made our today's special value earrings made these earrings and that's important to know about the quality because like you said the quality is so hot can you buy ball stud earrings elsewhere absolutely you can get them in the discount department store for a you know whatever kind of price and the question is will they be in 14 karat gold maybe not because a lot of those stores are not even selling 14 karat gold anymore but these are that's 58% pure gold and we will show you both the the polish and the diamond cut as well but these are gorgeous now I was going to say this though if you're gonna do it like in a second piercing or third piercing it's nice to have the six millimeter or the eight millimeter but if you're going for kind of like on its own kind of look go for that 10 millimeter because that one I mean it's $18 a month for five monthly payments and getting a nice bold look and so maybe I should put your veg sighs I love that they are robust yes they are they really really are and they just sit so well balanced you're gonna see even in the ten millimeter but you might think that's a large size you know do you see how perfectly balanced they sit how upright we're talking about how nice it is it that extra luxury touch when you see that extra-long post yeah all done in fort great Harry the host yes it sits up nice and high no pulling down nice and forward so good and balanced let me yeah I know what I have older last show and look it's it's nice hi Donald but anyway look at that though and you know what I find too that again going back to my grandson's is that a bear little they still like to grab at everything and so I can't wear hoops when I'm with them when I'm babysitting or hanging out with them so I put in a post or stud you know and that's just that's the ten millimeter size that's a great size to wear it really is so here's the thing I want to go back to all three sizes now my personal favorite what is the ten millimeter in the diamond cutting but I'm a diamond cut kind of girl this is six millimeter that's gonna run you ten dollars a month this is the 8 millimeter and you can see the size difference there that's gonna run you $13 a month on a credit card for five monthly payments this is the ten millimeter size and I love how you guys are shooting this thank you because you're getting the size you know to kind of you know compare them to each other and the ten millimeter which is the largest is $18 a month and you can choose the diamond cutting or the high polish and don't forget this is the only presentation of the day okay here's a quick update the diamond cut in the six millimeter right down here most popular two dozen remain oh my gosh so if you want these right here this is the one you've got to get right away in the diamond cut in the tan which is my favorite four dozen mein think about gifts for the holidays I mean this is where you buy them now this is our last big gold day of the year that's why you have to call now and get these the other thing is I always love to have some high polish studs on hand at home you know for well sometimes my daughter Elizabeth Jill called because my mom because she's got her own place down you shall say mom I lost an earring uh-huh okay what do you want what should I do well do you have any more so a lot of times when I see a real end I like her to wear gold because I don't want her to you know have any reactions or anything so I prefer her to have the gold but when I see a price like this at less than $50 for a six millimeter stud I mean put these away set them aside for your nieces your granddaughters your daughters your girlfriends whoever it might be and like I say you were saving from 12 to 22 dollars depending upon which size you order I'm gonna give you another update real quick here's what we have remaining comeback in the six millimeter polished only okay guess what watch this comeback what watch this the six millimeter only the polished remains and only a hundred remain in the eight millimeter both designs go oh good to go and in the ten millimeter polished only and how many eight dozen left you didn't get a chance earlier today well I'll put my name on a waitlist and by the way on that note if you miss out on anything today and you're like hats I wanted to get that put your name on a waitlist I think QVC will

actually 33% denser and heavier than white gold due to that reason due to the difference in densities platinum wears slower than 18 karat white gold I've got two pieces of metal here one is 18 karat white gold and the other one is platinum and when I hold it in my hand even they they are cut exactly the same size and length I can feel the difference between the two metals the platinum and my right is definitely lot heavier if you are making a pair of earrings we always advise that you go with white gold as it'll be lighter when you wear it in your ears rather than a heavy platinum earring if you weigh ring for example it is actually quite nice to have a little bit of an extra white in the ring because it feel you can feel the difference in the quality of the metals Platinum is 30 times more rare and less mind than gold so that's the first main reason for the price difference there's also a difference in the cost of manufacturing platinum due to the higher melting points of it will occur more manufacturing costs and therefore it's another reason of the higher price all white gold jewelry gets the coating on rhodium this coating is electroplated and they fall wears off over the years so if you go to our website and you look at all our white gold and platinum jewelry you will not be able to see the difference between platinum and white gold they look exactly the same due to the fact that white gold is rhodium plated so I hope this brief explanation between the difference between eighteen carat white gold and platinum has answered some of your questions about the two metals we will have some more videos that explain in more detail what the actual differences are between the different metals if you have any more questions you very welcome to book an appointment or

question, \"What is the difference between\n14 karat and 18 karat gold?\". And here we're talking karat with a K, and karat\nwith a K is how many parts out of 24 karat. Pure gold is 24 karat gold, and\nwhile it sounds like it would be wonderful to have a pure gold piece of\njewelry, the fact is you could scratch it with\nyour fingernail. You could just take a ring and bend it. It's very soft and\nmalleable. And so we alloy it with other metals meaning we we melt it and mix it\nwith other metals to make it stronger. So when you hear karat that's how many\nparts out of 24 karats. So 18 karat is 18 parts gold out of 24 karats. The other\nsix is another metal or combination of metals. 14 karat is 14 parts out of 24. 14\nparts gold out of 24. And similarly 12 and 10 karat are the same. They're 12\nkarats out of 24 and 10 karats out of 24. So 10 karat gold is actually more other\nmetals than it is gold. It is 10 parts gold and 14 parts other metals. So that\nis karats. Always when you hear karats with a k, think \"out of 24\". Now sometimes\nyou'll see 18 karat gold marked 750, and that's because the Europeans do it\ndifferently. They'll say 750 parts gold out of a thousand, and that's how they\nmark it. You might see a piece that's marked both. It could be 18 karat and 750,\nor it may just say 18k, or it may just say 750. And similarly 14 karat gold will\nbe marked 585 sometimes because it is 585 parts out of a thousand. So there you\ngo. That is the difference between 14 karat and 18 karat gold. If you have a\njewelry question, just ask me in the comments below.\nUntil next time!", "wjC1OK_kgYQ": "just restocked these crazy wedding bands si quality looks like vs swipe up now two years to pay it off only in stock in white gold yellow and rose is a delay swipe up now", "wtn4G_6B2uI": "hey that's how quantities become limited the more people see it the more people want it the more people buy it it's pretty pretty clear-cut now in this case we're talking about studs they're classic prong-set and again the moissanite quality it would be hard to get this quality at the sizes we're about to talk about without very very deep pockets so looking at our size options we have the one carat total weight so that's total so then in this case it would be half and half per ear then we have the two carat total weight so one carat per ear the three carat total weight one and a half per ear or the four carat total weight that's the largest two carats per ear and the price shifts depending on the size you're picking up so I'm gonna do a quick breakdown for you the four carat is obviously that's the largest price so $769 where would you get that I'll tell you a story in a bit but okay 153 dollars and 80 cents on five easy payments for the four carat total weight three carats 129 dollars and eighty cents on easy pay or six hundred forty nine dollars as a featured price two carats 80 980 $449 featured price or the one carat $249 less than $50 there on easy pay it is j3 five eight seven six five that's your item number all of these are set and 14 karat white gold but you know I went looking out in the mark again living in New York City diamond district blah blah 90% of the world's diamonds travel through this road and it was around the corner for me so I went and I looked and I said I would really like a pair of diamond stones everybody has them they're classics that's what I want yeah I don't have that kind of money like it was tens of thousands of dollars to start it started at ten thousand dollars the one that I was looking at and I said okay forget it give me the pave cut because I can't I can't do that just give me the look of now here you're getting the look of in better quality than what I was looking at for the price that I was quoted from my guy you know like it wasn't like just walked into a store the quality here is fantastic and I think when you wear something like this the cost I mean this becomes one of those things where whether you share or not that it's moissanite it's up to you because no one can tell no you'll get compliments on this there's so many people come up to my wife and say had beautiful diamond earrings she wears these every day to me this is this is the everyday this is the classic you talked about the hoops this is this is this is the staple you know and this is what I weigh to all my friends to get their waves and so on and so forth I really question why a person would spend the money on a pair of stud earrings as far as diamonds at this point it's it's just it's a lot of money whether you have it or not it just doesn't financially it really doesn't make sense and then you freak out if you lose it my sister-in-law lost one of hers at the grocery store in New York City you know you're not gonna have back no getting that back this one I mean it's still an investment it is but it's an investment because these are cut and treated the same way diamonds are you're getting that nearly quality nearly colorless quality so that's where that's coming from and it's still something that needs to be created we're recreating what the stars would normally do what the meteorites were normally do so we have to do all of that work and that's where that comes from but in comparison to anything else on the market that would fall within this line it's not an investment but it is depends on maybe Isis so just something to consider now you had mentioned your your daughter's where the studs are lying right all right you know it's when you want that special gift yeah a little something more than the norm this is just an awesome gift we gave a for my oldest daughter we gave her a pair for her graduation high school graduation you know and she wears she wears many different earrings but you know this is when she wants to go out she gets dressed up with her with her boyfriend so forth this is what she puts in and again you know all the kids that think you know they know they're her dad's in the diamond business they say wow you got diamond earrings already you know it yeah and big one and big ones too yeah I mean I I look at something like this and this it like you were saying it is classic whether it's somebody who's some kind of just starting off you know college high school graduation when you need a little something extra yeah you're going to job interviews you just want that classic polished look yep it's fantastic for that but on a more casual sense - I mean I would wear dime these kinds of moissanite studs with a t-shirt and a skirt at the Country Club and you know I just when you want to have that polished finishing touch and I think earrings in particular a great way to do it because they just bring all the light and everything right up to your face that's where I want people to focus yep and and what a nice way to to kind of sparkle that up let me remind you of the choices and then let's talk a little bit more okay the four carat that is my largest option so you're gonna have two carats per ear that one is the most popular and the most limited to get home the four carat you got a place your order first of all it's the only way it'll happen one hundred fifty three dollars and eighty cents to get home the four carat and remember this is the premiere show it's a top finds it will get more time later on in the day you're the early bird so you get first pick then we have the three carat one hundred twenty nine dollars and eighty cents there on the three carat so 1.5 per ear the two carat one carat per ear eighty nine dollars and eighty cents and the one carat half a carat per year forty nine dollars and eighty cents what an accent to have something like this and that's what I'm you know we said it earlier the entire show they're just classics yep boys a night is all about classic it really is because again it's its traditional round diamonds it's it's yeah you're gonna have a cushion up you know it's a it's just it's the staple it's the most popular shapes and and again the most popular styles it really is they are and I want to remind you that these are set in 14 karat white gold we are bringing you the best we've found in moissanite and bringing it of course in Gold j35 875 sorry J three five eight seven six five is your item number for those studs something else that we head on just moments ago the inside-out hoop earrings these are the ones that I'm wearing 1694 dollars 2.4 carats total weight", "zj2S_qDHolw": "others of the day what we call them our hot pics some of our favorite things and most importantly your favorite things you've told us in the past Italian gold it doesn't get any better than this because you're talking about traditions you're talking about family pride passed down from generation to generation we're gonna give you exactly what you want at a sale price all jewelry on sale all day long six easy paces are best easy paid plan on this or and on anytime the six easy pays means you'll get them home you decide whether you love them within the 30 days and the nice thing is then

job of going to all working with the designers going to all the factories she works with one of our largest suppliers of gold and gem and beautiful jewelry and has been for many many years so Patricia I'm gonna give everybody their options just know everything is made in Italy if we start here in the middle sizes first of all the half carat if you're looking for a closer to the ear more of a huggie style we've got it in polished or satin then the one carat is what I like to call your everyday everywhere earring this is six easy pace at $26.66 that's less than a dollar a day then the inch and a half and it always amazes me the size difference between the one inch and the inch and a half but it truly is that's how they it just looks different to me six easy pays at $40 if you're looking for those perfect spring/summer earrings that you can wear year-round but they just look so good you're gonna save 135 dollars on these they're a quarter of an inch wide so they're again not skinny they're beautiful they're Bombay but we'll before we discover that take a look over here and I'm going to go ahead and do it this way I'm gonna rearrange them just a little bit so that you could see the inch and a half highly polished or do you think that you would prefer something with that one fold diamond cutting and then once you decide that then you're gonna have to decide whether you want all yellow gold and these are Italian gold so it's 14 karat gold 14 karat white gold or 14 karat rose gold so you can be any more specific and you know you're like in this most magnificent jewelry store having an expert like British to help you and you get to choose oh I've always wanted those in white gold or I like them and highly polished a more highly polished or I like more of a diamond cutting you tell us what you like you to size you choose color and then you choose highly polished or that wonderful satiny twisted effect on that alright you know what to me this is the LBD of jewelry this is what every woman should own a pair of Italian earrings you choose the size the color absolutely and you know a lot of the time if you go to your you know high-end jeweler I would say are you even in New York you go to a jewelry store and you look for an earring like this from blue or these are male or you usually can only find them maybe a 1 you know one size one choice so what we do is we actually cut out all the middlemen we go straight to blue or oh they are able to give us the world's best tubed earrings this is a D tubing it is fully fat fully finished side and finished fully polished and you are getting the best quality now a woman like you said the first thing always looking is a woman's face you know we always take care of her hair you know our skin what's the next thing that you want to do is you want to wear a pair of earrings that like I say work sometimes better than a good moisturizer cuz it was gonna be like it's gonna reflect the light it's gonna give you that you know that the highly polished yeah they were a definite that highly polished that what that's going to do your face the light is going to shine off is gonna do wonders and take years off eyes I always say that and the Italians really do do it fast yes blue Oro is a factory that's known around the world recognized for their tubing and that's what you would make bangles out of that's what you make earrings out of so here's our update John remind me the one-and-a-half inch polished yellow a few dozen remaining and then it is gone so make sure you are picking these up because you're talking about saving 135 dollars in the inch and a half saving $90 in the one inch the half inch you're going to save $69 and you can get them home and see what they're like for $18.33 these are timeless generation after generation as far as women wave worn hoop earrings absolutely and really when you you get them and you look at them you see the high-end finishing of it but what's really great is they give you large impact they give you the you know the most out of your gold you're getting 14 karat gold I want to stress this this is not plated a lot of the time even jewelry of when it is sterling silver and plated in gold it will cost the same amount you're getting solid 14 karat gold from Italy the design is is done in Italy the quality down to the quality controls everything the whole process is done in a country that is known for their standard of gold and you're also getting these done at a factory that is world renowned and the best in this style of earrings this doesn't get any better than this you know what I love about this is the detail on it and we'll take a look at this so everybody has their own recipe of gold every well exactly so here we see the gold being melted this all done in the blue our Factory here we see those sheets of metal that are being flattened out you know this is a really specialty machine and this really takes a high-end art isn't to do it here you see that tubing coming out and here we see that beautiful finishing that sat in that twist tube coming in then we have the wire that it's pulled around that gold is looped around to make those hoops depending on the size then we see we have those all cut they are then this is very important and I keep on forgetting to mention so we bake them at a certain temperature to make sure that they harden now this is really important because gold in general will get harder with time so if you were to get gold just straight off it's going to be soft it could tend to bent so yeah we have a specialty process that we put the hoops through that bakes it at a special temperature first starting high and that goes lower and lower and lower that actually mimics the time process that it would take for the goal to get harder say if you had them for a hundred years so this is really important so you know when you go like this you're not gonna bend the gold that is the blur standard of you know approval that is the quality that we make sure that we bring you these so not only are you getting beautiful comfortable earrings you're getting 14 carat solid gold made in Italy you're getting pieces that are gonna last you a lifetime and that's the beauty that's why you go and invest in something like this I also want to point out some other little details on that and one is the contoured wire and the length of the contoured wire many times a manufacturer will go ahead and cut it off to the quick right there where it's going to click down we don't allow that so if you are someone who is worried about the length of the bar look how much extra you get you can see why they would cut it to the quick because then they would have to give you less gold but we don't allow that the other thing that the Italians do so beautifully is they execute where they put that contoured wire and snap bar so that you really have a continuous look of a hoop all the way around the hoop has to the wall of the hoop on this has to be a certain thickness to be able to create a design like this talk to me a little bit about what the design is Patricia so what we have here is we give you the option of getting both the attention and detail of the satin finish that's done by hand and the just the position of that high polish you know it's really beautifully giving you two finishes that all done by hand set into the grooves and then you're getting also that goal that high polish and from the inside coming out from that D tubing I love how you we're showing the class than how it goes down further what I want to point out too is I could hear that when you are putting that clasp down I could hear that from right over here and that is telling you something then not only are you getting beautiful longer post that you are getting more gold we don't cut out that little piece that actually in the long run does make a difference you're also getting really amazing quality control over here look at that is sticking there that is how you know this is look at that quality and I wish I killed even closer to my mic so you could actually hear it at home it is real attention to detail this is our standard of approval this is our you know grade a quality and that's why blue aural is one of the world's most renowned on places factories in the world that creates these earrings so let's remind you what you're going to have you're gonna have a choice of size the half carat huggy hoops very very popular and now I think particularly when you do it in the highly polished you're talking about an earring you could very easily wear maybe even and you know if you have more than one hole here's the one inch size to me particularly in this highly polished look somebody's graduating and going out into the world if you've never really truly had Italian gold earrings these are less than a dollar a day per month and then the inch and a half if you want those larger beautiful earrings go ahead and pick them up and get them on our best ez pay plan they're $40 a month that's two $20 bills and you choose your color do you like white gold do you want rose gold do you want the traditions of yellow gold you tell us J three five six four seven five well over 1000 of you have already purchased yours the one and a half inch polished yellow gold three dozen remain and then that sold out the rose and the polish one and a half inch also very very popular jig three five six four seven five all right and just a heads up coming up in just a little bit we're gonna have the or pause sterling silver half

really all it means it's still a heavy chain it weighs about twenty four point four grams it's 26 inches long six millimeters it's coming right out of the diamond district but its original a place of manufacturing is actually Italy we get these chains from Italy this one I particularly like you could fit it over your head real easy if you want to where it hangs down you can hang a piece on it pretty simply so if you're looking at this particular chain I highly recommend it I'm a big fan of this one it's 14 karat you always get your gold weight in it so when you spend your money on it after several years it's gonna pay for itself as far as its appreciation is concerned so what does that mean that basically means that you'll be able to melt it down and get all your money out and they'll the reason why I'm working on these gold chains that I'm explaining this fact is I've had this experience personally I bought this little franco when gold was about $700 an ounce and up to this point it cost me about negative $400 so basically if I melt this chain now I've been wearing it for for over ten years but if I melt it down now I'll be able to turn a profit I'm wearing it and that's a very rare product that's not something you're gonna get with anything else so if you're looking at this chain lay it away it's highly recommended here tracks and I see in the diamond district only from us and we got 200%", "tXxH7vuU6oY": "take a look at what's in front of me about dominique it's the world's finest diamond stimulant it is our proprietary brand of diamond simulation but also they simulate more than just diamonds they also do simulated gemstones which is what you see in front of me and why you know when you take a look at what you see here all this beautiful color the size which this is almost a half a carat of just the simulated diamonds alone and then you would have different color fancy color diamonds the price would be really really high if it were the real thing so i love dominique i wear dominique as my wedding set i'm obsessed because nobody knows that but you now normally we shop for maybe gold clad maybe we do sterling silver but diamonique does special things and special moments they take to do 14 karat gold these huggy hoops are 14 karat gold with diamonique so there's not clad there's no plating this is actually 14 karat gold through and through with those beautiful rainbow diamonique stones this is brand new today it is a beautiful little huggy style which is my like favorite kind of earring of the moment i just think it's nice because it's kind of how we are living our lives more casually adding that beautiful color around your face whether you want to do the first hole i have a second piercing you could do it there you could do it if you have a third piercing as well it's on sale brand new you're saving forty five dollars launching on a big day forty five dollars on easy pay and shipping for free which isn't always the case within the collection so that's a nice five dollars and fifty cents back in your pocket you have your choice though do you want what a day is rocking the yellow 14 karat gold which we're much more limited in or do you want it in the 14 carat white gold i know a lot of diamond need collectors this is that white gold like to pick up the 14 karat white gold because they wear more sterling silver or maybe their wedding set is in white gold or platinum and they want it to match and i also think the stones shine in a little bit of a different way in both settings so there's that white gold up close and you'll see how you know the rainbow comes through in a different sort of way and then next to it and i just pop one in my ear as well that is your 14 carat yellow gold really buttery really pretty this is easy peasy as well for your in and out this is my favorite because i'm always putting earrings on by myself obviously what's nice about it is you just undo it and then when you push it you'll hear that little pop that lets you know it's nice and secure in place and then you just pull it apart when you're ready to take them out look at that gorgeous color so i just popped one in as well to show it's a little bit but because of the added color i think it's enough of that little statement that you want to make whether you're wearing a t-shirt and jeans or a dress maybe you're taking it to date night these are every day these because they are 14 karat gold it's the kind of thing where you'll like forget that you're wearing them because they're so comfortable until someone compliments you or until you see yourself you know getting ready in the mirror the roots of dominique are major i mean this brand is super popular but i didn't realize this at first when they launched they only had 14 karat gold that was their first like the first thing they ever did so if you're a true collector these are brand new j367427 we have a few dozen left in that yellow gold so don't wait and we

affinity expert and so I'm wearing this earring and I'm going to switch out so that you can see a few sizes here in a second but I want you to just look at the impact that you're getting here that looks like four and a half carats of diamonds in my ear in one ear that's the look you're getting here but the reality is in the size that I have on right now you're only paying for one carat look of nine total but you're only paying for one we also have the half carat available in this stud and then a choice of shapes so I have the round on we have it in cushion in 14 karat yellow gold or 14 karat white gold this is my pick because it doesn't get much better than stud but the reason that so many women who want them but don't get them is because it costs a lot to get a beautiful stud home but because of the way the diamonds are set here you get the look you want at a far better price so the half carat size whether you're choosing the round or the cushion is now at a clearance price of 399 96 on easy pay for just $66.66 those are a hundred and forty nine dollars off the QVC price making them the equivalent of a today's special value I'm glad that that popped up on the screen right now because that's the balance of perfectly aligned exactly okay and then the one carat size seven ninety nine ninety six and then on easy pay for 13333 those are two hundred and ninety nine dollars off the QVC price and if you want more than six months you'd rather have nine we do have special financing available on these stud earrings if you're using your cue card so Jose as I slip into I'm gonna find the half carat size here would you please explain what's happening with the look like what are we getting exactly but then what are we getting the look of when we're talking about the half carat here that we're going to show you and I'm gonna have Mary show you one and one and same with kinesia so I think khadija is gonna be wearing the cushion and Mary is gonna be wearing the half because we want you to see the scale of them this is a half carat that we're looking at here but that Center cluster is one the look of 1.2 and a total of 4 so this would be like looking at two carats in each year this would be thousands of dollars for you to get at home we've worked with the very best the largest manufacturer of diamonds in the world to give you a composite setting where all of those diamonds are so closely set together that it looks as one but when I was speaking with her route he also wanted it route is the designer who has worked with let's say I'm gonna say it this way on 57th Street and Fifth Avenue there are three of the largest most renowned jewelry houses in the world he has designed for two of them so we're not getting designer like diamonds we're getting designer diamonds babies I was just showing you like you didn't have to come in close to see these earrings know that it makes it it's a two-carat presence on the ear in the half carat size so you just saw the round on me let's take a look at the half carat on kinesia did you do the half and the one as well awesome so you'll see here the way they look and maybe that'll help you decide if you're on the fence and you're wondering or maybe you already know you know that that other look would be more wearable for you or you want the most impressive statement possible correct then you'll go with the one carat size well I love that we're looking at we're looking at Khadijah and value hello some of the but you're looking at Canisius a guys can we go back to Kadena for one second I'm sorry we got all distracted by the gum mazing price look at all of the hair on Khadijah but that is where the half carat is so that is the fire that is the presence that you're getting on that diamond that's the half carat and then the other ear where the hair is swept away is the one carat that looks like four and a half carats on that one ear so this is your upgrade this is and you know what I do believe in recycling so you perhaps take that earring that you've been wearing and you give it to your daughter or your granddaughter and you do a little upgrade the the rel I'm not thinking about anybody but myself one for them one for you honest and hard I you know what I would do and this is this is crazy me with my the round half is the most popular right now yes and it always has been in the past I would crazytown me would get that round half pay that off right away get the one carat and put that on easy pay because you are completing your entire stud selection for your wardrobe forever this is the round in the half carat I know it seems huge no it's that's a half carat total but it does it looks like two carats in each ear in each ear that's what the look is but yet you're not spending thousands of dollars remember this size whether you want the white gold or the yellow gold whether you're choosing the round or the cushion the half carat size is on easy pay for $64.99 and then if we could look at the one carat choice and what did you say the sort of the earlobe impact is on that one on the one carat yes would be for also for the half and nine for the one carat weight okay so if you're getting the one karat earring it looks like a total of nine all right so it's four and a half carat per year and I can show you remember same choice is still available at a clearance price is so exciting that we still have all of these options for you at a clearance price because often that's not the case so if you want to be able to see the the larger size that one carat size I have it in this ear she's going to close up so she can do because I think scale is really a member so close up that she's uncomfortable so that's the one carat that looks like four and a half per ear and we're gonna switch you could look towards me and that's the half carat that looks like two carats per ear so you get a better sense of scale it's hard I know it's hard to see it on the boat for I'm gonna do EasyPay $64.99 or 131 66 that is crazytown in the round but remember we've got the same carat weight in cushion I'm wearing the white gold we have yellow gold available across the board as well it's just so many options a beautiful classic piece and so if you are investing in diamonds we have these exciting fashionable pieces playful pieces that we can bring to you through affinity and Jose but sometimes you just want a classic you want something that you know you can wear every day anywhere and not feel like you're restricted in the least like white diamond studs I can't think of any occasion where these would not be appropriate whether it be a party a job interview work I mean Church these are these are that piece that you go to all the time and they're so impressive you'll be proud to wear them and that's one of the reasons why I love affinity you know sometimes when you find diamonds on sale you're like I mean I I kind of like it but I don't love it I don't know that if my girlfriend's grabbed it that I would want them to look really close at those diamonds please you want everybody to see them you're gonna be so proud and you'll own them for many years I'm sure on six easy payments in the half carat size at 66 66 the one carat size 13333 but with nine months special financing it gets even better in white and yellow gold in the round or the cushion and those are your options in my pick of a show J three five five zero three seven is a good pick Thanks", "qI_cWK9yNmI": "fine diamond jewelry from the diamond store only the finest

is sarolta blessing and the goldsmith and designer for barrels jewelers all gold that comes from the earth is a really rich yellow color we then have to harden it to be strong enough to wear as jewelry 18 karat has got a 75 percent purity and 25 percent other alloys so if you wanted yellow gold then you you'll mix it with a bit of copper and a bit of brass and a bit of silver with white gold it is palladium that's added to create 75 percent purity we keep the metal separate so when you cost yellow you'll always use your yellow crucible when you cost white to always cost with your 18 karat white gold yellow will always leave a slight tinge in the metal and therefore all white gold jewellery will have a rhodium coating the properties are virtually the same the same malleability they've got the same hardeners they melt roughly at the same temperature [Music] just in the alleyway that's added to the white gold quite often the best alloy to use as palladium so when that's mixed together with the gold it does increase the melting they will be a difference in price due to the alloy of palladium that's added to the gold to make it white due to the fluctuating price of palladium that could have quite a big impact on the price of 18 karat white gold the copper or the brass that's added is quite low it doesn't really have much of an impact to the to the cost of 18 karat yellow gold I think lady M has always had an a higher value yellow gold all it needs is to be cleaned and polished every now and again that never gets any any plating or coatings added to it it's difficult to say how regularly you have to have your white gold radium plated we have people that want to have it done every six months which we don't really recommend we do also have a lot of people that actually quite like the warmer feel of a natural white gold [Music] so we have 18 karat white gold unpolished and 18 karat yellow gold unpublished I personally like the yellow and I have 22 karat yellow gold metal I just like the pure gold then their warmth of the cut so this is quite a popular width for a Jane's wedding band normally anything between 3 and 6 millimeters is probably our my son regularly sold with so that is just about four and a half millimeters wide once you've decided on yellow gold jewelry or white gold jewelry you will you will normally stick to that that color the only time that we would use a little bit of both is when they are diamonds or other precious stones involved in the design most commonly stones are mounted in a white gold setting with perhaps a yellow gold band you'll quite often see emeralds or rubies are accompanied with yellow gold if you are intrigued by the different alloys and the different metals please come and see me here and Barros and I will be very happy to get some raw materials out to show you what the exact difference in colors are please click the link below to come and speak to me [Music]", "3nTN8R1C_DU": "legacy is jewelry is it not yeah you know which is a wonderful family legacy to grow up and yes it really my love of jewelry came from my grandma Doris she had the longest-running boutique in the Waldorf Astoria in New York City the longest-running jewelry boutique 53 years plus her in any free moment I had that's where I was living I mean that's my whole world was jewelry and then I married into a whole jewelry family generations and generations of jewelers so I mean what a great way to start your finally legacy that's why Stacey is with us with our beautiful gold and I was telling her I'm so predictable but when the buyers say to me do you want to pick something for a gold day it's always a choice of Hoops because Rick Domeier put me on the spot one time and he said why do women like hoops and I'm like and I said well I think because younger women feel more sophisticated in hoops okay and older women feel a little bit younger and hipper in hoops and I said I just made that up on the spur of the moment but I think it's true so good i 100% so what we have now is the Goldilocks the perfect is something for everybody and it's lots of choices so you're gonna choose high polished or twist you can also choose whether you want 14 karat yellow gold or the beautiful white hoops so your sizes are gonna be one inch one and a half inches or two inches and we're gonna play with these there you see in the yellow gold in the high polish we just popped right next to it one of the twists so that you can see again if with this EasyPay oh my gosh I mean the smallest ones are nineteen dollars and eighty three cents a month on easy pay up to the boldest and shipping and handling is free you may want to do your hoop wardrobe today then we go over to the icy white metal more reflective than yellow gold and all the sizes are available you're gonna choose those again in your choice of the high polished or the twist so I think this is a kind of more than one moment I really do yeah I really do let me see what's in your ear and what did you pick so I went for what I call the Goldilocks okay so we have one we have one and a half we have two inches for me I like a little bit of a bolder earring but then or did I two different sometimes I do two different sizes I want to see that do that okay so if you want to go to the biggest and then you also want to see I think I might have the one inch in yep I have the one inch and I have the two inch just so that you can see the difference and wait let's look at beautiful Stacy while I give this in my ear because in the minute I know I am indecisive James yo to me well I go right in the middle right because sometimes I feel I like a little more presence I wanted to do something different I tend towards small I think I'm petite I don't always go for the boldest cuff so that this to me is the perfect hoop because it gives me a lot of presence and I wanted to do it in the classic polished but I love that you did the texture right I mean if you have if you're a hoop collector and you have a lot of that classic look Jane's look with the texture though it's diamond cut extra Sparkle extra shine and that texture just really elevates it well here is our beautiful Monica and she's actually now wearing the only options right Bry in the two inch okay so the two inch is completely sold out in both yellow gold choices in the white we have it three dozen in the Polish and three dozen in the texture or the twisted so what Monica is wearing is the twisted version of the white gold so if you want the big in the bold that's the only one that we have now I'm gonna put the one inch on one side and the one on the half inch on the other because I'm with you Stacy I really love the one and a half inch I really call it the Goldilocks it's not too big it's not too small it's just right and is wearing the one and a half in the smooth yellow gold and all of this is brand-new all of this is a one-day only price item so I mean you're getting beautiful 14 karat gold hoops and you know these are the the hoops that aren't too big in terms of their width so if you want to go bigger in terms of the diameter like in the yellow gold maybe the one and a half it's not what you normally wear but you want to try it and then you put it on easy pay and then Stacy these prices these are going up at the end of the day so this is a don't wait moment I mean we're in the grand finale we only have a few was left and if you want to pick these up on that beautiful one-day only price item do it so I felt Stacy it was gonna do it if you have to decide here's a one inch so I look at this one inch and I think it's kind of like you know go to the office or like do you like to wear turtlenecks you know you don't want a hope to sit on that so those little neck so that's a nice way to go and then there's the one and a half inch which is a little bit sassy and a little bit more heading out because I don't be right and I love them both I'm the worst that this is because I really can appreciate both of them the other one to me like you said it's classic it's almost like tailored it really just you know works I like a little more bolder on you I think it's funky and fun and especially with that texture you get a lot of look right without being too bold and too overpowering and there never ever ever ever going out of style these are timeless classic I mean and comfortable they're made in Italy we don't want them pulling your ear hanging these are weightless to me and just like we said the diameter beautiful it's a little over a sixteenth of an inch so don't be afraid to go a little bolder but maybe you just need those I call them the bedside earrings you know how you'd like you get in bed at night you say oh I still have my favorite bracelet on yes and then I always put it in a little Lord Grenier jewelry box that sits next to my bed so I have to remember to put the right size back on it so if you're somebody that's looking at these earrings and thinking but I want something I'm going to wear every single day I think that one inch and whatever color or texture you choose would be perfect to be that kind of back to school good boring day agree yes or if you're getting it for a gift you know and maybe for a niece or someone who's starting their jewelry collection you want to introduce to it I think that one it is very special it look at that I mean I just think that that gives you so much presents you really can't go wrong you have to think about what look you're going for what's going to work for you but you know you're getting comfortable Italian beautiful gold earrings and I just love that we've given it to you in the polished or the twisted right so here's what we've got for you in the yellow gold we have two sizes now and two choices so we have the smooth that you see on an in the one and the one and a half inch and then we have the twisted that you saw on me and that you saw on Monica in the yellow and the white gold also just in the one and the one and a half the two inch is completely sold out if you want the white that's available in all three sizes but the largest is super limited and you know Stacy is going to be back with me throughout the show but this is the only choice of Hoops we have for the whole night yes is it this is it there's no more hoops and choice of sizes or choice of colors so if you're interested in these don't wait because they're gorgeous they are gorgeous this is I mean easy choice you're looking for hoops here they are all ready for you and then Stacy is gonna be back in just a little bit with this beautiful eternal gold bangle it's the only eternal gold we have in the finale it is your choice of white or yellow gold and the cool thing is is we also have your choice of patterns in that gold so if you're somebody that's saying you know I want high polished or I want that beautiful stark cut or I want a different texture guess what again we got it sale price 298 to 339 for an eternal gold bangle and I couldn't decide so I went for all four yes arm load of bangles Jack Mosley is here we'll try not to get into too much trouble which is always

me what metal should I use to set my my radar my piece of jewelry and there's a few questions to ask when deciding what mail you should use to set your ring the first is what color do have enough demand to be broadly the colors that most people set jewelry in are white yellow and rose so you can get gold in either yellow color white color or rose color and then if you if you're thinking of white you have the other option of platinum so if you're looking at yellow or rose your decision is simple right you want either yellow gold or rose gold if you're looking at white how do you decide on white gold versus platinum what's the difference between the white gold and black well the skips a little bit into metallurgy so bear with me if you look up white gold on the periodic table of elements you will observe that it doesn't exist there's no such thing as white gold gold is yellow there's only one kind of gold in the world gold is yellow we all know what gold looks like so how do we make white gold well 24 karat gold is pure gold right so that's purely yellow all the time you will never have another color of gold in 24 carat purity designs yellow you can't really use 24 karat gold to make a ring with anyway because it's too soft to set of stone in you may have seen in like old western movies where the prospector comes with gold out of the mountains and the guy in town bites on it to see if it's real Laphroaig pays the guy for it well the reason that they do that is because pure gold 24 karat gold is so soft and you can actually bend it with your teeth and deform it with your teeth well that means it's too soft to hold a diamond and as soon as you not get against a desk or a doorknob or what-have-you it's going to bend in your diamond to Nepal now so we never use 24 karat gold for setting stones what we do use typically is let's say 18 karat gold sometimes 14 karat but let's say 18 karat well if 24 karat gold is pure gold that must mean the 18 karat gold is 75% gold and 25% something else so when we're making 18 karat white gold we use something really white for something else like cadmium or nickel and that makes it much whiter than pure 24-karat but it still doesn't make it pure white it's still a little bit yellowish so how do we get it to that pure white that you see when you look at a white gold rim we electroplated we cover it in a very very thin layer of another medical rhodium rhodium is a very white very brittle very hard metal that's uh it's actually too brittle and it brings out it because you can kind of break it but it works great for covering gold and we cover it in this layer of rhodium which think of it like the candy shell on an M&M and so that's how you get that very very white white gold but when you wear a ring made with white gold all the time you're touching doorknobs and desks and steering wheels and living your life and interacting with the world that thin layer of rhodium will eventually wear off and the yellowish gold underneath will start to show through now that's no big deal you can take it back to your jeweler and have it recode it read it's in the rhodium and make it good as new again and you can do that as many times in your life as you'd like without ever damaging your ring but there's that maintenance of color that you have to do with white gold now platinum on the other hand is naturally that bright white color all the way through so yellowing will never happen to the Platinum Lang right so if you put a white gold ring and a platinum right next to each other and they're both brand new they would look identical but after a year of wear the white gold ring will be a little bit yellowish and the platinum will still be pure white however platinum is also softer than white gold so that means that as you're interacting with the world and touching things and holding things and grabbing things the platinum will scratch up pretty easily and it will very quickly develop a pattern of dings and dents and scuffs and scratches now that's called a patina and many many people affect most people who wear platinum rings besides they love that 59 I think it gives the rims character I think of it like you know the rings on the edge of a tree they think it's a unique fingerprint to their ring and they think it's cool so they never want to change it but if you're not one of those people if you like your platinum looking shining and new you can get it polished back to that original exterior and you can do that as often as you like without damaging the ring so there's that maintenance you might have to consider doing so when you're deciding between white gold and platinum you basically have to decide what I prefer to do maintenance on color or whatever furthers your maintenance on scratches it's kind of a similar consideration either way now platinum is slightly more expensive than my gold but today's market price if that difference isn't it terribly significant so I don't think this is really a financial decision so much as a personal preference decision and you've got to decide for yourself what is more applicable or appropriate to your lifestyle so I hope that answered the question if it's not 100 percent clear you feel free to comment down there and I'll get to you as quickly as I can or you can find me on Facebook Instagram at

years in the business this is dan", "vTzPmyjv1BU": "so something kind of crazy happened missouri ended up sending me all of these pieces and we're gonna go through them hey guys welcome back to my channel i am so excited for today's video like i cannot even express you guys how excited i am for today's video we are going to be opening up like 20 to 30 pieces of missouri jewelry all new pieces stuff that i have never shown here on my channel before basically really really exciting news i am going to be doing a video partnership with missouri over on their channel where i'm gonna be like styling up three different looks using all measuring pieces and so they sent over like almost all of their collections so that i can use those pieces for that collab video i'm gonna be sending most of these back so sadly i do not get to keep everything that is in this box but i asked them if i could film an unboxing video for you guys here on my channel because how often do you get sent just a box of mystery stuff like it never happens so i was like please please please let me film a video for my channel since you're sending all this stuff over i would love to share with my subscribers and they were kind enough to let me film a video using all the stuff that they sent over so yes i don't get to keep it all i have to send most of it back but i wanted to unbox it with y'all and just show you guys what the jewelry looks like i am so honored that they have chosen me to do a video collab so i think by the time that this video goes up the collab should be up as well so i will link that video down below and you should definitely go to their youtube channel and see our collab video i'm really excited to work on that it is honestly such an honor and such a dream i have been wearing missouri for years and it truly is like a dream of mine to work with them i mean literally all of the jewelry that i'm constantly wearing is from missouri so if you guys are new to my channel though i will link my other missouri videos down below i have a majority collection video showing you guys all the pieces that i currently own and then i also have an unboxing of all of the croissant pieces i also have a discount code that i will link down below where you can get 10 off of your order but let's just go ahead and start opening all the stuff up because i have a feeling that there's a lot okay so we're gonna start with the large box first and this is one of their jewelry boxes i've actually never seen one of these in person but it's actually really really heavy i was thinking it was going to be kind of like a lighter more like travel friendly jewelry box but this is actually like pretty substantial this is the jewelry box that i'm going to be putting all this jewelry in for the video so that it's very on brand with missouri but how pretty is this jewelry box and then it has a clasp here that you open up and it says missouri on the inside and then there are multiple trays this is like honestly such a nice box and then there's another another section so you have so many organizational sections and i'm probably going to place the jewelry in these as i open them up because i need to keep it organized because i did take a sneak peek into one of the boxes and there are some really really tiny dainty pieces that i cannot lose like i said i have to send them back so i cannot lose these pieces so as i open them i need to put them in the jewelry box and that's how they're going to be displayed for the actual video that i'm doing with them so anyway long story short jewelry box is so nice okay let's just start with this first box right here you guys have seen me unbox missouri before if you've been with my channel if you haven't i go through all the contents of the boxes in previous videos but i i'm just gonna rapid fire i think the ones that are in these boxes are the pieces that i am being gifted so i'm gonna start with these so i can keep it all organized this first piece is there i think this is their solid gold dome ring i really like the missouri solid gold pieces because fun fact i never ever take my jewelry off like i never take these out i never take my necklaces off my dainty bracelets i try to never remove and so i wanted to get a lot of pieces that would just be really great to keep on and never to worry about lotion or anything like that so ah i love it this is the dome ring the thin dome ring like i said this one i believe is the 14 karat gold and it's just the most petite pretty ring i love it on that finger and then i think also it will fit yes it will fit this finger as well so i can wear it on this finger oh i i think that's so pretty i mean a dome ring is like such a classic timeless piece i am obsessed with that i really like it on this finger that is gorgeous first piece love next piece another box and i'm making sure that there's not like doubles in these because i do not want to lose any next piece in here this i think is a necklace yes so this is their curb chain necklace and i'm gonna be wearing this one like non-stop i honestly might switch this out and wear this one like permanently i've got on what do i have on right now they're diamond pendant with the letter j for jason my husband that i have on the i think this is called the boyfriend chain which is solid gold and then i have on the i think this is the bull spheres necklace and then this is the bold spheres choker i believe i think those are the ones i have on like i said i have not taken these off since the moment i got them but i might be taking them off to add in this beauty oh my gosh i love this okay i didn't want to get this wrong so i actually looked it up this is the double curb chain necklace which is a vermeil piece so this is not the 14 karat gold which i did look at it and i was like it is really really gold for 14 karat but this is the vermeil so it's a little bit more of a yellow gold but still so gorgeous i'm gonna love wearing that okay so this is a dome ring and this one this one actually came with a little pamphlet so this is a 14 carat solid gold dome ring inspired by the iconic golden gate bridge this one is a like textured dome ring so this one right here has all these ridges in it which are so so cool really really pretty i have all of the missouri rings on this is the duo ring which i wear all the time i like never take it off beautiful next we've got oh these are called the charlotte bold hoops really really pretty and these ones are vermeil i love that texture honestly would be so cute as like a second as well you guys will see me like style up all these pieces over on the missouri collab video okay next so this is a diamond band this is the diamond band super super thin super dainty just really really pretty oh that is just like the most dainty beautiful like stacker ring guys i'm like all decked out right now i'm just keeping it all on okay next up we have a different style box here i really am like how in the world am i going to package all this up and send back but i am supposed to take everything out of the boxes because it's all supposed to be in this like missouri jewelry box for the collab video so i'm like how am i going to figure out how to get everything back in i'm honestly not sure just we'll see what happens but this oh guys i've been wanting one of these for so long this is the herringbone necklace in gold this is a vermeil piece and it's just gorgeous i've been wanting one of these next up we have this is the i think this is called the flat curb chain necklace or is this the curb chain necklace they have a couple different styles of curb chain necklaces and i'm trying to do my absolute best here it looks like a flat curve it's obviously 14 karat gold it's solid gold i can just tell by looking at it it's a lighter gold so it is it's not vermeil so that eliminates which we already unboxed the double curve chain so it can't be that so this has to be either the curb chain which is solid gold or the flat curb chain which i believe that there is something called the flat curb chain unless i'm mistaken yeah there is a flat curved chain so is this the flat curve chain or the curved chain but it's beautiful it is beautiful look at how just dainty and pretty that is with all my rings on that's gorgeous so this is the difference also you guys can see the difference between the vermeil and the solid gold for may is the thicker chain solid gold is the lighter chain that's less yellow this one this one right here is the solid gold this is the vermeil you can see the difference in the chains but i mean both are so pretty their vermeil ones are actually gorgeous because they have that little bit more of a yellow tint next up what is in here i don't know how i'm gonna package this okay now we have is this another chain necklace no this is the bracelet okay so this is the curb chain bracelet so pretty so this must be just the regular curb chain and not the not the flat curb chain but that is the bracelet really really dainty so this is the herringbone necklace in silver and i die i'm not a big silver girl but i actually love this like so much like this with the gold it's so pretty like imagine that like layered up together i really really really like that so those are just both so beautiful then we have the bracelet and this is the bracelet again it is beautiful i've never seen so much beautiful jewelry all at one time it's very overwhelming okay what do we have next so these are called the enamel earrings and these are really really pretty i think this is one of their newer launches so unique i think they'd be so cute with like a second as well this ring is called the enamel dome ring another beautiful dome ring look how unique that is that is stunning oh my gosh i've never been one for like enamel rings i've got to be totally honest but that is just eye-catching like so unique so just like different i love i actually love that guys catch me styling up an enamel ring on the missouri channel i i don't know what i'm gonna use because i also have like all of my like actual missouri pieces that i own and i'm like how am i gonna choose just three looks i can make hundreds of looks different looks i feel like using all of these this one's actually a little bit big on me but you guys can get an idea of it it is so chunky when it says chunky it means chunky how fun is that though like a very just bold ring probably wouldn't wear it with the duo ring but i really love that super fun seeing all the different types of bold rings i would never wear all these together probably but very very cool next up is is this a necklace how praise this so this is like the i think it's called the sapphire trio necklace and correct me if i am wrong i'll put it down in the description when it's actually called but look how pretty that is i don't know how close i can get it to y'all without it getting blurry but gorgeous and i believe this is the 14 karat gold chain but i love that there is like a square a rectangle and a round stone so like very geometric very unique so i really love that i'm gonna hopefully do not get tangled okay guys we have a we have a lot more oh my gosh this might be like the longest video i've ever filmed so these are the sculptural hoops and these guys are so so pretty i love these these are vermeil so they are not solid gold but how pretty are these so unique so pretty i love those those are gonna be gorgeous those are so beautiful i love those i don't know where to put them but i love them okay next i have this in the bracelet form and i absolutely love it this is a vermeil piece really fun necklace if you're looking for something very bold same with the bracelet like same exact chain just in bracelet form super fun for layering very bold so gorgeous i love that actually i really like it in the necklace version okay next up we've got some more bracelets here oh this is so pretty it's this bangle i never ever wear bangles but that is beautiful i have the um spears bracelet on and then the bangle really really pretty it's it's like so beautiful i don't want it to get scratched so keeping that safe is this another ring i think this one might be part of their newest launch so this is the dome spheres ring in vermeil this one right here just launched how pretty is that i think they have earrings as well that match the same line but that is really pretty i love any kind of ring that adds texture i think it just makes the stack way more interesting seeing all those different textured rings together so i really really love that that is so beautiful so this one is vermeil the spheres bracelet that i have on my wrist right now is solid gold so it's a little bit more dainty this one is vermeil and it's more bold but i really love this if you're wanting something a little bit more yeah a little bit more bold a little bit more textured but really really pretty don't you worry we've still got a lot to go through you thought this was almost over you are incorrect it doesn't it is not even close okay we've got another necklace this is the diamond line necklace this is so pretty and so dainty so this is a 14 karat gold chain super dainty and then this is the line of diamonds just really really really dainty but that would be so beautiful if you just want something delicate would also be really pretty on a full stack so that was beautiful okay next up we've got oh my gosh we got just like a ton of little individual earrings twist ring and i'm not positive if this is 14 karat gold or remain it looks like 14k gold looks a little bit more of a lighter yellow gold versus the vermeil which is more bold but you can see it has the slightest bit of texture again really beautiful for stacking i think this one plus the diamond ring like that would be a beautiful simple stack i really like those two together i think that's actually really pretty those two i don't know if you guys can see kind of how they stack like that it's so dainty i'm trying to show you guys what they look like but i'm like guys see this super dainty piece of jewelry very hard to capture such beautiful dainty jewelry okay oh riley just poked her head in the door to say hello hi riley hi baby do you want to come in here no you're gonna come here come on oh she's nudging the door oh hi baby hi baby look we have a guest star you've never just come in while i've been filming normally you run for the hills this is the single ruby earring i would assume 14k gold i don't even know how to show you guys these pieces they're so dainty there it's just a tiny tiny ruby stone this would be gorgeous as a second or third or fourth or fifth or sixth earring that is beautiful these are the diamond line mini hoops so i guess i should open up should i open up both of them i'll just open up one of them so you guys can see but they sent over two of them i wish i had a third piercing so bad if i had a third piercing this would be going in immediately i mean they're just like so so dainty like that's the only way i feel like i can really show you what that looks like because i just feel like when i hold it up it's like this is the diamond pop signet ring this ring is beautiful look at that that is so pretty i love that that is just like so delicate and beautiful showing me that i need to clean my actual like wedding band but i mean that is so that's so pretty i love that i'm like wow i wish i got one of these those are gorgeous okay next up i think i remember this being called the box chain yes the baby box chain necklace and i believe this is 14 karat gold this is a really really pretty necklace to wear with any sort of pendants you could also just use it as like a single layering piece but i love the box chains because they are just a little bit more glittery reflective than like a curb chain they have a little bit of sparkle to them so that one is really really pretty really delicate okay so the boyfriend chain i have on my neck which one this one right here this like thicker one right here comes in a bracelet version and i wish i had gotten a bracelet in this chain because i actually love it this is the boyfriend chain in the bracelet and it's 14 karat gold so you never ever ever ever have to take it off and i actually love them like so pretty so that is the boyfriend chain i cannot get over just how beautiful all of this jewelry is i'm like looking at it sitting out in the jewelry box on the ground and i'm just like oh my gosh it's just like christmas except i don't get to keep it so but this is so fun i mean i've never gotten to just play dress up with so many pieces and missouri of all pieces i mean just like really good quality pieces these are the new dome spears hoops in vermeil and these ones are actually really really beautiful i saw these online when they launched and i was like i love that i love i love this launch so these are the vermeil hoops really really pretty ugh but good size like nothing too crazy to wear like nothing like heavy that's gonna weigh your ears down but still like old enough to where you can actually see them so i love that they have like a mixture of dainty and like more bold pieces i can't believe riley just came in here to hang out with me that is so unlike her okay this is the mini hoop in blue sapphire so that same hoop that red one that i opened up comes in blue as well i really hope you guys can see these it's so so dainty i really don't know like a better way to show you guys they are just the tiniest little huggy earrings but i love they come in two colors this is the diamond opened ring i don't think i've actually ever seen this on their website so this is so new to me oh really really pretty so it looks like this and as you can see there is an opening it's really really gorgeous and i would assume since it's diamonds it's also probably 14k gold beautifully dainty i really like that i feel like it would be so pretty as like a wedding band even but very very pretty love that i love that they just sent pieces that i would have never ever thought to try this is the heirloom ring in honey oh this is actually so pretty look at that again i've never been like a big gemstone person other than diamonds but that is just gorgeous that's really really pretty i actually really love that that is just like i think it's in the in this color honey but i think that is just so pretty wow i'm like i wish i i could pull that off on the regular not not with all the other rings but i think that is just so gorgeous i am overwhelmed because i just have like a lot of jewelry now that i am responsible for but i'm really glad that we got to open it up together and go through all the pieces i am so excited for my collab with missouri again i just i am just so grateful that they even like picked me out of the crowd there's so many people out

very specific one I use a small scale and slowly add powder to it until I get the weight desired [Music] I'll then add the water into the mixing bowl I found that it works the best to add the powder to the water rather than the other way around it just mixes better according to the state of California this powder is very bad for your lungs so when I pour it into the bowl I make sure to hold my breath at the same time you can go the extra mile by wearing a respirator after the powder goes in it's a race against the clock this investment will set pretty quickly so I want to make sure I get it done in time it should feel like a nice pancake batter at this point in fact if you make it to the end of this video I owe you some flapjacks the mixing bowl is then placed on an investment table and covered with a dome lid this will make the inner chamber airtight for what purpose you might ask to extract air from the investment itself the bubbles rise from within the chambers then depressurized the investment mix is then taken over to the flask which holds our ring models and is poured in after the investment fills up the flask I bring it back over to the investment table this eliminates air pockets in the mold and around our ring model and it looks like I overfilled it a bit it's sort of flowing out at the top like a slow magma now that that's done the last thing I need to do is just let the flask sit for a couple of hours that way the investment can cure fully after the investment has fully hardened I'll place it in the burnout oven think of the process like this those wax ring models will be melted out of the flask thus creating a cavity for the gold to flow into the entire burnout cycle is roughly 10 hours these are the pieces of sentimental gold we'll be using for this cast it's really sweet to know that gold from family members will now be added to an engagement ring because it is old metal it's always good to mix in some fresh 14 karat gold alloy this will help ensure it nice and clean casting the hot flask is removed from the oven and dropped into the centrifuge the crucible then slides and locks it in place Showtime it's time to melt down the gold and cast these rings [Music] the direct flame rapidly heats up the gold turning it from a solid into a liquid [Music] the moment has arrived the centrifuge is released thrusting gold down into the flask [Music] the spinning eventually slows and it gently comes to a stop the gold has found its new home from the crucible down into the flask I'll let it sit for 10 minutes before I quench it in water after the gold cools and sets a bit the flask is brought over this tub of water and dropped down in a process called quenching it really is satisfying I mean just listen to this the thermal shock blows out the investment thus revealing the gold rings still in the flask this is the time where I truly let out a sigh of relief all that time all of that work led to this moment the casting seeing that both rings filled completely with gold it really makes your day sometimes you can get incomplete castings and you have to do the whole process over again these castings turned out great and it's another simple reminder why I love this trade so much using my fingers I'll remove most of the investment that's been stuck onto the Rings at this point I'll drop the rings into this magnetic tumbler this will help brighten up the raw casting you can see there are hundreds of tiny little magnetic pins they tumble and spin around thus polishing up the Rings [Music] after 10 minutes or so I remove the Rings out of the tumbler you can see it did a great job at brightening up the raw casting I then take the Rings over to my bench pin and using a jeweler saw I'll cut through the Spruce and release the button the gold button can be used in many different ways it can be remelted or recycled or can be rolled out and turned into a wedding band which is what we plan to do here [Music] [Music] now that the excess gold has been removed it's time to blend everything one way I like to do that is by using a file I like to do nice even strokes when I run a file over a ring thus blending everything nice and smoothly you'll also want to make sure you don't flatten out any sections of the band to further clean up this ring I'll take this sanding wheel and use it around the base of the head this also blends everything together nicely [Music] now for the center stone we're gonna be using this beautiful two carat colorless moissanite moissanite is an excellent diamond alternative it's also hard like a diamond rated nine point two five out of ten on the mineral scale of hardness this brilliant stone is then dropped into the four prong setting each one of these four prongs has had a seat cut into it or kind of think of it like a notch this allows the stone to be popped down into place and to be securely held now that the moissanite is sitting down in the seats I cut for it I'll take some pliers and start to tighten the stone I do this by pulling the prongs down and over the stone itself I'll go over each prong individually making sure everything is nice and tight of course I wouldn't want a stone to pop out at a future date [Music] you and that'll do it now that the stone is nice and tight and secured in place it's time to file down the prongs I don't want them sticking up too high off of the stone I also like to use a cup bur which basically rounds out and smooth the top of the prongs you wouldn't want them catching on anything [Music] now for the last and crucial step the final polish polishing is so important because it really brings out the shine in a ring I like to use these soft polishing wheels [Music] it's also important to polish all the areas that are hard to reach with a larger wheel I like to use these small bristle brushes to do the trick [Music] an inside polishing finger is also used to make sure the inside of the rings are nice and smooth after the rings have been polished up they're then dropped into the ultrasonic cleaner this is a cleaner that basically removes all the polishing compound after letting the ring soak for 10 to 15 minutes I take my tongs and I remove them from the basket [Music] then it's over to the steamer shooting at 60 psi you really can't beat the job it does for cleaning I always like to focus around the stone and underneath to make sure it shines beautifully [Music] and there you have it one custom wedding set an engagement ring and wedding band cast using sentimental gold the memory of these loved ones will surely linger on and just look at that brilliant moissanite there really is a good reason why this has become such a popular diamond alternative as promised if you made it this far I owe you a stack of pancakes thanks for watching [Music]", "f_wl94rz0Us": "fine diamonds jewelry from the diamond store exquisite conflict-free diamonds and gemstones go into making our beautifully handmade necklaces

they're just all pave-set really really pretty here I'll take it out of the holder and you can see it's got even a split shank there for you so I like that it gives it a little bit of character keeps

you're talking luxury because you're pairing your gold with your diamonds and I'm going to slip this on next to my diamond wedding band so you can see just the quality of the diamonds is there but what's really interesting with this piece is if you are hard on your jewelry and we all God knows I am this is great because what they did is to keep this number one lightweight to for you and from it being chunky and clunky is really they filled the inside of this ring with silicone and all that does is it gives it a backbone so when you're active you won't dent this you know you won't have to worry about ruining the look and the beauty because it's more scratch resistant so let me slip this on and I'll show you real quickly what it looks up like up against my diamond wedding band because this is this is a little bit bigger than what I'd wear because you could kind of pair this up with any of your band rings and kind of pull it off as a look of a wedding band an engagement ring but look at the diamonds kept beautiful that looks and they sparkle nice shimmer and our diamonds you know our quality you know that's why so many people choose to buy their jewelry here at QVC because of

look more beautiful than they do in person look at it on Jones finger perfect example this is so tasteful and it glistens remember that's a minimum of a quarter carat worth of diamonds and really in retail legally they can give you a little less than that they could give you a little more and still call it a quarter carat we give you a minimum a quarter carat let me give you an update we started with close to 200 we have five dozen remaining and we are last call on five sizes five six and seven real nice presence smooth to the touch and it really it's a great choice for the lady who doesn't

"GfNjvmT9HCI": "[Music] b [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "ah07nvtxxvo": "welcome back to our videos and this video we're going to talk about what's the difference between 10 karat 14-karat 18-karat 22 karat and 24 karat gold and how to test for each one what's the most accurate way and what are all the ways to test for if your build is real fake rhodium plated stainless steel whatever it is I'm gonna teach you how to test for so what is 10 karat 10-karat is 41.7% pure gold 14 karat is 58.5% pure gold and 18 karat is 75% pure gold 22 karat is 91.6% pure gold and pure gold is 99.999% pure gold which is 24 karat that's what everybody wants but almost nothing is manufactured in 24 karat because of how fragile is if you wanna Cuban link in 24 care we could probably do it that's no problem 22 karat humanly we can do it no problem anything else and 22 to 24 karat gets really hard to deal with but special occasions if you really want something for the right price you can make the most commercial gold or ten care and fourteen care that's what most people buy a few people buy 18 karats or if you want to be an exclusive class you get 18 care now how to test the dip TennCare 14-karat 18-karat 22 karat we currently use thermo scientific I taught myself to x-ray analyzer thus analyzer is to analyze gold so putting on the piece of gold this is the most accurate way to test gold everywhere so people who use and then it tells you it's 14 care this is fourteen point three two carat and fifty nine point six nine percent of gold so this piece right here is a little over the fifty eight point five percent of gold that has to be same thing will be with 10 karat so 10 karat chain this was coming out a loving care so as stamp ten carats coming out of loving care which is forty five point eight nine percent gold anything above and better it's a little less what I would say if your piece of gold once you tested with the x-ray machine if it's nine point nine zero or nine point eight five it's still passable s 10 karat well we try and do everything above so if it's 10 ish if it's 10 karat it should be 1001 or 10:02 should go above should never be less but it could happen it's all about the mixture and where you're testing it let's say you test it right here it could give 1025 so you test it over here you could give 995 and it's all how long you put it on there so if you put it on with the x-ray machine you put it on 10 seconds to do a 10-second test on it on a pave finger [Music] on an 11-second test they gave 41.5% nine point nine seven percent so it's point two off of ten care I mean if you test it anywhere else it will give the 10k and right there gave 41.96 so this is the most accurate way to test it it tells you exactly what it is now a lot of jewelers still use acid and rock method where you stretch a piece of jewelry before a little bit of acid on and it's got 10 karat 14-karat 18-karat gold acid and the if it goes away it's not girls at all if it smokes a little bit it's a little under care or it still could be the carrot with the acid you never know acid is the least accurate way to test a piece of jewelry sometimes they even throw the acid on top of the jewelry and if the jewelry even has a gold plating on it they'll be like oh it's not real and not true because every piece of doing is go play it if you see this piece right here has a completely different color than this this one's they're both solid gold which I just proved to you is completely different color than this but this one before I left the factory they play today this one is not plated listen they're not plated and there's also the gel pen method where it's like you put a little tablet you put gel on it and you press a button and it should type it as 10 or 14 karat sounds a little more accurate than the current acid method which everyone uses the reason people use if the rock and acid method is because it's cheapest way this is the most expensive way there's a way I recommend you get your jewelry tested if you have a Cuban link or any other piece of jewelry be it a $100 item to a $10,000 get it tough do it the next year machine somebody in your town has to have an x-ray machine they're not everywhere just yet because they still are expensive pieces they run about 20 to 25,000 dollars depending on the model that you get there's a thermo scientific there's olympus you can look them up online but check check your jewelry out if you have if your I know we got videos of other jewelry stores in the local area they they bring their jewelry over here to get it tested but they don't want to their cut their customers bring their jewelry over here to get a tested and it usually goes down to about 12 carat and is 14 we even have a video of one that's stamped 14 carat then it came out of levy care so yeah beware when you buy jewelry busts do it from somebody you trust somebody that can respond to any of the problems because if you spend money for a 14-karat piece and you get a 10 karat piece it's not nice or if you get a 12 carat piece it's not nice because you did pay that extra money for the 14-karat they'll be aware when you buy make sure it's everything's 100% guaranteed if not you can return it and get your money back I know a lot of jewelers started to knock it so stay tuned give us a like share and subscribe and let us know what
