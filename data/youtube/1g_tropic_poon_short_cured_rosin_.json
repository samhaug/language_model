{"ylc16phLqDE": "i mean this right here is some live rosin bro this is really what you want to do what's good everyone it's haikai as you can see we're at the dispo right now pick up some fire and i'll show you guys what we get when we get back all right we just got back from the dispensary we picked up some real nice stuff for sure she was expensive but um definitely like i'm just gonna say now this is honestly worth it to me um we picked up some rosin and rosin right now is going pretty crazy it's a solving this extract it's like the top-tier extracts in my opinion like because it's solventless and there's no butane or anything extra added into it it's just literally using heat to get the extract from flash flooding flower or regular cured flower it's some fire bro i've only tried it once before and that was literally last night that's why i wanted to make a video about it i picked up and i want to go back today and get some more and bro that [ __ ] was i did one dab of it i only take i only took one down because i wanted to save more for the video but dude just one like it just hit so much different like i can't even describe how like how much different it hits your chest and like your head it just like feels because the the high doesn't even feel like groggy like you would from a distal high like when you get high from just slit you just get like i guess high and then you just like want to go lay down and just like i don't know want to [ __ ] off for a bit but if you take a dab of some like real live browsing bro that should just like i don't know it just makes you feel so much more uplifted and good like it gives you the actual like i don't know feeling of high like it re it really gave me like flash faster like when i first started smoking because like right now my tolerance is pretty high since i've been smoking like every day for like a while now so dab of rosin is just like up here compared to like some shatters just like all the way down here this is completely different experience in my opinion at least solving this is definitely the way to go we picked up three different types of roses actually and we're going to get into like the different types of rosins you can get we got some aged cured rosin we have some live rosin and then we also have a full spectrum rosin yeah it's going to be dope video for sure because like this [ __ ] smacks bro uh we're gonna get some cool we'll get some cool milk shots and everything you know the vibes but yeah first let's get into the aged cured rosin from the well it's a hybrid one gram of solventless cannabis extracts that's what you like seeing um get a little shot of the back as well and as you can see it says whoops it's age cured rosin as you can see um which train is it uh melon rings and yeah on the inside it gives like a little uh biography of why i like solving this extracts are really the way to go so we at lowell love concentrates but we don't love the chemical solvents used to create low quality extracts we also know that cannabis is far more than complex in thc alone and that's stripping out the rich and complex variety of cannabinoids and terpenes found in the plant undermines the whole plant cannabis experience our artisans worked tirelessly to perfect an extraction method encompassing the whole plant using pressure and time instead of solvents and volatile extraction we knew with the cold pressing of cannabis which preserves all the natural properties we can finally create concentrates worthy of the well named alaskan fire bro um this is just some regular age cured rosin it's a bit different from regular live rosin this can be full spectrum anything can be full spectrum uh it can either be full spectrum or live i'm not sure if it's live or full spectrum because age cured is referred to um the process after that and the carrying process usually involves rosin being collected in a suitable jar heated and then treated with some variation of hot or cold temperatures and then stored in a stored in the jar for a few weeks or longer and then if done well can result result in some jam that can be like some of the most flavorful important and potent uh concentrates imaginable and that's what this is exactly and yeah dude this should definitely smacks like no other bro like i can't wait to get some more of this because it really isn't that expensive like i was saying um hq rosin is from the well i think that's like one of their it's like specialties i guess because i don't really see any other age gear rather for anywhere else but yeah there's just gonna be some fire bro we'll take a globber of this um let's get this shop set up [ __ ] globber boys [Music] smoke down smoked out positive squad protect dj smokey at all costs [Music] [Music] all right bro that [ __ ] just smacks so different i i can't even describe it like i'm i'm just like so much [ __ ] iron than i was before i i i like i didn't i've been all right yeah i haven't smoked like at all really today i've like to rip the card maybe once or twice but bro this [ __ ] just smacks me so differently than just like a regular like live resin dab or something like that like this [ __ ] just makes my whole body feel so different but in a good way just you could really taste the full flavor profiling and all the chirps in them and that dab it just tastes so good dude whoa i forgot which string that was i think it was like melon rings like you could really just taste that [ __ ] it tasted so amazing i can't wait to take some more uh take some more [ __ ] globs of that bro it's some fire like seriously this it was really worth it and i think the melon rings honestly wasn't even that expensive either like that for a gram was i think i think 45 or something and that's really like that's pretty cheap in my opinion for some rosin and it was it's still pretty good quality and like you can get some live resin or diamonds for about the same amount and this is solventless and i would honestly rather prefer this and it hits like so much so much better dude i can't even like i'm not over exaggerating or anything because like i'd be smoking every day and like and i'll be smoking some like like i think in the last video like it was like some purple punch like it'll give me high and it made me feel pretty good but it doesn't give me that like full body high like this is giving me right now and this is like it's just smacking for real but um yeah let's get into the next thing the which is this full spectrum hashtag so what basically what a full spectrum extract is is about preserving the natural ratios of compounds within cannabis while removing the impurities that can compromise the full experience and then full spectrum exercise can also be called whole plant extract just because it keeps all the properties of the flower it doesn't remove any of it but however because heat is involved in this uh solvent extraction method compared to like a regular um full spectrum extract with uh like bho or co2 however since this is a salt in this extract and the only extraction method is like through heat basically um it is a concern that full spectrum extracts going solventless um can lose some terpenes if it isn't done right and some other profiles of cannabis but if it's a well-known company not some like boof they know what they're doing for the most part and like have it down to its science really but yeah that's basically the difference between full spectrum and live ones originally coming from a dry flower and then the other one's coming from a flash flowers and flower which is live resin we just dabbed on with some cured aid frozen i accidentally got that mixed up with uh with this the full spectrum live rosin so everything i just talked about i was referring to this which is a full spectrum like i was saying like you get the full profiling of the flower and everything from full spectrum compared to my bras and you get my rods and you only get like parts of it because it does remove some um profiles we'll get into this full spectrum now i pretty much explained everything about the difference between full spectrum and uh live resin but yeah this [ __ ] looks fire as [ __ ] as well um i'll read the little things they have um this is from honey butter this is their brand uh the last brand was the wells like it's cool how like you can tell the difference about the brands that really care and i feel like these like saltiness extract brands because like there's so much more work goes into it i feel like um they really care about their products and stuff and you can tell like they have like a whole last thing it shows you like what temperatures you should be taking your dabs out of stuff and like if you have a puffco or i think the other thing is the aura or email it even says with temperatures to take it out and that's really [ __ ] helpful like no other thing does that and like it says you should be taking them at low temps and like low temps is definitely the way dude you can really taste the chirps at low temp and it's the move and then mainly it says thank you for choosing to support craft cannabis our family business small farmers of uh meniscento county from the soil to oil every step of our process performed with love and intent of delivering the best experience for you down to the last dab we are incredibly grateful to share our patient we are incredibly grateful to share our passion for this amazing plan with you thank you kindly the honey butter team and then message us anytime we're always here to chat honey butter rosin dot co so yeah this is that honey runner rosin this shit's fire bro i haven't even tried it i can't even say it's fire but it sounds fire it's peanut butter cup bro it's crazy i'm allergic to peanut butter so uh bro imagine this like gives me an allergic reaction i've never even like had peanut butter so i wonder it's gonna give me the taste but yeah this is that um this is that full spectrum rosin and like i was saying full spectrum rosin does come from dried plants not um fresh frozen plants so that's why it does look a bit different it also could be different press as well from the live resin but yeah it still looks fire as [ __ ] and smells it smells like it's gonna be super tasty um like dude the other the melanie smelled super good too but yeah we'll take a nice uh nice glob of this too i'm already [ __ ] hiding and i'm working like an hour so hopefully i can get this video finished [Music] check [Music] so that peanut butter cup um that was pretty fire too as well and that was the cheapest out of all of them there's only like 38 dollars before tax that's really not too bad for grandma rosin um but i can understand why it is the cheapest it definitely felt like the quality it wasn't as like refined as maybe the cured age rosin and i just felt like like i said i mean like in the name said this just feels more cured and like they like the feeling of that one more i feel but this definitely gave me a good uh full body high more in the head i felt like yeah but this for sure with some fire bro and again it's solving this and if you can get some cell phones the same price as um some bho or um other [ __ ] like that i don't understand why you wouldn't cop some solvent list because it's like honestly like better for you in the long run i felt like personally and yeah it's honestly it's just really some fire it's worth the extra couple bucks in my opinion and then right now we'll get into like the most expensive one which is the live rosin that i got bro that's just some fire i i can't even describe it that's definitely my favorite one i think it's just some um banana korean premium live rosin it's a banana oj um mixed with a creme brulee so it's a hybrid this is definitely the most expensive one at 85 before tax and which isn't even like too expensive for rosin because there's there's jams there that are like 110 120. i mean that might be a little taxed just because of the hype i feel like right now but like 80 80 to 90 is what you're usually going to pay for raws and like i feel like no matter what unless it's like i don't know for at least for some live rosin and like bro this just smacks differently so any products that are like immediately frozen like after they're harvested or called like live so that's why this is called live rosin it's referring to the flower that was immediately frozen once it was harvested and basically what live resin is is a solventless hash oil made with full milk bubble hash that was made with freshly frozen materials and as you guys saw in like my other video i was um smoking some full melt bubble hash it was no it wasn't full mount bubble hatch because i wasn't able to dab it if it says full melt you are able to dab it but if it's bubble hash um just regular bubble hatch you can't dab that it will like it just won't burn correct but you can put it on top of bullets or inside joints but yeah that's basically just like all trichomes and then you go from that to uh you basically take the water hash and that gets pressed and then that's what becomes a live rosin and that's basically what this is bro i'm gonna open this up now no time to waste bro just some fire um yeah it doesn't even have like a long description like the other boxes though all it says on the top is flavor as nature intended in a smaller batches let's fire around i mean this right here is some live rosin bro this is really what you want to be smoking if you can some fire bro um just take a bobber of this [Music] [Music] like i was saying that should just hit way different than like all of them honestly don't get me wrong it's not like the most insane high ever i just feel like it's like maybe the cleanest high that i've ever gotten from at least the the papa select this is the most expensive rosin that um that i picked up it was the live rosin and like it tastes great and everything but i feel like the chirps like aren't really there compared to the aged cured rosin and then the i think this was the full spectrum rosin this is definitely worth it and it gives you the i felt like it gave me the cleanest high it was 85 before tax which is pretty expensive for one gram if you want to know you're smoking like the best [ __ ] possible you can definitely be getting this um these two as well any type of solvent this extract is honestly gonna be so much better than any bho or a co2 extract which is like um like shatters and stuff you can for sure always still get good batters and i'm like still going to get that of course because they're always going to be cheap and everything but like that means solving this is just honestly like superior just like it's just a step above it's honestly really worth the money i don't understand the hype now but like out of all three of these i'd say that the cured age rosin was my favorite and it was only 45 dollars for the gram and like this should super tasty bro like you could really taste the chirps on it i'm gonna take another glove of this before i go and yeah that's gonna pretty much be the end of the video uh thanks guys for watching if you can try out some solving this extracts bro definitely try if you can uh definitely worth the money if you've ever been thinking about it like comment subscribe i'll see you guys next week", "ezRzBxPQpbI": "when you know that this is $75 and you're getting a big scoop of it I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there [ __ ] it this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you what's up everybody Cubans here and today we are going to get into some rather expensive concentrates I picked up a gram of some hash rosin today that was priced at $75 and it is one of the most expensive grams of concentrate I have ever purchased so let's take a close look at what we got I've had a gram of Summit connoisseurs genetic and concentrates Tiger's milk and this stuff looks like a nice little slab of peanut butter I'm pretty excited pretty excited abot both so you can get a look at the packaging here this is that Tiger's milk and it's testing at about seventy nine percent THC and then it does have a little bit of CBD a in there but you know what I am so excited for this let's just take it down where are my clothes at let's get a nice nice little scoop here out of the email all fresh and clean and I'm gonna see how it does does [Music] um yeah that was really good I'm gonna actually throw that on a courts now I'm gonna throw that around on a few nails and see if we like it but just to compare I picked up some cheap dabs this cost 75 a gram for some hash rasen 75 bucks for this it's pretty expensive most most of my concentrates I usually find deals and get a lot of good looking stuff like this this is some live batter I got for about 15 bucks a gram one-fifth of the price now sometimes I find live sugars live diamonds of batters around that 15 to 20 dollar price if I'm getting it on a deal it's not the everyday price so begin the deal you can get this stuff cheap so it's really interesting to pay five times as much for a single gram of concentrate I can't I can't believe I did it it's still interesting to me that this costs five times as much as this other gram of some delicious looking stuff but some hash rods and it's hard to come by especially here in Colorado Springs it's not super common to find rosin hash rosin so I guess you got to pay that top dollar because it's so rare but let's get some more dabs of this cone I'm not done with this yet let's see what I'm gonna do some cold starts when you know that this is $75 and you get in a big school but I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there okay [Music] it's throwing out a couple bucks in that [ __ ] it [ __ ] it and get a little bit more I need about three-fitty oh we got it okay okay just pricey tab right here damn it all right let's get a nice cold start here and see if it's super delicious on the court oh damn well damn okay okay that's good stuff so I just stabbed it a couple of times here and it's pretty good stuff but is it is it worth it is it worth paying five times as much as I do for some good live banner is it worth is it worth paying five times as much to get some solvent once that's basically the major difference is the fact that it's solvent list most concentrates are made with a solvent it's the easier method it's the most common method but with rosin they use heat and pressure to make it so they just basically squish the THC or they squish the extract out of the nugs or out of hash most of the time they'll make a hash and then they'll press the hash and that's what this is this is a this is hash rosin so it's a little bit more expensive and my understanding is the yield is a little bit lower it's it's a process to make the hash and then when you press the hash you wouldn't get the same type of yield as if you were doing like a butane or propane extraction so I think part of the process is it's a little bit harder to get high-quality product and you're typically going to get less with whatever amount of plant material you go into the process with so I think that affects the price it is pretty rare out here in Colorado Springs not a lot of people are pressing - I can find it in a few places some places have rosin and half chosen but it's not as common as BHO and pho and there's so many dispensaries that grow their own bud and they do their own in-house extractions so something like this I can I can pretty much get really cheap any day of the week if I'm looking around so for me to pay five times as much for this it's a little little far-fetched I honestly I'd rather have five grams of this and haven't done but yet and it's just I like volume I like to do a lot of dub so I'm gonna go back and forth on these we're gonna compare I just want to shave this I got this the same day I kick it costs literally one-fifth the price I'm just gonna see if it's if it's it if it's 20% it's good like it doesn't make oh god I just paid so much money but anyway anyway anyway yeah that's that's solid for the price that's sell it for $15 grand look um I I think it's good I think that that the rosin is good I'm gonna dab the rod let me have a bucket that was that was the I don't even know of the other strain is [Music] [Music] I mean it's definitely better [Music] the Robins better smoother and tastes a little better you can't really compare the highs because I'm better than both back for it but it's all about the taste for me and it is smoother is it pay five times the price smoother [Music] I don't think so because it's not it's not five times as good yeah I don't even know how you would get five times as give it something like this this isn't the best this isn't the best cheap batter that I've got but for something to be five times as good as this would be pretty impressive so this is not five times as good probably not worth five times the price if I see it on deals I may get it but I don't think it's worth anything that's worth three times the price two times the price even thirty forty five bucks I get why it costs so much it's a it's a little bit less common not as many people are making it and you get lower yields with it I get why it it costs more but it's not currently it's not at the price point where it's super worth it for me to only buy rosin maybe if I had a press and I could get amazing yields myself but I don't grow and I don't have any interest in growing so it's like I don't have to buy all my nugs anyway to smash it so kind of interesting I like finding deals so maybe I'll get excited about finding a deal in the future but yeah this isn't actually the most expensive gram of concentrate I've ever purchased a few years ago I remember purchasing a I purchased several grams actually a full melt bubble hash that I got remember the dispensary but I got some full melt bubble I think it was about eighty eight bucks a gram I think I remember paying just under ninety a gram it was really really good stuff it was like some of the craziest stuff I ever spent I I gotta go back and look for some pictures of it cuz it was a few years ago those full mount bubble hash grams I got were like pretty good but after I got a mouse this isn't worth eighty eight bucks a gram what the [ __ ] did I just do so I kind of feel that way here what the [ __ ] that I just do but we made a video that's what the [ __ ] we just did so let's do a few more dabs of this [ __ ] might as well I've only taken out several dollars off of it I don't see if we can take several more I'm interested in the cold start here so let's do that [Music] here's a few dollars [Music] yeah this is good stuff still I wish I could afford you dabs well this was actually pretty fun and I'm pretty blessed after all those naps and I'm glad I finally got to try this rosin up and see it in a bunch of dispensaries even if I did pay money for it but if you liked this video be sure to subscribe for more content in the future and check out my other social media I'll have links in the description below and for my live streams tune in to twitch at twitch.tv slash Cubans if you tune in at night I'm probably live right now getting high dabbing some much cheaper than than $75 a gram rosin unless you tuned in very shortly after this is made that I might have some of this left but uh come hang out and we'll see you next time [Music] I would say perfect balance but I'm going [Music] [Music] [Music]", "QAkbtBShyp0": "hey everyone how's it going Eric here with peer pressure we're gonna be showing you our top five tips and tricks for getting the most out of your flower rosin so whether you're pressing at home on a hair straightener or using an industry-leading press like our peg speak rosin press we've got all the tips and tricks so you can get the most out of it tip number one quality in quality out this is the most important thing that you should know when you're making flower rosin or any rosin the better the material you're starting with the better your results are going to be and the fresher it is the better the clarity as material tends to age it's gonna oxidize and you're gonna find that that rosin is gonna come out darker so if you're looking to make the best flower rods and you possibly can get stellar material and press it as soon after its dried and cured as possible tip number two relative humidity makes a huge difference with flower rosin now you can go check out our other video where we did the full in-depth test but what you need to know is that your flower should be at least at 55 to 62% humidity before you press it this makes a massive difference in your yield so just make sure that your material is properly hydrated before you press it tip number three choose your temperature based on your desired results so we encourage a lot of experimentation and you're gonna find that most people are either pressing on the lower temperature range which is about 160 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit or the higher temperature range which is anything from 190 to as high as 250 degrees so depending on what kind of consistency you want to achieve that's where you're gonna set your temperature on the lower range you're gonna be looking at more of a butter on the higher range more of an oil or a shatter so when you have some material that you're playing around with we encourage you to try both ends of the spectrum and see which one you like the most tip number 4 choose the right micron bag type now you can absolutely press flower outside of a bag and get great results but that's usually only a gram or two you're gonna want to press in a 90 or 115 micron bag or at the most 150 we recommend not going any lower than 90 because that's when you're gonna see a huge drop-off in yield so if you're pressing flour in a bag make sure to stick in that range and finally tip number five if you're looking to make the highest quality flour on possible you absolutely don't need to overdo it on the pressure now you can definitely over press your flour rosin by applying way too much force at your bag and in fact we've seen great results not only with yield but of course with quality pressing at the lower end of the pressure range anything from around 550 to 1600 psi at the bag so when you're applying way too much pressure in the many thousands what can often happen is that you're pushing out plant fats lipids you know the waxes as well as all of those undesirable plant materials into the rosin really over pressing it so if you're looking for the highest quality rosin we recommend trying the lower pressure range and seeing your results thanks for watching we hope that you

"[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys it's cliff with peer pressure here thanks for tuning in to are solving this review series we've got Roz and Ryan from olio here today we're gonna be checking out his papaya punch number four let's get to it [Music] the papaya punch number four from olio is a cross between purple punch and papaya both heavily indica dominant strains the purple punch was giving me hints of grape candy and a sweet blueberry muffin fresh out of the oven while the papaya was was on the sweet candy side of things papaya candy maybe a little hint of mango in there and it's very surprising that it was an indica dominant strain because most of the effects I was getting were what you would attribute to a sativa dominant strain and I was getting a very energetic productive and uplifting high I tribute this to the high concentration of limonene found in the string and the limonene is really what was giving me that mood elevation in euphoria the second most concentrated terpene present and this strain was Lin Ahlul and I tribute that to the relaxation and stress relief that I was getting from this hey guys it's clip peer-pressure here welcome to the solvent ice review series this is episode number two we've got rosin ryan here with olio and we're gonna be reviewing the papaya punch number four this is our jam product this is been heat cured this is pretty much the most separated of all our consistencies as far as THC a and terpene content within the rosin and we believe it's probably the most shelf-stable even if you don't put it in the fridge or anything like that it keeps flavor for a long time and it's honestly my favorite consistency that I'm smoking right now so you can leave this out and it doesn't it doesn't you know decrease in terpene value it won't dry up which some people do like but this here let me show you here sure so what's this little dab tool here so every gram of ours has kind of comes with a personal dabber it's just a little extra thing we do just select emergency dabber in case of situations for sure very nice nice touch so what can you tell me about the the strain here so this is our papaya punch number four this is we have a few different fee knows we always Fino test a few different seeds that we get it's like the most exotic fruity and most punchy almost phyno it's got an exotic note it's um it's got a little bit of that artificial grape in it from the purple punch it's probably one of my favorite strains at the moment and this is from pony seeds papaya times purple punch very nice yep this is perfect for during the day I'll run some errands after dabbing some of this stuff it's very relaxing but its clear-headed yes it's a hybrid like most things are nowadays and for me personally I know it's different for everybody but I could dab some of this and still get a lot of stuff done during the day I don't feel too body locked or anything like that I still I'm ready to go you know do my stuff for the day so got that clarity stay exactly exactly and it's so flavorful that I almost don't expect to relax feeling I'm expecting some type of anxiety yes achieve a high but it's honestly perfect mellow high for the middle of the day definitely so how do you typically go about finding a good hash string it is many different steps so first of all to grow which ones grow nice we can't get any males obviously we take out the males whatever females are left it really is dependent on how well they grow their yield in the garden then once we wash them it's gonna be based on water hash yields it's gonna be the thing that plays the most role and if we keep it or not if it does yield well a nice hash and it presses well usually we'll keep it it all depends on flavors yields we all come together smoked them we all you know put in our opinions of you know which one do you think is a little bit tastier versus if the yield if it's really worth it sometimes we'll take a tastier one even if it yields a little bit lower just because it's got that little extra that we know people will will enjoy it so for sure so what do you thoughts on fresh frozen verse washing dried and cured flour so you can wash cured I've seen it done stuff 99% of our stuff is fresh frozen almost almost all we have our own in-house garden everything is harvested fresh frozen washed within usually one to two weeks so we try to wash it as quickly as possible really keeps that terpene profile just like it was when you were smelling the plant so when you're going around you got your fingers on the nose I want that to be what the rosin tastes like yeah I went down I really do think fresh frozen you know produces that a little bit better of a quality in the end for sure yeah so yeah you talked about doing BHO extraction in the past and you know when BHO first came out people were always looking for a light golden color but it seems now that things are kind of moving more towards an almost white color and I've even heard of people pulling their plants early to even get that color do you have any comment on like that is a huge trend right now in the in the grow world as people know you can pull your plants a little bit early but you're gonna sacrifice what I believe is a little bit taste and your potency the effects from you pulling early I believe are gonna be felt people really go for that visual yeah so when people see white hash they really they get excited yeah I think people really need to try the hash more side-by-sides sometimes a darker hash will blow the lighter hash out of the water with taste with potency affect how it makes you feel so I really think people should try stuff before you know everybody eats with their eyes so to speak but but uh you really gotta get smoking yeah so what can you tell us about the terpene profiles some of the flavors that you're getting up the papaya punch number four so this number four is probably our most like exotic fruity vino of this papaya punch it's mostly papaya notes it's that exotic fruit in there and it's got a little bit of artificial grape in there from that purple punch that's definitely that's it in there I think it's probably the most well balanced of our papaya punch he knows as far as flavor goes and that consistency is honestly my favorite I like when I see large chunks and they're swimming in Terps so definitely that Jam was just it's something else that is beautiful I seriously could smell it earlier just sitting back here when it was sitting over there so I liked what you did with it for sure well what about terpenes in general their medicinal benefits I mean how do you think that plays a role into the medicinal benefits the high and whether you classify it as an indica sativa I think everybody you know takes terpenes in a little bit differently obviously some of the ones like limonene stuff like that are just known to generally give people a little bit more uplifting effects like that but as far as terpenes go it's really about finding a flavor that you enjoy in an effect that doesn't hinder your day really yeah if you smoked something that you really like but it's giving you anxiety obviously that might not be the strain for you you should find something you know with similar profiles that don't actually have that same terpene you know within the plant so if you like something fruity but you're getting horrible anxiety from lemon let's maybe try like a citrus yeah or another a strawberry banana or something like that where you know hey this tastes really good but it's not gonna cause me to freak out yeah strawberry banana is one of my favorites - it's super relaxing probably the heaviest indica of the fruity stuff that I've tried so I know a lot of people that love it definitely definitely so one thing I love about following you on instagram is that you're just always dropping knowledge helping push the community further for those of you who aren't following him on Instagram he's at a troz and Ryan check him out lots of great content out there so I feel like the first time I ever heard the term rosin jam it was from following you on Instagram can you comment did did you coin that phrase is there anything there it was kind of more of the people speaking we did a little survey and stuff we just wanted a different our selves a little bit um there was a huge craze going on at the time of people putting rosin in jars and this whole new tech that's going on and I really wanted to create a name that people think Jam they think olio but honestly it's kind of taken off we've noticed other people you know using the rosin Jam name and we really don't seem to mind we've had people in Spain posting rosin jam so I think there's a really awesome to see and it's just it's just our version of rosin sauce or you know just a just a new just a new consistency we're just trying to cone so definitely yeah consistency is everything when I'm looking for a product if typically I lean more towards the jams you know if I see something that's a little more buttery that's just not usually my flavor lots of people like the butter does it is all of reference a lot of people love the butter just for ease of dabbing people like to just dig in some people grab it with their hands and just drop a bomb right in there and just its ease of dabbing it's a preference some people don't want the rosin heat it up some people want it straight off the press and put in the fridge so we like to offer a product for everybody yeah if you want your Ross and put in the fridge we have classic coins um if you want butter we have butter if you want your stuff lightly heated we have a batter and if you want a true separation and you want your rasam to look like BHO a live resin consistency and you don't want to leave it in the fridge then the jam is for you no down so I've got a bunch of homies they nerd out on temperatures as far as pressing goes dabbing goes do you have like a perfect temperature range usually fall in when it comes to pressing and dabbing yes I do if you know if something is pretty melty I use usually stick around 180 degrees that's a nice low temp of times and stuff really vary between how much you put in the bag and what you're squishing and all that but I like 180 degrees it just really is like a nice golden you know point for me for sure yeah so what about the your actual rig or the nail have you ever played around with temperatures I have and stuff it's been a while I'm usually just a time kind of guy kind of figure out what my new nail you know Davin is I'll heat it up and kind of do a test or at 45 seconds you know on minute 30 kind of see what my nails I like a low time dab it uh I'm gonna be dabbing I like a little bit extra on the bottom I'll leave a little puddle sometimes I don't mind you're sure we'll be sure to keep it on the blue setting oh yeah yeah so when you typically take a dab how long does it take for you to feel the effects usually I'm and this is just me I usually feel the effects pretty instantly honestly me too I uh I'll take a dab of this stuff and be ready to go yeah you know it's it's pretty instant behind the eyes yeah yep do you get that with other extracts or do you think rosin high gloss hooker I think rosin in general and solvent listen general I feel throughout my body a little bit more I noticed when I dabbed BHO it's it's more of a head high uhm BHO always you know it feels a little more floaty to me uh rosin solvent list is always a little bit more body I feel a little bit more relaxation from it instantly definite so tell me a little bit about the the bubble hash side of things how are you guys washing what's the trick to getting this so it all starts in the grow so most of our stuff is it's very well taken care of throughout all of its life the veg has to be very clean the early flowering stages at the environment is a huge factor so that's all before the wash is really the plant when we take when we're harvesting no no trimmers even touch the nose they're all hold it you know by the stem cut off the nose and take little golf ball sized pieces really trying to not disrupt any trike formation that we've you know work so hard to grow so washing we use our all RO water it's all hand washed pretty much as gentle as you can wash bud they do it multiple times will wash four or five times just to ensure that all the heads are taken off it's done in a cold room it's all ROI sorrow water it's as clean as can be in there so yeah that's how you make clean Rossum's clean hash and a clean girl so you mentioned washing by hand why do you prefer that over say and automate it where I can just hit the button and it's just uh really control over you know your whole process you can stir as gently as you want you can have a machine that stirs pretty gently but just having that control that hand on it and really seeing how much you're taking off each plant and stuff like that it's that extra care that really goes into it that really just makes it that much better for sure well let's let's get to it yes you want to about here guess we'll switch on over to the blue temp there it's the lowest temperature we've got I've got a little new little guide tool too they do come in handy [Music] man that's just what I was looking for you can definitely get that sweep of pile on the front and then on the backend you've got that like earthy grape soda candy like it was it's definitely what I'm looking for I'm glad you enjoyed it man yeah I always um I always enjoy papaya but that uh that little extra little grape really adds something to it it's got like a little almost a spiciness almost to it it's just really good for sure so what are you feeling like effects wise right now what do you think I I love the relaxed feeling I get from this the clear-headedness good vibe to some music right now to there so I just love the effects just great for chilling yeah you know I've got a real calm my body's real relaxed but in my brain I've got that little tingle to it but it's still real clear yep perfect biking it's quick behind the eyes and stuff quick acting I still feel like I could you know get up and go do some stuff right now so it's perfect and it is some strong stuff dum papaya punch generally tests around 80% for us so I mean that's a pretty high THC content so sure yep the rest of it's pretty much chirps we've been getting regularly 20% turps with the jam it's probably a 5 to 8 percent increase over just having it out you know just fresh press so wow it's quite a significant difference yeah so if somebody was looking to get some of this sweet papaya grape soda candy where could they find that so yeah you can find our product pretty much all over Colorado it's in recreational and medical shops dispensaries we have a flagship dispo it's higher grade they offer recreational and medical at two different locations you're probably gonna have our your best bet you know finding some jam there but we also you know post drops all over our Instagram page at dabble leo 7:10 you can give us a follow I also have my personal page at Ross and Ryan so I usually post the flavors as soon as I make them people get a little anxious and always ask me where it's at it's gonna be about a week or two before testing and all the packaging gets ready usually about a week and usually the olio page is where you can find all the information the drops what you know pretty much where everything's going that you're looking for thanks for stopping by man really enjoy the papaya punch number four it's definitely gonna be one of my goat cheese for this summer for anybody out there is not following them on Instagram be sure to check out at Roz and Ryan always dropping knowledge about solving this extraction trying to push the industry forward and dab olio 710 that's where we got the papaya punch number four from highly recommend it I really appreciate you guys having me I always love talking hash and thanks again so much come down so after sitting on the high for a while you know I really found it interesting that I was getting a lot of sativa dominant effects or what you would think would be sativa dominant effects because they're both in economists trains that we're working with here you know we've got the papaya on one side we've got the purple punch on the other like I said both indica dominant so you would expect a sedative effect but what I found was something really uplifting and that's why I think it's the perfect Brosnan for summertime vacation because it was relaxing mentally but still energetic got a little euphoria from that so an all-around great summertime high and perfect for like I said any vacation any trip to the beach or the lake definitely be my go-to and thanks for tuning in guys be sure to like and subscribe below follow us on our IG Facebook at go peer

from triminator i wanted to show it off how beautiful it is this is my ambassador version so i just got it in they were nice enough to ship that out david came out here to be able to unpackage it with me take a check look and i am getting ready to do a nice big squish on it so i'm gonna really break her in and have a uh see how well it does on i don't know squishy here so we're live we we're doing good here all right so let me get this set up exactly how i want to go i'm going to do four bags of 15 grams three bags on the bottom plate all right so i'm getting this set up here basically i'm using this so that we can get a good look at the flow coming out let's give this a little pressure here [Music] and i have two more 15 gram bags we're gonna do on the top level this is what i love about this press not all the time do i get a lot of product that i can push through but when i have multiple runs on the same product it really is nice to be able to get it through here all right that should look just about right just want to make sure these are in there good i don't want to have any problems okay now the fun begins okay paper set up like i want all about the prep work make sure you got everything placed right where you want it looking good all right got each one of these bags here with a directional flow so that's basically going to push everything out the front here on the front i've got these bags that are made just a little bit longer which will give them room to drip over what i love about this press is it gives me the ability to change the direction so i can tilt this at any angle i want to be able to get that rosin to flow off those plates a little bit faster when i'm doing a lot you know i can what i'm doing over i can just turn it all the way 90 degrees have it run straight out but this makes it a little bit easier for collecting and i feel like getting air mixed in with it is is kind of a little down from what i'm opposite what i'm trying to do actually so here we go start taking a look here oh that's so pretty but i like it still one bag that's still kind of everything's looking good though they're all holding pressure's just about right there we go that there is beautiful girl scout cookies ice water hash fresh frozen whole plant a few more farms here in tulsa grit beautiful that that looks a lot better than i thought it was going to that uh it's gorgeous i'm pressing that 180 on this i've been kind of changing all over the place on temperatures uh i'd like i like getting it off the plates as quick as possible you know i just don't want to have any reason for it to sit on there any longer going slower temperature wise lower temperature wise and i found this really is the best trade-offs on all sides because you're always going to give up something for something else speed temperature that's artwork right there we just need to put that up on the wall talk about expensive artwork bringing it up probably close to about three three thousand right now two thousand tons of psi i feel the bags are pretty much have given me all about all of it just want to make sure with having this many bags on there you kind of go the extra mile because some are just a little different definitely don't want to leave any i have to get this weight up see how many grams we really got off of here so the biggest thing about this is that i'm an ambassador now for triminator here in oklahoma so if you want to check out this press if you have one of these presses anything interested in it give me a call hit me up on instagram 9180g underscore and i'll be glad more than happy to show you answer any questions kind of just give you an idea in education we're going to be doing educational videos with terminator doing on the rosin education series and we'll have some really good information on there people just you know trying to get basic information not too overwhelming but also have some really good details for people that already know what they're doing just little tricks of the trade all right i really feel like that's about all i can get out of her fighting back on all the bags okay sorry i'm kind of concentrating on getting these out of here without making any mistakes and i didn't i don't know if the lighting in here will do it justice oh you can see all those terps in there beautiful the smell let's take a look at one of these bags on the bottom row that'd be the one with the least amount of power let's see how she looks so all you want to do one one good indicator of how well you did is to take a look at the bag through the light and how clear it is gives you a really good idea that you've got all of the product out of there you can see just pushed it out to the edges and that's going to be all your other material that you didn't want out of there anyways so very pleased let's look at that let's look at one on the top shelf and just see how they did comparatively all right taking a look at the same thing very similar they look pretty much identical this one has a little bit bigger that looks really good that's one thing about this product is just the hand pump everything about it being able to really feel the uh the pressure that i'm getting back and where i am in that bag so bva throw it out to them like great pump and the primary man you just can't beat it so let me know you guys want to check them out again i'm the ambassador here in oklahoma and um looking forward to putting out a lot of good uh educational videos and different types of", "cq7aL7VEwGI": "right here we're doing a review of the dab press sauce maker plate i just unboxed it came really well packaged uh you'd have had to uh pretty much run over it with a with a car to to mess this thing up and the way it was packaged so that's that's really good on the company they packaged it that well here's the back of it it's got a fuse there this is disconnectable this comes off standard power cord there it's got some instructions here for the temp control boxes maximum temperature range 0 to 400 degrees 110 voltage and a 600 watts as the energy consumption instructions turn on main switch start reading pretty obvious set a temperature between zero and four hundred main switch is uh there at the front yeah pretty basic there i'm just going to plug this in real quick here so i haven't actually plugged it in yet all right main switch what's going on here's the wrong one here it is all right here's the main switch it's pretty easy to adjust the temperature that's the on and off for adjusting you can adjust single digits uh your double digits here and then you want all the way up to triple digits let's just do a test to see what it takes to get to 400 for approximately how long it's all right do that go in there um let's take another look at the back too special this is made in china as we could probably guess uh still seems like a really really sturdy product there's uh came with a tool to disconnect just basically an allen wrench to disconnect these uh heating elements if you ever need to take them out and replace them the slab itself i believe it's all aluminum and it is quite heavy for the it's heavier than uh than i think either of these plates would be on their own and um much heavier than the the cooling plate that i have so i'll certainly get pretty warm already up to 100 and i bought this for making well for curing the cannabis for just experimenting and hearing it in different ways i know one of the ways i read to attempt to make uh thc diamonds you you leave the jar a seal jar something like this i think it'd be better to get something that feels better than this and you set that on there and you just leave your jars there something something that's sealed up so probably like a mason jar a small mason jar full of or at least maybe half full like this this one just has some dark 25 u bubble hash in it at the moment but something like that and you leave it there and says it can take weeks so i'm hoping this won't take too much hydro what does it does off to calculate it actually so yeah it's actually quite hot now i don't want to touch this 162 degrees fahrenheit i mean i can touch it but yeah offer any more than a second or two looks like it's gonna work well anyway for for what i need um another thing i thought of is you can use your you can use your main plates if you need for for for heating as well you need something to heat but this this jar doesn't quite fit in there and uh you know any small jars or medium-sized jars like that are not going to fit in uh there's not quite that much room really on either sides of the plates to really do anything like i had i had some situations where i wanted to heat just the paper the the parchment paper a little bit uh to to liquefy the stuff to get it off again there um and i know there's a cold plate but this was a different kind of product there that i was pressing that just kind of crystallized right away when it was down in heat so anyway i'll be using it for that and i think i'll have a few different uses for it we'll see it's a good tool to have and it complements the main press quite well i believe this was around 150 canadian and while being fairly expensive seems like it's well built and i could see this ah could see this lasting a lifetime perhaps i'll get lucky or at least at least hopefully five to ten years but because it depends on how how well it's used as you can see it's up to 250 now so it's just been a few minutes so it probably wouldn't take any more than five minutes to get up to 400 i'm guessing all in all i'm happy and i'm gonna post a video later on another day of the thing actually in use probably wait till i make something decent out of it using it to separate some terps and kind of condense the cannabinoids together hopefully so they'll have a terp sauce and some cannabis diamonds maybe if it works out if not then just kind of for curing the butt instead of an oven i really didn't want to have to use my oven because who wants to keep their oven on for days at a time it seems like uh that'd be pretty expensive on the hydro and uh it's also not down in my work area pretty much got whatever i need down here in the work area i got my fridge to keep the rosin uh freezer there for cold plates the whole outfit down here so it made sense to get this and have it down here as well to work with all right well i guess that's not that's that's the product pretty simple if the product should ever fail i'll probably let you guys know about that but all right zen express over and over now", "A4liVeDhO6g": "[Music] shoot [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] one [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]

you can tell from the title it is another honey butter rosin video if you guys didn't see my video where i i made a video where i said i bought a year old rosin and uh i decided to give him a second chance but i would like to say that there's in no way honey butter's fault that i bought that year old rosin it is the dispensary for selling me and partly my fault for not checking but sometimes when i get excited that they have a product i i don't check the manufacture date and the packaging thing is it just completely slips my mind but i encourage everyone to do that like learn from my mistakes but like i said this is in no way honey butter's fault or any way in any way and i like to mention that they actually contacted me from the uh for that video and they said that they're gonna send something my way so expect another video on honey butter to uh be on this channel but this one i personally bought myself at authentic uh this one is only three months old so it's not bad and uh i believe the last one i bought was flower rosin this is hash rosin for some reason i thought live rosin and hash rosin were made the same way or were the similar they're just named different i mean like uh live rosin and hash rosin i thought were the same thing but apparently there's there's levels to this [ __ ] right uh i don't know too much i don't know if i described on my live bronzing video how to make live rosin or hash rosin but i know that they have to like shake off the trichomes in the ice bag do micron bags and just press that afterwards with heat and pressure i know that stuff this is a collab from lit house i've heard many good things about their flower and as you can see right here it says full spectrum hash rosin lemon lava this is running at about 60 thc with about three point three seven percent cbd manufacture date of november 13 2020 uh best buy you know 11 13 20 20 all that stuff uh we'll see lemon lava hash rosin mendocino coast lit house uh they do come with this where they recommend what you uh okay so they say cold start okay i'll definitely try and oh wait this is for their bang okay i mean i'll do a cold start for this if i can most of the time it's hard for me but this looks like a freaking little puck right here right off the bat really smells like i mean i smell this light lemonness on it but it's more more of a plant very plant and buttery smell but we are gonna do this turn that on but we're gonna cold start this okay people have been asking for the cold starts for a while now you know so get them a cult start so this is interesting it's like a little puck very uh it's like a tootsie roll kind of consistency hopefully you can see it guys oh my god the ball got stuck all right we're good hold on so i want to do maybe a little little something some of the show let's do the flash too yeah bubbles what's it guys street bubbling up in there oh smells pretty good cheers guys wow very reminiscent of that that 710 labs i had slight ginger gingerness towards it it's weird wow that's a different taste very clean taste this was thirty dollars wow i would say that that live rosin that i had recently probably tastes a little bit better than this but this is pretty enjoyable let's let this warm up a little bit i don't get off i don't get rosin often guys but when i do it's cool you know what i'm saying but what i don't like is the certain type of people that think they're like better than everyone just because they smoke rosin it's like bro just stop like everyone's gonna smoke what they want regardless you know what i'm saying like if they want to smoke fake cartridges at the end of the day you really can't stop them if they smoke live resin or if they smoke hash rosin or whatever the [ __ ] you know you really shouldn't get mad at someone or think you're better than someone just because you're smoking more expensive stuff that's a very douchebag way of thinking and i know most of you guys aren't like that but there's some people in here that just like you gotta go hashtag i call them righteous rosin smokers and uh yeah we can we can deal without that like if you can get rosin like that every day or dab every day like more power to you but when you start stuffing it into people's face like i smoke rosie and i'm only rising weird get over it all right all right cheers maybe i should put more a little bit more a little something but damn authentic's coming in with the fire for cheap though not too much i'm just going to add a little bit to what's already in there be careful with rosin too i feel like it's dangerous stuff even more your bowls and stuff because there's a lot more of that stuff that usually is out of the live resin um but it stays in with the rosin you know that very that plant material with all that darkness you can see it we're gonna run this a little bit higher because i was told that rosin specifically has like a lot of fats and lipids that usually doesn't burn off with low temps so we're gonna run this again on the higher temp and we're going to end the video here but honey butter definitely a cop for 30 dollars it's definitely a steal like i know p2 peeps uh he lives in the bay shout out to p2ps by the way uh he pays like 50 for this and that's cheap for him 30 dollars is pretty cheap for rosin over here so um hopefully i can get some more but if not i'm glad that i was able to try it and you know for those of you who haven't tried rosin you should definitely pick it up i don't i think this is the only string they have that's dirty though oh yeah tastes like chocolate towards the end it's weird but yeah that is it for this hash rosin video uh let me know the difference between hash rosin and live rosin i thought they were the same thing but if you guys are know more about it let me know in the comments below but other than that honey butter appreciate the [ __ ] out of you guys for having such affordable rosin and yeah [Music]

we're gonna show you how to do it the right way so throw away those hair straighteners and let's get right into it rosin is a concentrate extracted from the cannabis plant using nothing more than heat and pressure the result a translucent sappy and sometimes shattered like product that is potent and flavorful enough to rival any of your favourite BHO products but what is the difference between rosin and other concentrates out there one word of solvents most concentrate extraction methods require the use of a solvent such as butane propane for co2 rosin however does not but how does the simplicity of heat and pressure transform cannabis into such an overwhelmingly great product the accumulation of trichomes trichomes are those small shiny bubbles that appear on marijuana believe it or not those microscopic bulbs actually contain most of the cannabis plants cannabinoids which provide most of the sense flavours and effects but can anyone easily make rosin themselves yes yes you can and will tell you how before you get started you will need a couple things a nug Smasher fresh flower micron extraction bags parchment paper and a dab tool grab everything you need aside from the canvas of course in a bundle at knucks master comm so now you're good to go let's jump straight into one very important factor starting product you may ask which nuts master gives the best results well the answer is all of them you get back what you put in it's as simple as that fire in fire out that is the number one most popular saying in the world of rosin because your extract will only be as good as your starting product if you put garbage into your oven at home it's not going to taste very good now how about a pizza it's gonna be the best thing you've ever tasted same goes for rosin if you put extremely potent trichome coated flowers into a nut Smasher mini well you're gonna get back some amazing rosin if you want high-quality results you need high quality products for tons of

the fact that 710 labs takes so much pride into the products that they all they do is just put in hard work and the results speak for themselves man they got people talking all over Instagram YouTube Twitter like I'm talking about like everywhere that I go everyone asked me as I have you tried seven ten have you tried seven ten and I've tried their hash rasen but I have not tried their what their Weed Man so I'm very very excited to get into this but for before we get into this man I have to give a big shout-out to today's sponsor man gothic comm where they sell bracelets pendants and rings super sick ass rings man well you can go buy some for your friends girlfriend whatever the case is man and you could use my own personal code savvy G to get a discount percentage of well I'll put everything down in the description below man go show them some support because a support of today's video guys alright honestly we're like I said I was ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that tastes so freakin good I already look at the depths what's already coming in that was the perfect dab I kid you not watch this I love waiting all right the reason I love waiting that much time it's because you just get the smoothest hits the milk is hits and then the Terps now I'm tick I'm talking about I can taste everything in this I can taste everything man it's phenomenal and after you're done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button and reach so let's try to get 400 K subs I mean 40 K subs boys that's the next call right and you guys are gonna help me do that guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day and we're out", "WE4H-gXnGJA": "yo what up boy bacon babe today I just wanted to do not really a Q&A but kind of respond to some of the questions that I've been getting in the comment section some of the comments as well we're not necessarily questions they're trying to tell me different ways to do things so I'm not opposed to taking advice only a fool would be but I am opposed to taking advice from people who are just talking but don't do if you don't actively press rosin don't tell me [ __ ] about how to do it because you don't know how to [ __ ] do it yourself I actually do it one of the comments that I had was that on one of my videos where I left a pre pressed puck inside the plates for too long while I was trying to prepare the camera so he did the material up a lot and when it came out it was a little bit darker than normal so a lot of people like to comment on that one and a lot of people are you know one person told me use less less pressure because you get more plant material in your end product and just let the heat lose it all out well that time [Music] Oh [Music] whoa whoa all right I'm still not over being sick completely sober all right so that's what I was saying um that's Bob that's backwards straight-up backwards you want more pressure less key you're not going to get more plant material in your product by using more pressure that's just not how it works the rosin bags that I use are 160 micron there from rosin evolution and they work perfect with my pre-press but you guys have to remember that when you're pressing out rosin the filtration bag excuse me those bags are not for filtration actually they're guesswork [ __ ] look they're just for containment so when you have that puck of flour and you go to press it it wants to expand and as it expands it will reach outside of those pressing plates and then you're not pressing that material anymore right so what the bags do is they don't filter to keep the plant material inside they just they keep it so that the plant material doesn't expand too far out because you could press nugs without any bags and still get all the oil without even collecting plant material the plant material only stays right along the very edge of the Google oil so again those bags aren't for filtering anything they're just for containment and make it a little bit easier what else pressing temperatures so temperatures - depending on your material you're gonna start as low as 180 and go anywhere up to like - 30 to 40 the fresher the material is the less heat that you need to use also the less time you need to press it if material is not the right humidity you're gonna have to press it for longer and you're not gonna get as good of a yield usually 60 to 70 percent relative humidity for your but it's good to start with and I'll usually press it fresh material like starting around 185 190 and if I'm not getting the yield I want but I'm getting the quality then I'll increase the the temperature by about 10 degrees until I start seeing the yield that I want now when you increase the temperature got to remember it's like a it's like a sliding scale right and right where they cross those two lines cross that's the perfect like settings right temperature time pressure so what you're trying to do is you're trying to get to keep high enough to make all of the oil lose out without degrading the actual material right so it's heat that degrades it not pressure so ideally you want as much pressure as possible without blowing out your bags right or breaking your parchment with as little heat as possible necessary to facilitate the flow of oil out of the material usually that ends up being around a thousand psi on your plates so for example my plates are 22 square inches right now to hit a thousand psi you know you're gonna have to get up there around like 13 14 tonnes because you take the max pressure that you're putting out so let's say you're putting out 10 tons that's 20,000 about 20,000 pounds of pressure now you divide that by the surface area of your plates which for me is 22 right and so I end up needing to be somewhere around like what is it I think like 15,000 psi or 15 tonnes will give me about a thousand psi so do the math on your own the base of yes the max pressure you want to get to and then you just change your temperature based on that so the higher the temperature the faster your product will start to flow right now this is where it starts getting tricky and it's a sliding scales because your temperatures too high you degrade your product but if it's too low then it has to sit in there and between those heated plates were too long even though it's a lower temperature it has to sit in there too long in order to start flowing and get the final yield so now you end up with the degrading product so like I said it's a sliding scale you want to have a high enough temperature so that you don't have to press too long but you don't want to have it too high to where it's degrading the product and then your pressure you're just going to keep ramping up the pressure until you don't get any more yield out of it so that ends up being like like I said fresh material 180 to 190 and about two and a half to three minutes for fresh stuff and then for older stuff it's usually I go a little bit higher and press rike around 210 or so for about three or four minutes but it also depends on the type of rosin that you want so a lot of people would see this and be like oh man that looks like like a big bunch of doodoo but this is your super Turkey stuff that's been pressed out at about 180 185 so you're gonna get more of the oily sheen on there right you're gonna get a lot of Terps and it comes out more like a sauce and this is cured this has been cured for about two weeks now and so this is just super super stable and this is really [ __ ] bomb but a lot of people don't like material that looks like this and keep in mind this would be super golden if I were to thin this out but a lot of people want like ghost rosin which is the stuff that is so clear you can almost see through it but people are into the purple rosin now there's a lot of trends but you can't let the color dictate everything because it's not just about the color right because of this stuff fresh bud pressed out at 180 there's a little bit darker and more Turkey than stuff that I've pressed out at higher temps of the same bud I pressed out at 2:30 you know and I've gotten slightly different looking material it was more shatter consistency way lighter color even though it was a way higher temperature right almost 40 degrees higher same pressed time actually was a little bit shorter with the higher temperature because it started to flow faster so I didn't have to press it as long you know this is some more 190 190 180 but you know you can get all different types of colors and consistencies and the point is that it doesn't necessarily dictate the quality it just dictates the parameters that were used when they pressed it so let's see what else you guys want to know cover filter bags temperature pressure time collection don't collect on anything too cold I made the mistake of collecting on top of some dry ice there was a protective surface in between but still the cold got the the rosin too condensate and create some moisture on top of the rosin and that's just because it got too cold so now I added moisture where I don't want to I want to remove it so that's a conditional time to cure and get that out properly but make sure that you have I would say like a couple is regular ice packs and then put it like a cookie sheet and I still look on mat on top of that and that should be enough to keep it just cool enough to collect easily but not getting moisture on it Oh a lot of people asked me about the the paper I use PTFE squares so I don't use parchment the reason I don't use parchment is because 90% of the markets parchment paper is covered in silicone silicon is very very easily broken down by a lot of different terpenes specifically D limonene which is very high and a lot of Turkey buds and so when you go to press you'll notice you have your little circle your puck of Bud and then around that puck there's like little box where it looked like it seeped through the paper or the bud is eating through the paper and that's actually the the terpenes eating through the silicon and then getting through the parchment paper so what happens when that happens is the silicon gets broken down by those terpenes and then when you're scraping up your rosin you're actually scraping up bits of broken down silica that get into your rosin and then when you when you ignite that or vape it burn it whatever that's toxic silica is extremely toxic when ignited and ingestion so those of you that are pressing on silicon treated parchment paper still chances are they're silica in your material you may not notice it but it's there now it seems a little bit easier to collect material off of parchment compared to PTFE if you do not have the correct temperature to collect it on if I were to place ice packs underneath this and then collect my material it comes up extremely easy way easier than parchment nothing gets stuck to this it's the most nonstick one of the most nonstick surfaces known and unlike parchment paper that is only heat treated or heat rated up to like 400 450 degrees PTFE is heat rated up to 500 degrees and pressure rated up to 500 pounds I think it is which is pretty significant nothing breaks through this in my experience I have not broken through a single PTFE sheet so that's why I use these I got a pack of one thousand four by four squares for 125 bucks from turkey roof comm or you can check out the version PTFE roll if you guys are doing bulk compressing with larger presses get a whole roll of this this is 14 inches across and I think this sheet was like maybe safety ET or something like that and this was like I think 100 something bucks it's worth it so think that covers and yeah it's depressing show me what you guys got if you guys have any questions comments please drop them below this was a very impromptu video I was gonna do like a whole little script and make sure I covered each bullet point but dabs happened and then I just started talking and here we are now so that said you guys have any questions about processing material growing anything like that drop them below I reply to almost every single comment if it's worthy of a reply show me what you guys would like to see in the next video and if you guys have any material that you want processed and you know the Southern California area hit me up and I'll press your stuff for you and I'll show you what it's like happy dabbing I'm about to hit this and I'm gonna be out of here [Music] [Music] we're hearing all the stuff in my email probably today because I'm impulsive and I have money right now all I need is another control box similar to the one that I built for my rosin press a PID controller and a plug-in spot for the coil that I already have so it shouldn't cost me a more than about a hundred bucks and I'll be able to build the control box for for the email and I won't be torturing anymore because [ __ ] this shit's annoying especially because I smoke in the grow room now because my wife is pregnant and I'm not trying to have her getting all secondhand smokey up in this [ __ ] so I don't smoke in the living room anymore which is where I usually chill and play video games so I got a run in here to take dabs or smoke and then run back out there in between rounds or games it's like man I wish the [ __ ] was just always lit always torched up ready to go I could just come in here drop it down and be out but I got to spend like a good minute and a half [ __ ] torching this [ __ ] up to get it clean and then let me cool off but it's all good oh yeah the I don't have any packs in here with me but I did make these little gel packs I rosin in coconut oil this shake is for I take four of those it's a wrap a rat I was in Chicago for business with my lady over this past week and that was what I would do I didn't take any flour and dab anything to smoke at all all I took was those pills I was a pill-popping animal and she would hate me like 3045 minutes after I take them and it was just kale like chili Hey [ __ ] dog barking for no reason Cheers [Music] I can't wait to not be sick [Music] whoo [Music] alright that's it for me they can be about catch you guys next time", "AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel

phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me

understand the purple lotus was started up you know quite different than i think a lot of other dispensaries and especially dispensaries in san jose were established it was just established by my by my wife and i was in a situation where i had a lot of money that i was coming into this with a huge investment or anything and just lost you know money doing in a business venture um it was kind of my first forte into business that lost a lot of money was credit card debt but we started up the shop with a very small amount of money about fifteen thousand dollars when i opened the shop i had you know just four jars of marijuana about a little less than two pounds of marijuana i mean this this place over here really set us off i mean you would have people flocking from all over this area to to come on a daily basis it became a community of people the landlord that i was leasing from was leasing to another dispensary upstairs so we had we had competition up there and all humility you know they were closed within about three months of us being there um you know we just my motto was to reinvest that product you know i sold the original product and then i made the sacrifice didn't hire anybody i worked for a year straight just myself right there every day all day and just put all the money back in the product and that increased business and so many people were such strong advocates because they saw what we were about which was first of all people love great cannabis they love great wheat so we had great weed at the good price and then we were good people we got more involved in the community and because people came every day we became you know they became part of our lives we became part of theirs also when we first moved in here i mean i would park up here every day and then at night time i would take the bud with me inside ikea bags for the first maybe three months because i didn't really have a good safe situation so i would take it with me at the end of the night bring all the cannabis back with me the next morning i said this was popping up here as much as i like to at the time say that they weren't you know people smoking people you know a lot going on up here in the parking lot we ended up needing to get a guard up here to ensure that everything was all cool everything was all cool but they came from every which way they came by car they came by bike scooter walking because these apartments right here and all this area around here you know the bus stops right there this was a community right here people are proud to say that they came here to jackson you hear people say oh i've been coming here since jackson great great great memories from this place fought hard to stay here you know didn't work out but uh this will always be the original [Music] spot we barely squeaked into our next location over on lundy it was it was a rough move i mean it was not a successful situation at all it's very tough to get somebody to lease to us during that time it's not like now it's still very federally legal and people are really concerned we paid six months in advance and got the place over here and once again from day one we had issues um you know just especially in this place this has a shared uh it's an office building uh as a shared air conditioning unit by this time we were carrying a large supply of marijuana and uh the whole buildings just stunk like even though this is not far away people felt like it was far away so this was always a place where we were waiting for white road this is you know we had white road that we were building out while we were here so we struggled through this place they wanted to evict us from day one we fought through that and ended up staying for six months while the business i don't think grew a lot of customers during that time what we did is we grew a lot of resilience during that time we used to tell them hey uh you'll find this over by the loading dock you know you know that's i believe at one point we ran an extension cord from way over here down to the street just so that we could sit there and put a light out so that people could know that we could tell them that there's a light down there because it was so dark you would miss this because this is a building that closes at nighttime except for if you're selling wheat up here then it closes a lot later [Music] this was the nicest place we had built out beautiful place it was formally been a bar and we just made it really nice restored the bar had it all set up to serve it was really right in the middle of where at that point a good portion of our patient base was that opened up people were lined out everybody they were fighting to be the first person to say that they were the first person to come through the door um you know my mom came to pictures of all of us so happy to be opening up this great location we have been working for months to get it we didn't have a lot of money evicted from the other spot this other spot unlucky wasn't working out so you know we got this set up big day our biggest day ever still had the other location open but pushing most of the people down here feeling great eight o'clock sheriff's come tell us we need to close this it just happens to be this whole area is san jose and this corner right here out of all this area annexed to the county and the city had given us a business license for the address but it still fell underneath the county zone and the county at that time it had a ban on all cannabis activity even though san jose city allowed it this was a beautiful place we put all of our resources into and they closed this place down right here it was a big blow it hurt especially after only being open for about 10 hours [Music] you know 903 was was a blessing i didn't see it at the time but blessings come hidden and you know looking at the spot there's only about eight parking spots assigned to us but see how you can make that work especially with the employees and you know us needing parking we ended up uh leasing a little spot next door for parking um and making it work we put four or five security guards there at about a 50-yard uh uh distance and they just funnel people in and out in and out in and out it was a 4 20 weekend hey what year we moved in over there and uh it was actually it was a convention there's a big hemp con or something in town and uh we did 42 42.8 you know out the door and by that time we had built our our our venue up to 30 or 35 strains good bud 42 out the door and it you know it worked so well that we just kept it moving from there we just decided hey this works and we just kept on doing it and we kept on selling at 42.8 and it became just very popular we got to the point that it was you know we were running five six hundred people a day in through what was a 600 square foot retail sales floor with eight parking spots i'll tell you man one christmas day we're the only shop open man lined up from here all the way down to the head man waiting to get inside the facility we were the only club open on christmas we've been we never closed from the first day we opened we never closed we never been closed for one day we've been open for i think it's coming up on 4 000 days in a row no matter what happened we opened almost 4 000 days in a row [Music] listen lou gehrig type street [ __ ] you

you're watching this hope it's going great for you we've got a little video here I haven't really done many of these but a lot of other cannabis content creators do these videos and I think a lot of people enjoy it we've got some strain reviews coming up today and of course we're starting with the hottest hash on the alerting rec market happy cabbage farms so happy cabbage farms they came into camp in probably about four months ago I don't know exactly when they came on to the Oregon rec market but at the time it was a pretty Minzy era in the Oregon rec market here in Benton there was just a lot of the companies have really slipped towards the end of the summer and a lot of their stuff really wasn't tasting as good as it was towards the beginning of the summer then comes heavy cabbage farms with hash robison and we don't see hot rods in a lot in the rec market because it's such an expensive and kind of niche product there's not very many people that are searching to pay a lot of money for hash rasam but when you [ __ ] try this hash frozen you're just sucked right on back in guys it is ridiculous this stuff I will tell you I have tried tons of hot rods and a lot of the times I'm going to say that's my favorite hat rosin because I don't get to try it very often happy cabbage now has been around for about four months and they are a group in our circle it's just been around I've gotten to dab it a lot and I've gotten to dab a lot of other hash rosin because I don't have to pay for it other people have it and I will tell you guys there's a couple strands that I have not liked from them but these four right here that I have are so titties I would stick my face between all of them and motorboat myself to death this is hands-down the best half rosin I have ever smoked and it's on the wreck more kit if you are over 21 you can buy this you don't have to [ __ ] buy it black market you don't have to pay the $120 for black market six star hash rosin it gets it cannot expensive for a while there guys so to see a company coming out with stuff that's between sixty and seventy five dollars and medic maybe even cheaper than that that's super impressive and just such a breath of refreshing air so this guy I've got open right here first thing when I open it this is the purple starburst og six star like just what in there is just a bad thing to say let's take a look at what we going got going on in this jar alrighty here we have the purple starburst og 6 star you guys can see it's nice and flaky there's no real huge clumps partly because I dabbed a lot of them partly because it is 6 star and it is just gorgeous look at that color sorry for the shaking I'm filming on my phone they check that out just absolutely gorgeous I am completely enthralled with the look of this rosin I'm enthralled with the look as well as the smell a second you open up this up you get hit in the face with the real ocean groan oh gee smell and it's been a long time since we've gotten that we're getting more chem more gassy oh geez out here this is real ocean groan oh gee and then on the end of it is like this almost faint hint of like purple lavender not in a floral way at all but in a very very gassy way like I can't even begin to explain this we're gonna go ahead and take it yeah we got two rigs out today we first we're gonna start out with the prophecy glass and get a little function shot and I'll shop for you guys we don't have the cleanest rigs or bangers today just kind of caught me on an off cleaning day but maybe we should still be able to see that function right we're gonna start off with the purple starburst it guys this stuff is absolutely amazing I cannot tell you how much I recommend going and trying just the strain right here all of happy cabbage farm is fantastic this strain right here hands down my favorite let's go ahead and get her heat it up and get into some freakin turf skies I am excitement for this video you can not believe how hard it is to have four jars of happy cabbage sitting in a drawer knowing you can't smoke it because you have to come with it it's literally heartbreaking I also want to give them a huge shout out for sponsoring the 420 of it at the Pacific Circle that was absolutely amazing they set up a tab bar anybody that came by could have their stuff a company that produces this high a product of this high quality of product just allow anybody to come up and smoke it no no [ __ ] questions asked is just amazing huge shout out to them for that call that good set a timer for 45 seconds alright we're gonna go ahead get in here and scoop ourselves out a nice flaky dab of this gorgeous six star here we go guys first dab of the half cab farms Cheers [Music] oh good lordy that is so delicious straight to the head immediately my whole head warm fuzzy dice feels delicious but you just know media we have strongest it because it hits you momentarily after you take it down man is a good video to be filming guys yeah I also got to say this is mind-bending how good that flavor is and how much flavor there is usually with a lot of even really good tasting dabs only a small percentage of flavor this there is a large percentage of flavor in that [ __ ] strain it is amazing how much you get out of it I love it for our first thing to have in the morning like if you got one dab to set your whole day straight that's it right there that purple starburst og alright move on to the next string I believe this one was a collab width Oh pull on a stick and throw it into my house I rip the [ __ ] alright I threw the Box away in the heavy collab on it [ __ ] oh no without gaps in garden Gadsden Gardens okay this one is a collab with Gadsden garden and this is Tropicana punch now this one has a much much different look to it let me give you guys an initial smell test it was like pomegranate and man what is that that is a good [ __ ] smell right there it was like pomegranate and fish I'm not like just weed but the actual cush like when you're exhaling a cush strain it smells like that oh man that's delicious now this one has a much different look to it way more waxy was this one what was this one called no just Tropicana punch hash rosin not six-star not their batter or their jam just hash shots but still absolutely delicious looking kind of looks like peanut butter and this was not what I do what it looked like when they gave it to me when it was cold it was much much more pretty and hadn't like waxed up into this solid state yet still [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna switch it up we've got the DBE 503 slimeball rig all ready to go over here a dab of this junk ambush I believe this is the one that gave me a job on the night of 4/20 and I was just absolutely mind blown by how good the flavor of it was so much rudiness to it but still keeping a really nice base in the OG gas cushy that kind of a chem that kind of a taste so I'm keeping it sweet waste in there but still having some food on top I'm a big fan of fruity strains but when I have to smoke all day every day it's not my favorite I really really want the Kim gasps og scum push stuff like that all right that's all set a timer 45 seconds that's not that's not the right dance isn't it there was a dude I'm just gonna stop him all right if vijaya tease this one's a lot easier to load up I'm just gonna take this a nice big chunk here boom I am gonna be so blitzed by the end of this guy's four dabs of hatch rosin and that I haven't gotten into this yet but I'm sure you guys read the title we're taking out Widowmaker at the end but yeah let's do it [ __ ] drop the dead Cheers [Music] [Music] get right with that safe before really really fruity but it keeps its [ __ ] feet planted firmly in a nice little og tastes good very clean - I mean like of course there's no solvents in it but a lot of other people's half-frozen I get a a wheezing in my lungs and that's usually the reason I stay away from hats Rossum as you guys can hear [Music] there is some coffee but there's no wheeze and that is what I love about this stuff it just seems so clean so pure you're tasting exactly what this amazing weed was meant to taste like guys we're going nips out go the [ __ ] nips out Jesus Christ two tabs of hash rosin in we've got the purple starburst and oh wait no the Tropicana punch and the purple starburst yeah okay yes yes boom so we've got punch breath up next this is their jam and this one unfortunately has slowly disintegrated in a series of very unfortunate dabs that were completely unavoidable but I think a little bit left so we have something for this video right here I'm gonna zoom the camera in so you guys can see it's really really clear and very very light in color but it is so ganbei good I can't even begin to tell you guys how many Terps they've got packed into that gorgeous little [ __ ] doing GM glove there when you get in this one it immediately has like a purple smell I use that to describe a lot away I don't know what the purple smell is I don't know what I'm describing there I'm sure there's some people out there that are gonna be like yeah and there's some people are gonna be like what the [ __ ] he's that high already but it does it smells purple purple with a hint of fruit punch on the end that's exactly what I'm getting clenched breath and it's really really cool how true their flavors are guys like you can't even begin to tell you how many other hot rods and strings like taste we're like this one's strong in and you taste it that's great it's amazing how many people just they'll name their strains anything just because that's what's hype that's what's selling right now these guys they've just got some fire a sweet in fire ass hash on the way out switching it back up again to the prophecy glass for our punch breath dab here I'm gonna go ahead and heat this up man guys given that Widowmaker at the end it's gonna be so brutal I have already baked like a cupcake my gourd is gone stone to the bone I just [ __ ] rent I think you guys a good idea of how ripped I am I've taken two gaps and I already am starving I don't feel like I need a turf map two naps like I thank you I'm taking seven gram damage guys this we just took like maybe point one maybe and I'm already ready for a turf down at the end of this I'm going to pass out right here after I've ordered new greens call it good BAM wham Shazam set timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla alright let's go ahead scrape ourselves out some of this leaving just enough left to put into our Widowmaker jab guys we got we got some crazy stuff going with a maker jab this punch breath was definitely one of my favorites it was a lighter high than the six star starburst og but had just about the same percentage of flavor it's fan-fucking-tastic really allowed me to go about my day if I was smoking it in the morning before say a meeting or something it would be really good for that not if you were gonna go out and want a dad that was gonna last you three to four hours that would be the purple starburst six star that stuff is just [ __ ] tits it is so strong BAM Thank You Carla let's take this damn choose people it's tons tons and tons of flavor [Music] [Music] now we got the sweats going big time holy Jebus how is it is hot in here oh my god keeping you close holy [ __ ] this was a good fight hey promised the Widowmaker again oh [ __ ] turf sweats aren't [ __ ] real oh my god whoa next up we got some margarita punch six star don't let the nips cool off for a second here wow that overheated a needle is in the red Oh rubbie oh my god I completely forgot we have water over here not sponsored by but shout out the can event for carrying the happy cabbage four guys are in Central Oregon looking for a place to pick this stuff up get a man got it they got so many different strains oh yes we got one left guys we've got the margarita place six star same with the starburst og let's go ahead and take peak here in this jar very very flaky but it is all stuck together none of it is gonna fall out I don't believe ya all stuck in there when I first got it was flaky like if you sneezed it would go everywhere like a pile of blow it was pretty [ __ ] flaky oh man oh man this one probably actually I'm gonna have to take my my vote back for the smell this one has better smell than the purple starburst dojin form starburst oh gee I do believe tastes better but god damn margarita punch they're definitely a hint of that tropic punch in there but there is a kick what is that kick gasps that is straight gasp oh man yeah once you get past that punch just gassy oh that is good it doesn't have the og smell of the purple starburst I mean it is just Tropicana punch instead of deep purple starburst OG um but it does have a massive undertone of some gassy flavors go ahead keep the slime ball ring up last one and probably take a little two-minute walk around the house and then we're gonna dive into that way a but nothing's more currently done I am so big guy so I can feel my hind legs coming down [ __ ] just set a timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla thank you very much I can feel my eyelids coming down like heavy hard it is I'm gonna be in for a real long afternoon here we got a photo we got the Gus glass show circle tonight [ __ ] I'm gonna be licking windows all night long guys so yeah super flaky super super potent smell let's get some [ __ ] taste in here oh yes oh yes wants to scrape it all off the bottom it is super flaky again yep all right we got a margarita punch six star and hash browns and over here I bring a ball right up in clothes for you guys kitchens function off the first initial hit oh my god I need a new cord after this video it's not even baked out of it it's just oh [ __ ] cheers everyone a lot more gas when you smoke it less of the push flavor than the go wow they're really not my favorite in terms of flavor definitely not bad whatsoever it's still delicious I'm probably ranked this number three the Tropicana punch probably be my least favorite out of the four but honestly I would buy all four strains again thanks they say that they're that good all scraped up on a piece of paper see if we can get it um damn er and then we will take a lap mop it off a bit and take this [ __ ] Widowmaker all those cobbles alright we got our four grams right here I have completely forgotten which one goes to which cap so that will be interesting we're just going to go ahead and see if we can take this damper here and get some of each of these on here it's not going to be a monster dabbe but I mean big enough for some fun boom there's our starting scoop of the punch breath now this is this is the margarita punch now this is gonna be a little difficult this stuff is so flaky I'm not quite sure we might have to get like a spoon for this so I'm gonna just take some of this and yeah there's no way it's gonna stick on there take that off and then last but not least we need the what what was this I forget [ __ ] I think I've lost more oil in here than I got out definitely alright well there's that there's what I've got and there's also some on this damper too this stuff has all different consistencies let me see if I can't like splurge some of this long as dabber just smush it all together that's kind of working I'd say that's working pretty damn good alright let's look at our dab here guys oh [ __ ] yeah oh Jesus alright alright let's let's get her going oh my god this is gonna be fun I literally didn't move any of this because I was terrified that the dab would fall off the dabber I think we are very lucky and fortunate that we got all that hash onto a bro without any of it falling off I didn't I think that was going to happen as this on a monster Widowmaker but like I was saying before guys - dabs in I was pretty [ __ ] toasted we're at a point now where I am just I'm good at I could be good for today for smuggling I am [ __ ] why are we doing this because you got your [ __ ] awesome but I love each and every one of you that's why we're [ __ ] doing this get in there fam calling that good guys this is

always please be kind to one another Cheers I'll see you guys soon", "YqHusgV-caQ": "everybody how you doing as promised I would give you a video featuring my new prototype kt20 mini press then I just got in today from CR D so what are we going to use to inaugurate this well never gonna go with some GTI's star tribe picked it up today at the healing center of Monroeville I have rehydrated it with spinach leaf as you can see right here there is spinach leaf here so I'm going to get rid of the spinach leaf and we shall press the flower because the rehydration process is definitely done what it's supposed to do here do this out yeah I'll tell you what I the the pictures do not do this press justice it is a completely amazing piece of functional artwork that Chas Ryan at CRD out in Oxnard California he's the one that you want to get your presses from trust me on this for the price point for the features the engineering that goes into this you can't beat this guy now we are gonna press not 1/8 but to we're gonna do the entire quarter press and we're going to use my nug Smasher 160 micron 7 brand bags I haven't used these before I've only either used the big 14 grand ones or I use the the regular eight ones three and a half gram that I normally use but since this is a new bag our new size bag for me I'm going to try it out let's see how it works for us this stuff absolutely amazing the rehydration process went flawlessly we've got seven grams of rehydrated flour we've got 160 micron nub Smasher back and we are going to load it up with this green and turn it into gold for everybody that's the thing and you want to turn green into gold this is how you do that using a machine like mine you guys can get one to his prices are if you compare feature for feature capacity for capacity with any other manufacturer bras and presses you won't even come close to the value but you get ordering from this man here and we'll customize it any way you want you want different size plates you want a hydraulic ram instead of a hand they'll do all that for you but make it any color you want to put your logo on it anything you want the man is there to serve and he does an amazing job as long as FedEx doesn't mess up the shipment it's all good so here is our quarter in our bag we're gonna I'm going to trim this off a little bit here make it a little easier to get in the press and I already got the paper in the press I got the press heated up to 200 degrees that is my normal pressing temperature for anything I'm doing for myself I am now going to move this and put this on the plate now I'm going to move the camera that you can see what's going on give me just a moment here let's get this moved over here there we go let's get this lighting situation a little better so we can do here just bear with me I don't have any helpers today on the camerawork so trying to do this all myself and if we're lucky I'm going to get to see this thing - its drip tech it's usually pressing quarters I can get that to work so right there that's where we want to be let's bring down the hammer okay all right a little tension on that paper now I'm gonna bring this down okay let's get this up here actually you know what that's the problem those magnets didn't hold very well it's okay I got these he's worth just fine all right there we go now get the camera in here so you can see it really really well they just kind of move in look at that view right there and that beautiful okay there it is there's the slug now that's you a nice view of it let's bring the pressure together oh we're almost at the heat some point already that's good that's real good loving this and move the lighting a little bit give you better better angle how's that yeah get you nice and focused in on that bag cause you're gonna start seeing the magic happen I am slowly bringing these plates together in a controlled way just like with the original design of the mini it has a weighted handle which aids in controlled pressure without the need of a gauge again it's one of the features that I really like about his presses besides the fact that they're user serviceable which is again just priceless and its value let's see what the star tribes doing I hope everybody got to the dispensary today and got some of that flour before it before it went away at least all the good stuff I you know they were rationing it out I couldn't get as much of the birthday cake as I wanted for sure and the star tribe I grabbed only because it was the closest thing to 30% I could find so we're gonna do our best with this we're gonna get the best medicine we can but tomorrow morning gonna be in line at the dispensary Monroeville at the healing center because I heard that they got a nice drop a prime flower tonight so I'm gonna be there I'm gonna get it so I can press it at the event at the Monroeville Convention Center this weekend the holistic wellness Expo body mind and spirit is going to be going on at the South Hall and I will be featured there along with my friends sloth we will be pressing rosin both dispensary flower and hemp CBD it's going to be educational it's going to be a lot of fun and it's definitely going to DANC up the entire venue it's gonna be great had a great time in March doing this got an interview with dispense magazine back then they just published it today in this newest edition of dispensed magazine look for it in your local dispensary or at some vape shops that are around the carry it there's a really really nice article in there that they did about an interview that I had back in March with them and an event very similar to this one this will be a much bigger event so I'm hoping that everybody shows up there's gonna be a lot of people coming through I'd be a lot of flower getting pressed I promise you that so I'm gonna start adding some more pressure now and we're gonna start seeing some production here pretty quickly I would imagine there we go you can already soon as I added just a little more pressure to it there it goes there it goes look at how beautiful that is a happy happy plant properly rehydrated pressed with care and we're gonna get some awesome medication out of this you can't be in a hurry with rosin you just can't okay this is a craft this isn't a science it's not hobby this is a something that takes a lot of dedication to your craft so if you don't have this kind of dedication you might as well not even do this just by concentrates in the dispensary and pay outrageous prices if you're real serious about medicating these presses pay for themselves and savings very very quickly I know the cost is high this press here is the new design it's probably going to run somewhere just under $700 I'm not exactly sure on the pricing go to WWE rd online comm for his current pricing and you can also set up how you want it modified because he will customize it for you look at that beautiful gold coming out of that green that's what I do people I turn green into gold now question is is it gonna flow off these plates we're gonna find out back up here okay I'll back the camera up refocus it right down here and see if I get a little closer right there okay watch the mat because I'm about ready to tilt this thing yeah just a little tight from production but here it is if this thing tilted I'm gonna come back out here so that you can see how it's tilted you see that that's its trick get this stuff off the heat quickly and it's already starting to drip people see that there's your dripping starting right there so let's give it a little more love right here try to keep my fingers off the plates Pop's Malta's they are hot look at that and it's a happy plant right there just given us it's beautiful essence this is the soul of this plant and we are getting the best of it treating it well pressing it with care here's a nice look at that I'm going to take the camera off of here and give you a nice look what's coming off these plates look look at that just gorgeous so bring it around I'd give you a whip up underneath there we go back out of this you see this here's all our medicine trying to come off that heat look at the drips it just drips oh my gosh it stuff is just pouring off of here and then if you look carefully as it drops you can see little rosin webs form sometimes really really cool stuff I'm gonna put this thing back in the cradle now so that I can reposition this I'll pull out just a little bit so you can see what it's doing add a little more a little more pressure see if you can't lose some more mature there you go there's a nice rosin web coming off of there yes look at the color on it it's so beautiful just gorgeous oh yeah it's still still just given itself to us you know this is love right here this is love for this plant the plant loves you back you know that's what this is about making medicine better medicine then it comes flowers great you start off with great flower you end up with really great medicine not always the biggest yields but always good quality all the end quality out with pressing rosin if your rosin doesn't come out looking like this it's dark and sappy doesn't snow right doesn't taste right your flower sucks I don't care who we are go back to the drawing board and grow some better flower you know I'm sorry but this press never lies its crucible always was and it will tell you if your flowers not not tip-top now the lighting is not giving you an accurate look at what this stuff actually how nice it looks under here the color is just amazing so let's think we're done with the major drip edge so we're gonna flip it back up we're gonna step back out of there move the camera and we're back up here together get the lighting going on and there you go there's now we're at the final stage but getting further along in our press now so we're going to keep monitoring it for both the pressure and the color and the production I'm starting to add a little bit of pressure very very gently I don't want to have a blowout the color on this is just amazingly beautiful just gorgeous yeah there it is see it really well there and it is still producing medicine this this plant is very very happy GTI is knocking it out the park with just about everything they're coming out with that's in the upper THC range prime again just fantastic results and of course grass roots those are my three tops if you asked me what flower to get you can never go wrong with any of those three growers ever you can sometimes catch something good from Cresco you can sometimes catch something good form alehrer sometimes from Terrapin not very often but sometimes but if you were producing rosin if this is what you do you stick with those three until there's others that come along to prove themselves worthy because up to now there are the only ones who consistently put out product and quality that makes pressing medicine from that flower not only easy but just darn right damn well enjoyable I love doing this it's so satisfying to me you know it's like those videos you watch on YouTube that oddly satisfying videos this is what this is for me but it's real life so still getting a lot of production out of this it's just not happening quite as quickly and I am really wanting to err on the side of caution with these new bags I really don't want to have to clean up a blowout but I'm gonna keep giving it a little bit more I got to get a feel for how these bags feel on the press one we're at max pressure I think we're just about or we need to be just don't want to see plant material squirting out between these plates that would kind of put a bummer on it for me and I think we're about done here production seems to a slow due to almost nothing definitely at max pressure here don't ruin that so let me get my magnets put them back and we shall see what we got from GT I start right there we go [Music] and unlike my older version of my over press and get this back out here sorry about that and get you all team back into what I'm doing over here okay I mean can you um can you get me centered up here and tighten it back down oh look at that perfectly pressed puck no blowout right at the edge of it though right at the edge almost had one that's good good good now let this go down let me okay very good so we'll give this a general cooldown [Music] let's see when we get off the paper don't forget you got a lot of stuff sitting over here that came off the plates early but for right now we're gonna get what it it has on the paper so is it gonna gather up okay it's a little on the southeast side nothing I haven't experienced before with this strain so I'm not worried about it just takes a little bit different approach I'm just gonna perch this a little more patiently I'm just gonna take our time go over this paper very carefully now we're gonna get up all the good stuff there we go this is gonna be nice we're gonna weigh it up gonna see what our yield was for the 7 grams of flour that went in how much did we get back in medicine and again understand that all I'm doing all this process is is removing the unneeded plant material from the effective compounds in the flour it's all we're doing here difference is just not using chemicals just use a beat and pressure it's very green every byproduct yields the additionally valuable products", "e9i7qFYpXzI": "okay should be back now we should be back now all right hopefully the stream stays up i just kept you guys on the battery [Music] cheers we're gonna get into this straight away after a dab that was a lot of work you know and we're going to blast the room with some chili chills real quick it's gotten a little bit warm i turned

[Music] um so as those other cannabinoids get pressed out at the higher pressures you'll see the color change slightly this ever so slightly towards the end of the press just passing five tons uh he's

at that it's about to move on the right it's about to move you see it i have two more presses to go and then collection so probably about 25 minutes 30 minutes okay i'm gonna go ahead and wake up okay yes that sounds now but seriously you guys this is all credit to the farmer man you guys know how it is i have my finesse as a processor but at the end of the day i can only extract what's there to begin with i can't create something from nothing so this is all about me just finessing that hambone drip see where there's a single drip you can see the color on it wait until i get my hands on this the equipment that's going in there so i can give it to my electrician he's gonna come out and run me um you know properly underground through conduit to the shed and then uh all i'll tamp down the uh the foundation the gravel and then um i'm gonna have a plumber come out too try and get something going with this plumbing but i have february to get it sorted so i'm not really in a rush rush they're not really big jobs either neither one of them you just hit eight got a good extraction there those mass i am going to make some progress on that soon i've been really busy but luckily things have been lining up timing wise you know you guys i had to get the whole kind of room reset done and deal with the botched clone issue and then now we're good to go so it's just off to the races you know off to the [ __ ] races i got the controller project coming in in about a week um to two weeks out probably from getting those parts in so i've been trying to get the room ready to go and get that sorted and wash all of hound bones material i had to get caught up on because i was focusing on harvesting and all of that you know i had quite a bit of material backlogged that i needed to wash for for hambone and for myself like the next wash that i'm going to do is probably going to be still not even my own stuff it's going to be probably here he grows endless summer number three nug run

[Music] so he makes really good videos i wish i had his production skill and time but i have kids and a wife and a job and yeah it's hard to do it all not there yet i've shown how to make okay rosin from [ __ ] plenty of times [Music] not everything i do comes out looking like this [Music] [Music] and i'm not here to teach you how to make [ __ ] in the gold i'm not here to tell people polish turds i'm not here to help people make fire from the get-go you don't polish turds on this channel [Music] [Music] i had my weightlifting day as i moved past that i got more important [ __ ] to worry about the lifting weights my whole life it's awesome to stay in shape and be healthy but humans don't stay stationary and lift weights we do functional movements it's good to be functional and get out of there you know it's not hard to always work with excellent material if you supply yourself which you should be doing if you're a processor no processor should go into business relying on other people to keep this business afloat you should go into business being able to sustain yourself 100 if you can't you're in the wrong industry you shouldn't be hashing you shouldn't be processing okay my two cents on the mata fire fire isn't it settled so nice no loss when this settles i'll have a nice little muffin let me grab a jar [Music] ah all right so real quick i'm gonna weigh this and then i gotta run because my wife is about to kill our kids so i'm gonna tear that out teared 67.4 alrighty 67.4 divided by 91.5 74 yield all right you guys i'm gonna get out of here thanks for hanging out and uh i'll catch you guys on the next one", "PwwxFh01X-U": "what up YouTube we are gonna be doing that rosin press video today this must set up some what we're looking like when we charge all my product in there what we have right here is about 2 grams of some outdoor pineapple Thai what I've been doing lately because I've been using these right here instead of parchment paper I've been getting a little better return and also [ __ ] hell of a lot easier to to collect it off of these the natural parchment paper so this is just what I've been doing baby I'll get it over it up like this talk about that you can see I'm trying to do all this show one hand cover it up like this and I'll set it on the heat pad for a minute close them like uh that these get a little warm for about 10 seconds but I've been doing then just give it a press let it do its thing for a little bit and get my get my product in return about in I don't get none of that crazy using [ __ ] out of the sides I don't press that much so I'm not gonna give you guys like a little run like that the most I do in this little setup right here this is a half ton it's a thousand pounds a thousand psi is right here so pretty much half ton so long only do about two grams sometimes I'll do four if I'm being lazy I'll throw two sets of pucks like how you just seen in that one I'll throw two sets in there and smash it if I'm being lazy and but other than that I just do about two grams out of time and seem to be getting a fairly good return well I guess the puck felt already nice but that's what we got nice is a fairly good return I just liked it it was immoral over there but that's decently I'll give you guys a scrape and then show you what we're looking like I'll be back what up we're back I'll show you the next step that I do um I'll give one of these ice packs out the freezer and I'll just set this thing on here for about two three minutes let it get cold just cold enough so that that'll oil is nice and hard and then we'll move it to the table and we'll get the screen I'll see you in a couple minutes we're back it's been a few minutes since this thing has been sitting on the ice so uh let's peel it off and see what we get you know just a little bit stuck to that so we'll collect a little bit first and we'll move on to the better yield and get a better better - look at this and then when we're done we'll get a I give you guys actual close-up on the clarity and all that other good [ __ ] stuff that you know matters more but yeah I found this way right here to be the so far that for me the best way easier for some reason this particular strain no matter what temperature I ran it at when I ran it imparts me it was just [ __ ] soul oily that didn't want to collect and we'll just drive me [ __ ] crazy just having to go back and forth back and forth to try to get something that it's just always doing this smearing so I try to figure out easier and better method and figured might as well give these ago he compares on them so I don't know I don't see why you can't smash with him we're gonna do this bigger one now I'm getting nice little collections he will be got going in there get all this little [ __ ] on the outside first just so that I know I don't gotta keep [ __ ] witty I just like to click my [ __ ] so I can get at the dabit I got more in the backroom of this actual strange who that for some reason so I'm [ __ ] reason that [ __ ] turns it turned green when it's in parchment when it some parchment paper that's another thing this oil right here will turn green it wouldn't get this clear wouldn't you nothing it was just straight green so it's another reason why I'm trying to try not new things with my prayers you know I just dyed it so I'm learning regardless so all I gotta say it's a lot better than my first few runs I was [ __ ] up when I was first learning wasting product smashing that to higher temperatures I'm getting it out in it's getting there but uh let me get this all finished raped up and then I'll get back to you guys when it's all collected and I'll show you the finished result all right we're back do you with the final product see if I can get it to come up real quick another reason why I like these I could get this whole little hold it all opinion nothing too big but you can see ladies they're gonna use any filters when I do never ends on time I use filters and when I'm smashing [ __ ] I'm smashing hash only time I use a filter but what we're looking like what I'm dabbing on pineapple tiny outdoor stood that about maybe like an ounce live for this I'm trying to just dab dab slowly what what we're looking like I just wanted to show you guys a little clarity video thanks for watching rate comment subscribe and get your little close-up view of this thing well clearly you look good before you get out of here mmm thanks for watching", "1ebUoH4Lm38": "what's up YouTube it's cannabis love coming at you with another video whoa

all that rosin 83 grams of rosin I smoked it already by the way it was pretty quick if you didn't know this was all done on the peer pressure rosin press no we didn't max out the pressure I think we hit 66 psi so about half pressure we're only using half of this machine I promise you if you crank this machine full power all you're gonna do is blow out your bags you're gonna watch your rosin poop flower and that's horrible when it starts popping flower anyway I hope everyone's having a good one enjoy put your pants on kick ass peace cannabis love [Music]", "V0FE0p_3r4g": "[Music] wait right yo

"XWpZOxc94lc": "welcome back to Vader vision today we are harvesting our flower room ninja and bubbler both down here to help first thing we're gonna do is a roll a joint and talk about a couple of things like cannabis cap we got cannabis cups coming up in the future we should be going to all of them for those wondering same with East Coast and the Midwest or the Michigan cup not sure about any of the International cups for right now those are on hold but we will be going to our domestic cups first one is Las Vegas which we are going to coming up here very soon so I may be gone this may be the last upload which I guess which is why I'm warning you guys may not see us for a couple of weeks because we'll be extremely busy getting that together getting out to Vegas and getting back so it'll be a minute before I can edit but with any luck we'll squeeze in one more episode with Riley's I do want to take this quick opportunity though to thank all of you guys everybody who's been extremely supportive for Vader vision and ocean grown especially without you guys we would not be motivated to keep doing what we're doing so I encourage you to keep spreading that Aloha love and I'll keep trying to spread it back speaking of spreading the love I will mention just really quickly lots of people have been signing it for the tester program it has been incredible thank you guys so much I really enjoy a lot of your posts so ocean grown lounge comm that is where you need to go for all those who have been messaging us inquiries for how to become a tester so that will be down in the description you can go check that out okay enough of the pleasantries we are nice and high and we're going to jump on into the garden and check out what's up with the Death Star flowering chamber we'll go ahead and cut the lightsabers that have been floating down the center aisle of the room for a little extra side lighting and helping out our living soil food web girls which we just moved out of the way checking out the evader on the right and they got Jedi in the middle tray Malibu on the end we got all the ninja fruit on the left back corner first two trays and right on the left I had some moms that we set in a little bit late so we are going to let that tray go with an extra week I do need to get up a rail so I can hang all of the drawing flowers inside of this room because I don't have enough room over in the drawing tent since we are harvesting basically the whole room or at least five full tricks so just removing a couple of screws that were already in some studs and I'm just gonna replace them with some hooks just worked out to line up so that way I don't get foam everywhere nice and gentle a little clean install and we are ready to chop a girl's down all the Jedi and the Vader all the og is looking fantastic frosty stinky gassy D silly bud some got a little bit of a lemony lime to them a little bit more citrus overall very gassy fuelie flavors so super stoked with all of the progeny everything that you'd get out of any of these packs is fantastic and of course just like a traditional og stretchy between the node a little bit of training and you are good to go but I do want to emphasize for those that are new this is just a testing room so we're running seedlings most the time we run them straight up maybe we give them a topping like we did in these rounds I leave all of the lowers on the plant so I can see how they perform see how dense the nugs are all the way down this is not to maximize yield we really let these girls go kind of crazy so that is why the system is set up the way it is we are just trying to get an overall impression of the progeny and make sure that there are no problems as far as mutations or any stress issues that any of the strains may be showing now when we do grow and harvest my favorite technique is to hang the plants upside down all by themselves we're just going to strip off 80 or 90% of the larger fan leaves and any of the closer families to the nugs I'm not going to worry about damaging a bunch of the flowers and my main concern is just to get rid of any dead leaves that will shrapnel into little brown pieces and get inside the flower stem cells as well so that is our main motivation for this but as you can see give them a nice stripping and they are good to go for drying and should dry in about seven to ten days depending on the environment everything is looking nice and frosty we got nice solid buds all the way down all of these are looking fantastic especially these oh geez right here so we're going to move on to the ninja fruit which turned out in crowd I can't give this strain enough praise I'm really stoked with it I love the flavors coming from all the flowers it's got some incredible purpley nugs all the way through the plant there were just a couple that were a little green purple but most as you can see once we get out of that HPS lighting spectrum purple and beautiful leaves a lot of them looked really yellow under the HPS but they actually had a really fall lime green color to them if you were to look at them under a fluoro white balance lamp oh geez same thing looking fantastic lots of green under the HPS they always look a little bit more yellow especially towards flower and our Malibu came out super purple now there were a couple that did stay green like this one on the right that you can see but overall lots of purple black leafy know so very interesting with that strain and I love the flavors coming from all the progeny everything's got a pineapple a Hawaiian Punch sweetness to it so pretty stoked about that okay well moving on now that we have everything hung up move the last couple of things into the second tray we're going to get this bulb turned back on and we're going to let both these trades go for another week I am just going to hang a tarp and a couple of things in front of this side just keep the direct light off them and there'll be 100 percent fines never seen any degradation while putting in a light block barrier if I needed to like in the situation now we are going to skip ahead and fast forward a whole week checking out all of our girls they could have gone another week we put these in about two weeks after the seedlings I would have loved to give these another week but I got to cut this stuff down and flip the room so we're going to cut it out a little bit early they're all looking fantastic they're going to make excellent extracts or flowers if we want to smoke them no problem our living in soil food web plants we can see that they are starting to fade we don't give these any flush there's no need to but you can see they naturally just start to change over in some of their colors and start to ripen up these turned out fantastic by the way this Malibu smells incredible got some really nice little den snugs of course they're not giant but that's because we put them in kind of small now the witch's brew over here these were a little bit gangly they didn't get a lot of light in the side of the tray that's okay most of us were just making it to extract anyways all these flowers we are going to set up top into the other dry tents now that they've deflated a little bit and I have some extra room I can actually get them all into the dry tent to finish out their drying and then eventually I start bidding them up for cure so go ahead and get these up to that up top unit that we set up that is above the hot room now I'm going to move the living soil food web girls out of the way for a second while we harvest these other girls first we're going to take care of the Highlander this is the witches brew fino we've been looking okay I mean they got some nice top notes for sure so we'll have a few flowers out of this but not the best yield they were just some filler plants these are a couple of our runty Malibu that we threw in really late the first I wasn't going to flower them but when we got a bunch of males I threw these from the flower room in and it was great because it turned out to be females so it bumped our ratio back up a little bit who's kind of weird at first and threw me off but it does happen and especially when you're only popping a couple of packs of seeds the more seeds you pop the closer you'll get to that 50/50 ratio lower amounts of seeds it could be off you could get more females there are more males in any case now these living soil food web girls chop these up we're going to hang dry all of these for another week as well so right now we are going to flip over to breeding and just kind of check in on our breeding rooms we've got our OB right here you got a little experimental room going with some mixed flowers and a couple of things just trying some things out look in the fantastic nice and green males blooming females are blooming jumping over to our alien rift this is a full alien rift tray so we're going to try and just keep the stock coming in for this strain this is definitely one of my favorites in the recent years and we've got our LED room from Green jeans that's specific light concepts you can check out their website in the description everything didn't fantastic in here got some beautiful buds when we rip this up and for harvest we'll take a closer look everything fell over just like in this room the vada room but unfortunately Malabo room hi just put up stakes thinking it would be enough and I didn't put a trellis in like I did here here we have a trellis so they all fell over but they kind of woven cells right into the trellis it wasn't as big a deal but the beta room is also looking fantastic so stoked on both these rooms they're going to give a harvest really soon get all these dried up and keep moving through more seed stock bubble and I cleaned out this entire flower room we wiped everything down we nuked it we cleaned all the reservoirs trays everything so we can get all of these girls that we got in veg which are just busting out we definitely need to spread them out and get them sexed and then moving on into flower so we got alien rift right here in the center over on the right we have tropic moon which is our later cross with our Malibu very excited about these look incredible even in veg they got a very sweet musky smell on the stem riffs doing fantastic they're pushing out a lot as expected staying a little bit more squat and we have our Highlander with these huge massive leaves the Tropic moon and the Highlander both got some massive leaves going the Highlander is the Vader male crossed with our witches brew Highlander female again very excited about this strain really looking forward to it although these girls fished up a lot they are huge I am interested to see how they react once we flip to flower now over here I have a few runts that weren't looking too good so I put them in the living soil and they bounced right back and looking fantastic so we'll end up throwing those in the center as well and fix them out mother's looking good nice and green we're going to take some cuts for another facility but for right now I'm just going to go ahead and set all of the girls that we need to transplant into containers so we're not going to leave them just in the Coco Liners it was really convenient for veg but if you leave them in Flour for me they get algae on the bottom of the pots the plants don't seem to like it as much and some of the liner's start to sag they're not as thick and it really helps to have a strong container for the plant themselves keep them upright they seem to enjoy it a little bit more so now that they've got roots poking on out or going to be nice and gentle flip them into the containers and gently place them into their trays and position so we can go ahead and sex them over the next we week-and-a-half start pulling the males and then we'll see how much space we have left and I'll take some more clones and set them into the extra empty space so I do have some clones in the bedroom that I had prepped as filler clones so we're going to cross our fingers hopefully you get lots of females but if we get a lot of males then we'll just fill it in now I'm going to give all the reservoirs topped off with reverse osmosis water we're going to add our canna Coco lineup is what you were running right now our NPK a and B boost we're going to hold off for another week and a half can design we are going to add and as well we're going to add our Rizzo tonic which server booster this always helps bring out those healthy white roots for all of our ladies and while I'm moving everything around I'm going to go ahead and start transplanting some other veg plants that I had setting for another breed room so we got some cookies here we're gonna try and pump out some more dark helmet actually so we're getting all that prepped and I am just using cocoa people do have some time to time fat perlite or peat moss or anything else and no we just runs straight cocoa inside of our liners or our containers separate container we're using but in the flood drain system I find no need with frequent waterings to add any perlite or any other additives to the cocoa so just a simple text straight straight forward okay well now we're going to get all these tropic moves has moved over as well because I needed to rush transplanting those other girls to flip-flop and Jane get everything around and now we have a full flower room so we're going to top off nutrients and reverse osmosis in those reservoirs as well and we are ready to go so since I need to keep flipping things around and I cleared out the last tray in the corner we're going to start transplanting all of our clones because these have been sitting in here too long and the roots have gotten huge did not mean to let the roots get this big that's okay they'll be alright we're just going to transplant them right into an 8 inch Coco text container this is another breed room we're setting in this is the Vader male looking nice and everything should be good but yeah here here's another example of a giant clone this thing started really grown inside of the cloner turned into more of an aeroponic unit and less of a cloner but that's okay I'm just going to kind of gently twist them down into the container since the roots are so big it's probably gonna take a few extra days for them to really get used to the medium but overall they should be just fine so we're going to go ahead and clean out this cloner so we can take some more clones valgar you stopped by to help out with the living soil food web girls she has been in charge of this project so I've been leaving that up to her and she's been doing a great job keeping everything going we do have a little bit of cover crops popping up that's actually just a happy accident as our friend Bob Ross would say we did not purposely plant those in there those are just from the worm bins we're also going to add some worms into our soil just to keep everything going nice and healthy so we got this whole room set we're going to sexes everything in here and we will see how this all turns out at another episode but until then keep spreading that Aloha love leave a comment hit that like button share with your friends and subscribe if you're new we'll be back again really soon with another update but until next time I'm Vader and I'll see you later", "UNWHow4VH3k": "well we are back we are back and we are pressing a quarter of moxie viper cookies okay uh this is i haven't i haven't pressed a lot of moxie uh in a while so this will be fun this stuff is ringing in at uh 26.9 percent combined thc thca we've got a 121 micron bag here and the crd 30 ton triptech rosin press is set to 180 degrees fahrenheit i don't use timers i don't use the gauge that's on this pump so please don't ask me how long i leave it on just watch the video and you'll see how long i leave it on for okay so this has been rehydrated with hydra stones and we're going to load this bag up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there just a reminder if you are a medical marijuana patient in the pittsburgh area and you have dispensary flour and you would like to have it turned into gold please come and see me in penn hills here at the studio i do that for patients i press form for free that is a patient's helping patients initiative that i've been doing since 2018 never charge a patient to press their medicine for it it is important that patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody have a good day", "AIWclTyrV30": "[Music] [Music] what is up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another versus video i have two of the devices that i've gotten recently and i figured let's put it to the test uh we're gonna say i'm gonna say what i like about both of them what i don't like about uh both of them like i'm stuttering i actually took a hit previous so i'm sorry also i like to mention is that uh rj eats is filming and he's laughing right now because i [ __ ] up but we also got ben right here i like to mention you guys have been asking for a custom bandana i actually have one on right now it's actually one-sided uh i will show you the design but i'm gonna say something right now that i actually got a shittier one i ordered a shittier one for myself uh because when i uh i was i was actually happy to find like a website that did custom bandanas so i basically made this design i put it up there and it said it was a low quality image and i still ordered it but the one that i have on the website i readjusted it it's a bigger size and it actually has like a a little bit of a different design in the corner but nonetheless still the same design i'll post on the screen right now uh but yes back to this we are using uh the dip vapor this is an e-rig and then this i don't know what this is this is probably a portable uh email is what i would consider it a portable email and uh on a bomb or on a dab rig so what we're gonna be using first is the dip this is going to run you at about 180 but i unfortunately i know i have a code for you to get 15 off if you do want it uh it is on red right now so uh [ __ ] we are gonna we're not gonna use the dip first this is all red right now but we're chilling we're chilling we got that stuff we're still running with the show so uh let's see this is oh [ __ ] all right so basically what this is is a portable email uh if you have a rig you basically just put on top and it basically makes any dab rig an electric rig basically you put this on here it becomes one of the electric rigs but uh it is a more pricier setup you know this in uh this piece itself is 250 and then you're gonna have to get a bong i believe this bong was 30 right yeah 30 bucks yeah and uh also you know you have to get a compatible bong because not a lot of these are gonna have the thing on top you know some are gonna have them right here and it's just gonna be very heavy and fall over you know so you're gonna have to you know find the right bond for this specific thing but this device in itself is just dope you know i i do have the video it will obviously be uploaded before this video uh and you would have seen it by now i already did up edit that video though just to let you guys know and uh yeah from you've seen their in their faces from it they [ __ ] love this uh yeah it's basically still uh brand new i've used it i would say three times and uh all three times uh consistent consistent hits you know what i'm saying fat [ __ ] hits uh what i did mention in here i believe it's a usbc 30 minute to charge and you get 30 to uh dabs so that's pretty [ __ ] good you know if you're a guy that wants your dabs and for something this is actually i did a video on this right now but you would see it before it's actually the connected uh and bezel this is guava 2.0 okay you know that so this is actually going to be pretty hard to possibly put in here because it is you know look at this [ __ ] oh actually it's not that hard all right so with this you double tap and then it'll go to heating and then as it's heating up you can hit it and what you don't uh what you don't need on here is a cap because it's reverse airflow technology apparently so i don't know how to explain that the science behind that but that's what it is and that's probably why you don't need a cap on top but today all right no all right one of the hits you know i'm gonna give them a hit also but i like to mention is i don't know if there's interchangeable coils or buckets like e-rigs you know e-rigs they come with silicone carbide they come with ceramic they come with even quartz you know some of them uh this one i believe it's only one and it's a ceramic but you know people love ceramic it tastes [ __ ] fire on ceramic uh i do i like to mention that ceramic does seem to stain a lot uh easier than others uh but this device itself you could take apart and then just submerge it in isopropyl alcohol and uh it's pretty much very easy to clean i haven't cleaned it just yet because you know i've only used it like three times and it's just been vaporizing like everything like i really don't need to like i mean look at this [ __ ] i mean see it's kind of stained already but it is you know what it is having like some more in there but yes all these uh the links to the products will be in the comments below guys uh youtube's been uh [ __ ] with me you know if i do put stuff in the description i don't know if putting in the comments exactly is gonna avoid that but i don't know uh it seems to be working i haven't gotten any strikes uh that's what the other youtubers be doing so um but we are going to give it to ben so ben this is guava 2.0 you know the deal it's heating up right now but shout out to ben you guys already know the deal you want to say anything about this or after you hit it or before you hit it yeah uh wait till i hit it because i think it's about to be ready yeah i'm actually considering buying a dab rig after after getting one of these but then you have anything to say about this piece in in general yeah it's still still amazing like it still gives you that nice quality dab it doesn't give you that burning taste because it's like at the perfect temperature it's overall really great device there you go all right and you haven't cleaned it since no nice yeah all right randall that's his uh i got hello nicknames whichever you want you want that pleases you go ahead honey i'm saying all right so we're gonna double tap that there you go sir now sir well crandall sir boyle jolly i'm a grown man now i'm a sir just hit it all right how do you know it's ready when you put this right and it says that's [ __ ] cool man now it says i didn't know that at first it also vibrates don't press it yeah what the [ __ ] you press it after with this he blew it at john lennon i should have blew it over here let's do it again for the people is there still though no nothing for the people just uh here you go we gotta do it just you're done you're done that's up again ben's camera man all right that's right i like you to take over actually so i can lay down that's comfy right here that's where i want to be my back hurting looks like it's still red blinking failure no i was good for somebody i think so yeah we're gonna just share this uh because it i mean the session mode on here is a quite long much longer than here uh another thing about this like i said there's interchangeable buckets there's it's a more dab like experience you know you actually dab it and then there's carbs or a carb cap uh yeah and it's all in one you know uh yeah that's pretty much it i mean you do have interchangeable glasses as well uh but let's just let's just take a [ __ ] hit [Music] okay all right i would say that um the clouds are much fatter on here but it is a new device this one's a bit you know used uh the bowl is uh it's not as it's in pristine condition i would say a point it's still nice here hit this yeah yeah but this still hits guys uh and it's relatively cheaper you know coming in at about 160. i gotta diabetics better if you're expecting fat clouds that's what i mean that's what i'm trying to get across you also got to consider that the battery absolutely oh it is low but i do like that device though i will say that that one was much better than the smoke see you had yeah much better the smoke ski is better quality in terms of like the the build quality i would say but no of course so the even though like maybe when that one is fully charged it might hit better i don't know but like i don't know that that bag still like if you're very expensive if you're expecting a fat cloud you want to go to dab x for sure it's just uh it's not at its full potential guys right now it's still hitting like you guys seen previous videos um but i'm still gonna run with this versus video at the end of the day i'm just gonna show you what i like about both products you know they're very similar yet so different because one is attachable to a bong one is an all-in-one you basically put this on a dab break to become one of these you know yeah they're both good yeah they're both good they felt good that's that's all i'm one like i said that one's way better than the smoke scooter you got like it hits better yeah we know it's not the smoke ski in here though we're comparing these two yeah i'm just kidding but yeah like i said uh in terms of hit wise definitely better than the smoke ski but i like the build of the smoke ski better uh like the clouds are here man like then you're still taking hits yeah so this is more i would say of a party one because the the sesh time is longer i don't know actually there is a dab time on here i gotta [ __ ] with it more but there's there's certain features on here that i didn't play with in the the original video but i believe there is a dab mode let me see look at it here oh yeah dab mode skip preheat so you hold it for one second then you press it for a dab mode so that could possibly mean you know longer sessions i don't [ __ ] know but uh yeah just uh i wouldn't say a fool versus video uh it this is this is purely just a video of me comparing i would say the two best devices that i got recently uh you know that are similar you know i would put the email in here but you know it's it's stationary and all that stuff but uh let me know your comments you know you've seen the videos for both of them what do you think is is good and at the end of the day if you're going to consider purchasing any of these things these are all well above 150 worth of products so do your research you know there's plenty of things on the market and there's plenty of videos on the market so at the end of the day do your research and find the one that's best for your ideal situation you know sometimes maybe this isn't you know this isn't like for your situation but maybe this is you know what i'm saying there's just there's just things right things for everything um and that's what's cool about like the the product market or the device market when it comes to cannabis it's not a monopoly you know i'm saying there's just so many different things at different price points you know but that with ending with that i'm pretty [ __ ] happy with that we're gonna end it here uh does anyone have anything to add i mean or you pretty much said all your [ __ ] i don't know you you stayed at a lot of good points right now i feel like you laid it all out you know and all right and they're both good advices yeah all right so uh hope you did enjoy this video shout out to rj eats and be legit for you know helping us or helping me with the video he's floored it's actually better to have uh other people's uh opinions on these versus videos you know so other than that yeah hopefully you enjoyed the video [Music] [Music] one is [Music]", "o7yToj8NgbU": "yes i am going to be pressing two strains of flour today picked them up at the healing center in monroeville big shout out to them and what we have today are some really nice strains i hope they press out really well we're going to find out because we're pressing 180. first one we're going to press is the cresco this is the pineapple express ringing in at 30 percent it has been rehydrated with hydrostones i'll take those out now and we shall get this ready to press hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there if you are a medical marijuana patient the pittsburgh area and you would like to have your dispensary flower pressed into rosin i do that for free for patients right here in penn hills at asher's finest rosin world headquarters it's been a long day folks i am so glad to finally be getting down to getting some pressing done uh so that's that's it that's our quarter and let me see that these new uh press bags okay those are not the right size all right here we go i do believe that that should handle i could have sworn i got three different sizes nope just two okay because here's the size difference from a seven gram bag right there so let me see if this more suitable now this is what happens when you go live stuff happens and not everything is perfect those are the wow i am just having a heck of a day today it has been pouring down rain almost the entire day today okay so that's the one closest matches the size and so these are made by gutenberg's tank pressing and they they had those custom made to emulate as close as possible a nug smasher seven gram bag and i think they got it down pretty good but let's take a look and see how these hold up under the press my crd 30 ton rosin press so there's 120 micron bag we're pressing at 180 degrees uh this is the i haven't pressed pineapple express from cresco in probably two years so we shall see what it's going to do hopefully it's going to press out well at 30 percent i'm really hoping it will but you know as well as i do sometimes the thc level does not equate to a larger yield if the plant doesn't have the right wax and lipid profile so just trying to let you know what happens in the real world we're either going to get a really good result or not and we'll see what the quality of this flower is for the price i really hope it's good because quite frankly it i've gotten surprised by some of the flower lately that should have been good producers and were not but i give everyone their chance i try not to pre-judge anything uh this is really really sticky uh especially now that it's been rehydrated which is a good sign this all tucked down in here nice and tight and we're gonna get it all folded up here and we're gonna move the lights and put it on the plates and see what she's got for us hope she gushes that would be super nice get a really nice happy happy squish out of this we shall see this is video one of the two video series today pressing dispensary flower pennsylvania medical flower from our local wonderful dispensary here the healing center in monroeville i'm gonna move the camera now move it into a better angle for you to see what's going on okay let's let's get this here blow there we go put you right in here and focus is right there all right let's start dropping the hammer on this and see what she's gonna do like i said if you're a pittsburgh area medical marijuana patient you have dispensary flour you want to press bring it over to penn hills that's where i live real easy to get a hold of if you hit me on a private messenger i give you my address and i will do this for you for free because that's what i do for patients is my outreach helping patients who need better medicine and can't afford dispensary concentrates at the price level so i'm just doing this real gently given that heat because i'm pressing at such a lower temperature than i normally do takes a little longer for that heat to start working its way in there [Music] but i'm hoping on paper it should be a gusher you know 30 that's that's the magic number for the gushers usually but sometimes it'll surprise you you won't get the yield that the uh numbers said you should based on what it's telling you and that again goes to my point this is a variable plant it's always changing and as a result it's kind of hard to get a handle on it sometimes and figuring out what you can and can't do there we go there we go you should be able to see that nice cool here we go drop the pressure more now this is going to disappear from your site okay these plates are very deep and the lights will not penetrate past a certain point so once it gets to that point i'm gonna move the camera back out because i'm gonna need to pay attention to what's going on with it and when i pull those plates back apart you should see something really really nice but that's what's going on in there right now and now come right back out here focus right there keep this thing up to full pressure where i want to be don't want to risk a blowout so we're going gonna really go gently on this especially with a bag that i haven't used before too it's always always something new that gives you that learning curve all right we're gonna let it sit right there and at 180 you can let it sit on the heat a little longer without degrading it at 200 you have to react quickly but you can get amazing results at 200. some strains of 200 degrees though will shatter up on you and turn into ground glass and you definitely don't want that so i dropped my temperature profile to 180 and i am getting slightly smaller yields overall but it's not as much as i anticipated so it ended up being a much more acceptable range than i was thinking and you know so now i'm pressing at 180 this year and if i have to make adjustments next year to see what maybe 190 does or 185 then i'll do that but i'm always trying to to do better each year better quality because i'm a quality over quantity guy every time i promise you that okay so i believe we are almost ready to pull these plates apart and see what she has given us as we showed her respect you know that's the thing you show this plant respect treat it with respect press it well and it gives her soul to you you know that's what it is at least for me that's how i approach it i approach it that this plant has a soul i'm bringing that soul out making better medicine so give me a moment we're about ready to open those plates so i'm going to give you a nice view of that ready to see it let's see it pretty oh yeah i don't know about you that's looking pretty to me huh you liking that because i sure am all right so let me get the camera moved down here so as you can see the goodness and stay tuned for my next video where i'm going to be pressing moxie's viper cookies which is another heavy hitter not over 30 percent but absolutely gorgeous look at how beautiful that came out you can't even believe how it smells you know what i'm saying it is just filling this room with the dankness and i did it i got a tiny little bit of a blowout right there okay so i took it right to the edge and got the most that this flower was able to provide now it's time to find out what our yield is because my my own personal scale that i like to use is i want to see a minimum and that's minimum of a half gram per ounce per eight pressed okay minimum i'd like to get a gram per eight and some strains give me that and most of them don't so let us see what our jar ways i'm gonna back this back off now you can see everything there we go okay i got my scale i'm going to tear my 17 gram jar there we go and taking my tool down see how it picks up i did not put this on the cool plate because it's about 65 degrees in the room and cooling it too fast leads to shattering results i like the way this is picking up is sticking to itself it's very stable didn't crystalize up which i believe the last time i pressed this flower was 200 degrees i do believe i had an issue with it turning into shatter on me if that's him so i'm much much happier with what i'm seeing here right now for sure let's get this stuff off here and into its jar it's your home that's where you want to be other than my lungs look at that look how pretty no it doesn't want to focus but it's got a really beautiful color just gorgeous loving it let's get this stuff up in the jar give you guys a yield well tomorrow starts the weekend if you don't have plans get some dispensary flour if you're in the pittsburgh area come see me i'll have a present sesh love doing pressing sessions right now my wife is not in the house so i am going to be able to have people over and we can hang out got a big screen tv and lots of equipment to dab on so if you're thinking hey i want to go party in a safe secure environment where can i go well you can come see me bring some dispensary flour let's have some let's make some good medicine have a nice session you know the social aspects of medicating are every bit as important as the medicine itself in my opinion so anybody who's just sitting around medicating in isolation that's not really very therapeutic but you get it you get yourself around some other like-minded people have some interesting discussions maybe watch some tv or a movie or stand-up comedian or something that is just as therapeutic to me as hang on just a moment i got a visit all right sorry about that folks let's finish gathering this pineapple express up like i said i don't press a lot of cresco flour because i've had some had some bad results from some of it and i always found them to be kind of higher priced than their quality would seem to indicate but in terms of this pineapple express yeah i'm pretty pretty happy with it all right now we got it all in the jar try to get in the jar and not on my hands so much so that is 18.73 when you take the 17 grams for the jar away that's 1.87 no no it's 1.73 my bad 1.73 that definitely falls within the acceptable range for me so thank you for joining me for this video here's a good look at some really really beautiful rosin this is from made from cresco pineapple express premium buds so thanks for joining me on this video i will be seeing you very soon because i'm going to turn right around reset up and shoot viper cookies so stay tuned folks i'm out of here", "3uxHpZxYeO8": "hello senior stoner fans is the real senior stoner back at you for your terpinator real dab of the day hello everybody it's senior stoner and today is friday hey everybody if you like today's video please subscribe to the senior stoner channel on youtube hit that subscribe button hit the like button send me your comments i reply to every one of them have you thought that day to day trivialities in life often get in the way and we get bogged down with mundane tasks well there comes a time for most of us however when we try to embark on a quest for greater fulfillment in life so if you're seeking to continually improve your life maybe there are things you can do every day starting today to help yourself let's discuss how about spending time with those you love most i have two vaccines in my system now maybe my other friends and family members will also have and i'll be able to spend physical time with my friends again and with loved ones if not you can do it virtually over the phone for most of us there's nothing more important than the relationships we have with those we're closest to so make it a point to spend any kind of quality time with your loved ones every single day don't let geographical boundaries deter you pick up the phone send them an email if you can't see someone in person reach out to a friend or a family member you haven't spoken to in a while and let them know you're thinking about them it'll help you believe it or not say please and thank you more often think about it these days seems like we live in it's all about me world while having a good time matters well being good with manners may be a lost art practicing politeness daily can make life even better for you when you interact with others and in turn it can help improve you the world is a crazy place filled with dreadful acts of violence and sadness and one small action can set in motion a far-reaching chain of events that can yield miraculous results make somebody's day by thanking them and telling them how much you appreciate them i'm not kidding it works you know what do it now i'm going to do it this afternoon what do you think of that i'm going to take my own advice today this is good stuff for all of us laugh out loud laughing is one of the most therapeutic things you can do for yourself every day it's research proven it so spend time with a funny friend or watch something funny a favorite television comedy because when you're wasting a few minutes watching a funny video you definitely don't feel bad about it think about it prepare yourself at least one healthy meal whatever your healthy meal consists of because there's a direct correlation between the foods you eat and your level of happiness spend time preparing one or more healthy meals a day and try eating more healthfully try to find time for some type of exercise i walk sugar when i can might not be on the top of priority lists of people these days but it should be exercising even 15 minutes a day can help lower your blood pressure and reduce heart risk what about saying i love you i'm not kidding shout it out i love you think about somebody you've lost in your life god forbid somebody you cared about deeply what's the one thing you'd say to him or her if you had the chance you'd probably tell them how much you love them that's right so don't take time for granted because you never know when ours will be up try listening to music we've talked about that tunes are a way to improve your life immediately and make a day a little bit better classical music believe it or not in particular has been shown in research to help improve mood lower blood pressure and help people sleep what do you think of that maybe we can perform a random act of kindness simple thing improve our lives face it helping people helps you feel better so if you want to improve your life help others improve theirs first if you give a dollar to a homeless person you can bring food to a pantry compliment somebody do a friend a favor without asking for anything in return and your reverse will reward you many times over it's true and ultimately try to carve out some time for yourself to be alone with your thoughts because improving your life means cultivating positive thoughts on a regular basis so to do this you're going to need time to let go and recharge maybe try spending time in the morning or before you go to bed focus on taking low and deep breaths and let the thoughts run through your head like clouds soft billowy clouds with nothing to worry about try that every day and you never know your worries could slip away learn something new i learn every day and people who are content in their lives share something in common they never stop learning make it a point feed yourself knowledge every day whether it's in the form of a book a website television talking whatever it is because you got to learn as much as you can while you're here okay and you know what else all these different things all of this what is it meant to do it's meant to help us understand the circular nature of life how you come across on top again and have two things always hope and opportunity and how when you're trying to make your life better if you can get your fingernails on the windowsill you can get the rest of your body into the window for sure let's take our dab of the day and remember this and remember these things okay remember these things it's important that we take stock of how we can improve our lives each day if you enjoyed today's video i i hope you all did subscribe please to the channel as always please

subscribe button hit the like button send me your comments i love to reply to all of them hello everybody are you happy is a state of mind specifically it is a state of well-being and contentment but the definition can be tricky and assumptions about the word can be all over the place up and down and sideways well we're going to talk about it today many people don't even realize that learning to be happy is something that can be intentionally practiced some people when they hear the word happiness assume it is speaking of an emotion such as pleasure or joy for them it is what people feel in the immediate here and now this is the reason some people say don't pursue happiness seek joy happiness is fickle and fading joy remains forever but the short-term definition of happiness isn't how everybody sees it some define it to mean long-term satisfaction in fact when i speak of experience happiness in life i'm not thinking of short-term at all i think a quality of living a much longer term view both are understood both are correct but they're different realities but are they different not really see a long-term experience in life satisfaction is almost certainly made up of many short-term feelings of joy and pleasure does that mean every day is a great day with no trials tribulations and problems absolutely not but it does mean when we look back at the seasons of life we can look back satisfied at how we navigated them the long-term feeling of satisfaction is most often experienced when we embrace the emotion of joy in the here and the very now we accomplish that often by taking steps every day to be happy consciously well guess what everybody who's listening and watching senior stoner right now you're about to get happy here's what we're gonna do every day we're gonna choose happiness that's right happiness is a choice is the easier choice on some days to do nothing absolutely if you get up in a trap thinking about circumstances that need to change before you can be happy you'll never ever get there focus on the good there are good things in life right now i'm alive i'm fed i have family that loves me so there are opportunities every day maybe not all of those are true for me or you right now but certainly some of them are which means there's good in everybody's life if we can find it people asked a double amputee veteran who lost both of his legs landing on a grenade to save his combat patrol they asked that hero how he stays positive after losing his legs he responds by saying i simply ask those people how they stay so negative when they have both of theirs you see happiness is about perspective and if you're looking for reasons to be happy you're gonna find them happy people focus on happy thoughts we gotta stop comparing stop comparing whether it's finances body type vacations sports don't do it there are no winners in the game of comparison nobody's forcing you to play that game and you can stop that game any time you want don't compare appreciate who you are instead and work hard every day to live the best life you can and stop comparing ourselves to other people you'll be happier if you practice gratitude and generosity that's right it's a world of positive psychology is called that's right recurring themes that are positive gratitude and generosity both of these are disciplines not responses it's a discipline because we practice it regardless of our circumstances what do you think of that making them both a discipline in your life will result in a happier today and a better tomorrow gratitude and generosity don't pursue physical possessions now i gotta tell you i got a lot of stuff ain't necessary for life but our society has confused consumerism with happiness marketers work hard to make sure that all their products are everything we need for essential living and happiness but slowly but surely we begin to believe that those empty promises and waste our lives pursuing things that can never satisfy we sacrifice time money energy maybe relationships and focus chasing and accumulating things we don't need think about it these excess possessions we all have add stress worry and burden to our lives i'm not saying don't buy anything but if you want to become a little bit happier today go declutter your closet or your drawer and challenge the consumerism look at what you've got be grateful for the things you have maybe you don't need anything else right now in terms of purchases up to you but don't pursue those physical possessions to be happy be present in your relationships that's right one thing that psychiatrists have learned is that relationships hold a very big key to happiness close relationships more than money more than fame are what keep people happy throughout their lives mrs stoner the love of my life my best friend my wife 44 years you know what these ties protect people from life's discontents think about it they help or delay mental and physical decline and you're going to have a happier life you know you don't get to control your relationships or every bit of it family's an example but you can take steps to be a good friend and good friends tend to attract healthy community so you know what it's a wonderful thing to have mrs stoner it is but i want more that's right you do too so what you need to do is you need to develop healthy habits how we spend our days is how we spend our lives our lives are filled with days our days are filled with hours and this hour is filled whatever i choose to do so let's pursue healthy habits let's add value to our hours let's add value to our days let's add value to our lifetime and try try and know it's hard to look outside of yourself it's very hard you know the pursuit of self comes natural to human beings we often don't need to be reminded to pursue our own self-interests we pursue self-survival self-promotion self-actualization and sometimes self-exaltation as if it was hardwired into our genes but but a more effective and efficient pathway to happiness and fulfillment is not to look only at your own interests but also to the interests of others when we shift our focus off ourselves we live lives of greater meaning and greater contribution when we serve others without concern over what we might return receive we experience the beauty of selfless love the size of our universe and happiness will expand exponentially so it is no small thing that happiness is pursued by so many people but hopefully if we listen to some of these tidbits we can make sure we find it both in the short term and in the long term it's about taking control it's about taking small steps that end up being big big steps if you're concerned that you can't take that big leap to be happy right now it's okay you know what we live a circular life you're gonna come around to the top of that ferris wheel and have opportunity and hope again when you go over and if you think you can't find that happiness you know what a little bit at a time get your fingernails on the windowsill and you can get your body in the window of happy this has been the real senior stoner talking today about happiness that elusive thing we all look for happiness but i think maybe many of us have misunderstood what it means and how we're going to get there i hope i helped hit the subscribe button hit the like button send me some comments take a look at a t-shirt take a look at a mug thank you by the way everybody who's supporting senior stoner we're getting the brand out there you're going to be using your mug showing that brand to others and being confident people thanks for watching everybody this has been the real senior stoner talking about happiness and we can all have some cheers have a great day excuse me thanks again for watching everybody let's find some excuse me some happiness cheers everybody it was a big one two", "hMYxdRmZ5l0": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I'm going to be pressing some vanilla berry pie 20 point 18 percent THC from three boys farm which is now known as one plant but it was a three boys farm at the time on my 10 tongue that press drip tech dab press nah it's a dead press and it's called dead press so there you go all right so this vanilla berry Piatt is the first order I ever made from one plant and it was a really dry batch with not much smell to it and so I threw in some intent and type of booze pack and all these things to moisten it up it's like 60 - I think it's 52 percent humidity I'm not exactly sure here you can take a look at it inside here I'll give it a small it's got its got a berry smell to it now you're back then I really didn't have much of a smell to it and these do have a good effects these nugs but I think bringing it back to life with the integra was a necessity for sure here's a a nice shot of these nodes before I give them the press like I said they had decent effects even though the flowers themselves were unimpressive alright let's go ahead and get these buds weighed in and that way we can have an idea of what the yield is like go ahead and tear out the scale nodes these are actually pretty decent looking lugs and they they smell again now that I put the booth back in there all right looks like it's 3.5 grams on the money I don't know if you can see that alright and I use the trottle tech method I'm not sure if anybody out there is familiar with it but basically I use a 120 micron mesh bag but cut off at both ends and I'll show you how that works probably need to get something to break this stuff up on I just like to break it up a little bit so that smushes nice and tight into the filter bag if there's any big stems like this I'm just pulling out so I had pressed um some from this batch before and it didn't pretty had really really um disappointing results I don't know if it had been fully rehydrated at that point or not though so who knows alright so now we have an eight broken up right here on this piece of paper is a little bit I'm gonna take the filter bag and just start stuffing it full of weed basically there's definitely a lot more aroma now that I've broken this all up I found another stem in there I'm going to take that outside and break the bag or break through the parchment either you just gotta stuff all this stuff in there basically a couple more little stems in there if this suckers out luckily I don't think I see any seeds go grab something real quick but my help in this there's no escaping the drawer of doom alright so I just basically got a flat it's just a kitchen tool with a flat dough on the bottom handle swing smooch this down basically want to get this as compressed as possible so you can fit all of it in here and have a little puck going on inside the bag that's what I'm trying to get accomplished and so I believe the expected yield I heard something like it you know a good yield should be something like 2% under the stated THC percentage and I've gotten that that seems to be a pretty good rule of thumb I have to say but we'll see what this one does every strain is different every batch is different it depends on the growing conditions on all kinds of stuff the maturity level when they were harvested lots of variables that go into getting a good squish as they say and um so just so you know I'm not I don't want this to be all broken up like this into shake that just happened when I was breaking it up so you know ideally you just want to break it up a little bit so it fits into a puck shape inside here all right now I have my finished shuttle tech puck to be squished and turn into rosin smells pretty good good look at it yeah it's all smushed into a puck and I actually could have had a little bit less of this filter bag right here but that's okay it's not a huge deal I scrape this very last bit of crumbs on there all right but we have our eight of vanilla berry pie all puffed up in our shuttle tech bag we need to set up the damn press to get ready to be pressing some tabs how about that so I'm gonna adjust the camera and get right over there alright so first I need to turn on the heating plates there we go finally and I like to start out at 180 so I'm gonna take that down I just like to do my first passes at lower temperatures to preserve as many Terps as I can gotta have them terpene you know that's what rosin is all about is the Terps otherwise you just have other forms so we got that going at 180 the gauge on this I draw a camp up here that's what's gonna be operating you can see you once gets to 180 it'll be ready to go ready to press some dad's out press some nose alright so now that I've got the heating plates heating up from the PID with up to 180 degrees I'm gonna go ahead and get the press set up between two sheets of parchment paper for the first month all right ready to go all right I've got it all set up just like I need it these I just use cheap bulk parchment paper because I still have this thing in it it just won't seem to run out so I use I double up because it'll press through the parchment paper which is not a huge deal so yeah you just put the button in here give it a press there you go we're just gonna wait for that heat up and once it's ready will squish somebod all right now that the temperature plates are heated up what I'm gonna need to do is take this puck right here and slide it between the plates just like this and you want it to be just kind of centered like that and towards the front a little bit is what I prefer so that it can kind of direct it to come out that way yeah that's just right give me a second guys so after I get the puck in here I like to just so I haven't really started to put much pressure at all on it right now it's just strictly heating up at this point all right so it's been heating up for over a minute now so I go ahead and just start a timer right when I start applying pressure to this and I'm just going to try it as much as I can just keep applying steady pressure to this and I usually take it up to the 4000 on the PSI scale rear and then I'll be able to swing this camera in right here so that we can help you of the drip close-up so let's go ahead and get that started all right it's starting to start the timer as soon as I start to feel the resistance of the pump all right I can feel it so now I'm gonna start it I'm gonna do one minute for the first squish probably not the most exciting quite yeah I'm actually gonna swing that hammer right now hopefully we'll get a nice view of the squish going on all right well I'm a little bit over a minute and we don't get no squishies out of here I guess I don't have enough in there or it's not gonna yield as much as it would need to make a squish that's been in there long enough though so I'm gonna go ahead pull it and to do that undo this toppling like over here what's probably going on here is it just didn't have enough didn't have enough trichomes and stuff to push it out at that temperature all right nice and aromatic that is there's the first squish you say I'm going through the paper there a little bit that's all right we get it put that in the freezer all right so I put the first squish in the freezer and then we'll go ahead and get the second stick ready this is the same thing over again [Music] looks like the bag broke a little bit on that one I went a little too fast so you know usually I try to go pretty slow didn't work out that time so now I'm gonna put the temperature up to 210 degrees all right so I've turned up the temperature to 210 degrees on the plates I like to do that first press at 180 to get as many Terps and you know the nicest press that I can and then I go up to 210 after that to get as much as I can out of now I'll even go up to 220 for the last one so once this is all heated up then I'll be ready to do the second press I've got the plates up to 210 degrees and I've got the puck here so I'm just gonna slide there we go let that heat up just about 30 seconds or a minute or so all right now that it has heated up for about a minute I'm gonna go ahead and start putting some pressure on it this time I'm gonna take it slower so I don't totally destroy it I'm just trying to apply even pressure as much as I can throughout the whole time hid key to sort of get a little tougher up in these thousands give you a nice arm workout well it looks like there's a little bit coming out this time all right a little bit didn't have this already did a about 220 it's starting to drip and I've gone longer than a minute that's for sure I'm missing all of this camera tank sorry this is so bad there we go a bit more pressure just a little bit more now that we got it hurtin and it's just such dark rosin I'm not used to that but same thing happened with the other batch of three boys that I pressed so who knows all right that's plenty of time not too shabby on the second place smells nice it's kind of hippy all right so now we're gonna get the third press down here I'm gonna put this into the freezer let harden up all right so now that the plates are heated up to 220 degrees Fahrenheit I'm ready to go ahead and put the puck in but first I'm gonna have a little shot glass of water right here and I'm gonna just dab a little bit of water on each side of it now just help push out the last of the dabs last of the rosin I should say just that pressure of the vapor a little bit just a little bit of pressure so I can start heating up plates heat up the puck for about a minute or so to bring it up to temperature and that's just to help get the juices flowing basically all right now that the puck has heated up in the press for about a minute I'll go ahead and start applying more pressure slowly as I go at 220 degrees Fahrenheit and hopefully we'll see a little bit come out again it's always nice when you get to see the drip don't see any coming out yet tighten up a little bit still nothing look we should definitely be getting more rosin out that's for sure oh here comes something right there very nice very nice third press and since this is the last press I'll just let this go throw away for a minute and a half two minutes you can pretty good this is on the prison prettiest rosin I've seen that's for sure mm-hmm but I'm sure see what the yield is like press that's a pretty decent press right there for the third press but you can see it is there's a lot less of it Wow very nice berry flavor to this last press interesting what if the water help right now all right so I'll put this in the freezer like the other ones and then it will be back with all of them once they're all frozen and we'll gather them up and I'll tell you what the yield was all right so here I've got the first press and I collect it now as you can see I went through the paper but that's not a huge deal you still get this all up alright so I've got the first press collected and there it is as you can see there's you know there's some stuff on here there's no all my fingers but that's the vast majority of it right there I'm just going to throw it onto a piece of parchment paper for right now and then we'll weigh them all up together at the end get as much of this off as I can but it won't be exact that's for sure mark this is number one I set it over here all right now on to collect the second press here we had the second press and I hope it'll be easier than the first to collect nope it's shattering - let's see how it does that's not so bad all right and here's the second press put this on a piece of parchment also this has got like a taffy consistency to it label that number two and we'll collect the third and final press and then we'll weigh it all up and see what our yield was - stuff like this of course don't touch your rug further than final price right here so I'm going to collect it and you'll know just exactly how much we got is the third press right there number one go ahead and tear out the scale with a piece of the parchment on it sure it's not touching here we go got that tear it out now I'll transfer attached to this parchment and that is point one seven five grams from the first press and it has a really interesting consistency to it it's waxy it's like it's barely even sticky I mean it is but it's nothing like the other pretty cool so I'll mark this you tell the batch number then I'm gonna put it back in the freezer I'll grab the second one all right there's the second batch go ahead and tear out the scale again just like before transfer it over easier to do when it's frozen make sure it's not touching yep not touching 0.18 one second do it a little bit better than the first one which is not surprising because the second one had 210 degrees well unit 108 so there's not as much energy to push out all that rosin all right and they go ahead and tear out the last one transfer one more time whoops I have to wait a trick on this one here we go make sure it's not touching all right it's point zero seven eight there's a tiny bit more on here let me get that so I put this there was a little bit left on there I don't see what's a point seven eight so didn't really add a point seven eight point seven nine point eight let me close this really point seven nine twenty seven eight I'll just call it point seven eight 0.078 all right so label this one this one is a lot stickier look at that it's a lot stickier and that's the last one it has the water so now we'll add these all up and see what our yield was 175 that's point one a one plus point zero seven eight equals point four three four 12.4% yield man that is not good you at all it's just terrible and this is the same thing that happened last time that I pressed this stuff you know I mean I realize look you got a little bit right here but man this is some bad yield right here for 20% so I don't know what the deal is with these I definitely get a lot more out of Tru leave and let's see well if I Curie if gave me some good stuff to so let me mark this off for number three and then we'll take a look at the different batches together here's that one as you can see I mean it doesn't even want to stick to the paper you see that it's hard it barely wants to stick to the paper if you touch it it will stick to your finger because of the heat but other than that it really doesn't want to stick let's batch one at 180 degrees that's too similar but it is a little bit stickier and it seems to be a little unruly or two you see how it's like flakes off like that yeah I don't really like touching batch two very much I'm gonna get rid of it well we just ahead of my fingers and then batch three as we put the water in it much more of an oily consistency and just like before this is all really dark stuff compared to what I'm used to I will press some buds from a you know different dispensary soon and we'll see well you'll see the difference I don't I don't get it I don't understand what the deal is but I mean I would think that the first one would be a nicer color than that but the thing is this stuff is really potent and the smell is nice it concentrates all that smell down from the bud alright guys I just wanted to show you how I press rosin at home and next time I'll make sure and use a screen that gives us a little bit better stuff you know I just had this kicking around for a while now and I figured I might as well get something out of it what I'll do is I think I'll do one more press on this at some other point and I'll tell you if I get anything else out of it alright thanks for watching you guys have a good one", "uiiyBZxyutg": "what's up homie murder bombs small tubes been a minute [Music] we here at the lab you know um yes that well like you can see it there's little circulator running that's recovering a run from the closed loop system but for right now we bounce in a little bit of dry [ __ ] just real quick nothing's nothing special just doing some quick bounce tech let me get that off here so it doesn't contaminate that just doing some quick balance tags you know it's been a long day i've run a little over four and a half pounds and i don't have any hash i mean i have somehow but i want different you know what i'm talking about so how is everybody how's your day going what day is it [Music] okay that's the this is uh 120 through 159 not the cleanest or anything just trying to just trying to get a little something together to rip with you guys oh we can't do it like that can't see [ __ ] um [Music] not bad huh for some midzies so you're looking to learn about some dry [ __ ] mojo jojo well then i i have wonderful news for you i uh i finished uh shooting and there's just a little bit of editing for the um second video in the patreon series and aside from that i had all this uh dressed up stuff out and i had some material that i was working with so i went ahead and shut up oh comprehensive driveshift uh tutorial-ish video really a sort of revisiting because i have uh i watched a couple of bubble man's um old videos and some john brothel and a d420k and i realized my dry sip tack is nowhere near what it should be and um well to give you an idea why i'm feeling okay about it i'll just show you here in a second we pressed some rosin we're gonna show you [Music] and what we're doing [Music] wanted to see what kind of a quality product i can get from this and still um this this will still maintain a pretty a really reasonable view um this is 120 through 1 49 159 dry sift but this is in a 50 micron bag um a little bit larger than i typically use for hash but not too let's see what we got right here again not not to clean just trying to bounce any particulate through the screen that's smaller than 74 micron obviously boom playing drum solos over here [Music] i tried to use the camera last time but i guess you can't focus when you're live on youtube oh [ __ ] can you guys see this not bad for how long you saw we just worked on it 519 canada here shout out to my dry sipped masters from the north marcus of course uh john six grams i don't know i guess i could weigh it should we wear it yeah we can wear it why not oops we do have a little scale right here anyway so shout out to whoever the hell this company is no more batteries [ __ ] it usb rechargeable scale and i charged i've charged it one time and i've been using it for almost a month all right so we're going to weigh this the easy way [Music] make it a little bit of dry ice sit and really i was just bringing you guys in to take a break with me but when i set up the stream i noticed i had all that sift on the screen and i thought you guys might like to watch that hey four grams 3.95 looked like more didn't it all right guys it's good yeah i am tired i'm ready to take a dab i'm not sure how much i'm gonna get done after that but i have put in a very full day all right um [Music] you guys wanna you gotta [ __ ] it i guess we could press this real quick i do have some wonderful things to show you that i pressed earlier today from some dry sift that i spent much more time with um so if this stuff comes out amazing i'm going to be a little bit disappointed because why did i spend all that time making that stuff nah it's just there's absolute technique that cannot be denied and then of course there's the advantage to you know fully mature trichomes very dry fully mature trichomes in a very cold environment with very low humidity i mean in that setting you don't even really have to be this very good at this thing with all your variables perfect like that you're gonna you're gonna get some decent hatch but for uh mojo that said in the comments there a little bit ago about getting some screens or recently got some screens for driving oh what's happening here guys i can feel just a little bit of loose sift that's around it you know i don't want that on the parchment obviously okay now where's the first one the one i'm on i don't know we'll see if we get any yold out of this this actually is some 160 160 to 249. huge very high micron hash i don't think we're gonna press that but hey let's see what happens with this step as a matter of fact i know i want to press this because [Music] we want to try to stream i guess by a little bit of dry slipping i meant a lot sorry sorry sorry let's go let's go let's go [Music] all right here we [Music] that's a go too close how's everybody doing how's everybody doing it was a little fluffy you know what that points to unfortunately a high uh count of a capitate and stocks so that's contentment um only only contaminant would have it looking so fluffy like that we both thought it was like [ __ ] when you said seven grams i was like yeah probably maybe even a little more and then it was half all right guys so we're gonna first press the uh which one is this i can't remember which one was the bigger bag now the bigger bag was the last one so this is the 120-159 this is the 74-119 i think yes this is the 70 419 that's the stuff that we thought was seven grams but it's actually get my big fat head out of your way [Music] [Music] should be ready to go whoa those are some big comments yo what up austin video is called miz uh mecca mccall man static oh yeah [Music] so i don't know who so so dare you you must not have been here for the beginning i was talking about the marcus um adding to your driveshift quiver that i watched about six years ago and then i revisited over this past weekend and it was a really it was a wonderful reminder um no we're not of course i didn't just do static tech i don't have the time for that right now just want to make some dabs [Music] no they're actually four thousand dollars so sorry to i'm sorry to so sir dirty i love your information i appreciate the help and everything but you're a little bit incorrect there brother um yes of course the video at least i well i mean bubble man pro had had published tutorials on full mel dry sift and static tech six years ago so that makes sense as far as the drying being done with a freeze dryer oh yeah sure it's a great way to do it but old school microplaning and and drying um on cardboard honestly if you know what you're doing if you know how to keep your room cool and dry it can be very dope aside from that even whether or not you're freeze drying or not you're going to have to microplane um unless you're just going to stuff chunks of well you know i have no way of doing static technique the same thing as you were thinking security i'd like to check that yeah oh of course we know that's v man yep it is you're absolutely right sir dirty it is very simple the uh well there's the [ __ ] [Music] oh he's always doing it dude that's that's all that's like every single day for solving this bacon big he goes live for like four hours at a time and washes and presses and you know all that that's what's up yeah so depending on if you want a pharmaceutical freeze dryer which for the record if you're going to get one through low temp um and we are we're only talking about harvest rate i am not going to speak on anybody or any other company's freeze dryer if you're going to go through low temp you're not you're only going to be able to get a pharmaceutical one and they're not and that's not 2 000. they do have a small freeze dryer that's like it has three shelves it's very very small if you don't need a pump or anything like that if i remember correctly i think it's uh we could just look it up i think it's like 25 maybe maybe 3 500 but if i remember correctly actually i think the medium one is because i was looking at the medium one with a pump and it was going to be right here just over four just over four grand i'm so interested in that uh [Music] i love it i love it um yeah i'm so interested in this static tech austin what you got what you got that's new yeah you and that's don't even get me started on that oil free clown so you know dope about fire fire driveshift if you accidentally [ __ ] around and get and get caught answering some questions on youtube and just watching your [ __ ] burn there's the 120 micron obviously buttered to hell because how long i let it sit on the press but i don't think it's gonna hurt it [Music] all right let's press the big one and then let's go take a dab and then i need to get the [ __ ] out of here but i like to say dear tate because it reminds me of joe dirk [Music] oh that's right yeah okay a moderator i understand i'm sorry i've been so into reddit lately you guys that it's just usually i mean bops are mostly moderators over there but anyway i get what you mean now you got a blue ranch when you go live with them and you help them keep [ __ ] together [Music] i know homie i'm waiting for my taxes to come back so i can make skunk man austin god damn it yo if you don't know anything about skunk man sam you actually don't even know anything about triceps and sir dairy that's you seem very knowledgeable and i don't mean to say that to be rude but i actually you're pretty knowledgeable so you probably know who scott manson is marcus himself bubble man himself shouted out to scott manson without skunk man sam we would be we'd be a long way behind in the full mount [Music] there we go there we go probably let that guy warm up for a little bit too long but that's okay that's the beautiful thing about pressing at 155 degrees you got a little bit of yeah a little bit of leeway looks like there's a couple of you in here hope you guys are having a good day i am wrapping up my work week we're trying to anyway i'm gonna have to come back tomorrow of course but here we go let's get a little bit of frozen banana dry sip hash rosin glow for you again remember guys i didn't really clean it we certainly didn't break out any static tech we're just trying to get some dabs for me to get going with skunk man sam is the [ __ ] man just i gotta say it again austin you know what's up hey thanks mojo i laven if you're old school weed too you remember brett mavericks using the static tech on a pool table with the playing card brett maverick used mavic was that that's that's long enough static tech ago that that's before uh i was seeing people regularly doing it with books and dvds and things damn see i knew we had some crossover man i love solving this bacon bank he's such a cool dude and you ain't kidding i do need a netflix series and i'm down for that pay too um but he is such a cool dude and i just like what he's about um i of course i'm i'm kind of busy doing the same same similar stuff so because of that you know oh i have the timer set for 90 seconds i'm gonna press a little longer than that it just we're probably about 110 right now um [Music] also i don't want to get too crazy with the pressure because i just want this to be fire i don't really care about you um that's a shitty thing to say yeah but solving this bacon baby's such a he's such a cool dude and he's just he just seems to be so like the thing i some people are like so you could say that but they're just so nice i don't get that with him i get to know [ __ ] from him i like that you don't need to be [ __ ] nice for me to be a fan of yours you need to be about your game and he is he's about his game i just don't know personally i get silly with trying to be nice to everybody again some presses you just don't [ __ ] care about the yield this was on the plant how long ago did we start streaming 21 minutes ago this was bud a little over 30 minutes ago now let's see here's our first press this is our one yeah this is the big microphone i think that stuff's going to be better 35 40 minutes ago for sure this stuff was flour in a plastic bin in a tupperware you know what's that you know what time it is only i had a [ __ ] rig ready over here [Music] better not take forever geez my desk is messy i'm so sorry you guys let's uh just bring you in on about that much of it so you don't have to look right at all oh i know what i want to show you so that's the this is a little bit of frozen banana dressing pass rosin that we just pressed together we made it [ __ ] around with the card didn't that card moved it around a little bit let some of the let's let gravity do most of the work for us and uh there we got those two processors from it i couldn't absolutely get a second press and i will later earlier today what did i press oh this is nightwing so here's some night queen dry swift rosin that i pressed a couple hours ago and this is the second press i never [ __ ] with second presses unless it's good hash good hash will press two sometimes even three times if you're not if you're if you're doing short presses or whatever if you're [ __ ] it out you shouldn't have to press it three times but anyway i just want to share that a little bit a little bit a little with you we got some super fire rosins for dab on and um we made them all from the plant to the parchment ready for the bag and it's just 45 minutes tops where are you where are you oh you guys wanna get silly little slurper dab i just saw the case over here don't do that that's how you lose a marble all right guys i gotta have that gauge up all right how we doing how we doing how we doing just so you know i can't see you and i have no idea what the hell is going on but i love you guys [Music] [Music] all righty then [Music] let's uh let's start this [ __ ] off right i'm going to start it off with that second press from the uh from the night queen oh [ __ ] i forgot that i'm working one thing [Music] and by working i mean taking a break i like to take a break about every six to eight hours yes i do work 12 hour days 10 to 12 hour days today is going to be a pretty short day though i'll be out of here i'll be out here right around 10 hours um anyway yes we'll slow down the recovery there a little bit so i can play with you guys for just a minute come on guys i think i just want to look at the picture of that deer pooping now so again give me something let me know what's up give me something to read in there sir dirty had all sorts of good information i do i hate that i'm so uh contrarian and so oppositional and i'm sorry about that but it seems like sometimes like somebody i mean regardless of whether or not he's right about the price we can agree to disagree or just look it up or whatever but i don't know why i have to oh no you're not right he [ __ ] cares if any of us are going to buy a freeze driver we'll find out by the time we check out you know what i'm saying you know what i'm saying there we go that blazer though all right so we're going to start this off with a excruciating dab of the night queen second press tricep hashgraph oh i barely even smoked last night i certainly haven't smoked anything yet today i've been working for since 10 when it's about 7 30. [ __ ] i'm at nine and a half hours now it looks like it's gonna be more like an eleven-hour day whatever where's that second graph that's not it that's not it that's a good problem to have right you like that you guys this is the other reason why i want to do a dab with a second press to start and you might be able to pick up you guys having fun watching me let me watch when i finally get my youtube page pulled up here on my laptop i'll be sitting here by myself i mean i don't know how anybody wants this [ __ ] i gotta be [ __ ] annoying as all hell but i love you guys and i love sharing my little bits of knowledge about how to make hashish with you well and don't worry guys if i knock this rig over digger gave this one to me um for court sales i want to say three years ago so it's a decent ring but it didn't cost anything surprise says oh that's me right there i was like i call myself a surprise set all right here we go oh that's that's actually a very big dab already cheers ladies and gentlemen oh my god i'm not even gonna be able to dab the president that's some night queen and really it's like trim then keith that i threw over a screen real quick and it was so terpy i almost couldn't even i really whoa that must be good where there's the very turkey dab one of you what whatever mcafee any cheers come on dude my antivirus pop up was cracking the comments and then thank you elite uh 27 m uh 27 32 and four and that's for the regular and that's in us dollars iso um but that's just a regular freeze driver it is a food grade freezer option but it's not the pharmaceutical ones which have way way way more um options and settings that you can play with as far as dry times dry times depth of vacuum temperature sublimation is a really amazing thing got me by the nose it really did too man it's like uh and honestly that's the oh that's the second press um mixed micron or whatever it didn't it doesn't have a very clean melt to be perfectly honest with you i'm a little less than impressed with that there's absolutely no char or particulate or anything it's just a little darker than i think it should know anyway let me set this down over here or not shut this down oh man yo night queen [ __ ] give me a break jesus i have never experienced that strain being that loud before um i i've washed it and pressed it i have some sugar of it it's just amazing but never had that happen jesus this frozen banana [ __ ] looks amazing this is not frozen now that's good man all right there we go now this should be the bee's knees wait that's the night queen again i can't do that it's definitely gonna be good that's the 120. the 120 to 159 oh all right here we go no he said it was 2k for a freeze driver and it's 2700 and if you're in canada that's more like three um so he was off by 50 number one and then number two that's if you if you have a pump if you need a pump too it's more unless i'm mistaken if that's the price with the oil pump the other thing is that anybody trying to get one of these to use it in a setting like i'm trying to use it in is not looking for an oil-free pump the oil free pump is like an extra six to eight hundred bucks so at that point it's 35 for the small one and for the record that freeze dryer is so [ __ ] small you're gonna be pissed at yourself for spending three thousand dollars on something that small when you could have spent four thousand on something that is significantly better but still goes back to my point i just i don't know why i always got to be right anyway that's fair and honestly that's the thing is if it's a thing to waste and you're like a hobbyist or whatever damn you're really going in on your hobby but for me i look at it as like well why would i spend two to three grand on something that then when i recoup the value for it it's too small so i mean um freeze dryer is on the schedule not sure what size i'll be getting but we'll see you know what's up it really does man what kind of class is on a dab right what would i say and then aside from that hello annie yeehaw right man damn i [ __ ] but i'm almost scared to go in on another job but we got but number one i need to wrap it up and number two come on jesus man i got dab sweats and [ __ ] my gloves all hashy man jesus and my hands are clammy now because they were in the glove that's probably why i was so hot it couldn't have anything to do with that dab i just took i'm sure it had to do with the gloves all right ladies and gentlemen you know how much i love you um i mean if you don't know who's being silly if sir dirty's still here let's haven't seen a comic i'm gonna walk but if you're stupid still here looks like we're going to split the difference um we're both no i mean to be fair i don't know i don't know actually i don't know about that before i think i just said they're not too um but also i was speaking about the pharmaceutical freezer regardless it is the morton salt girl except it's the morton salt girl taken and done by slinger which marble slinger is a glassblower but then he takes it and he puts an assault rifle in her hands and we have a salt girl that makes sense and this is a special february edition this one's called oh this one's called rain and blood that's right that was the other thing the slayer rain and blood um yeah i love slinger [ __ ] um but this is a this is the picasso version of the design super cool first time i saw it i was like that's like a morton salt girl and then i realized he's holding a gun and i'm like a salt assault like a salt oh god and i've been in love with it ever since because i'm an old nerd and when i see some [ __ ] like that and i think it's cool i never get over it jesus christ look at this [ __ ] frozen bananas you guys it's on was he i didn't know that was i didn't know that was with it but at the same time i was too you know hope you're still here if you're still here let me say something um that's what i was saying about the split the difference oh my god look at that melt you guys need to see the color this rosin is melting into uh [ __ ] dude i went in hot we went in just under 600 degrees holy [ __ ] you guys whoa hey what's up austin my homies in the northeast you know i love you i'm saying that a lot of them anyway that is a beautiful amount and if we were if you remember i was out of the right micron bag so i had to press that at 50. that's the 74 to 119 pressed in a 50 micron bag almost like the same size um you know not really but just a little bit so the fact that i knew that was going to be a little charry or maybe dark on the end as it did get a little char charlie when it dried up or finished but i cannot get over the color of that when it melted down was [ __ ] beautiful and it maintained its color for a minute tastes great tastes great it's a very interesting terpene profile um very very unique for me uh well you guys know it's got to be unique for me because every time i take a dab or a hit of anything i [ __ ] cough for 10 minutes and cry and that isn't happening so it must be different all right guys i was going to say have a great day but that dad was so [ __ ] delicious so delicious just like dog food tastes exactly like it smells delicious all right that's the low mic that's the that's the mids frozen bananas compared to this because this is way way way larger micron hash pressed out of a 50 micron bag so this is certain oh my god what do you guys think drop it i don't know sorry guys this [ __ ] is and i'd like to smoke something with some of my homies back home in missoula how is annie doing man thank you mom um reached out to me about um tincture help for either a sick person or a sick dog or i can't remember exactly but i wasn't able to find the uh micro encapsulation article i was looking for anyway uh it's been a while i'm glad you made it over so if anybody has the chance to try this strain frozen bananas this is my absolute first very very first experience with it [ __ ] uh don't get me wrong the guy that i the guy that i work with is an incredible brother absolutely incredible of the highest calorie so you know if you get your wheat from somebody that all the strains look the same don't be necessarily excited about frozen bananas it might not be that different this is very very exciting for me because it's so different than what i'm used to eddie peace 340. well that means it's 6 40 in california and almost 10 o'clock on the east coast cheers ladies and gentlemen that's exactly how you spell it with a k and one l oh my god wait you guys know i like that i like the flare for the dramatic but i tend not to exaggerate especially not when it comes to ash no cap definitely some of the best cash i have had hashtag that i've smoked so far this year period i don't care if it's from a hyperzone maker or if it's from the dispensary down the street this frozen banana ah find me um 120 to 159 the micron is dry ships hash rising is [ __ ] wild i cannot explain this taste to you guys i guess it is kind of mild like the way a banana is like a mild fruit but yo for real grizz that's what's up man austin where are you that's super cool yeah caspell's though also california's the only town county whatever it's the only place in montana that has a chick-fil-a so if you know what i'm talking about when i say there's nothing quite like the taste of [ __ ] hate oh you can only get it in council i got jokes open your heart let the hate out oh oh you guys i gotta lose some weight i gained weight during quarantine and then i just uh gained a little more love to michigan oh good luck with that because to be honest with you this is the problem the dab before this one i was supposed to quit and get and just finish what i need to do and be done but this [ __ ] is so good man so good nah anyway i hope you all have a wonderful week and hope you all have a wonderful weekend uh for those of you that are patrons or interested in becoming a patreon i'm sorry for those of you that are interested in patreon or are already patrons um i published uh one of the first of an eight video series um a couple days ago i've i have minutes maybe an hour left of editing for the uh part two part three is going to be wild it's going to be a celebration so far we're all only into hydrocarbon content but episode four if you can't tell from all these parchments around me is a dry sift and dry sift pressing episode so we got content coming go over and check it out if you like i and i say this because i encourage you those of you that are interested to just to go over and check it out it's you certainly you know pick the tier that you want with for whatever much you want to support me if you if you don't really give a [ __ ] about that and you just want to see what but what's up with the videos or if they're worth the money whatever then just do the small one you know either way you get to see with everything i just ask that anybody that has the ability and has any interest in helping to support me does that like mr david brazier has been like a [ __ ] high-level tear patron for a year and i mean i've while i think he's i think he's the longest that couple a couple of you guys have been rode with me and it's amazing but mr brazier from alaska i think he absolutely holds the record yes sir i'm gonna try i know this much up until um when i came to work today i had always had some hats you know what that or some oil or whatever but didn't really have any fire rotting feeling like my weekend's gonna be pretty sweet now let's get it started right cheers ladies and gentlemen after this i am gonna rock and roll and go ahead and finish my day pardon me i do encourage you to check out patreon if you're interested in processing a tutorial um hash tutorial but essentially processing tutorial content if you want to learn how to make some stuff make some high high quality stuff uh like there's there's a lot i number one i encourage you if you're gonna get into it to get a notebook my videos are you think my videos are long here the number two that's being published should be published tomorrow it's one right now i think i'm going to be able to knock down another couple minutes so if i should be able to get it to around one hour and 50 minutes it's just under two hours it's a [ __ ] movie i mean but it sucks and it's not entertaining however the amount of information in it is is probably pretty valuable um again check it out if you're interested if you're not i'm always here on youtube you can always email 710.consultations gmail.com you can always email the 7th extractions at gmail.com you're interested in booking a consultation and i'm actually i'm commenting from my 710 consultation so there it is 710.consultations gmail.com or you can text that number if you're interested in booking a conversation and for those of you that are interested in going over and checking out patreon that's great because i feel like i owe so much to the people that have supported me over the last year and the amount of content i i just fell short on being able to publish on time at all um i have this very very very comprehensive eight video series that i'm working on now and when it's finished it may be more like nine or ten videos but when it's finished i'm definitely going to turn off enrollment for a while um it's i uh it's hard when you finish a ton of content and then you need to get back to you know to work and or whatever you're doing and you have a new patreon patron or a subscriber or something come in and then you know their first question is when are you going to post something and i'm going like in my mind i'm thinking like i'm not even trying to shoot anything for a month so it's it's uh it's an interesting thing i'm not the kind of i'm not the kind of uh creator on patreon that like has a podcast going or anything that you would want you know that you check out regularly but there is a significant amount of information available to you right now and when i'm finished my a video series the amount of information that's available to you for the cheapest monthly subscription which is insanely cheap i think it's a pretty good deal i wish somebody would have put all that information together for me and been like give me a couple bucks and you can watch all these videos for a month all right guys yes you're absolutely right i didn't want so austin thank you um as far as things like if you might be interested in them like merchandise uh some personal time with me one-on-one stuff like if that's the kind of thing you're interested in there are some advantages to the opportunities but cheers ladies and gentlemen frozen bananas oh i'm under the same name i am everywhere brother however i do think it is all just one word i don't know why i spaced that either jesus that [ __ ] is so good i want to try a dab of it and save peace and kill the stream and that's my third day oh i love you guys but i gotta get back to it and get it wrapped up again i hope you have a wonderful weekend should anybody have any questions comments concerns anything feel free to go ahead and throw that in the comments section below and aside from that if you have any uh interest in a consultation inquiry you can email 710 dot consultations at gmail.com or you can text the number that i wrote in the chat 406-500-6698 peace", "arcDdONzgBk": "hello senior stoner fan just the real senior stoner back at you for your honey badger cleaned out honey badger dab of the day today is wednesday hello everybody what are some good reasons to go into therapy i want to talk about that because there are so many people that i see out there who are really not getting the therapy getting the help they need there are people in trouble people in mental trouble people in challenging situations people need to talk to people and i think they in most cases people think therapy is really only for very sick people it's not so what i want to talk about is the fact that therapy is much more than just sitting on a couch many many misconceptions are out there about what it means to talk to a mental health professional the need to talk about our emotions is not something to poke fun at or be told that you're weak or be shamed the stigma is a stigma from the past that really is gone so here's the reality about therapy therapy is an incredible tool very useful and it helps with a tremendous range of issues anywhere from anxiety to sleep issues relationships to trauma therapy is incredibly helpful with people managing mental health issues i'm going to try to convince you but i'm going to give you reasons why you should give the practice of therapy a try really it's because i've been so successful with it i have had so much therapy over the years and it's helped me a great deal i know there are tremendous amount of people out there hurting hopefully you'll be able to seek out and get help for yourselves too let's discuss some of the reasons why you might want to go talk to someone are you experiencing unexpected mood swings are you taking on more negativity than usual is it persistent maybe it's worth talking to somebody professional you know unfortunately it's typically a sign that something's wrong and a good therapist can get to the root of the cause you'll have an opportunity to open up about your feelings circumstances in a confidential environment what if you're undergoing a big change in life well you certainly need someone to talk to then this could be a career a family change moving to a new neighborhood a multitude of different things new ventures are challenging and it's normal to seek assistance with that think about it you can work with someone with a neutral perspective to identify goals help you peel back the situation and develop a plan to achieve them therapy often involves the development of skills and strategies that you may not have had you see today with tele telemedicine you can sit on your iphone and have a video chat with a therapist and work through many of your issues god forbid you're having harmful thoughts call 9-1-1 if you are they're completely preventable situations self-harm you need to be in front of a licensed professional please call a hotline if you have an issue like that what have you withdrawn from things what if you've withdrawn from things that used to bring you joy what if there's a loss of motivation you know what that's a signal if you were a social butterfly and suddenly you're pulling away from everything you could be experiencing something deeper a professional therapist is trained to help you uncover what might be occurring the truth is therapy can be very helpful for many people and often it helps individuals sustain positive good mental health what if you're feeling isolated or alone many people deal with this with loneliness with isolation especially now well guess what you're not alone and when you enter therapy you get an immediate sense of relief that you're not alone that problem is extremely well understood and shared by others and can bring a sense of true comfort and hope to both people involved if you have a severe substance abuse problem you need to talk to somebody professional think about it if you find yourself god forbid an alcohol situation or a hard drug situation please there are tremendous breakthroughs in giving care to people suffering from these problems don't sit by the wayside and think there's no help out there for you you can be helped what if you think you have a serious mental condition i've gone through life many times thinking that well guess what you're not alone if you've been feeling off for a long time reach out whether you have an inkling that you're bipolar whether you think you have something else now is the time don't ignore the situation these things are treatable don't let it get out of hand so you become an uncomfortable person in your own skin what if you feel like you've lost control that's a common feeling with people either in substance abuse situations unemployment situations that lack of control keeps people in a circle they call it the circle the cycle of addiction and unfortunately it's not just addiction to to drugs or to alcohol is addiction to bad behaviors so please if you've lost control poke your head up and let's talk to someone what if your relationships feel strained well you know what relationships no matter what type are very hard work we're not expected to have all the answers so if you're with a partner therapy can help both of you have better ways to communicate couples therapy you see even if one partner is hesitant it's still an important thing to think about because a therapist a good therapist can help you pinpoint how to help your partner interpret a misunderstanding think about it what if you've been going through life and everything you've been saying has been twisted just a little bit to left by your partner maybe you can have somebody help that impression be straightened the key thing for everybody to remember here is that therapy is good don't fear it there's no stigma anymore what if you don't sleep right go to the therapist what if you just need to talk to somebody find a therapist and i am not an advertising agent for therapists but therapy is perfectly normal and valuable you know why because it's an experiential thing and it really works there's proof that therapy works well if you enjoy today's discussion about therapy please subscribe to my channel send me your comments i reply to every one of them thanks for watching the real senior stoner here we go with a fingertip dab cheers everybody [Music] wow wow that was a lung buster dab is what that was hope you enjoyed today's session talking about sessions this is a real senior stoner have a great day everybody and don't be afraid to pick up the phone and
