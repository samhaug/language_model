{"2E2LnyuVwuo": "\u266a [music] \u266a - [Woman] I had always wanted a dog.\nI had joked that my first dog would be a Basset Hound named Zeppelin.\nSo when I saw a puppy actually named Zeppelin up for adoption,\nI took it as a sign. He wasn't a Basset Hound but a black\nLab mix, a real mutt. The first time I got to see Zeppelin was on one of those\nadoption trucks in New York, five years ago. There were many small\nfluffy lap dogs with kids banging on the glass and those dogs were getting all the\nattention. And there was one black dog, a little older and bigger than the\nrest, napping through all of it. Zeppelin came from a high kill\nshelter in the south. And I was told no one wanted him. When I met\nZepp, there was nothing not to like. He was friendly, calm,\ngoofy with an underbite, and just damn cute. In our\nminds, Zeppelin was a catch and we wanted to bring him home.\nBut what if we hadn't adopted Zeppelin? What would have happened to him?\nAnd what happens to other black dogs like him? It's called black dog\nsyndrome. The notion that black dogs are adopted last, euthanized first.\nThey're overlooked in shelters and killed more frequently than dogs of any other\ncolor. Zeppelin was born in a cage and the only time he was going\nto leave it was to be put down. - [Sarah] Five years ago, when\nZeppelin was a small, adorable, little puppy with his underbite,\nand he was looking for a home, he couldn't find an adopter. And it\nwas the strangest thing because he was a beautiful puppy.\nHe just happened to be black. - At the time, I wasn't sure what black\nhad to do with it. I needed to find out. I reached out to Heather C. Lum,\na professor based in Philadelphia. Heather had done numerous studies\nrelated to dog color and likeability, including a study where she presented\nsubjects with an image of Labrador dogs. - [Heather] The yellow Lab was considered\nthe most friendly, most adoptable, most likely to want to be around children,\nthings like that. Chocolate Lab was a little bit less so. And then once we\ngot to the black lab, they are far less likely to be considered adoptable,\nfar more likely to be considered aggressive or less friendly,\nall based on color. - Less friendly, these subjects haven't\nmet Zepp. Here's Zeppelin with my seven-month-old baby,\nas loving and gentle as can be. While some people are scared of black cats\nbecause they are associated with bad luck, others are terrified of black dogs\nbecause they assume they're violent, how depressing. From The Hounds\nof Baskerville to Harry Potter, black dogs have long been associated\nwith evil. Even the common \"beware of dog\" sign, depicts a big black dog,\nteeth bared, and eyes bulging. - [George] People associate dark\ncolored dogs and black dogs with some sort of aggressor. You know, there's\nnever a cute movie where it's a black dog. Lassie is very light-colored,\nyou know. All the jokes aside, those same kind of stereotypes apply\ninto the canine world. The black dog is usually like a Doberman\nchasing you down the street and, like, tearing the bad guys,\nlike, the seat of his pants. - [Suzanna] In general, there\nhave been...people think of black animals as just scarier. I think\nthey're, like, in movies and t.v. shows, where if you have an evil animal,\nthey're often dark and black. And I think that can, kind of, play\ninto what maybe already preconceived notions around breed\nor what a dog looks like. - I have physically watched people\nget nervous and get scared when crossing the street. But we've had him for so long that he's family. that I just kind of laugh it off now. - Fact, not even 100 years ago, Winston Churchill named his depression\n\"black dog.\" And it remains a scientific term in mental health. I'm not\nsure what Churchill was thinking. Zeppelin always cheers me up. Dogs\nlike Zeppelin are dependent on rescue groups who go into high kill shelters\nin the south and pull them out into other cities like New York and L.A.,\nwhere they have a greater chance of being adopted. Social\nTees based in New York was the rescue group who found Zeppelin. - [Lashley] Dogs just like Zeppelin come\nfrom an organization in Tennessee that we work with, along with other\nrescues, to pull in all of the puppies and dogs that, again, are either\nabandoned or have been in high kill shelters and puppy mills. - So they will be taking the black\ndogs, often litters of black puppies. There could be eight-week-old puppies that\nare beautiful. And they're going to be large or small, whatever size.\nBut it's just because they're black, nobody is interested in them. - [Zarina] I'm told by shelter\nmanagers, \"This is a black dog.\" I know what that means. This\ndog will have less time and less opportunity to be adopted locally because\nthey're just not going to risk the chance of having this dog in a kennel\nlonger than it needs to be, when they have\nan overpopulation of incoming dogs. - Almost every rescue group I met\nwith had a story about how black dogs are at a higher risk. - [Rachael] A dog named Captain had\nbeen in the shelter since he was six months old. And he was three\nand a half, so literally in the shelter for three years. And he was a, probably,\n80 pound, 75, 80, pound black pit bull. People would have passed by and see this\ngiant black pit bull who had been there for three years and assume, well,\nsomething must be wrong with him. The longer dogs are in rescue or in the\nshelter, the more people assume that. So it just makes it harder for them\nas, you know, as they're with us longer. But Captain got adopted.\nHe went into a foster home. And he got adopted in two weeks. - [Eva] Had we not rescued Wedge,\neven though I believe he was the sweetest dog at the shelter. We used him for temp\ntesting for days, and he passed every test with flying colors. I don't see that he\nwould have gotten out because their local adoption rate is probably in single\ndigits, like maybe 1%, 2%, 3%. You're much more likely to survive\nif you are white, or if you're fluffy, or if you're small, or if you have brown\nspots. But a black dog, not so lucky. - So what would have happened to him? - He would have been euthanized. - It's also true that there are so many\nblack lab mixes and pit bull mixes down south, that, you know,\nif you just have a row of black dogs, I guess, in people's minds, they\ndon't become individuals anymore. It's just a sea of black dogs. And it's\njust one pen after that, the black dog, black... You know, I think people just,\nagain, they don't see the individual. They just see another black dog.\nBlack dog, black dog, black dog. Well, look at that cute\nwhite dog, you know? - Everyone I spoke to, from dog owners\nto rescue groups, believe that one of the main reasons black dogs have a\nhard time is because they just don't photograph well. I know better than to try\nto take a picture of Zeppelin at night. He's a black blob. He blends in to the\ncouch. And it's hard to see his features in a quick snapshot. A few times,\nI almost sat on him accidentally. - When you go to shelters, very often,\nyou know, the lighting is very poor. You know, it's very dark.\nAnd a black dog just doesn't stick out as will a white\ndog in that environment. - When we pull dogs from the\nsouth, you get one crappy photo that's texted to you. The dog is often\npetrified, ears back, and looks nothing like the dog that I get after I fully\nvetted and transported them up from the south. And with black\ndogs, the photos are terrible. - When you photograph a black dog,\nit's really hard to see their expression, whereas dogs that have multiple colors,\nand textures, and, you know, are fuzzy, or what not, those read a lot\nbetter online and that is in the initial impact of where you meet your dog. - When we have a black dog in the program,\nwe are prepared to do many more things to get that dog adopted,\nto advertise the dog, to have him/her professionally\nphotographed, groomed. We dress them up to make them look\nfriendlier, softer, always have kids and people around them, and just we have\nto do much more to push that black dog than any other dog. I know the number\nof black dogs that we come across that are just simply not adopted. And I know\nthey have a limited amount of time. \u266a [music] \u266a - [Shaina] I think shelters have a\nhard time promoting black dogs. Because shelters are really busy.\nThey have a lot of work to do. And getting a great picture\nisn't always the priority. - Working with rescue groups\nin New York, Shaina created the overlooked black dogs project. - I started the project because I wanted\nto bring awareness to the issue. If you're getting hundreds of dogs\nin a day or a week, you can't spend more than a few minutes\ntaking a great picture. - Today, Zeppelin gets to be the star. - I thought showcasing\nthese beautiful dogs against the black background,\nwell, most people would think that you wouldn't be able to see a black dog.\nSo really being able to highlight the beauty of those dogs and show\nthat you can take pictures, beautiful pictures of black dogs. - I didn't know black dog syndrome\nwas a thing when I first got a dog. But the fact remains that according\nto a study published in 2010, over 50% of black dogs\nare euthanized a year. - I know, just from my own experience\nwith my dog, Ozzy. He turned out to be gorgeous, and shiny,\nand happy, and healthy, and a great dog, no different than any\nother dog in the shelter. Just because of his color,\nhe was was overlooked. - You know, I have a black pit bull\nand I think combination of his color and his breed, make people feel\nreally afraid of him on the street. Like, I've run into a lot of people who\nhave literally crossed the street when we see him walking by. And they just\nhave no idea that he's the friendliest. - I remember when I first saw Zeppelin\nin that adoption truck. Back then, I was looking for a dog with the right\npersonality, who would belong in our home, just like this little dog Joplin. I don't know what would\nhave happened to Zeppelin if we hadn't stumbled across him\nthat day on the adoption truck. I don't want to imagine his\nstory ending any other way. He's black. He's beautiful.\nAnd he belongs with us. \u266a [music] \u266a", "JT8_N3zWAGw": "hello everyone this is Rio Grande from ten rooster in this video presentation I'm going to show you the black dog forex trading system so I used this forex trading system back when I was trading forex something like five six years back and it's also been applicable when I apply this to Indian market it's very much applicable and it's a price action works exactly as it's supposed to be with this black pepper forex trading system right so let's move on to the next slide and then go or my indicators and show you the rest of the stuff right let's move on to next slide a legal disclaimer and kindly read them clearly all right let's next slide okay the indicators let's move on to the indicators before the mocking are indicators I wanted to show you that it's I'm originally purchased a black duck like a five years back at around close to 300 bucks 300 dollars okay so the system owner said that black duck forex is created by either day back in so I'm going to give a credit to him because a lot of vision in the black duck Forex he has a lot of templates and different types of you know style you wanted to trade five minutes in here three minutes were given 15 minutes it doesn't matter here a lot of style versions templates are available what I am using it's a world one that I bought it which also is a so say know what's exactly in Indian market that when I applied it here okay so I'm going to share you what are the consist of the indicators here right let's look at that indicators here is a first one is a ma 50 EMA 50 hi-low channel okay now why that is even used let move on to the next line the next one is EMA 15 close okay and then st st stands for a short time at d which is a setting of 1027 okay and then LT stands for long term at D which is at 135 70 and then 12 is a setting and then EMA crossover this just indicated there is no in the indicator of the arrow only not the no plotting the EMA okay just a arrow indicator plotting 15 crosses too and then I am a crossover only the arrow and the text was 100 EMA and then 20 okay so let's move on to the each indicator and what its what is the purpose okay so first one is the ma 50 I love channel the EMA 50 I love channel act as a money line okay price is above the EMA a channel is bullish and the price is below MA channel is bearish so so what you're saying this is a 50 ma Channel we're above the EMA channel is a bullish and below LM a channel is bearish also here the indicator is you know exactly plotz when bullish its plots a green and then bearish its plots a green it's a visually appealing you know it's a very simple to know that boy the channel is bullish and below the channel is bearish okay that's all is the first one the second one it's a EMA 15 close there's a EMA indicator which is a line okay line indicator the MFI closely follows the price and determines the trend by strength and pullback evaluation the pullback evaluation we'll look at it in later part but what is that means here if we EMA 15 greater than 15 EMA channel so in this case here is a bullish bias okay so we know that it's a the EMA 50 ma channel is green means it surprises ah boy it's a bullish but bullish bias is continuing then we we should know that a 15 EMA it should be a body 50 period EMA Channel okay that's what it says that then second one is the opposite of the bullish with the survey bearish now it's a 15 e EMA less than the 15 mm 50 ma Channel okay so 13 EMA is crossed down that 50 ma period okay so now that is a bearish bias it's continuous okay now the third one is 15 EMA so it's actually sluggish actually it's a lot greater than not less than 50 ma so which means it's it's something like a penetrating between that 50 ma channel so market is not going anywhere okay so this is a no identifying the choppiness is no pretty excellent way it identify the choppiness and it give you the signal that it's not going anywhere so you should be avoiding your tree basically whenever it is you notice the market stays within this 50 period channel and the 15 year me and the blue line is stays within that area so market is not going anywhere and it stays sideways so this that is what the 15 EMA closes acting us okay let's move on to the next say indicator short-term MACD okay the mad day that he uses is a slightly different than the the MACD that comes with are there any other platform okay the mad day that he uses the setting is 10 20 and 7 okay the 7 is not useful here actually because the line is not plotted only the histogram okay the short term we are Mac they refer this trend is strength to basically so the greater the short-term MACD is greater than zero then bullish strength is you know more if the short-term MACD is less than zero it's a very strength this mode that's very simple straightforward right nothing to worry about is the bar is lower bar is bigger is it a dark green or low green doesn't matter it's it just above the gray above the zero line or below the zero line that's it that's what the short-term MACD says there okay let's move on to the next slide long-term MACD so long-term Mack days setting is 35 70 and then 12 period it uses the MACD and then the signal also the Matt be signal also is plotted if long-term MACD is greater than bullish greater than zero then it's a bullish trend starts so basically the bullish trends when this crossover of 30 and 35 and 70 basically so once it's crossover then you start looking for that trade okay we look at the trade and the next part series are later this in this video also okay if a be less than 0 then it will be looking for only the bearish trend okay let's move on to the next slide hope he was clear about the long-term Mandy okay it looks like London might be that's it so now the EMA crossover 15 told there isn't now this is not a no indicator and no 13 EMA crossover used only the two indicator to EMA's which is a 15 period and then to two EMA okay the EMA crossover 15 and then to EMA serves as a pullback factor what I mean is that the 15 now this money line is now pointing up which is a 50 period EMA Channel and then 15 EMA's above Ella body EMA channel so which means only the bullish bias now if you look at that the red and blue arrow which is 15 and 2 EMA crossover so it actually evaluate the pullback factor we are in market where they already bullish bias is established and the market is trending okay now we will be looking for to buy the buy the trigger okay that's actually evaluating the pullback factor that's what I mentioned here it's basically by finding the pullback predatory effective okay next one another ATM across so where is he used 120 with this indicators it's a trend reduction okay it's similar to in a 3570 long term MACD it's also used to here so when a black dog they're the first arrow that in a service in a black dog so it's a latest black dog is up which means it's you need to look for only the Bice by side a no more you know sell side area so only look for by side alone okay in this scenario just a triggered here and then we know that it's a market is trending with it's not that you have to go and buy it directly here you have to wait for the market to reach to closer to the 15 period EMA or closer to the 50 period EMA channel okay so this is where the my you have to buy it because this is what the money lines is there right so you should not buy all the way top my stop in us here and by market reverse you lose and hit your stop loss because market wants to pull back and then go back pull back and then go back so this is what is a market typical trend so when is even the blood establish the market is trend is established then only find the trade in that direction only the blood duck because the black dog bark that a market is up so only in that direction you already watch okay look if we put all together this is how it likes overall okay so the blood dog it says it's a dog a sub so we will be looking for only in that upside direction so if you look at this the the below this you know market window where the long-term Magnus up is a Buddha zero it's up already and then short-term mag days also up the trend strength is up money line is another 50 period channel EMA channel is up and then 15 period EMA is above allah body 50 . e EMA channel and then we will be looking for this small trigger of by triggers you know if this is actually Asian Paints Asian Paints in our today's back it took this a screen shot and if you look at that how many signals been triggered and any would have worn it at least a two to three signals here okay so let's move on and look at the chart and I will explain that one by one here okay so let's first look at that you know look at we have to identify the trend okay how do you identify that a trend so this is actually a sheen paint I mean a five minute chart so long term mag days well above the well above the zero so trend is being established and then short term agnese firing up in OP sidebar above zero so strength trend strength is up and then we have matt days up long term so short term at D and the long term at days up so we will be looking for only by and then the look at the black duck is also fired at the right place so the market is fired and the blood dogs is up you will be looking for to buy by the market right so market you should not be here because it's actually breakout or any price action you can start buying it but typically won't even you have to buy when your market comes to closer to 15 period EMA or a 50 period channel so this is the first trigger and this is a second trigger and the next day it's a Friday we have a trigger because the trend is continuing right so another trigger another trigger this trigger so if you could look at that this is how it traders let's look at the there's a bullish signals let's look at the inner bearish signals okay there you go so the will the head of in our trend direction so the black duck why it's you know very before it black that fire said that it's going to go down okay so it's that time the black dog arrow in the text message will show you that black dog arrow is down that time okay now that time is actually you know the short term might be a steam act is down loyalty might be long term might be is down so now we'll be looking for to sell the market are by the put options or bear put whatever your choice so directly don't go and sell it I so wait for in order to pull back the trade so the market is coming and touching the 15 period EMA where you have to try to use so MACD is still no firing of the lower low and then short-term MACD is also firing that lower low so it is a good way to trade and that's a second trade trade for 350 trades so that's a real very trending market he would have made it good money okay I will show you the choppy day so in the 15 period EMA goes to 50 period at a channel so look at that price is not going anywhere right though there you know the black dog arrows fired that up and then back to channel and then crossed over now the black dog arrows fired ago history it's going to go up so then now that I am a is also going up so that this virus came and tested that routine period EMA and then 50 period mmm so here here or something like that you have to buy so its market is going or so another point where you have to buy so it's all pullback when the market you have the momentum using that MACD indicator and then we're filtering using a 50 period EMA channel and and 15 period EMA okay so will and price action strategy using a few indicators you can apply the same indicators in any trading platform platform because the indicators are well-known indicated since most of the technical analysis package will have this indicators okay so we'll also go ahead look at that how we are going to apply this into a very effective method and the next part serious okay so I've just explained it the rules here and the indian my indian market just applying it i also have a one more method of i know filtering out the nicest using this zone mechanism okay so i will explain that in our next series part of this black dog forex trading systems so let's move on to the next slide so that's all i wanted to share with you today about a black trading for very simple and then effective trading strategy and you can apply and then test yourself and then if it is useful give a thumbs up in the youtube video and do follow me in twitter and then post your curries anything in the youtube comments okay thanks have a good day bye bye", "6cKYPLSUW20": "October 1st is national black dog day which encourages people to adopt black dogs so in this episode of great show of greyhounds I wanted to share with you the story of how we got mate our black Greyhound Black Dog syndrome is a phrase that animal shelters and adoption organizations use when referring to the tendency of people to skip over black dogs when they look to adopt a pet black dogs are frequently thought to look more intimidating and that can make a person perceive them as being aggressive but that point of view would not be very accurate because their disposition is no different than that of any other color of dog regardless animal shelters on average have black dogs in their care for longer periods of time than that of dogs of other colors simply for the reason that people feel uneasy about adopting them knowing this when we moved out of my condo and into this house several years ago and decided to get a second greyhound we reached out to the group that we work with Hartley and greyhound adoption and asked them if they had any black dogs that they were having difficulty placing and they told us they had three normally when Heather and I are looking to get another pet we're not being very choosy about what that animal looks like but in this instance we wanted to help out Harmon greyhound adoption by taking a dog off their hands that other people were passing up we arranged to meet all three of these dogs at the same time the first one did not care that we were around at all the second one was only interested in smelling a tree and the third one walked right up to Heather nuzzled his head into her lap and let out a really big sigh his name is walkabout mate and he chose us mate is a very good boy and he is super cuddly he always wants to snuggle on the couch and if for any reason you were to stop hitting him he'll let you know me was retired early when he was about 2 he didn't race much because he was kind of a goofball and may not have put it together that he was supposed to win his races now he spends his days running around the backyard and playing with his toys despite not being very good at racing he's surprisingly competitive when playing chase with our other dog Wilson a really endearing quality of me is how much empathy he has he's very much aware of how other people are feeling around him and he will try really hard to make a person feel better if he can tell that they're upset about something he would make a really good therapy dog Maine's most favorite thing ever is food he will sit as hard as he can so that he can get a reward sitting is the only trick that we've ever taught him so he uses it all the time to let us know that he is present and that he is a good boy the main takeaway that I hope everyone gets through this video is that even though a black dog can look scary they are only mean if they learn that behavior from humans either due to being trained to be protective and be a guard dog or if it's a reaction to how someone has treated them badly any dog can have any personality it doesn't matter what the color is what I hope I've demonstrated today is that mate has a lot of really good qualities but there is one drawback to having a black dog they are really difficult to take a good picture of I have deleted so many photos off of here that just did not work out because they came in as just being solid black blobs I find that I have the most success if I take a picture of a black dog win the back leg so for this episode's photo finish I am sharing this back leg picture of mate and I will be posting it to Facebook Instagram and Twitter and I encourage you to reply back at great show with a picture of your black dog using the hashtags photo finish and national black dog day the next episode of the great show finds us back at the emergency vet because Olive has again fallen down the deck stairs tearing open her foot and exposing the bone so I have to do something with these deck stairs so I'm gonna show how I have padded them to keep the dogs safe if they fall down a link to that video as well as the previous can be found over here you can also watch any other video at youtube.com slash great a subscription link is here on the screen

to warehouse hello my name is David and this is Grayson we're part of the team over here we are kind of what we call BDS to what it is it's the second showroom but we really is there really is a wolf retail warehouse thinking we have to have a runner things that you bring in for us and thanks to self acceleration that's right so we're kind of like the first stop for all things Salvage here so a lot of folks have seen our show we've got in the field and we Salvage buildings and then we come back with the salvage and this is where we all unload the truck together so it comes up the trogs we do all the weights and measurements photographing begin the research process and hopefully get it online and even eventually to our showroom originally we got this building about three years ago maybe as a warehouse to store things we've kept our multiples hear things like flooring and paneling that take up a lot of room in our showroom we would have a sample board over at BDS one as we've been calling it and then over here at our warehouse is where we would store all of the wood a lot of lumber multiples and things like that and over the years we've just kind of accumulated so much and we just decided to open up this to the public the warehouse we've estimated it at about 25,000 square feet maybe inside outside I don't know maybe an acre and a half a lot of wood work that we have is located inside that outside and a lot of stonework a lot of our wrought iron railings it is imported everywhere from Egypt or from around the world a couple of Hoarders that get out of control the family way I can describe it over here that but you know we do have them under control because we're trying to take you know tabs and a lot of the inventory that comes in we've got a variety of different things things come in every day now we don't know what's arrived sometimes in the runs you don't even know what it is but that's what we do we average over here yesterday so some of this cool stuff that we've got on the inside you know a lot of stained glass pieces entry ways that come out of houses that are having a nice next to the bright years bowling alley flooring all flooring that we've ever salvaged a lot of paneling under seats that we have around here too a lot of throw many left yeah going through something an amazing long outside we've got some really cool famous feel brewery equipment is the best way to avoid there was a disassembled a brewery and there's Fair Park and every night together yeah sometimes that s when you take your car to the mechanic they do this so we get extra parts laying around here they can have some of those yeah creeper project also outside we've got cast iron fire pit we do this kettle Mike goes around lots of times or it gets phone calls who knows where those phone calls come from but we get to score some wrought iron railing some transoms and actually over 600 of them that have come from actually Egypt so I'm date back 100 200 years oh and they are a bit rustic we're just starting to process this is what happens we bring them in station steps forward kind of we start the way these things and she is the team leader certainly Tory every single one every item we research the history of this is what we want to find out about it uh-huh every little bit that we can find out about it because that's what brings not only value but almost a lot of the history with it just part of the story sure sort and that going back to Mike and the way things he brings in we got an airplane recently we I heard that I haven't seen this something with another airplane well you know the research actually hasn't been done yet but we do know that it is a Duke Beechcraft so another year but it's just a fuselage and it's been cut into two pieces for sale section and in the front section so could be determined what we're going to do with it could get creative with that with it yeah we've got some light pictures here as well we've got some corrugated chicken wire glass and amber and clear what did we score that from where did he find all that stuff it was a railroad building record with hair building in Clifton Forge Virginia soon to be seen on episode well one of the episodes in season 8 so another cool thing about the warehouse is you'll get to see some things before the air or you might see things from the past that we've salvaged that you recognize from there our show so how do we get here Maui well you know there's different ways of course but if you're coming from Black Dog this you just go across Memorial Bridge the first right so what you do just go down two blocks it's going to be about a mile you'll see a ballpark on the left hand side the name of the street is a schlong 629 a schlong as soon as you turn the corner six either side big fully warehouse with our that was our sign on it hanging on the front Park on the street having the walking entrance don't try to drive in New York you might remember this is an active work that's exactly what it is we are open for retail it really is just the warehouse yeah I've been thinking of it as like a Pickers paradise this is kind of how Mike and Robert started you know bunch of Salvage there's people working so to be aware but we're also here to help you and we want you to come and hang out with us and shop around well folks I mean that that's pretty much the basics there I think we've covered as you can you're just going to have to come and check it out yourself [Music]", "MyXvzDdWK8E": "good evening and welcome tonight we're going to be

2013 I was homeless and living in the local women's shelter the exclusive director of the place is a man called Dan he was shady as hell with the creepiest sleaziest aura around him and a long history of abusive behavior towards the shelter's clients but that's an entirely different story most nights Dan left the shelter by 5:00 p.m. and he was virtually never to be found on the grounds past 701 October night he was still kicking around at 9:00 a few of the other ladies and I was sitting outside just chatting when we saw him pull his car out of the back driveway and take off down the street like his ass was on fire his back tires spun out in the gravel before getting purchase and that's how fast he accelerated and just as his car disappeared I saw an absolutely enormous black dog or wolf like creature come leaping through the brick wall where his office was it took three long strides across the front yard lapped towards the road Dan had taken off down and vanished into smoke everyone was quiet for a moment until I asked if anyone else had just seen that one of the ladies said yep and we hurried around to get back inside I'd never felt so deeply and viscerally unnerved the night at that night I'd raved so many blankets over my bunk that it was like a little cage just trying to feel secure enough to sleep fast-forward to December we had a new lady in our room and was staying up past lights out to work on some small Christmas gifts and while we were working we were quietly telling ghost stories I happened to mention what happened in October and once I'd finished two things happened all at once the temperature in the room plunged it was a little chilly back there because Dan was too cheap to turn up the heat or even turn it on sometimes but this was cold like someone had opened the window and the baby in the room next door had been dead asleep let out the most blood curdling shriek I'd ever heard from her like someone was hurting her and started screaming crying so loud she woke up everyone in the woman's shelter to this day I don't know what exactly I saw but I've been left with the distinct feeling that it was evil and attached to Dan in some way or another and you know it was always a joke that he'd sold his soul to the devil to be as untouchable as he was I am an atheist but I'm open to the ideas of ghosts however I can't explain what happened summer of 2017 I'm a 19 year old male working in Dubrovnik Croatia as a Booker for a tourist company and a bartender slash animator for the same companies pub crawl boat party my employer was paying me and my three roommates accommodation but this cheap guy placed us in a village called Oscar play which was twenty one point three kilometers away from Dubrovnik this village had six houses not including our own and less than 15 people living there the biggest issue was that no bus passed there since it was a top of hill so you needed to hike around downhill to this ala village where the bus stop was built the hike down to the village was 45 minutes half hour on the road of 15 minutes in the village and the bus ride to Dubrovnik was another 45 minutes one night I was working alone and was coming back about 2 a.m. from the boat party making my way back from the bus stop to our house I stepped onto the road on the left of the village with the bus stop and turned on my phone flashlight to light the road since there were no streetlights this was vehicles only no pedestrian path and I turned on the flashlight since this area was known for venomous snakes and I wasn't willing to deal with that and half way there when all of a sudden I heard a howling behind me a wolf like how first there are no wolves in this part of Croatia and secondly my father is a vet and we've had a lot of dogs mostly German shepherds so I know what a big dog sounds like and this dog's voice was deep I slowly turn around and find this massive dog staring at me roughly 20 meters away growling barking and howling but not moving a muscle I followed his example and stood there for half a minute just analyzing the dog I had never seen this breed of dog it must have been twice the size of a German Shepherd let's say as large as a Great Dane but its head was definitely more similar to a Doberman or Belgian Shepherd also it was completely black there was something completely off about this dog I'm not gonna say it had an evil aura since I don't believe in that sort of thing but I simply had the feeling that this was something of a demonic dog or something like that I can't explain it but for some reason I felt like the least of my worries should be this dog biting me take note at this point we were standing in the middle of a row in the middle of the night there aren't a lot of cars that pass here at this hour but I wanted to get off the road either way after staring each other down for about a minute I slowly without turning make my way to the house after I walked about a hundred meters the dogs stopped the growling turned away and left I picked up the pace and was just only a few minutes away from home when I heard a growl this time it was meters away from me I turn around and the dog was less than three meters away if I had made a single step I could have reached out and petted him once again this dog was growling but not attacking me it did the regular attack and would posture with its tail up legs widened ears up and teeth showing we stared at each other for another minute the dog didn't move a muscle and neither did I the beast was as large as me at least I'm weighing at least 60 kilograms and was definitely as large as a Great Dane once again I slowly start making my way home backwards and the dog doesn't let up but it doesn't follow me I made my way home and The Barking & howling stopped as I closed the door behind me I tell my roommates about it and they say they've never heard anything even though the dog was relentlessly barking and howling just 200 meters away from the house while they were awake with no TV no radio on in the room I asked the neighbors about the dog they said the same thing and added that no one in the village owns a dog my roommates and I agreed that we should never let anyone go home alone at night because of this scenario we went on to investigating the surrounding area never found anything no reason this baffles me so much is because the temperature there can reach over 40 Celsius and that's in the shade there's no natural drinkable water source and there are no animals there except the snakes small lizards birds and insects the dog even if it were able to stand the heat could not feed and that large of a dog must need a lot of food nor could it find water there was no way that dog could survive in the wild and there wasn't anyone nearby all in the next village who owned a large dog the neighbor was kind enough to ask around you see the dogs seem to have come from nowhere and we never have heard from it again which is probably for the best about two years ago my best friend and I were driving home from late-night classes we live in a rural area and take these roads daily we've had a few strange encounters on these roads but this one stuck with me it was pretty dark and we were going about 40 miles an hour I never drive faster than that on these roads because of deer and other wildlife the road has a few houses so it wasn't completely wooded I'm driving alone and see some eyes and a dark figure that resembled that dog I stopped the car to let across the road it runs across the road and at the edge of the bank and stands on its hind legs and runs like a human my friend and I are scared because of how creepy this was we tried to register what we saw and decided that it wasn't possibly a dog it may have been something else it was too small and skinny to be a bear all I can conclude is that I saw a skinny canine creature running across the road and stand on its hind legs and run into the wood it was a quiet and damp night in Akata California in this small town not much happened low crime rates everyone knew everyone if there was a ruling party meant to happen every team in town knew and if someone wasn't from there we could smell it it was oddly dark tonight completely devoid of light my friends and I decided to play on our personal playground this morning and we've been out here ever since and looks and feels to be close to midnight I've always been good at telling time just by looking at the moon tonight was a full moon actually my favorite of the bunch Murray come on we're gonna play hide and seek my best friend yelled from across the field I didn't even notice that I had been staring at the moon for quite some time now well we had a hill that connected the playground in the woods and if you went into the woods you'd soon find yourself in your neighbor's backyard so the hill created a wall between us and the neighbors as kids we made a sort of dare to see who had the guts to jump the wall and into the playground I of course always won well me and Vanessa Vanessa is my best friend when closer than Tom and Jerry honestly coming I respond to Vanessa then our friend Jackson who's only about a year younger than us which makes him eight I take one last glance at the hill which is the way to climb the wall but my attention is immediately drawn to something much more peculiar I see someone's feet climbing the hill but I can't see their face due to a branch that drapes over the hill at first I think nothing on it people always climbed the hill as a shortcut to get to one neighbors on the other side but for some reason this wall was different I couldn't take my eyes off this strange figure by this time Vanessa and Jackson noticed my staring and came over to see what I was so intrigued with within a blink of an eye the human feet that were once visible and now pause almost on instinct I push Vanessa and Jackson behind me slowly backing away towards the entrance to the house guys run we all start sprinting towards the door I struggle for my keys but they drop to the ground and I hear a gasp come from Nessa and I look up to find a creature staring right at us I secretly slipped the keys to Vanessa while I stand in front of them in a protective stance he's big his du coated fur is like coal drew escaped through his mangy sharp teeth disappearing into the prickly grass his eyes while they were gazing right at me it felt like he was taking a piece of my soul and they were blood-red but to my own surprise I wasn't afraid I felt drawn to him paralyzed almost like I never wanted to leave this spot I stood in but my protection for my safety of my friends got the better of me you want them you're gonna have to go through me I said confidently he saw the challenge in my eyes i half expected him to lunge at us but he never did he stood there his crimson orbs never leaving my brown ones he was drawn to me I could see it I could taste it I felt a tug on my Backstreet Boy shirt and before I knew it I was standing facing Vanessa and Jackson in my own they look terrified to say the least everything was in complete silence now we were safe but in my mind I was still out there gazing into those eyes I wanted to see them again and I turned to look in the window but it was gone there was a sting in my heart a feeling of disappointment and rejection my friends and I ran upstairs to calm ourselves down we all got permission from our mums in order for them to sleep over until the morning the next day my mum walked Nessa and Jack's to their house and we never spoke with that night again 10 years later and I still fall asleep in the cold of night dreaming about those crimson eyes I've had more than one and my fair share of paranormal experiences and came face to face with multiple weird things since then I'm now 20 and did some deep research as to what I saw the only thing that describes my experience to a tee is the hellhound my dad had a sister who I never met she passed away before I was born it's a very touchy subject as you can imagine within the family but one time my grandma was getting drunk and brought up this story on her own I asked my father about it after and Heba grudgingly nodded his head and said that we think it's true but to not speak of it the tale goes like this apparently many years ago my father and his sister were out on the land as they lived on a ranch they were doing their duties and his sister chose to stay out a little longer to finish off some work she was doing she must have been around 17 at the time my father a bit younger went in because he was hungry and she never returned after about two hours my dad was thinking it was weird that she hadn't come in yet so he went out looking for her and when he found her she was crying by a tree the Sun had almost set and it was dark and he was asking her what was going on she explained that just as she was finishing trimming some bushes did she look over to come into the house and put the shears away when she saw this huge black dog with red eyes she said the dog easily came up to her chest and that upon seeing it she froze in fear the dog led at her without a sound for a few more seconds and just like that evaporated into a smoky mist his sister couldn't take it and she freaked out ran and hid behind the tree not knowing what to do and too scared to go home as that would mean passing where it had disappeared my dad told her not to worry but it was probably her imagination a deep down he didn't think she could imagine something so vivid that would terrify her so much he brought her in and they tried to forget about it but apparently his sister liked to share and told my grandmother and my grandfather what she'd seen my grandfather being a very stern man said that it was nonsense that she obviously imagined it and to put it at the back of her mind did not give it any more thought my grandmother however was a bit more compassionate and although she had a hard time believing her that some strange dog appeared out of the Mist and then vanished again she did her best to make her feel better not three days passed and again my dad's sister was out on the land doing some yard work my dad was right next to her they were chatting and having a good when all of a sudden she seizes up my dad looks at her with a start and in the distance he sees the very same black dog she is frozen in fear and as the dog disappears she lets out a horrific yell and then her face contorts in agony my dad doesn't really know how to describe it but her eyes nearly rolled to the back of her head and she collapsed they rushed her to hospital and they found out that apparently she had an unknown aneurysm in her head and it had burst killing her they don't know if the sight of the black dog was enough to cause it to burst from the stress or perhaps it was an omen of her life coming to an end as you can imagine it took a very heavy toll on the family my grandfather started drinking again ended up going to rehab and never ended up leaving as he took his own life from the grief my grandmother is still about and doesn't often talk about her daughter but I know she still hurts from it my father has never let us have a dog for obvious reasons my mum has had many many strange and paranormal encounters in her life including meeting her own doppelganger as a child she had many stories to tell me and I've grown up hearing about them the flying cups in her bedroom the vacuum cleaner running by itself when she was a little girl however there's one that still baffles me to this day and I want to know if anyone else has ever seen this creature or knows anything about it years ago before I was born my mom had been staying at her best friend's house for a while her best friend was married so her husband was also there but he and my mom early interacted with each other when she was there he always kept to himself and still does today as they're still friends as my mum put it she was parked in her friend's driveway waiting for her friend to come out so that they could leave my mum was alone in the car fiddling around with some buttons and such and she glanced in her rearview mirror what she saw horrified her in the rearview mirror she saw a large black dog walking on its hind legs now I'm a very skeptical person of everything so I asked my mum if it was just a random big old dog standing on its back legs and using the car for support she insists that no it was walking like a human did it did not touch her car it walked along the sidewalk like a human would it did not once get on all fours and that it walked on two legs she swears this and I can see by the genuine terror in her eyes that she's telling the truth I asked if she saw the legs she said as soon as she looked behind her it had vanished into thin air gone like a ghost when she looked around there wasn't a single dog or person in sight that's not the scariest part for me at least my mum visited her best friend again not just the house she hates the house a few years ago and the subject of spirits came up my mum told her exactly what she told me about the dog or whatever it was walking behind the car in her driveway because she never told anyone her best friend looked at her pale in the face and said my husband told me he saw that too it walked on two legs two people saw the exact same creature in the same spot at different times I've heard legends of dogs and how you can see it so many times as a signal of fate or fortune but what was that have any of you ever seen anything like it I'm terrified because I passed my driving test recently and if I see this thing or anything remotely unnatural in my rearview mirror I think I'll have a heart attack fifteen years ago I lived in a town in Indiana where we lived was in the country a few miles away from town there were a few wid things that happened so first off I woke up at 3:00 a.m. and had a strong urge to go to my window when I opened the blinds and saw a yellow eyes and it was as if it were piercing through my soul I felt instant hopelessness and fair and turned around and went back to bed I'm a hundred percent sure I wasn't dreaming when the morning came and I went to the area I saw the eyes and didn't see any footprints the following night I was standing on my porch and suddenly smelled rotting flesh and the worst thing I've ever smelled and proceeded to hear crunching leaves to my left I see a very large black dog walking towards my home I screamed and ran inside that night and I heard scratching on the side panels of our home the following day I found a large patch of fur probably four by four in the same area where I had seen the large dog but the fur was white with gray instead of black I called this thing a dog but it was dark I looked at this thing for long enough to determine it wasn't a deer and freaked out and ran I knew it was taller than on all fours we lived in that house for another year and there were still some mornings I would smell the rotting flesh they've also been weird instances where I've spoken about this and phones will glitch out or the phone line will cut maybe I'm reading too much into it but it was spooky I didn't even know what I saw until a few months ago I was drinking with friends and Mullen tells me a story and he starts going on about skinwalkers so who knows I'll preface this by saying that I have spent a lot of time with Native Americans and their culture / history is really important to me my dad grew up on the border of a reservation in Alaska and was adopted by a family that was Inuit and I spent a good amount of time with a friend who is Lakota at the time of this incident a friend and I were leaving Standing Rock after being there for six weeks to drive home to Texas we for some reason decided to go and see Mount Rushmore on our way back and after being at Standing Rock for so very long we had a sour taste in our mouths seeing American presidents faces carved into the mountains that was straight-up stolen from natives so my friend decided that we should go to Wounded Knee it was only a few hours out of the way home and it seemed important that we go sidenote it was about 11:00 p.m. at this point but screw it I was planning on driving straight to Texas and we should go to pay our respects especially after Rushmore fast forward GPS takes us straight to the main part of the gravestones and monuments plus a bunch of descriptive signs I've never believed in ghosts or spirits or any of that but as we parked I was seized with a terrible fear I couldn't move refuse to get out of the car struggling not to have a panic attack and get out of there that kind of fear my friend gets out of the car and goes to read the memorials and I sit in the car literally paralyzed with fear and terror I look at the window and see two giant black dogs with red eyes that looked directly at me all I could feel was this oppressive feeling that was almost a thought that we didn't belong there and the word leave we maintained eye contact as I literally started to shake and feel the most horrible feeling and sense of dread I have ever felt also for the record I'm a really tough lady so it takes much more to even ruffle me I lay on the horn and once again my friend returns to the car and I tell her that we need to leave now I don't tell her what's going on I just type Texas into GPS with shaking hands and start to drive away following the instructions I leave taking a bunch of turns and roads I didn't remember from the way in and after around five minutes we end up right back at the exact same place of Wounded Knee that we were at right then feeling legitimate an actual terror and trying not to lose my mind I tell my friend what's going on she happens to be a hippie who believes in stuff like spirits and crystals and she took me seriously pulls her phone out and her GPS did the same thing all I feel is dread I cannot get those eyes out of my head and I decided to trust my hound dogs sense at that point and just drove as far away as I could my friend insisted we threw off all the jewelry we were wearing and I drove in clammy terror for at least an hour before I felt ok to even speak I still don't know exactly what happened and it still unnerves me I got goose bumps just remembering this as a kid I saw a fair share of paranormal activity but this is one that has left me puzzled as a child me and my siblings all shared one run two bunk beds for them and a kids bed for me pushed right under the window of our room I vividly remember waking up one night probably five or six years old to a pitch-black run as I laid in bed terrified of the dark I got an overwhelming feeling or compulsion to look my window and when I did I saw a massive black dog standing at the road directly under the seemingly only streetlight that was working as I was staring at this dog it turned its head towards me and I saw it had red eyes it stared directly back at me for what felt like forever before turning to face a head again and then the streetlight flickered and went out and I could no longer see the glow of his eyes no more than a minute later the street light turned and in place of the dog was now a very tall man around seven feet tall all features completely obscured by darkness aside from one thing red eyes that looked directly at me for ages before he walked away as he walked down the road though he gradually hunched over more and more until he turned back into the large dog I have told this story exactly the same for years and years to anyone that listens but I can't find any information as to what this could be this was over ten years ago and I still remember it quite vividly I had just gotten out of an emotionally abusive relationship and was dealing with some pretty heavy depression a level of which I had never experienced before and was quite hard to crawl out of the situation back at home wasn't any better so as a small escape I would go out for late-night walks with my sister we never wandered too far the cops never stopped us or asked us what we were doing at 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning it was weird but we thought safe enough one evening we made our way to the local 7-eleven just a few blocks away to get to this place we had to cross a short bridge over an irrigation canal this canal is known for having bats roosting underneath and we would see them occasionally fly out to catch insects we're just chatting about various things my sister and I make our way to the 7-eleven to get our drink neither of us had a lot of money so when we were out we would get the largest drink offered and share it between ourselves on the walk back home we were approaching the bridge once more and I look up and see the shadowed form of a dog it was huge much larger than a German Shepherd or Siberian Husky would be it was moving towards us the odd thing was there were no sounds of footfalls or the telltale signs of claws upon cement I've never seen a spirit before and since it was approaching a street land and still had no reflection of its size my sister directed us to the median that partitioned the different lanes of traffic there were no cars out we were the only ones on the street that night and we moved to the median to continue our walk since there were sidewalks on only one side of the road and that's where the dog was my sister said to leave it be and to not look at it it won't bother us I walked several steps then looked back anyway the dog was gone even as we passed it if it had sprang into a run I should have heard the animals footfalls but there weren't any I'm not sure what I saw but it was a little while before we went out again I was 12 years old when this happened I didn't believe in the paranormal or anything until this night at the time I was living with my aunt and her kids in Jacksonville Florida there was this huge rainstorm going on outside that night and at 3:00 a.m. all the power in the building completely went out I wasn't afraid of the dark so I slept in the dark but I was awoken by the sound of my cousin who was screaming for me and my sister to wake up and come downstairs being the kid I was I didn't understand why he would be screaming for us like he was and I was four to five months older than him I didn't fear anything but he always acted tough my cousin was around six foot tall and was screaming like a scared child it would have made sense if me and my sister was scared because we both lived in a state we didn't know I slowly started waking up aggravated by being awoken by someone screaming downstairs I get to slowly hear the front door open and my cousin was standing in the doorway by how close he was to the stairs me and my sister share a room where our room is close to the stairs that leads to the first floor of the apartment I rolled over from facing the wall to where I would be facing the closet that has sliding doors to access the clothes I peek out the window to see it's raining so hard the world looks grey I hate the sound of thunder and I fear seeing lightning but I love the sound of rain it always has a way of calming me when I was either stressed or waking from a nightmare I used to have horrible dreams of being attacked by people with no faces not a blank face without eyes or mouth but the face is completely black with no eyes no mouth no nothing just emptiness it was always scary to have the dreams that I'd wake up crying I stare out the window just thinking of how I wished I wasn't there and glanced towards the dresser with the clock showing 3:05 a.m. when something called my eye I glanced towards the closet where I saw a black shadow figure standing in the doorway it stood as tall as the door and I noticed he had red glowing eyes I admit I could have imagined it I do have mental health issues from abuse sustained by family and PTSD psychosis and borderline personality disorder as well as hallucinations so I could just easily conclude that it was all in my head and the hallucination episode was making me feel uneasy but then I realized I couldn't be imagining because when I imagined it usually only stayed for a second or two but this thing persisted and was still standing in the doorway I was just laying in my bed staring at this creature just thinking why it was here and what did it want I was frozen in my place by fair I tried collecting enough courage to ask what did it want but before I could raise my hand towards its face where her mouth would be but like I said the only thing there were its eyes this creature was telling me not to speak could it read minds didn't know what I was gonna ask but my mind was set I wanted to know if I was going to die before I could ask this creature it shook its head and I relaxed but not long after it disappeared I laid in bed thinking almost on the verge of tears you could call me weird but the situation made me sad I couldn't help but think that death himself had wanted me but then probably didn't because no one wanted me that's how I felt at the time I got out of bed after collecting my tears telling myself who cared who wanted me or not I prove it to everyone I didn't need them I wiped my tears woke up my sister telling her to come on and that our cousin was scared after we leave our room I look back to see if maybe it was behind us but the room was empty well my went downstairs I asked my cousin if he saw anyone in the house and to my surprise he just said he didn't like the dark we went to a neighbor's until our aunt's mom came back home about 6 a.m. she comes home to find the apartment empty and find us at the neighbours she didn't want me hanging out with them because she didn't like me making friends a week later I was running down the stairs with my little sister behind me rushing to the bathroom to take a shower and get ready for school we did this every day racing to the bathroom to see whoever made it first would get the shower out of nowhere this huge black dog with red eyes jumped out of me with its huge scary teeth showing an open more I fell backward and landed on my butt causing my sister to stop laughing and asked what was wrong I asked her if she saw the dog that jumped on me and she looked puzzled and surprised she didn't see the dog how didn't she see it it was clearly in front of me and I felt the dog I touched its fur when it jumped at me it felt so real it scared me thinking she didn't see it she looked at me as if I were losing my mind my sister got the shower thirst she won the game it was only fair I couldn't stop thinking about the dog when I got to school I rushed to the library before it started to see what the dog was the searches I could look at said it was a hellhound a very scary dog and nothing that you ever want to encounter and that people say that they are ancient demons that serve as the heralds of death according to the legends seeing one leads to a person's end sometimes it's said to be once other times it requires three sightings for the curse to take effect and for the victim to fall these factors make the hellhound a feared symbol worthy of the name bearer of death after reading the article of the creature I feared I was going to meet my end seeing the death guy I told myself I didn't want to die anymore and then the hellhound who knows all that I know is them afraid of black dogs I lease a horse at a barn a very rural part of Ohio and close with the owners of the barn and have a key so oftentimes I'll go to ride later at night after the lessons are done and I finished my homework I had a friend with me who was not a rider she was just coming to hang out at the barn with me the way the indoor riding arena is set up there are large garage doors on each side which I had to open for some air flow as I was tacking up my horse I saw something dart across the open barn door and the end of the breezeway I assumed it was a coyote and the aisle was lit up and the outside was dark so it was hard to tell I mentioned it to my friend and we walk into the area from the stores and just start to warm up since my horse is older and it was chilly the next half hour goes pretty smoothly it's as I'm dismounting that I see the similar shape from earlier go fling past on the open garage doors my horse starts nickering nervously and getting shifty so I take him back to the aisle to one track I tell my friend to go close the barn doors for the night she says she doesn't want to go alone in his freaked out so she'll wait for me to go with her by UNTAC and we closed the arena doors we walk back to the aisle to close the last door I'm right outside there's just this massive dog it was shaggy and came up to about my waist and five at nine its eyes weren't glowing but they were reflecting red in the light from the barn my friend starts grabbing at me and pulling me back but the dog isn't moving or anything just staring at us I know this sounds weird but I didn't get a bad vibe from it I come from a superstitious old-world Italian family so I'd think I'd have known if it had bad intentions all of a sudden it turns around and trots back to the tree line my friend is freaking out crying and begging for me to call her dad to come pick her up because she didn't want us leaving by ourselves it has been a month now and I haven't seen the dog since but honestly the weirdest part of this story is that the other horses in the barn didn't freak out if you know anything about horses you'll know they sense danger and freak out if they think their lives are at risk this whole situation is just super weird to me I've had something very bizarre and scary happened the other day my wife and I were taking our dogs out for a run call me weird but one of the most beautiful spots in our town is the cemetery we take her there once a week to run around in the area don't worry she doesn't go on graves or anything like that so everything is going good we get there and let the dog out and go park in the usual spot she comes running back very fast and I can tell she seems spooked okay odd because she always wants to run to every tree and smell it and normally it's a pain in the ass to get her ready to leave so we figured we should head out and find a different spot to let her run on our way out we see an oddly shaped rock on top of the ridge just outside the cemetery my wife stopped the car so we could get a better look but something felt odd my wife gives out a little whistle to confirm it was nothing and it lifts its head she whistles once more a little louder and the first time and it turns around and looks at us this person or whatever it seemed to be at the moment just sat there with its head cocked in our direction the face no joke looked like a dog a big brown dog with a long snout yet the dog had arms and looked like it was using a smartphone this overwhelming sense of fear came over me and I tell my wife to drive and get out of there fast I swear on my life I've seen this with my own eyes it's crazy the fear you can feel when you see something you simply cannot explain I plan on going back on my days off and see if I can find some evidence hey guys it's Mort here and thank you so much for listening I really hope that you enjoyed tonight's interesting mix a lot of black dog stories and you know I think they were over

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so black dog great song real landmark in rock music and rock guitar playing there's basically four sections that you need to learn to play this okay so we'll go over all four of those the guitar track is tripled on this song there's three guitars playing throughout the whole thing they're all kind of doing the same thing but just little variations and we'll go over all of that and the biggest thing about this song i think is the timing there's a lot of weird timing stuff in it especially that that first turn around that one there and i'll explain that one that one has had me baffled for a long time and i think a lot of other people too and doing some research on the song and reading some stuff by john paul jones who kind of wrote this one that was almost his intention was to come up with something that was really hard to for cover bands to um to be able to do and then you've got a section where there's harmony and i think there might even be four guitars in that part so we'll go over all of that in between the singing and when the band comes in it has always been a bit perplexing i think for a lot of people if you want to learn this you probably already know this but john bonham you can hear him tapping the sticks you don't hear one two three you just hear the last tap so if you really get your headphones and turn that up there you can hear the little click of the sticks before the band comes in so he's cueing them on one to come in so they're not counting some mystical time signature there he's just cueing them in so they're following him and later on in the song i mean he accuses every time but it becomes more a normal sort of a pattern and live they just play it straight too because just too hard messing around with them coming in at weird times like that so we're here it's in a and we're in this when that a minor pentatonic sort of a shape so the lick starts here on a slide up to a7 and then chromatic up from d five to d7 back to a7 [Music] and then we're here on g5 we put a little band on that and back to d7 and what i do is i like to finger that one with my middle finger on the way down [Music] because the next move is going to be up here and i used to play this like this i don't know if you'd be able to tell the difference but [Music] very short [Music] short there right but it isn't short it's long if you do it with that finger your next move is up here right with your first finger so that's kind of you know it takes a while to get that up there and you can wind up shorting out that note i finger it with my middle finger now and you hold that until you hit that note so it's a longer hold don't do this [Music] you want to do this hopefully you can hear the difference there you're winding up holding that note a little bit longer and then we come up here so it's just g7 to g9 then a trill from g5 to g7 back down to d7 some guys will do it here like instead of going there they go here and you can do that but if you don't finger that cleanly [Music] you wind up you know hitting that cord right and it sounds kind of uh messy there so and i'm pretty sure jimmy page comes up here to do the lick so [Music] so we're just here on d5 to d7 then a5 to a7 and then a3 to a5 but we slur that kind of slide it down as it goes [Music] and as you slide that one down you're gonna upstroke on the g string on that a power chord [Music] and then two down strokes on the uh on the a power chord and then that's doubled and then there's another guitar that does the exact same thing but it just ends it different it ends like this slide and slide down the open a two hits on the open a and then a power [Music] cord that's pretty subtle right but if you're you know in a two guitar band you maybe want to get one guy to do that and the two together combine nicely so then we're going to go into this turn around like and this i think is probably the hardest part of the song for anybody who's ever played it because it gets syncopated and it gets real weird oh just before i move on when we end that in that first couple of times it's just a straight a chord later on it changes where one guitar does this [Music] he bends up that g3 to the a note here it's weird holding that chord and bending but that comes in later but the first time it's just just a straight a chord now onto the syncopated turn around so we're going to do there we're just going to play the same leg just down a string so instead of [Music] go down a string and that just repeats a bunch of times [Music] and then it ends on this and then we're back into this so that's pretty straightforward easy to just talk you through that but the timing there is absolute killer and it's been screwing me up for like i guess you could say decades now but i finally sort of really looked at it and read about it a bit there's a little bit i'll put in the description box that i found on some interview with john paul jones and he explains how that look works and i remember when i you know used to talk about that with my buddies and stuff we used to think that oh yeah well they made a mistake and they just were all catching up but you know there's no way this was planned right from the start and apparently from what i read when he first brought this song to the bat it was so complex because he was looking for a different sort of a time signature apparently it was in 316 i don't even know what that is but so complex nobody could do it so they had to change it and simplify it quite a bit but this part here is still the trick of playing this song and probably a huge reason why most bands never play this song other than having a singer that can sing like robert plant right but this is really tough part to nail what i do with that is it's an eight note riff that starts on the offbeat so that's eight eighth notes one two three four five six seven eight and then what happens is there's an eighth note rest before it starts again so the ninth note is a rest you just count it like this one two three four five six seven eight nine one two three the first lick is on the off beat and because you have that eighth note rest in there the licking now will start on the downbeat so it starts on the upbeat the offbeat the first time downbeat the second time and you do your eight and you have the ninth is a rest which will make the lick again start on the offbeat so it starts on offbeat on beat offbeat does three times like that and then the last lick is just five one two three four five and then we're we're back into that that whole lick then we'll do it real slow and just talk through it is three groups of eight with nine being a rest one two three four five six seven eight nine one two five six seven eight nine one two three four five six seven eight nine one two [Music] three then you're into the main luck so if you think of it that way you're just dropping an eighth note it's an eighth note rest every eight beats i'm starting my counting on the lick which is an four five offbeat seven eight nine one two three four five six seven eight nine that really helped me sort of sort it out in my mind as to what's going on but still even though i know that now it's still hard to get it's the kind of a lick where you're just gonna have to sit down with the track and just kind of get a feel for that dropping that eighth note and that which is a very bizarre thing to do i've been playing guitar quite a while and i don't know i've never run into anything like that that's going to finish up going back to the alec [Music] and then we're getting into that oh yeah part right which is uh [Music] so it's pretty straightforward there you're just kind of holding this a chord and there's three guitars doing all this stuff so the first guitar is just here and then here i'm not going to yell every fret here because it's kind of it doesn't move around it's all right down here between the basically the second and fourth fret [Music] and that chord there he keeps the a in the bass note the actual bass moves to a c but the guitar is like playing an a it's like an a minor seven [Music] and that does that a bunch of times and then it eventually ends off where one of the guitars pulls that e string up to the a and the other guitar just ends it normally and the other guitar that's gone [Music] so it's a little bit different because it's holding that a note you can clearly hear that so one guitar is and the other guitar is just so that's how that part works and the third guitar is it's just basically doubling that first one right it's just kind of there just to fill out the sound so that's that part and then we've got the hey baby thing the guitars are all doing the same thing except for the chords at the end so it's always it's just a to g right [Music] and then this the very first time when it goes up to the c it's kind of like it's a little bend in there [Music] with my little finger but you can do it with your third finger so just the first time [Music] and then one of the guitars just does like g d and i the way i do it i don't know if it's right or not but i just do that acdcg right where you're just muting that a string and then d and just repeats and then the second guitar is doing this this chord here those kind of chords when you put that third in there they always sound a little bit sour down in this range of the guitar because the intonation on guitars um it's not great down in there but that's what he's playing so what you can do to smooth that out is just maybe leave out that b string and just go because you can clearly hear that recording that that b to a note so a little trick is if you just do the two notes [Music] put a little vibrato on it to kind of just smooth out that intonation thing when you play third playing thirds with distorted guitar is never great you know and uh i don't know if you know about eddie van halen used to you know when he was playing playing all that uh all that kind of stuff he would flat his b string just to sort of fix up that intonation problem with guitars and playing thirds you just would do this [Music] just smooth it out a bit so that's what the other guitar does and then the third guitar actually just plays single notes so it just goes [Music] just emphasizing that g down to the f sharp and you put the vibrato on [Music] and it ends the phrase with just goes straight down to the e and that's about it except for the end lick where we do the uh the harmony and what happens is the main guitar it kind of changes a bit it puts a little pull off in so instead of going like this [Music] it goes like yes a little pull-off there [Music] so now the harmony goes up a third and it doesn't do it doesn't follow the main guitar completely it doesn't go [Music] doesn't do that it just goes straight and it doesn't do the chromatic thing you know you think it would go but it doesn't it goes two notes on that c sharp back down to the a and then we're here on b4 can we bend that and again i want to finger this one now with my middle finger because my next move is up here [Music] just b7 b8 a little trill between b5 b7 down to g6 another band here in b4 so far we've got [Music] and then we finish the phrase off doing this [Music] b4 to b6 d5 to d7 d2 to d4 the a power chord [Music] and slowly [Music] okay and that's it that's the song and i guess there's that little little thing at the beginning i you know i don't i think i think he's just just like sawing on his e string now you know with some delay we'll put the delay on here see what happens like [Music] i don't even know what he was doing i think that's what he was doing so i mean if you're in a band and you want to do before the song starts it might be kind of cool right so that's it i hope you get something out of this there's a lot of little deals in here but mostly it's that syncopated part [Music] that'll be the thing that screws up most guys and just remember it's just groups of eight with that ninth beat being a rest in eighth note rest so three groups of eight with the ninth beat being the rest and then one group of five [Music] very tricky to get that together anyways good luck with it and like i said i hope you get something out of the lesson and we'll talk to you soon [Music] you", "25CBe5FAvtI": "so a tale of black dogs with golden leashes broken stories so facetious who's the pet who's the teacher [Music]

"welcome or welcome back everybody thanks\nso much for joining me today we're going to do a black studio portrait I'm gonna\nmake sure that the black background is completely black in camera not\nafterwards okay so I have notes today because I usually don't and nobody can\nunderstand anything so essentially the aim of doing a black studio portrait is\nto have the background completely black that is the aim the aim is not to light\nthe dog the aim is to not light the background so for everything that we're\ngoing to cover today that's the principle that we're operating on that we\nwant completely black background and then after that we want light on the dog\nlet's cover equipment first I'm not going to go into the brands and makes of\neverything because to be honest with you it doesn't matter I've specifically got\nsome very inexpensive modifiers with me today so that they are relatively easy\nto pick up for everybody who's doing them we are in a shed which we've been\nin before I will link that video above so that you can go ahead and watch that\ntoo but we're back in the shed and this time we're doing black so first of all\nyou're going to need a camera it doesn't matter what camera you've got a DSLR is\nbrilliant mirrorless is fine SLT is also fine the one thing you don't want to\nhave is something that you can't use on full manual motor you need to be able to\nuse it on fully manual mode then the next thing that you need is some lights\nI've got with me two strobes and a speed light today there is no reason why you\ncan't do all of this with speed lights and you can also just have one light which\nwe will cover as well today too the one thing that you don't want to have is\ncontinuous light if you use continuous light or ambient light you're not going\nto get this result as easily because you're not gonna be able to overpower\nany other ambient light in the scene some people do shoot black background\nportraits through barn doors and shed doors things that have got a light\noutside and then very dark inside you can do that but technically that's not\nlit as a studio portrait so we're not gonna be doing that today\nlens so lenses I've got with me today the 24 to 72.8 zoom lens I prefer using a\n24 to 70 for studio portraits but you can pretty much get away with any lens\nthe wider the lens you're going to use the bigger the backdrop you're going to\nneed because just to the field of view that's covered but you will be\nabsolutely fine using a kit lens for this as well so you don't have to have a\nvery expensive lens to do this kind of a shot because you don't need to shoot\nwide open you don't need to shoot at a low F number if you don't know what I\nmean by F numbers aperture ISO or shutter speed you are absolutely\ndefinitely going to want to go ahead and watch the exposure triangle video which\nwe have already done and that is on the channel I will link that above too - you're\ngonna need to understand that to be able to do this well so if you don't\nunderstand that at the moment you need to go ahead and watch that and then come\nback I mean do I really need to mention do I need to mention that you need spare\nbatteries you need spare batteries at all times so I've got spare double A's with\nme and that I've also got a spare camera battery with me I've also got spare memory\ncards so you don't want to run out of these things then the next thing is a\nbackdrop you don't actually need a backdrop we're using it just to make\nediting easier because what we don't want to do is have to deal with the\nreflection both active (birds) we don't want to have a reflection of the lights coming\noff of anything and that's why having a backdrop is useful I personally prefer\nto use fabric for black studio because it absorbs light better if you've black\npaper which we also have got with us today it will reflect some of the light\nback off more than fabric would you can also use vinyl or you can use a painted\nwall any of these things will work but fabric will help you out more than it\nwill hinder you if that makes sense so with your light stands and your backdrop\nstands the more stable your backdrop stands on your light stands are the\nbetter and easier this is going to be for you always think health and safety\nfirst I have not waited my stands today and\nI've got my light stands as in light not heavy duty stands on the lights at the\nmoment this is not normal for me I would usually have the stands that holding at\nthe backdrop on the lights because they are far more heavy duty heavier is\nbetter there is a link to those in the description below so if you don't\nhave solid light stands go ahead and get some and also consider weighting your\nstance especially if you're doing this with clients modifiers could you please\npass me the beauty dish you don't have to be so gentle with it ta I've just\ngained some stuff next to me now let's just have a tea\nI do like talking about modifiers but it's a bit of a rabbit hole so we need\nto just look at what modifiers are modifiers essentially change light or\nthey change how the light comes out and therefore they change the look and feel\nat the image afterwards we are going to use a specific set of\nmodifiers today you guys will have seen my other modifiers my normal ones which\nI use which are I think one meter 20 or 90 centimeter octa boxes those are my\nnormal modifies however when we're shooting black we need to have control\nand that's really important because shooting well on a black background and\nmaking sure it's black straight out of camera all comes down to control and if\nyou don't have control of your light it's not going to go very well for you\nso the modifiers that we choose need to be able to control the light and some\nmodifiers control light more than others so we've got with us today some strip\nboxes which are to either side now a strip box itself is already a controlled\nlight source because you are directing the light in a very specific fashion out\nof the front essentially it's a narrow softbox and so a strip box without a\nmodifier on it looks like this one here and then we also have got grids which\nchannel the light far more directionally out of the softbox or the strip box so\nthat has got a grid on it and what that does is can you just trick me my grid\nta so a grid looks like this so essentially it is quite literally just\ngrid of fabric and each piece is maybe an inch an inch deep I would say and you\nstick your grid over the front of your softbox and what that does is that gives\nyou a very specific directional light source it does mean that you need to\nhave control over your subject as well because if they move away from the spot\nwhere the light is they're not going to get hit by light\nbut it also means that you've won in the control department for not letting that\nlight go onto the backdrop so that is a win the other directional light sources\nthat you can use our beauty dishes a beauty dish is semi directional as a\nstandard piece because the light is funneled out in a straight direction\nhowever most beauty dishes you can also get with a honeycomb grid like so so you\nput the honeycomb grid over the front of the beauty dish and you've essentially\njust created a grid like those soft boxes over there like so your other\noptions when it comes to directional light sources are snoots so you can use\na snoot it's a very harsh form of light a snoot essentially is if you think of a\ncone backwards on the top of the light so it's going to a smaller end point\nvery difficult to use well with dogs because dogs move more than humans would\nso you could just stick a human in the right place with a snoot you can also\nuse barn doors barn doors are fine again a very harsh light but fine to go behind\nto offer some separation in the use of a rim light that's kind of it for\nmodifiers what you would not use is a modifier that has no control over the\nspill of the light and one of those would be an umbrella so you wouldn't use\na shoot through umbrella for a black background shot if you're going to do it\nwell and not do a lot of editing afterwards hello little birdie bye okie\nkoki probably important to note when you're shooting on a black background\nthat if you're working with dogs it's actually a lot easier if you lift the\ndog up off of the floor it's going to depend on the type of dog and the\nsubject that you're working with as to whether that's going to be safe to do so\nor not but if you're wanting to get full-body portraits of dogs lifting them\nup onto something else is going to help you out a lot it just allows you to have\na little bit more control over the light that's hitting the floor because the\nfloor is technically part of the set and you will also be able to make sure that\nyour dog or subject whatever it might be stays in one place and doesn't move\naround outside of their spot when you shooting on a black background the spot\nthat the subject is in is is probably the most important thing out of\neverything so the more that they move away from their spot the\nmore difficult you're gonna find getting the right shot I think that made some\nform of sense and in the space so the last thing that's really important in\nterms of equipment is the space that you've got available we have\nspecifically come here to the shed to shoot this because we've got enough\nspace as you guys know already my little living room is not big enough to do a\nblack portrait well you can do it but it's just not technically brilliant so\nwe've come here to do it in a much larger space there is a massive expanse\nof indoor shed space here but we're only using one corner because you don't need\nthat much space but you do want to have separation from the background area so\nthe space behind me to the background is probably seven six meters maybe five\nmeters about maybe five meters maybe give or take you don't need bigger than\nthat really to be honest and realistically you want to have your\nsubject probably sat about a meter or two behind where I am sat the main thing\nis that they are far enough away from the background so that you've got light\nfall-off let's discuss light really quickly the most important things for\nyou guys to know about light especially when it comes to studio light is the\nlarger the light source is relative to the subject the softer the light will be\nso the larger the light source relative to the subject the softer the light will\nbe so today we're using the two strip boxes to light the front of the subject\nnow theoretically in comparison to the subject they're quite similar in size\nbut the closer those are to the subject the softer the light will be the other\nthing to note about light is that the closer the source is to the subject the\nfaster the light will fall off that's important for when you shoot in black\nportraits so the closer the light is to the subject the faster the light will\nchange from being bright to dark when it hits the subject so if you have those\nlight sources very close to the subject the background will be a lot darker I\nhope that makes sense okay so we're going to look at settings and setup now\nso I best get up really so the most important thing to note about settings\nis that you will set up like you do any other studio session and for most of\nthose things you will need to be using your\ncameras sync speed for the flash every camera has a different sync speed most\nof them are very similar but it is something to look in the manual for or\non Google because it's very important my sync speed for the Sony's as far as I\nknow because these are not Sony approved flashes the sync speed is a hundred and\nsixtieth of a second so you can't shoot higher than one hundred and sixtieth of\na second we are not going to be using high-speed sync today nor are we going\nto be using TTL because control control is the aim of the game so manual one\nhundred and sixtieth of a second or your camera's sync speed your ISO doesn't\nneed to be set any higher than 100 there is no reason to have your ISO higher\nthan 100 you could go to 200 if you needed to but realistically there is no\nreason why your ISO should be higher than that so therefore you've got two of\nyour exposure triangle locked down which gives you one left Dan what's the one\nthat's left so what's a stand for (Dan in background: aperture) yeah see come on Dan so aperture is the last\nthing left not aperture is what's going to be controlling the level of light in\nthe scene and as we set up for all studio sessions the most important thing\nis to have absolutely no ambient light hitting the backdrop so to be able to\nascertain whether you've got any ambient light hitting the backdrops so you just\nturn your flash trigger off like so so that's off now so if I take a picture\nit's not going to be controlling anything at all and what you want to be\ndoing is getting a completely black background to check that you've got a\ncompletely black background the easiest way of doing that is to actually set up\nblack clipping in the Live View display of your camera so most digital cameras\nwill have a black clipping selection option in the display preferences so\nwhat we also want to make sure that we are on is single point focus so when we\nare on a single point focus essentially again I use back button focus too but\nour focus point which is actually up here somewhere is the only thing that\nwill be focused you see it light up in green so that is the focus point so we\nwant to be in control of moving that around and have the camera just pick up\non that I use back button focus which means that I can focus let go\nrecompose and then shoot so what we want to be able to set up I'm on 125th of a\nsecond because 160th of the second is a bit risky\nwe'll go hundred a 160th for now ISO 100 and I'm f9 as a starting point so if I\ntake a picture of this scene and then go into play that's got black\nclipping enabled so can you see the flashing that was on that there so\nanything that is flashing white is completely clipped so that's this\npicture that is a picture and anything that is flashing is black so we've got a\nlittle bit that is still peeking through so what we can do to make sure it's\ncompletely black is just change the aperture so remember we're leaving our\nshutter speed we're leaving our ISO we're just going to increase the\naperture so we're just going to push the aperture up one two f10 and when we play\nthat picture we've only got just the corners as long as the most part is\ncompletely black the main in internal sections of the picture you could keep\ngoing and just push it to f10 f11 sorry and then the more you increase your\naperture the f-number the more of the image will be completely\nblack so you want to keep going until you've got a completely black image and\nthen at that point unless the light changes the ambient light changes you do\nnot touch your settings at all on your camera ever again that's it and the only\nother controls that you have in terms of how much light is in the shot come from\nyour artificial light and then that way you know the ambient light is completely\ntaken care of and anything that is lighting the scene or the background is\ncoming from your artificial light so when you're setting up where stuff is\ngonna go you want to be looking at where the sides of your modifiers are pointing\nwhen we're looking at the softbox hear the strip box we're looking at where is\nthat pointing so what is the widest point of where this light will spill and\nif you were to walk in a straight line you would end up over here so we know\nbecause that's got a grid on it as well very little of that light is going to go\nthis way onto the backdrop the same thing with the other lights you looking\nat where the side of it is pointing so we're just\nstarting with a two light setup we'll try and introduce a bit of a rim light but\nI'm not too fussed about the backlight from being honest because this one\ndoesn't have a grid on you need to just be aware that some of your light will\nprobably spill sideways and also some of it might be reflecting off of this wall\nto the side but even then we're still well out of\nthe way of hitting our backdrop then if you want to add a third light we've just\ngot a speed light up here with a little softbox on you can introduce your third\nlight to the corner this one is on a slave cell so it means that it will only\nflash if these two flash and we need to control the power of this manually at\nthe light rather than controlling it via the trigger on the camera so the speed\nlight will just be sat at the back to add a pop of light and not that does is\nit'll add separation from the subject to the background if we want it sometimes\nyou might not be able to see it too much that's fine and one thing to note is\nthis obviously doesn't have a grid on it it's quite old and there is a gap coming\nout of the back of the softbox here because it's a quick folder pop up one\nyou might end up with some spill hitting the backdrop the first thing we're going\nto do is add the main light and the main light for me is gonna be this light here\nso this light to this side I'm going to turn this off and I'm gonna turn this\noff in fact no let's use this as our main light okay this is gonna be our\nmain light so we'll leave that on I turn this off so now if we turn our trigger\non this light should be the only light that flashes and this has got a pretty\nheavy grid on it which we're going to leave on for now so we want to kind of\nfind the cross point of both of these two I switch is about here so I know\nthat I want my subjects probably front paws in the terms of a dog to be on or\naround this line on the floor and pretty much central to it as well might change\nthat but the subject needs to be about here now it does mean that when we look\nthrough the camera that some of the background might not be in it but\nbecause we've exposed perfectly for ambient light we don't really need a\nbackground anywhere so the next thing to do is just to add a\nsubject in if you've got a stuffed animal they are brilliant to bring in at\nthis stage because you will not bore a stuffed animal but she will bore a dog\nI've brought Alfie with me because he doesn't mind being stood and bored so I\nwill put him in this scene stood on this little mark that we have found here and\nI will begin to build the light with this light first okay I've just hurt my\nknee but we'll be fine so what we've got we've turned on our trigger on the light\nwe're not judging the camera settings at all where I'm fully manual we're on auto\nfocus on single point or flexible spot that's what we're using for here\nand we're going to move that to fit and sit on his face if you are using EVF now\nis a brilliant time to turn off your settings on feature because otherwise\nyou're not going to be able to see anything at all through the viewfinder\nso you want to really just be looking at the ambient light scene put him at his\npoint which is here which is here come come come close so we're gonna put our\nteddy bear or Alfie in the shot line ourselves up with where we want to be\nhe's got a hair on his nose but never mind\nyou only get into a position focus and shoot and when you look at the back of\nthe camera good you will be able to see your clipping so I've got a slight bit of\nhighlight clipping on this side of the dog but I've still got everything at his\nside can you see that okay everything at his side is completely flashing which is\ngreat this is good news for us so that is what we want to see we've got a\nlittle bit of light spilling over onto this side of the background so what we\nwill just try and do is angle it slightly towards us which you can do as\nsimply as that and you put your subject back back and sit good so he's in the\nsame place as he was if this was a stuffed bear it would not move at all\nand you just take another shot and make sure that your background is completely\nlost to shadow waiting so I'm just checking again much better\nall of that side of him and the backdrop is now clipped if you can see it so I'm\ngoing to reward him and then we're going to add a light which is this one so\nwe've added a light this one does not have a grid on it so we're going to read\nwhat the level of light that is coming to this side of the background but we're\ngonna put our subject where we think we need them I give you all of the tricks\ntake another test shot we've added a light so we now have got two lights on\nwhat we can see good boy waiting from the test shot is\nthat this light is quite significantly darker than this one I want to just drop \nthis left light slightly and increase this right one slightly so that's one\neighth plus naught point seven and that's one eighth power\nso he's front feet are on that line and I'm lining up the shot again same\nposition nothing has changed apart from the power of the lights we think so we\nwill just look at the clipping we still got completely black at this\nside so the one without the grid on has done a good job we've got a black at\nthis side and a little bit of black in the ear but we'll be able to lift that\nup in post-production afterwards so I'm quite happy with the level of light on\nthat if we zoom in we know we've got a catch light in this eye to this side and\nthen we have got a catch light in this light I to this side so what we might go\nahead and do is just increase the power of this one a little bit but we'll wait\ntill we've got the black dog on that what we're going to do just before we\nget the other dog in is that we're going to switch on the light to the back to\nsee if we can get a little bit of separation from the background so it's\njust angled to hit the back of his head we might need to raise it slightly again\nwe're focusing on where the dog is on their spot you can see a tiny little bit\nI wish you could turn the power up on this and what I want is a nice rim it's\ngood so we've got beautiful rim right good okay if we put it on clipping we've\nlost the clipping from around him because of that softbox being on full\npower but actually if you look we've got full separation of his hair from the\nbackground so it's going to mean that we can just\nturn the exposure down a little bit on the whole image and we can cut off the\nbackground that's coming in there what we'll do is we'll just turn that down\nslightly move it a little bit closer and then we will get our subject in\nI'm just going to take a quick picture of the white balance card because I\nforgot again only and all we won't is the white balance card to be lit and\nthen that gives us the white balance of everything\nlet's bring Bramble and see what the situation is because she's a lot darker\nshe doesn't have the white so we might be alright we also might not be\nlet's bring the dog oh oh this is Bramble so with Bram she's never been in a\nstudio environment before so what we can do is we can just test her good girl Bram\nso with her because she's not used to having the light she's fine if you\nrelease her when the lights are flashed that's fine could I have the ball is it\nstay stay so I'm just focusing on the eye okay so the light is fine I'm not\nconcerned by the amount of light hitting the subject potentially a little bit low\nbut I think we will be fine see we keep it quite short for Bram\nbecause this is a new experience for her and she's not done this before so if\nwe're looking at our picture we can check the focus and make sure that we\nare super sharp on the eyes which we are maybe slightly low I remember that we\ndon't want to touch our aperture or our shutter speed or oh ISO so if we're low\nwe need to increase the power of the light so I'm going to increase the power\nof the left light and we'll just reshoot see if we pop Bram Bram back here just\nhaving a rest oh my bad good catch good one that right let's do a one light shot because the owner wanted a one light shot so for a one light shot we\nwant to have quite directional light so what we're going to do is we're going to\nput this one here we're going to put a grid on the other one bear with me for a\nsec hi so that grid is now on and then what\nwe're gonna do is we're going to bin off the light to the rear and instead\nthis is gonna be our light to the rear we're kind of mirroring the two lights a\nlittle bit so it's not flashing at the camera but\nit's not far off and we've got this one about there so that I'll give a\nseparation from the background from this side and this one will light the side of\nthe subject so for this shot what we need is we need Bram about here ish\nlooking that way so she needs to be looking at you so for this one if you\nstand here with maybe some cheese or something and she wants to be sort of\nlooking kind of straight at this light good girl to put Bram back so one thing\nto you just remember is that obviously bramble wasn't on a lead today which\nmeant it was actually quite difficult to keep her in her spot you saw how she had\nto be in this particular area for this shot to work so if you're in a situation\nwhere you you know the dogs not staying where they need to stay just put them on\na lead and ask the owner to hold them so in this situation you just going to make\nsure that the owner or handler is not blocking the light so your owner\nwouldn't stand here you'd be surprised how often that happens and your owner\nwould also not stand here again you'd be surprised so what they would need to do\nis find a gap in the light and then stand with the lead\nhigh above legs out the way lead high above but not pulling the dog up by the\nneck nice a thin lead ideally black and just hold it out of the way so what we\ngoing to do and now we're going to pack down we're not going to film that and I\nmeet you back in the office to edit one of these pictures things like this is working I thought\nyou said he wasn't gonna start a forklift anytime to do oh okay is it is\nit gone now is that it okay we've got direct sunlight coming in but it's not\non our background area so we're okay", "UX35Eo3Ip7U": "there's something dashing and sophisticated about black dogs lots of breeds of ebony coat colors in this video we have

give this video a like and share with a friend here's some other cool videos i know you'll enjoy see you guys later you", "pLn4vNi7_-A": "hey guys check out this pet portrait I'm working on so originally I was gonna film this as a time-lapse video and then I thought maybe since I think all my pet portrait videos are time lapse that maybe a few comments might be helpful for those of you interested in arts or are like watching painting in real time so this is Darcy she's a friend of mine's fuzzy loved one and I'm writing love on the canvas like I always do before any painting I start I just think it's a great way to start that was with a watercolor pencil that'll just sort of dissolve into the pigment and there's the photo of Darcy I have as a reference that my friend sent this is just a kneaded eraser you kind of need it stretch it pull it and then it'll lighten the charcoal pencil that I drew on the canvas so I can see where I'm going because when I paint a pet portrait sometimes you get a little lost in the details and you need I always say a map of where I'm going so I'm just lightening it right now so it's not quite so strong oh this is a 5x7 canvas it's an inch and a half deep and now I'm just painting the background and some colors that'll pick up the color of her eyes I'm using raw Sienna burnt umber and I don't think that's red ox I think that's burnt sienna oh and then a Naples yellow there and I got a little bit of medium orange up on the top of my palate there just in case I need to brighten up the color a little bit and then I'm using oh it looks like it's a filbert brush I don't know if it's quite a half inch it looks like it might be about a half inch so you can see painting isn't real time painting isn't the speediest thing I've got an art table for painting small paintings and I have a big easel when I paint big paintings and then I've got a little clamp with an arm that I've got my cell phone hooked into so when I bought the table you'll see the video shake a little bit because the tables shaking so what I'm thinking about here a little bit is keeping the bottom and the corners darker it just is this an easy way to keep the viewer focused into the more the center of the painting of course this is a portrait so the eyes and the nose will definitely draw your attention but I'm just being mindful of keeping things focused in the right place I think for me painting the backgrounds is one of the most relaxing things you're just playing with color and brushstrokes oh I should mention these are acrylic paints they're heavy body professional paints I like acrylics because they dry so much faster than oils I think they're much more archival than oil paintings they're not going to crack the oil isn't gonna yellow you know it's just I mean I know the old masters used oil but they didn't have acrylics back then so I just love acrylics they do amazing things okay since the eyes and the nose are important I'm making sure I get those in get them at least sort of mocked in and in the correct spots I'll go back towards the end and brighten up the eyes this is just a little knife brush I'm using I don't know if it's even an eighth inch wide and it goes to a point like a knife you so my palette is a Styrofoam 8 inch plate I like it's really easy to mix the paint colors on it doesn't dry out the paints and then I will miss the paint's with just a little bit of water especially in the summer when fans are going or actually in the winter when there's not much humidity in my studio and then I will put this plate in a gallon ziplock baggies with a little more misted water because acrylics are water-based paint it'll help preserve them for a gush maybe weeks usually I only need it for about a week I think that's just a really neat trick you can also add moisture by adding matte medium or gloss medium but that will also affect the transparency of your paint it'll make it more transparent I'm just missing it with a little bit of water I think it's just a really neat trick I suppose I should mention you don't want to put too much water in acrylic paint because it'll break down the polymers I think that's the right word that they're made of and then there's a chance that the paint won't even stick to each other but misting is totally fine I mean it is a water-based paint so so what i'm doing here is rather just painting straight out of the tube black and gray because this is a black and white dog a lot of times the cool side or the shadow side of your image will have blues in it or even other colors so I'm just using a little Prussian blue and some black and make mixing a blue grey just to get some more depth to the painting I heard an artist talk once about how there are living shadows there's there's color and shadows sometimes people think of shadows is just being gray and you can tell I'm thinking because I'm not painting a lot here I'm looking at the shapes of my reference photo I'm looking about where I might want to put the bluish colors and plus I thought it's gonna be a time-lapse so this would be speeded up a bit this part of a painting usually goes pretty slow because I'm just looking at shapes as I mentioned and I just want to get things right brushstroke direction does matter but this is a very short haired dog so you can also get away with painting just the shape some I'll come back with some more brush strokes when I get towards the end that our fur direction all right we jumped forward just a little bit here and you can see it's starting to take shape and especially when you video or photograph a little painting like this it kind of smoothes it out a little bit what I see is a little rougher than what you guys see but that's not a problem it's just an interesting little fact I'm still using that little knife brush and things are still going pretty slow at this point you okay look what a little bit of time and a little bit of painting in the shapes and the shadows does Darcy is starting to come together I always get excited and what starts looking good I haven't changed Chris my hands over it but I haven't changed the eyes or the nose since I first painted them wait what you kind of want to do or what I want to do is get one layer of paint down and then see where I want to make things lighter darker more detail less detail because sometimes you like I might paint underneath the nose and it gets too dark or it's not dark enough so it's good just to kind of get one layer or paint down and then go back and with another layer it gives it depth and it'll give it a little bit more realism too you a little more progress so here I'm painting and you cannot tell that's actually a very light gray it looks white on camera and actually I'm thinking it's kind of light so I had a little darker gray there oh I actually changed where I was gonna go so here not I'm painting more of the neck and chest I'm paying a little more attention to a brushstroke and I went a little too far over onto the background that I wanted so I just took a clean brush and the background has been dry for quite a while probably a couple days so I can easily just wash off but I didn't like there and start again so guys tell me what you think do you like when you see him we paint in real time do you like the time-lapse better cuz either way in a video you can stop it back up you know see what I did see what you think let me know in the comments if you like the real-time better the time-lapse better or you just want to see more of both I really love the challenge of painting pet portraits I like to come fuzzy loved ones for real of ones and then I'm also honored because it's really important to their family members so I think it's just a neat thing to do so here is another jump forward and you can see my breaststroke sore-loser on Darcy's body and he can make a lot more progress quicker because it's not the detail of the face and I'm adding I went back to ask my gray and her white patch on her chest then I believe she's got a flowered collar on but in the photo it's just little spots of color and I paint when I paint a pet portrait I paint from one photo that my client sends I can't combine photos and figure out how that's going to look and it'll look more it looks much more realistic if I'm painting for one photo and so then recreating those values and those angles and shapes combining photos it just starts to look a little goofy I'm getting all fussy here I think I could have used a bigger brush but it doesn't matter I mean you use whatever brush you want so things are just looking more refined I've gone back and smoothed out the brushstrokes in her body and then added some looser stronger ones to indicate fur Here I am getting down to the nitty gritty of lighter darker details it's really starting to look yummy I'm definitely on layer 2 here if you guys were wondering Oh notice her eyes are better I've added some highlight I've added more color i strengthened the black areas they're starting to really look good with that background thanks so much for watching everybody I am pretty much done for more information on portraits a neat row calm", "Fvq3QiLmN20": "hi it's graeme from black dog cat the boat is 100 finished 100 ready and is available for sale now we're keen to sell it it's a 620 black dog cat hard top let's do a bit of a walk around i'll show you as with most of our boats comes with the black dog custom aluminium trailer with the patented catch and release system that'll make your boating a lot of fun this is a braked trailer it's braked on the front axle and we use stainless steel calipers and rotors it's good gear moving down this wall let's start the start of it it has the maxwell drum winch in it uh has the maxwell drum winch which is just brilliant gear um makes your boating easy to be fair i'd actually put one of those winches in a boat before an engine nowadays i'm not going to pull an anchor let's walk through this boat looks beautiful in the dark navy the navy blue with the white stripe it's a beautiful boat we've just put a few little extras on cleats mid-chip just make it easier at the dock let's walk through here this boat looks like it's got the one kilowatt it's got the the big garmin it's got the big garment in it with the one kilowatt transducer and the retractable transducer mount this means if you're ever launching off a beach or bring your boat up to a beach you can bring your transducer up above the hull so it won't bang these things are 1800 these one kilowatt transducers so you've got to look after them and the idea of the electric mount you can actually get it down further once you get into your desired fishing area so the electric mount is brilliant really makes the best out of the sounder so we've got the big garmin with the one kilowatt sounder let's just walk around here luke let's just go and have a look look at the ladder on this boat so easy to get in and out so easy okay we have the plumbed live bait tank so the plum live bait tank it's a big live bait tank it works really well so that's got its own pump on it have a look at this two batteries two batteries right there off the floor fuel water separator and the electric the isolation switches comes with a voltage sensitive relay so that all the electricity from the engine goes under the the all the electricity it's created from the engine goes into the start battery to start with make sure your start battery is always good these boats have 100 liters of fuel each side total fuel capacity of 200 with an engine are they typically used on this you're doing about 1.6 1.7 kilometers a liter so if you said uh 1.6 that's a nautical mile a liter and you've got 200 liters of fuel that's the range you've got 200 odd miles pretty good by far our biggest selling seat base is the pipe style seat base the pipe style seat base allows us to put a chili bin under here that gets fixed in position allowing another seat on the boat to face aft so effectively you've got seating for four two facing aft two facing forward if you don't have those in place how is this for a position to sit away the time with a bloody fishing rod on your hand it's just brilliant a brilliant spot to sit so these are the black dog bolster seats these bolster seats really are beautiful okay let's just move up the front of the boat this boat's going to come with a set of squabs up the front of it so the set of squabs will make it easy to sleep there just have a rest during the day um it really does it's actually a small double bed you can either sleep east west across it or put two people in to go you know just on the sides it's a very very big berth for a 6.2 metre boat let's go to the dashboard there's the screen of the big garland this is the honda management gauge so this particular boat is geared to take a honda engine if you really want another sort of an engine i'll put another engine on it i don't care we just did the wiring except for this boat with a honda if you'd like a yamaha a suzuki or mercury we'll put that engine on for you this one has actually got a honda gauge that it's the garmin gauge that actually interfaces with the honda it has the maxwell electric drum winch there has a fusion stereo a garmin vhf and there's the button for the up and down transducer bracket got electric wipers in it lights throughout carpet in the roof have a look at it's got led lights in the cockpit it has rocket launchers to burn this is a good boat this is a 6.2 meter fishing machine that doubles as a family boat this boats is happy out wide and three or four 500 meters as it is in 20 meters very easy to tow very easy to launch the black dog cat 620 hardtop if you're keen on talking to me about this give graeme a ring black dog cat two hulls twice the boat you", "OFHDDkAyOlU": "today in the shop we're going to finish this corn sheller coffee table [Music] she wants a coffee table [Music] [Applause] and we're back on this this table this corn shucker coffee table and those tabs you guys saw me weld on minute ago right here to the feet I just I started second-guessing my welds you know because it's steel tab welded to cast iron and I just tapped this guy with a hammer a little bit and it broke right off and you can see is a good opportunity you can see kind of what happens to a weld when you weld to cast iron some of that brittleness some of that granular structure gets transferred into the weld making it well brittle Wow that's a good message so I'm guessing I could probably break most of these off I [Music] don't know that one's actually better this is the one that had the biggest crack like it wasn't falling off but like just a few bends with my hand and it came off so it probably would have been fine yeah but we don't make fine here yeah we want to go further for you know heirloom pieces we want stuff that'll last longer than you do but that one had the biggest crack some of these other ones aren't quite as brittle a little trouble in paradise we'll figure it out okay here's what I did or I'm gonna try to do I ground down higher on the wheel and I actually ground down deeper into the metal I kind of get rid of all the contamination of this rust has and then for the ones that aren't as brittle is the one I broke off I'm gonna weld in a triangular gusset in here just to give me a little bit extra chance of making it strong and that ought to take care of a some of the wobble we had will be tested it and be the structural integrity of the weld it's not the prettiest but I got a much better preheat on this one and it looks like my well tower zero cracks so that's really nice as you can see I've got my tiny little gusset in there it's not beautiful it's not gonna win any awards and it is gonna be strong and it is gonna hold together and once we wire wheel it and final do the final finish on this thing it's up underneath the table you'll never see it nice that's not an excuse for bad welds but these are good enough [Music] [Music] [Music] what I'm going to do is eggs ban this but I need to leave it a little bit proud for a quarter-inch piece of glass and then I'll come in and rip these guys the edge off so I've got grey timber or lumber on all three sides because I don't want any fresh cut if I could say it that I'm lighter the ends I'm gonna go ahead and and run this through the saw and clean up all the edges [Music] [Music] so the door itself is one of the nights that I want to put a quarter inch piece of glass on it so I need to make it my my cleat that sits flush with the bottom 19 3/8 so I move over to the saw cutting some some pieces cut it down into three eights [Music] I think I got enough there so I use this is my shim to replicate the glass and so I'll I'll bring it down a little bit but up so to get started with this I'm gonna go ahead and do one miter all right and then I'll start and I'll mark I marked the other miter then I'll float it to meet this and then I'll all the way around I always cut it a little bit fat that's that fat means a little bit more wood on it then I come in and shave it down so you can't put the wood back on once you do that so cut it fat bring it back when you're working with old stuff I don't know if that was when were it's in there somewhere I'm not sure all right so I've finished putting on the edging and as you can see I've got the gray the gray wood on the outside and the top did a little bit of sanding on the inside miter the corner so I had a good coverage all the way around and didn't butt joint anywhere and we're ready for glass what's cams through with his pieces I'll have the wood ready to go and we'll just slap it together to put a clear coat on it and get it to the owner one of the data saw right now what I'm gonna do is create feet out of one boy so I'm gonna cut the hollow out quick six inches here and six inches there that's gonna be my feet on either side of that of the table you don't want one straight board one across because if the floor is uneven it'll rot and I got a piece of looks like chestnut which is pretty cool I just picked this up off the floor it's this kind of scrap wood but certain little marks I want to leave enough here for the legs on the table to mount to and make sure it's wide enough for everything all right so over here today toe you want to see how high you're cutting so I'm gonna bring it down just a little bit somewhere around three eighths perfect and what this is gonna do is don't give me a give me a slaughter or carriage to run this thing back and forth so I'm just gonna cut it all the way down to this side now I can do it a couple of different ways but this is but the quickest I can do right now so got everything on fire that's [Music] so see what I got here I've got two platforms for it to sit on all right you can see it if I lay it down on a surface foot foot I'll do two of those so that it's got four bearing surface instead of two long bearing surfaces all right so I've got the clean on Rajee 1/4 inch set in for the glass I put in a couple of standoffs on the bottom that's going to get me up with some elevation that I need I need a couple extra inches and then I've made two feet that the the wheels will sit on and then glue on the top kind of like that and you're done [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] one thing I just learned we got to do is be hinge holes there's two spots on the front of the door that there were hinges on for some reason I'm not sure why there's hinge holes on the front of the door but these guys we are gonna go gonna go upstairs to the hardware section grab two old hinges and then cut them cut a piece of them off that can fill this side and then then we're gonna screw it in and instead of just having two big holes there now you kind of have something that looks like a door it kind of looks like we got that one inch by little in this four I can make these holes bigger with a chisel a little under four by one so my hinges my hinge leaves if you will need to be four by one yes [Music] [Music] do you think yes absolutely every time fantastic [Music] so I missed most of it with the camera because it's too much going on but I got my two pieces cut in the hinge and now hopefully we can make a bit in the holes [Music] so we have all of our pieces for the table on on the bench we've already pre finished them all I finished these the cast iron legs was just a rattle can of oil-based clear coat and then I I finished the the table top and the two feet with water based chem craft polyurethane and so we're ready to go and all I got to do is attach the legs to the

mean i heard that's not your normal well i am man it was very gently so it had like a lot of gently it was gently with also that that nice chorus but um you know that's really when i first started kind of like really like oh this like gin like i that's when i first started really like getting my toe in the water so to speak um so i like the sun man i mean it's nothing it's nothing crazy uh the breakdown's sick though there's a nice chorus it's just a very easy to listen to track uh what did you think yeah i wasn't sold on it completely until that course came in um i was waiting for the chorus to hit because yeah i knew that you'd like that i i and i thought the the cleans weren't overly done either had like a good harmony in there yeah um i don't know i didn't like a a couple of the riffs just you know the harmonic like look that kind of stuff and i i prefer less of that but i thought you know see i love that that yeah i love it i i'm you're you're uh oh guy and i'm a riffy guy kind of stuff you know but anyways so those are the only things i didn't really care for but they fit the song still and i loved when it went like straight death core for a moment there so i thought

Morgan e for fishing monthly magazines at the Melbourne Boat Show here with Jason Graham from Aussie boat sales Jason you've got a great brand here the Black Dog cats they're the only ones at the show

a which is about an hour north of Auckland in New Zealand so the played alloy boats that come out of New Zealand the quality is impeccable we're up against some of the best boats you know in New Zealand the big difference with this boat is that it's a plate alloy cat so we're a bit smaller than a sailfish so but sailfish is our competition basically we're aiming more at the trailer boat market but in a price range it's a little bit more achievable for most people so the boats range sort of from that 35 40 grand right up to the 6.3 that we're standing in now is around about 110 120 grand but that puts it about 50 grand cheaper than our nearest competitor well we all know that the cats are great platform guys love cats and the the ability to buy cats nowadays is limited there's not as many people mayhem as it used to be so you're one of the only places in the market can do them and you're happy to give some good deals here at the show oh we are mate in fact and Luke tested a

New Zealand on a fishing trip with the family the black dog cat family so we're putting out 5 nights accommodation on the water made its a beautiful part of the world so just it's a little bit of a carrot to get people to come and have a look at these boats because the quality and the performance of them is unbelievable whether customers are in Adelaide Melbourne Brisbane anywhere what we're also offering is is free flights into Sydney to my office on the North Shore we'll do all our demos there and then if they do fly in and we take them for demo they love the boat which I know they will

Australia Queensland we just sold one to chinchilla up in Far North Queensland so they're a beautiful boat and they're built for that New Zealand conditions which down here in Melbourne you know pretty rough out there and then up around up around Far North Queensland where they're there fishing around the reefs and stuff the beauty of the cats is they draw no water so yeah they're a beautiful

represents tragedy calamity and demonic bondage then it represents the stronghold of the wicked the stronghold of the wicked that is the dream of black dog when you are seeing black dog in your dream praise delivering jesus so if you dream of black dog watching you what does it mean it's really the enemies are aware of your next plan of action this dream truly confirms that you are being monitored or someone in your life who wants to attack you someone in your life wants to attack you by all means if a black dog is watching you it means there's something god want god want to bless you with and they want to take away that thing if you dream of a black dog chasing you in a what does it mean it indicates troubles from a close person who are envied you you show that the enemy wants to arrest and delay the manifestation of your goals if you dream that black dog attacking you what does it mean if you notice this dream use psalm 18 44 it shows the ancestral powers applying to make sure you did not succeed in your plans if you dream of aggressive black dog what does it mean this shows that you have a stubborn strong man who is angry at your progress if you dream of a black dog what does it mean it indicates the sign that god has blinded the eyes of your enemy from getting full knowledge of your activities the blind black dogs means god is frustrating the household powers trying as us all power trying to cause problems in your marriage in your finances in your ministry in your career praise the living jesus if you dream of biting by black dog what does it mean it indicates a certain world's cause issue by the enemy will cause you to fail willfully in life in having the fulfillment of your goals if you dream of a tight black dog what does it mean this kind of dream is interested by the agent of darkness to deletion the black dog could also represent you you showed that the angel the agenda of witchcraft is to restrict you it means someone has determined not to allow you to enjoy the freedom god gave you to prosper to succeed in ezekiel if you are a pregnant woman and you have this dream that show you are likely not to deliver safely pray for god to scatter the witchcraft agenda against you life but if you are the one that tied the black dog it means your enemy is about to give up in attacking you when you are kind the black dog it means that you are dealing with the ancestor powers if you are tying the black dog it means you are taking a targeted prayers when you are tying the black dog it means that god has given you power over your enemies if you dream of killing a black dog what does it mean it means deliverance you will begin to experience success progress promotion happiness the black dog represents embarrassment fear opposition pride evil friends it indicates your eagerness for dealing with stubborn problems in your in your life completely it means you will achieve your goals but if they don't kill you you may start experiencing bad news if you pray very well you overcome them in jesus name and at the same time if you are seeing a dead black dog in a dream what does it mean a dead blood dog in the dream then that kind of dream it tells you that somebody somewhere is giving up in life as a result of life battles as a result of persistent demonic attack you have to pray very well so that no one will experience downfall praise the living jesus then in some cases if you dream of black dog approaching what does it mean it means the advances of the enemy towards you if you are keeping on trusted friend cut away from them immediately such dog who also could also represent difficulties about to locate you the enemy wants to bring fear so that you won't be able to carry out your divine assignment if the black dog is approaching you try to protect yourself because they may come to come and steal to kill and to destroy you praise the living jesus if you dream and see many black dogs what does it mean it indicates witchcraft gathering over your life and destiny if you dream of black dog barking you backing at you what does it mean it means you are not you are not fully saved as the enemy wants to steal your happiness their backing is a one signal indicating the season of evil attack and manipulation use isaiah 54 17 psalm 35 to scatter their evil power and authority value if you dream of shooting a black dog what does it mean you are taking authority over the power of darkness in your life according to luke chapter 10 verse 19 if you dream of taking a black dog for your work what does it mean it means you are moving with evil friend in ground ignorantly the bible says do not be unequally yoke with an unbeliever if the person is your fiance or fiancee and you feel is a dem is a carrier of demonic powers pray very hard otherwise it may corrupt your life and your destiny or you can also meet your pastor for guidance if you dream of white dog it means you will gain the trust of a friend of a loyal friend if the white dog is attacking you that indicates betrayer if you dream of black dog licking your sex organ what does it mean it means impotency and barrenness it means you are going to lose your virtues to the enemy and the devil are using that virtues against you once they have extracted your virtues what remains from you is shocked that means you have no z to fulfill your destiny again so if you are dreaming about black dog you have been driven about blood you have sheer diminished so what is the word the way i shall give your life to christ have a genuine repentance and confession of your sin break the yoke of marital problems destroy the agreement between you and marry demons live a holy life and stay away from bad friends pray for discernment to know who your friends truly are saturate yourself with the blood of jesus instructions and back on seven days fasting and prayer between 6 am 6 p.m take proverbs 14 verse 12 first corinthians 10 verse four to five

can trust in debate the rain is expected tonight just a minute over YUM six my one walk arounds manufactured by black dog fight Elementium date started you'd be reversed join on these things around

another coil yet another aftermarket car I hear you say this one has been sent to me today by a European company called Black Dog detectors and they have to admit I have never heard of Black Dog detectors up until last week another coil another aftermarket Kyle from Europe which begs the question why are we not making aftermarket clothes either in the UK there's got to be an onsen out there somewhere all seems to be Europe and which isn't bad there's some really good clothes coming out of Europe at the moment but it just seems to be coil after coil off the manufacturer of the manufacturer coming out and I think the key to is finding the good ones and dismissing the bad ones and so let's have a look at this one meets comes with a box as you can see nor frills comes with a little noughts talking about with guarantee of two years which is fine strangely it comes with a coil cover and slotted in the top as just conceive and it actually comes with one fitted as well so that's really come to two code covers now whether that's a mistake and I'm not sure but one thing that I have noticed when I unwrap it there's no cobalt so I guess that you've got to use the standard coil bowl that your machine comes with I guess so the clasp in it has the XXL black dog 13 by 11 there's a little red market scene ultra deep and it actually doesn't seem bad at all build wise it seems quite good and it's quite light he's actually lighter than the thought and lighter than it looks and I'll have to get the weights and dimensions and everything else from these guys but um looking at the Kyle looks they thought tomb seemed too bad them in deflects a little bit what you tell me which ones dawn and it's one thing I always worries me about the market tiles these these lugs always even on standard manufacturer mid coils some of them can be extremely weak which leads to frustration not only for the person that buys and for us guys up to have to pick up the pieces afterwards somewhere she is cold cover fitted nice and light nice big thick cable standard length this is for Fisher 75 this one which will also fit the Fisher of 70 now I haven't tried it on the machine I've not a chance because of the appalling weather we've had today it just doesn't give me the opportunity to get on the test bed with it but reading up on some of the information that these guys give out and I guess it'll be pretty much like some of the others on on the market performance wise I think the key to aftermarket cars is this does it improve your metal detector yes or no does it give you a better ground coverage just to give you a better depth to the sensitivity levels remain and crucially to the allow the machine to ground balance correctly so there's the factors you've got to take into place so let's give it a go I'll do a video when the weather dries up a little bit and gets a little bit better I will just add at the weekend I'll get up with this off the test bed and give it give it some give it some stick but there she is another coil who knows could be good could be average could be pure you don't know until we try it so what's this space thanks for watching", "eYq8yzQS9TE": "[Music] that was super easy graham nice job nice and straight on the trailer too bit of a head turner when you're short-handed i'll tell you g'day graham from black dog cat one of the things we've been asked to build in the last year a lot of people have been talking to us about aluminium trailers so we started building our aluminium trailers to supplement our range of bmw steel trailers so we've built about 40 trailers now so this is a boat this is a trailer going out on one of our uh a 545 black dog cat i'll just run over some of the features on this so one of the things we like on all our trailers we like them to have places to stand just somewhere you can stand on the side of your boat and actually get into it and street and you're always looking for some places to stand so all our trailers beat a cat or a monohull come out like this we put mag wheels on all of our trailers we put bearing buddies now on our cat here a lot of trailers just don't have sufficient tie down points depending on which boat we're building this trailer to we have tie down points so they're just there and accessible and actually made for the boat we use really hard nylon rollers to actually roll and the boat comes off the trailer we'll work through here we've chosen to use box section construction so that's four-sided aluminium a lot stronger than anything else we put gussets on every outside joint we put gussets on every joint in the middle we can't see how we can build a better trailer it's a good looking trailer toes great we'll work up through the front of it doesn't matter what sort of boat basically you have whether it's a monohull or a kit we can fit the black dog cat catch and release system to it we can weld a fitting to if it's a monohull trailer we're replacing you know putting a new trailer under it we can weld a fitting onto the boat and we can make a catch and release system here really makes your boating easy we put quality jockey wheels on we put trojan toe two toe hitches on so these are a great trailer so when you're getting a black dog cat or whether you want a trailer for your monohull give us a call and i'll quote you up black dog cat two hulls twice the boat [Music] you", "bmszqsF6bFM": "meet my two dogs boy one there's one black one yeah the weight one's been here longer and he did nothing to the black one to make him mad

I've got another holster review for you guys today black duck concealment contacted me recently wanted to know if I was interested in any other holsters so I could try them out and review them for you guys they ended up sending me out two of them one is an on the waistband and one is in the waistband and I just want to say off the bat that I love both of these holsters the owner of the company did a lot to work with me on what kind of style and design and fit and all that sort of thing that I wanted he has a bunch of other holsters listed on his website and he asked me which ones I've wanted and I don't remember the ones that I asked for but he ended up writing me back after trying to make the ones that I wanted for my particular gun the sig p228 and he wasn't happy with how they were turning out he sent me pictures he gave me a big write out of why he wasn't happy with how they were turning out and he asked me what I wanted him to do I let him know that I trusted his judgment I mean he makes holsters for a living and I would be happy to try out whatever he sent so he ended up making these two for me and so I know a lot of effort went into making these and I think he did an amazing job he really hit a homerun with both of these I will say with the on the waistband one the retention is a little bit too loose for me he did send out some really good instructions with pictures on how to fix the retention it's one of those deals where you have to heat up the Kydex to do it so I'm actually gonna try to film a for you guys and show you how it works [Music] here's a little bit closer of the on the waistband option it has this paddle on the back here and this is really easy to get on and off sometimes I have a hard time with how these clips go over my belt and I get frustrated but this one was super simple so I really liked that my gun is not loaded there's no magazine in it there's nothing in there it's perfectly on my hip bone it is not uncomfortable in the least and I think for on the waistband it actually has quite a low profile I think I could get away with wearing this one in the winter with a sweatshirt or a jacket or something over it it's definitely not gonna work in a summer with a thin t-shirt if I wanted to try to conceal it but I really think this is one I could get away with in the cooler months I think if you're a girl and you want to get away with carrying on the waistband and you have a smaller firearm like I do I think this is a great option alright and here is the in the waistband option it's like one of those hybrid holsters with half Kydex shell right here it has a nice big clip that is super easy to get on and off of my belt which is really important to me I also like that this clip is flat here here it is on the side and here is the backing now this is not one that you can adjust the can table but I did see on the website that he gave you options for that so that's how he would make it for you I just so happen to think that the cams on this one is perfect for me and I don't want to change it so I will go ahead and show you what this looks like on alright and I like that I can actually wear this appendix style or in the back it fits really well in either placed this backing on here is really comfortable it doesn't dig into my skin at all it's really soft around the edges here's how it looks in the front for appendix it disappears even under this really thin shirt I am just really impressed with this I think he did such a good job at making this holster here it is in the back like I said it is super easy to get on again it is very comfortable back here it doesn't too high or too low the cans on this is just right for me it is easy to draw and cheery holster here it is with my shirt down and it does prints when it's in the back like this it prints more in the back than it does in the front but it really is because of the shirt that I'm wearing this is a really fitted shirt alright just a few more things that I want to mention with this company I saw on the website they have a lifetime warranty he says it's his lifetime not yours because he's an older gentleman which I

people at black dog are great but the experience you get to feel when you get picked up from the airport they welcome you like it's family they fend off everybody that they possibly can to make sure that your experience here is five star in first class we've been treated like we are royalty needless to say last guys we just had in they killed 475 birds 21 birds a hunt there's nowhere in the states that's going to shoot like that there's also no place like black dog outfitters either right and that's what separates us that's why we're better chasing birds across the states it's cool but

"2MCP2nbI60c": "hi there guys I'm Danny and welcome to this episode of all monsters go to space today I'm going to be talking about the black dog of legend somebody know it better as the groom or even Padfoot this is a spectral entity some say demonic that can be found in folklore throughout Britain mainly but it's also in America Latin America and Europe and usually as you can tell by the name appears as a big black dog with glowing eyes they were also said to be shapeshifters that appear at night nor a warning of oncoming death and some say they are linked to the devil or ghosts or even hellhounds they are known to appear at crossroads cemeteries execution sites in ancient paths some say mainly in Suffolk that black dogs are linked to electrical storms the origin doesn't seem to have a start date they seem to have always been around but it does seem to have a Celtic or Germanic root this being also has a varying nature depending on where the tale comes from to some it is sinister and in some rare cases actually harmful let us say that they are merely a warning and then a few have said that the dark was a benevolent guardian that would go into lost travelers away from danger and even might have been guardians to treasure in the United States there are a couple of places that have tells a black dog in New England in the Bridgewater triangle back in the 1970s Abington town was being tormented by a large black dog the fireman reported they had seen it attacking horses and although the police searched for the creature they couldn't find it then one officer saw gave chase and shot it but the bullets have no effect that it disappeared for the final time over in Meriden Connecticut the area called hanging hills it's said to have been haunted by this very entity here it is said that if you see it only once it portends joy twice will mean sorrow and if you see it three times it'll signal your death there are a lot of Latin America they have stories of this creature in Argentina and Paraguay it is called lobizon in Mexico now well as well as a Cheever and Hawaii Peck and it's also called perro Negro in some places it seems that they are believed to be shape-shifting sorcerers or an incarnation of the devil in Flanders Belgium in the 18th century reports of a large black dog with fiery red eyes and in Vilonia there was a dog that was wrapped in chains that would roam fields nightly and it was named towhen also in lower brittany there was a story of a go ship it was manned by a complete crew of dead criminals and they had black dogs as guards and last but not least for mainland Europe way back in 856 AD in France one of these creatures were said to appear in a church it would walk up and down as though searching for something and it would disappear now before I delve into the fairly long list of the black dog in Britain and its islands I must add in that not all of these entities are black in some places of northern England and Suffolk there is a white and a shadowy being in Scotland they have a green being and the Isle of Man has an entity that is white with red ears so at the isle of man in the Channel Islands these creatures have different names on Normandy they have the rank order which walks along Bayeux and winter and surprisingly for a winter ghost it drags his chains with it very a Christmas Carol in Jersey they had the Chico and here is a warning of storms on Guernsey they have two beings Chico is a headless entity that is the ghost of the past bailiff Gautier delle stelle then there's the bodu when this one appears it is a sign that someone nearby will die and in the Isle of Man there was a black dog who acted as a guardian a group of men were waiting for their skipper so that they could all go fishing but after waiting all night and well into the morning they witnessed a storm that would surely sunk them and their boat the skipper then finally turned up and told the others that his way had been continually blocked by a black dog and it wouldn't leave until he had turned back and another one from here is the muddy do the Manx black dog it haunts around the peal castle in Cornwall there are a lot of different black dogs down in st. teeth there is apparently a pack of spectral dogs they were called Chaney hounds since they were owned by an old squire called Chaney there's also packed down in the st. German area they are called Don Doge dog dando was a wicked priest who loved to hunt as the story goes he was dragged away by the devil these are not to be confused with a devil standing this pack belongs specifically to the devil and are said to be very dangerous and finally for Cornwall there are a few black dog sightings near lawn stir they haunt the roads in Wales their counterpart is called googy the dog of darkness and it appears as a mastiff with red eyes and there is one that haunts Saint Donald's castle also here in Wales there is a white dog called  anoon and it is connected to the other realm up in Scotland some of their black dog legends are said to be treasure guardians near the village of mirth Lee at the standing stones there is also the maka black type that is said to be the devil himself now there are just so many sightings and reports around England in Devon if they have the yes and the wished hounds the yes is headless rambles around the woods and Wales and the wished haunt the Moors in northern England this omen of death is a dye trash once mentioned in Jane Eyre in Lincolnshire they are called hairy Jack and it haunts the fields and village lanes and hems well brick and Spaulding this being is said to be gentle and a protector there are the Gabriel hounds that have human heads and the power of flight and it said that if they hover over a house someone inside or die in Lancashire and Yorkshire they have thus Croker and trash respectively they wander the woods shrieking and her death omens in Westmoreland their black dog is the Capel's white it was helpful to those who worked on the farm by rounding up sheep but if you were stranger to this dog it could be very mischievous in Tring hartfordshire the entity is said to be the spectral form of Thomas Curley who was hanged in 1751 for the murder of Ruth Osbourne in Norfolk Suffolk and parts of Essex they have the black shuck its malevolent and terrorizes people even killing people but they also have a spectral Guardian dog who walk with people on their journey home to protect them from misfortune for 400 years the prison of Newgate has been haunted by a black dog that appeared before executions a farmhouse near Lyme Regis Dorset was haunted by a black dog it never caused harm but there is a story that a drunk man tried to attack this bin with a poker it ran up the stairs into the attic and disappeared just as it did the man tried to strike it again but hit a floorboard and discovered some hidden silver and gold after this it was said to haunt the lanes that leads to hey Lane at midnight in Aylesbury a man living in said village would go and milk his cows as he was walking over one night he saw the black dog he saw it every night thereafter luckily one night he brought along a friend and again he saw the entity went to strike it and as he did so the dog disappeared and he fell senseless his friend then had to drag him home and unfortunately humane speechless and immovable for the rest of his life in York they have the bar guest seeing this being is a warning of bad luck and it's also said to prey on those who travel by and finally it is said that black dogs can be found in almost all churchyards they guard against any dark force like grave diggers vandals and any person who has an ill intent upon the graveyard now a little gruesome fact a dog would be buried under the cornerstone of the church foundation there would be the first being buried and this then means that their spirit was tied to the grounds I would act as a protector this being can even be found throughout popular culture the most famous for my generation at least maybe in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban with Sirius the groom also had furred the very nickname of Remus Lupin there is a groom in the hand of the Baskervilles or at least it said at the hand of the Baskervilles is a groom in the omen being a giant Mastiff that can change its form and the Windigo episode

show how people we can customize things the people of this boat one of a debit in it for various reasons so we put a debit in the boat it's actually a 620 but instead of being a normal hardtop we've opted for a 620 with a caddy heaven but a hardtop but not at last in one his reasoning for that he goes out in the dark so often the with the glass of a hardtop he can't see through come and ever walk through here you can dream that I can build it we've put a really really good yeah bit in this boat so we've designed this Devon and we've so it's going to be used for some crepe ops outside the kapre any deep topic aligns as you can guess I'm kind of excited about 620 hardtop the inside of us but we've spent hours and hours getting it just right the feedback from our customers was just brilliant

Blues of the black shelter animal it's a nationwide phenomenon and I think shelter is everywhere kind of has the same experiences as far as black pets go they don't photograph as well so it's kind of hard sometimes to get a good marketing shot of them some people even see them as being menacing looking and I think the biggest thing is that they just kind of tend to blend in to their background people don't tend to notice them and it's easy to just walk right past them and if it's a big black dog the odds of adoption are even lower there are websites now dedicated to black dog syndrome sometimes I'll try to make sure that the black dogs have nice collars on that make them pop just to make them a little more obvious in their kennel shelters try different techniques to make all the

walk through with it it's it's only a six seventy help but it's the enclosed cabin so it's the 670 enclosed and we've made it into a weekender I'll climb up and show you through so we have the the 670 this is our standard Hulk sits a pony up black dogs custom and aluminium trailer that we build on site especially for our boats we've fallen they just Tomek better and they come on and off the trailer brilliantly this is powered by the Honda be in 150 four-cylinder engine plenty a pug seven-year warranty and you might notice you have a choice with the 115 above white or of a silver bullet looks stunning with the white Honda and the white boat I mix just turned a little bit of a look at what we got on the baby this time we've elected to run with the gamin 8410 it's the galmans latest the big head unit with the the one kilowatt transducer so that it should be capable of seeing fresh tea under 400 odd meters seeing the bottom on 500 meters pretty good gear okay sort of this bow here here's the live bait chain case we as you know most of the boats of this size do hydraulic steering here's our big trends and the game chaser transom and this one we don't have a live bait changing here we've elected to go with extra room and we have a force with the dual batteries and the fuel isolation a fuel water separator probably one of the things on this boat that I absolutely love is the cockpit seating this is brilliant and when you actually see it hardly takes up any room that if you're fishing type thing you know you're not tripping over them you just fold them up but to sit down in the afternoon after a bit of a fish and have your crew setting you up like this you could conceivably have a glass of beer a bit of wine and cheese it would be very sociable I speak to the spoke it's getting really popular with our boats in Australia this is a great idea so this is just a seating that we eventually don't ever look sure at the boat let's get up in the cabin here like it so with the windows on this particular boat we use the CMAC aluminum windows ce mec great Whangarei firm that you share a building with us so ce mec of basically Seamus and Bonnie probably more body than Seamus I would imagine they're designed and built this wonderful system here doesn't leak doesn't rattle and to open it you simply walk the deck like that so that gives us access to the extended her top have a look at this the owner of this boat here wanted his crew it's all about sociability he wanted now to talk to them keep an eye on his wife and and daughter you just sort of have them handy so he's elected to go when the fridge down still under here and seats on top with I've got visibility and he can keep an eye on them creates a lot of room with in there with a mean clothes Kevin I really like it I really like it and of course you've got the bowls to seek here the box to see obviously allows you to to lean back stand up the mobster seats quite standard and lots of boats near Daisy he's a lot of room bring that amulet bring it right in you're probably not going to sleep in this boat for a week but with the amount of room up there you can certainly sleep in it overnight it's huge for a boat of six point seven meters so there you go we've got a we've got a drum which on this boat as I see if we run the Garmin here we have the zip wakes with the save winch now we'll make next sever in Australia next a great life you're watching the sneaky-ass things and you know we've gone with a fusion here dick we've put all the good gear on this boat and we're really proud

about it", "qzc-6xoRito": "[Music] to see a black colored dog in your dream symbolizes the shadow aspect of a friend the dark side of someone close to you is being revealed and you are able to see through to their true intentions why do we dream there are several hypotheses and concepts as to why we dream our dreams merely part of the sleep cycle or do they serve some other purpose possible explanations for why we dream include to represent unconscious desires and wishes to interpret random signals from the brain and body during sleep to consolidate and process information gathered during the day to work as a form of psychotherapy from converging evidence and new research methodologies researchers have speculated that dreaming his offline memory reprocessing consolidates learning and memory tasks is a subsystem of the waking default Network which is active during mind wandering and day dreaming dreaming could be seen as cognitive simulation of real life experiences participates in the development of cognitive capabilities in psychoanalytic dreams are highly meaningful reflections of unconscious mental functioning is a unique state of consciousness that incorporates three temporal dimensions experience of the present processing of the past and preparation for the future provides a psychological space where overwhelming contradictory or highly complex notions can be brought together by the Dreaming ego that would be unsettling while awake this process serves the need for psychological balance and equilibrium as with many things concerning the brain and unconscious thought there is so much that remains unknown about dreaming dreams are difficult to study in a laboratory as technology and new research techniques are developed the understanding of dreams will continue to grow why our dreams hard to remember researchers estimate that five minutes after a dream people have forgotten 50% of its content increasing to 90% another five minutes later most dreams are entirely forgotten by the time someone wakes up it is not known precisely why dreams are so hard to remember however there are several steps that people can take to improve their dream recall these include waking up naturally and not with an alarm focusing on the dream as much as possible upon waking writing down as much about the dream as possible upon waking making recording dreams a routine a dream is a succession of images ideas emotions and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep dot the content and purpose of dreams are not fully understood though they have been a topic of scientific speculation as well as a subject of philosophical and religious interest throughout recorded history dream interpretation is the attempt at drawing meaning from dreams and searching for an underlying message the scientific study of dreams is called a neurology dreams mainly occur in the rapid eye movement REM stage of sleep when brain activity is high and resembles that of being awake REM sleep is revealed by continuous movements of the eyes during sleep at times dreams may occur during other stages of sleep however these dreams tend to be much less vivid or memorable dot the length of a dream can vary they may last for a few seconds or approximately 20 to 30 minutes dot people are more likely to remember the dream if they are awakened during the REM phase the average person has 3 to 5 dreams per night and some may have up to 7 however most dreams are immediately or quickly forgotten dot dreams tend to last longer as the night progresses during a full 8-hour night's sleep most dreams occur in the typical two hours of RAAM opinions about the meaning of dreams have varied and shifted through time and culture many endorsed the Freudian theory of dreams that dreams reveal insight into hidden desires and emotions other prominent theories include those suggesting that dreams assist in memory formation problem-solving or simply are a product of random brain activation the earliest recorded dreams were acquired from materials dating back approximately 5,000 years in Mesopotamia where they were documented on clay tablets in the Greek and Roman periods the people believed that dreams were direct messages from deities or deceased persons and that they predicted the future some cultures practiced dream incubation with the intention of cultivating dreams that are of prophesy Sigmund Freud who developed the psychological discipline of psychoanalysis wrote extensively about dream theories and their interpretations in the early 1900s he explained dreams as manifestations of one's deepest desires and anxieties often relating to repressed childhood memories or obsessions furthermore he believed that virtually every dream topic regardless of its content represented the release of sexual tension in the interpretation of dream Freud developed a psychological technique to interpret dreams and devised a series of guidelines to understand the symbols and motifs that appear in our dreams in modern times dreams have been seen as a connection to the unconscious mind they range from normal and ordinary to overly surreal and bizarre dreams can have varying natures such as being frightening exciting magical melancholic adventurous or sexual the events in dreams are generally outside the control of the dreamer with the exception of lucid dreaming where the dreamer is self-aware dot dreams can at times make a creative thought occur to the person or give a sense of inspiration dream interpretation is the process of assigning meaning to dreams in many ancient societies such as those of Egypt and Greece dreaming was considered a supernatural communication or a means of divine intervention whose message could be interpreted by people with these Associated spiritual powers in modern times various schools of psychology and neurobiology have offered theories about the meaning and purpose of dreams most people currently appear to interpret dream content according to the Freudian theory of dreams in countries as found by a study conducted in the United States India and South Korea people appear to believe dreams are particularly meaningful they assign more meaning to dreams than two similar waking thoughts for example people report they would be more likely to cancel a trip they had planned that involved a plane flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing the night before than if they thought of their plane crashing the night before or the Department of Homeland Security issued a federal warning however people do not attribute equal importance to all dreams people appear to use motivated reasoning when interpreting their dreams they are more likely to view dreams confirming their waking beliefs and desires to be more meaningful than dreams that contradict their waking beliefs and desires [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "fmEx7n_ckBw": "in this edition of energy secrets you learn how to properly trim your dog's nails even if they have what doula has black nails do you hear that noise that's the sound of someone who needs a nail trim hello you guys welcome back to my channel for those of you who are new welcome today's video is in part inspired by Tula who's been clicking around her house she's got moderately long nails but the difficult thing is that she has black nails and many of you have commented on the channel saying the same thing they've got dog with black nails really difficult to trim their nails can I give you some tips and pointers you bet I can so let's first just have a look at Tula's nails and the issue is just how do you know exactly how close do you cut them how can I make sure I'm not sort of cutting into the blood supply or the quick so we're looking at her front foot here we're looking at say for instance you know the middle nail here so the very tips of the nail there's just nail keratin which has no nerves no blood supply it doesn't hurt at all but if you go further past that that's where the blood supply to the nail the nail bed is and from there you've got some of these nerves that really hurt along with bleeding if you cut it too close so that's what we're trying to avoid so when you guys look at the nail upside down and actually appears sort of almost hollowed out that's where there's no blood supply as soon as it gets quite thickened and that's where the blood supply stores and that's what we need to avoid let's just have a look here on Tula so the very end of the nail right here for looking at on the side you can see where it's sort of hollowed out right there I hope you can see it in the camera that's where there is no blood supply and just in front of it or maybe a quarter of an inch that's where the blood supply starts and that's how I find as easy as anytime I was in practice I had clients coming in to trim their dog's nails my first have a look and then when in doubt just cut it a bit shorter and never cut it too long first of all you want to make it positive and for lots of guys that's the problem that you trim their nails one gets trimmed too short it's really painful and there's just whole cycle it's negatively reinforced so to begin with it really helps to have your dog be a little bit tired tool has already gone for a good walk this morning secondly you're gonna need some good dog nail trimmers something like these here which I have a guillotine type and in practice I also had the ones with the firm grip side to side all the side nail trimmers even like those a little bit better this is just what I have on hand regardless we wanted to be fairly new we wanted to be fairly sharp so the first sort of click through we're gonna cut completely through that nail third we're trying to make it positive so have some type of treat around you know what I've got here with little Tula I mean she loves these yummy liver treats and that she's gonna get one of those when I you know do the first couple nails to make it easy forth you want to have a place where you're comfortable to work on you I'm gonna put her on this little coffee table here something like that it could be in your kitchen table regardless somewhere where she's up a little bit it's easier for you to sort of restrain her moderately and then trim those nails safely there nothing like a dog sort of squirming around for many people it's often easier if it's a two-person job so Piatt definitely with luest it was kind of a one-person thing I do it at the end of the day he's really tired lying on his side and he was happy to have me trim his nails it also really helps if your dog is used to having their feet handled it's a really good day to do it as a puppy where you're not trimming their nails you know Tula unfortunately didn't have that so she's a little bit unsure I start to handle her feet and she's like what's going on so just do it you know where you handle your dog's feet go-girl Trula and then pair that with something part of it okay little Tula there is a little liver snack yeah sometimes it doesn't matter how good you are you're still can hit the nail a little bit I'm causing some bleeding so I always suggest having some flour on hand a lot finer works really well to help stop any bleeding there are some specific veterinary products but from personal experience putting them on a shaving gut they really really sting a flower doesn't sting it works pretty well I'd rather just stick with flower let's start off with this one here and I'm just when you go to is almost take so I've looked straight on it I can see exactly where it's hollowed out I'm confident there's no blood supply there and I'm just gonna take like a quarter of an inch go girl there we go see little tool has had some bad nail experiences so she's not sure back to these nails again I'm gonna get this dewclaw so Tula is definitely more challenging than many dogs and should be woke up too late it's okay good girl give me one of the dogs that dad's go to end up going to the vet clinic because they are more difficult looks like you're back Neal is there a little bit longer I always encourage you guys to though cut shorter than you need to just taking the tip off because he's just often what happens is that nails are infrequently cut then the blood supplier the quick grows longer if you're not sure just take a teeny tip you know I can eat them an inch off or something there we go big chunk off of there Tula she is almost done hooray yes even little Tula has a voice yeah Tula good girl two is losing her nail patience you're a good girl good girl to us so I've definitely got a rewarder after that episode oh my goodness may be more difficult to repair wound on you without anesthesia okay so if you do happen to trim your dog's nails one of them too short so far so good with Tula none of them were too short I would just take some of this flower put in here you can just dab it right on it like this you put it right on there like that or you can stick her nail dick your dog's nail right in look it's not gonna hurt I'm just gonna show them what happens just put it right in there just hold it down and you could as I get flour everywhere and then you could just apply after you've done that you just hold the flour on the end where the bleeding is applying a little bit of pressure I find for most guys the bleeding look can look pretty substantial because there's such a good blood supply to the nail bed but generally it's gonna stop within sort of one to two minutes and most guys are going to be fine the one other last point I need to make and I often found that in practice is that if you cut your dog's nails more frequently you're gonna start to see that that nail bad that quick sort of grow back a little bit so you don't have to be it's just gonna make it easier on yourself thanks you guys for

yeah when you when you buy your house the first time you look at the payoff I'm gonna once yeah then you just go like everybody else and do it yeah it's a it's a cool place great great it is gonna be nice just like Ohio we have a lot of success of always enjoy just being straight through the office roads are always under construction so many edits by it is nice we don't I'm sure it would be nice one day maybe today's the day and I'm sure all fixed right someone said we should go live with the whole crew we can think that happen one day a job and we're all together yeah speaking of which Laurie says where's Robert Langdon our keys in his lair Robert is doing Roberts thing he's everything he's running this and run in that paper counting for this and that and you know gonna have Robert and every business cuz all the half twos I'm not the happy guy I'm the what if God hey what if we do this yeah we got bills pay we'd have to do that that's why they make a good pair made in a memory Lori our online sales girl says the Drake branch cabin is actually rebuilt on an estate in Charlottesville Virginia just down the street perfect pretty it's not thank you so far away from home because that's probably about a hour and a half two hours from where we get that's pretty cool look that we have to follow that one yeah it's gonna be cool other than that just just kind of doing the day two days here guys we'll be shooting a little bit downtown tomorrow yeah enough we got two more episodes to go after tomorrow and I'd love to do something close by because we're kind of restricted a little bit at the end of its season with biting and you know how far we can travel so you guys hang out there you know within like a two hour radius of Roanoke or maybe maybe three hour radius I'll be generous and let us know what you got because that's how we find all of our stuff is word of mouth and through the internet and just you know we don't we don't have to do a lot of gumshoe the old folks out there understand what gumshoe is that's detective work because everybody brings it to us now but we're always looking for good stuff well you didn't you never gumshoe before I'm full of old classic I don't know if it's from you or what googly one thing about it now you can do a gumshoe me from the 1890s yoshu is a phrase no longer use detective gumshoe I don't know why they call gumshoe maybe I mean everything from gumption or Gumtree which is the Craigslist in Australia well and I hear that the the Mike dictionary is coming out soon yeah Mike isms there's one for every letter of the armor not safe it's like archeology when it's gone it's gone you know grab this history you know I'm the history it needs to live on there's no doubt about that are you this that's right so you got to download all this I'm gonna go say knowledge but there's other things you can call it that's how that's how I get all my idea that it's gonna smack one side and it comes out the end that's what we're talking about this bravo charlie he's got one that's this is Mike's version of it which is his words his um don't shoot I'm sure Humber's yeah I'm you know the stay tuned guys it's gonna be it's you know and then you can watch the show and then it comes up with one of those words we don't have to do one of those pop ups you know where's Mike means this spin with the gum chief and they will come up with old cartoons like fractured fairy tales and you know that kind of stuff they're you know we had a flying squirrel in couple weeks ago and so we channeled rocky with rocky and bullwinkle you know so it's old stuff guys someone's got to compile you got a lot of compiling it's when it's when cartoons were cartoons I think the only reason I know any these old cartoon references because I've been around you and Robert and Ted forever and I just you absorb them and now I've found acknowledge I know it's funny I just don't know why I mean because I never saw but that's how time works everybody things happen and the people around those things when they happen enjoy them and then the people that come later when they're not happening anymore have to just listen to the people that were there when they happen we're gonna kind of go back to a high point here in October we're going to take take some of the savage down to circle office building and that will kind of let us know where we are and this is for the trade but we're gonna kind of reintroduce our skills back to the the world furniture market with things we're doing and and the potential of creating our line again so anyway that's just kind of new FY but is do first I'm hearing oh yeah and hopefully we're going to get the trolley back on on the road and be right running around Roanoke and we'll have it down hopefully with having time for the market will be down there but if you haven't seen the trolley I know we don't have any pictures of it at the moment but it's a black trolley yeah the wedding right there so we have that's something that's new been around for a while and it's coming off the back lot gonna get I'll explain this pictures later yeah and keep everything well I do have a whole itinerary I gotta get know the trolleys cool and it's got a black dog all over it and it's beats probably twenty five thirty and uh it's got a barter back you got places to shove people to now so we'll see if we can get it moving got the dog bowl got the warehouse we got potential beer location downtown that we're working on collaborating with yeah I'll show a secret secret coming soon top secret um there was one thing I wanted to say I was validated in Ohio's roads by way he's someone come like you're exactly right the Grayson cut her hair I believe she did like are you for sale too and if so is there a return policy negative look behind our counter all sales are final you can repurpose the few times I've been told Mike you're old school says Eugene McPhatter is a metric I I study see I'm trying to trying to stay glued to y'all's comments here I should do better job at that when are you on the DL I mean just inundated with questions about when the shows coming back we still don't know we won't know until we know and though as soon as we know the first half of the season is ordered to deliver to network so they're probably planning on putting it up pretty soon I'm assuming maybe in the next month or so and then of course we'll finish up the season here by the end of October but it's all a mystery to us how and when it's booked or program and wish we had a little more influence on that cuz you he's seeing savage dogs every day all day nothing else on TV but us stay tuned to our YouTube channel because we try to generate as much content as you can in the meantime for you guys to see what we're up to so hopefully that's fun and we're thinking about thinking about a blog I'm not a blog a podcast we've been kicking around for a while so we're gonna start now put something like that together if you can't get enough of us here we can be able to listen to us on the road we all yet so it's gonna be fun fun you know they always excited I've salvaged that I like dog tales that was your vision that key I like that one yeah a little back to gumshoes susan mcfarland says bum shoes were original sneakers or tennis shoes it did originated in the 1800s when souls of shoe soles were made of rubber and detectives could sneak around quiet Genki the sneaky virgin but Michael the saws-all would not acquire that part of anything I'm and you know I'm coming yeah like that scene from The Iron Giant when he's coming through the trees and all the trees are moving so yeah the exciting stuff the podcast is the new thing we got a lot of new things are trying to work out but it's gonna be all centralized around what you guys already like which is definitely the show yeah I mentioned the dog bowl I guess yes so that's actually first you've dug hair neatly into my shadow itinerary yes so here are some photos from the last event at the dog bowl this way this is there's you and Robert in front of the e and a few other I don't think so I'm not sure I just grabbed random photos but if you guys didn't see or hear about the dog well show last month this is what it looked like early on in the evening it got more packed out later but growing up I've had a ton of events going on this weekend people hanging on the parking lot they're everywhere yeah so we got another one coming up October 12 a week from Saturday sorry October 12 September 28th the floorboards will be planned this was fuzzy lot was e logic last month here's everybody checking out the show shout out to Kevin Hurley for the photos love these but yeah sorry I got all twisted

Haas to dig yourself out of this all you gotta bring some local you know smaller names and bands just to come and entertain for the afternoon this is this Saturday possibly this Saturday definitely Tucker Rojas and forget some hopefully Saturday believers by the way their permit exactly so we're gonna start putting some of that together cuz things are changing here we want you guys to come obviously everybody out there in the world comments may be a little bit expensive to come from Ireland the point is were trying to make Saturday shopping a bit more of an event a bit more of an experience it's fun here on Saturdays we usually we usually have food trucks or somebody coming by but now that we have the dog bowl we're thinking about having solo artist singer-songwriter small groups that one exposure want to come practice I say practice you know do they want to come perform for what you tends to be a pretty big amount foot traffic on Saturdays so contact us email us at info at Black Dog salvage comm if you're interested in coming to play on the dog bowl on Saturdays we wanted to do a weekly thing we wanted to become more of a shopping experience and that's what he was trying to get at that exactly see it's just interpretation yeah and we're putting together a vent calendar you'll be able to access on our website that can kind of keep up to date with what's happening a black dog on any given day we just want your we want your input tell us tell us what would bring you guys out and what you would like to see and do our best but you come and see what we

lot of subtleties but doesn't matter how you do it just call Tracy just subscribe to our YouTube channel thanks Tracy no pressure well since you're still here will do I've called some fan comments so Janet Kern says I want a shirt where by and she even threw in an upside down question mark because she needs to know or she's Spanish and meant to put it in the front do you buy a shirt here or shop Black Dog salvage calm ya can buy these bad boys you can't buy this shirt for Mountain khaki yeah and I suppose you could get it stamped with black dog but these were custom yeah we sell these these are those is sort of yeah they're like kind of straight I already feel like letting you remember to wear that shirt no we did not read either we're just that in sync as wife live show yeah we should Tony Ruggiero says plead add captioning to your videos Thanks Oh interesting I appreciate you saying this and I know the deaf community specifically would love to have captions on the videos but also people watch these videos sometimes without clicking on them and opening the audio these live videos I genuinely don't know how to add captioning in real time I don't think it can be done in real time and if you know how to do it retro actively after the video is now saved on our Facebook profile give me a shout out give us a message if you know how to do that I'm genuinely curious to do that yeah I think I bet there's men do it on on Facebook if you upload the video specifically as a direct upload but these are different Facebook live videos don't get uploaded directly they do but it's automated so I'll look into that but I appreciate you saying that and the answer is I don't know how to do it yet but I will figure it out because we want everybody to participate I thought this was cool a sweet recommendation on Facebook from Flip Brooks which is kind of a cool name just a lot of almost anything you might want for an older home like ours it's great that's what our business started looking first and we're still doing it that's our that's our meat potatoes we call it smells right hello Salvage is what we and we've done a lot of other stuff obviously with furniture and other things but that's our that's our staple later Robert is that you out there buddy I think that Cindy said hey buddy you still look or anybody looking good keep up the creative work yeah that's Navy buddy of mine we Robin we cavorted out in the Philippines and the western Pacific together back when we were serving in the late 70s and could see man you're looking good he taught me how to well that's no that's not Robin Clark cause problems later oh yeah Robin Clark's different guy yeah another guy but Robin Slater okay he's not everybody Minds cool right now get too dirty thanks for watching okay come see us let me know you're back in town another one was Keith Berkley left a recommendation says awesome place super friendly people love the TV show but the in-person experience is even more impressive that's a good button appreciate the shirt yeah that's a great preciate the shoutout Keith that is true I actually hear that from a lot of people when they come see us as that they had no idea was this big they had no idea there was this much stuff you can look behind us this is just one area of one of my house yeah and we're here most of the time guys one of us is usually around and you know zone but we love meeting you guys we love telling stories hearing your stories it's just part of the experience that we want people to come in you know and we always say we put the real back in reality because what we grew one of the most real shows out there and the barnwood builders yes there's a few good people keep saying that me and Johnny Jett need to have an operator off and so down I just want to meet the guy I've never met the guy really cool I'm open to it I've just got it you know well we call that like a pickoff or a fork off or a for coffee a rip off yeah work off there this I thought was an interesting question from Kimberly Kaufman where can you find weather boarding for the side of a house I'm not a hundred percent sure what she's talking about you're just inside I wouldn't talk about what siding or they call it shiplap they make it still milled you can go to any lumber company and have it and purchase it or you can reclaim it from other houses we don't take a lot of that off because cause it's there's not a big call for it we're more into barn side and wood that we can use the Turner's as far as a house siding and lap siding and things which are maybe you're referring to probably one of the best way to do it it is still made today and it's made in composites too so it makes a lot for me it has a good look don't get me wrong it's it's it's a good look and that's one way again we we have some reclaimed stuff but if you're doing a whole house it's not likely that we sew it but if you want a whole house I mean we have access to them we just don't take that off because it takes up a lot of space we don't have much all right if you're wanting something like this say I want to build a fuzzy house and size-wise that I want authentic shiplap siding yeah we'll take it down for you we have a wanted list I'm shocked that for things like that so definitely email us just I guess info at Black Dog salvage comm right let's see someone said for the for the deaf community we can have an ASL person oh my god I wish I maybe I should train you know what you're the guy with the hey I'm the guy with the hand I talk with my hands but I don't actually talk right Norman Warne asks Mike would you sell your hat absolutely it's a navy suit yeah you can see there's genuine sweat stains rather dress got a little DNA on it so yeah use it wisely yeah I got this Armed Services site that sells maybe army marine cos guard gear yeah if you want one I mean I'm playing a box to the teeth no big deal call call today I'll get another one yeah Borman Warren asks my friend has this was an older comment has some windows that he got from someone that was from the 18th from 1829 right it is a big pane window he's asking what he could do with it don't give it here I'll break it I mean that's the first thing I mean what you can do with it if it's wavy glasses and commodity value of weighty glass I put a big pain like that is it's got break all over it so you be careful with it market it as that kind of glass people are looking for it but I'll go through you know 10 square feet of glass to get one square foot good and because it's so brittle but that's about it unless there's got some architectural value to it like really interesting Mulligan patterns and right that's a way to just hang it up on the wall or make sure there's a room divided or something that can be you know people walk in and say hmm Lord somebody SR Wow somebody asked Grayson your sunglasses are for sale yo what's going on everything is for sale everything by the dog is your dogs okay and that is a I mean that's with one of our staples for a long time did a t-shirt yeah that's right everything's for sale but the gun yeah well you just keeps going he's going on one thing before you and I'm recently we try this at the warehouse with a window if you are sure you don't want to use it the window again they have a spray it's like a literally a spray-on mirror and it works pretty well and especially you could spray it on the back and it takes a couple layers and you have to make sure the glass is really clean and the wavy glass it might look kind of cool like antique do it let us know did it work we've got it the warehouse yeah there you have your reaping that's what you can do like with your 18:29 1 million or chalkboard paint why happy Cathy right says wise old glass wait I think it's poured lathe yeah it's not machine may hate it and as it solidifies that this is something probably crazy my daughter couldn't throw the answer for us I think I've heard of a thing called float glass where it's sort of floated across a sort of medium yeah and then as it cools it doesn't cool immediately where itself levels and that's a very good question we're gonna get to the bottom on the next episode that's right I think it was because of a few different processes yeah obviously blowing glass results in imperfect glass I'm looking it up right now actually but glass is also a permanent liquid so it's strong ways to sag over time detect it's actually a liquid look yeah still barely a liquid yeah it'll continue to move this time I'm sure we're gonna get something like MIT to call us up and let us know that's great good question we'll find out for you Victoria longsword says love Suzy Whitesides your wife my mother's paintings no you buy them online email email us yeah we'll make happen shift some of my canvases before and she does uh Commission's to so she's a color whiz when it comes to yeah oh I'll color all the time it's

now there's stuff every weekend it's it's got a good vibe you got one of the best outdoor cycling areas in the country yeah here for sure got a river we got what we got blacked out a little self promotion is ratiza CLE located in between all the things you wanted all roads lead the back black dogs I always say can you think about except the ones that don't they did it connects up that's true all roads are technically connected yeah well that's probably a thank you guys for joining us on Wednesday live hope you guys still like this this is fun to do we usually have about 100 150 washings so thank you for the support get to know each other a little bit better I'm trying to let me know if it's annoying that I keep looking at my phone but I also want to stay plugged into what you guys are asking and commenting on so we don't have a tell a big prompter once there's actually a budget for broadcasting equipment and then maybe we'll have one we Dan will go for will go for right now lift dark Studios is just donating all their well there's a bunch of sweet yeah alright guys well thank you see you dog Balto September 8 how much weekend tacos Rojas this weekend I will be at this dog bull show to come out say hi give me a high five and take a selfie and the floor boards are gonna rock out so I'm sure some other things but I thank you to those that already subscribe to the YouTube channel stay tuned there for more video content like this like the show it's all in the same realm of who we are and what we do so see you there okay everybody see you guys", "bLy2Bk5pYpU": "I'm in Roanoke Virginia I drove by this place is on the left and I said oh my goodness Black Dog salvage that's the place from the TV show Salvage Dawgs [Music] my wife and I watched one season of this on Netflix about a year ago the first thing I noticed is this telltale rocket I remember them buying that rocket in one of the shows this place is huge they have some great tables check out these live-edge wood tables and these are all table slabs [Music] look at these things that's one thing my family needs is a gigantic new dining room table this is an old shuffleboard table this is pretty cool it's an old elevator car if you lived in a palatial estate you can plop one of these right in the middle of your living room here's an old Griswold skillet of course Griswold cast-iron skillets these are made in Erie Pennsylvania the factory the foundry is long gone but that's where I grew up they have episodes of their show playing on TVs throughout the shop they even have their own low code cast-iron skillets let me tell you what these things are dense these are much heavier than other brands Wow this little guy is kind of cute check out this flatware [Music] the room of doors I remember seeing an episode where they came in here looking for doors hundreds upon hundreds of doors these are really cool old barn doors and still more doors growing up we had a clawfoot bathtub in our house we had three boys one bathroom no shower old brass hinges and doorknobs [Music] we saw it on Netflix but right now apparently you can catch it Sundays 9 p.m. on the DIY Network that's it from Black Dog salvage and your Roanoke Virginia I need to get over to Walmart Supercenter and they even got myself a t-shirt [Music]", "fY5G4CkezNk": "hi grant from black dog cat i want to introduce you to a boat that's just come out of hot work just about to go for its maiden voyage we don't do that many of these boats the 545 is our most popular size but the 545 cuddy is the most popular model because it fits in people's driveways and their sheds and their carport 545 hard top quite a small boat to have a hard top you know there's not many boats under six metres have a hard top a functioning hard top so we have five four five we've put a hard top on and um i reckon looks bloody brilliant come and have a bit of a walk through before we jump up in the boat we'll just go over the normal features we have on our boats black dog cat custom aluminium trailer built specifically for this boat you'll never launch a boat or retrieve a boat as easy as one on one of our black dog custom aluminium trailers so now tightened it catch and release system is just brilliant toes will launch as well retrieves well looks well good trailer okay the bow rail on the 545 cutting possibly for aesthetics thing but it's at the right height when you've got it on the beach or on the trailer really with cleats midship any of these so we can put them wherever you like just if you're tying it at the dock you have a cleat midship and a cleat aft and you can have full control of your boat now we start to get into the business end of this boat here father and son do a lot of fishing um and they come to us with quite a big spec sheet so they wanted a rail on the outside of the boat and this rail on the outside of the boat has a multitude of functions or not it's not just for hanging on to it's um stops the boat or the pontoons hitting the dock um inside the boat when you're jigging you have a bit of pressure you can hang on to it it makes a comfortable place to put your back side and really it's an option that costs nothing it just works when our chair at reality that little rail along here is just really good it works come around the back of the boat right here bit more innovation on this boat look we'd be killed if we said we don't look at what works on other boats we put a cage on the back of this boat so the cage is there for basically when you're snapper fishing uh you know you're live bait fishing uh you can actually get in the boat have a look how big this this cage makes this boat look at that up the middle of your thighs if you're out here having a bit of a jig a bit of a fish the back of the boat the transit basically stays dry makes a huge amount of extra room inside the boat so the cage is an optional extra on all of our models now it doesn't cost that much to build it's actually only a little bit of aluminium pipe really works coming through the boat so on this little beauty the 545 in hardtop we have a oversized walkthrough transom probably the biggest walkthrough on a boat of this size live bait tank fully plumbed with a light we were talking about the about the bar over here it happened to be sitting down and just actually conversing it's brilliant you'd be sitting here on a fish you know taking a bit of a drag and you've actually got something a bit more to lean on this will be a feature we use in most of our boats okay let's start the real business then actually before we do that we'll go down here so twin batteries fuel water separator really really accessible isolation switch right there simple everything's out of the way not going to get damaged there standard belch pump all our cats will be underfloor tanks have a tank on each side 75 liters each side so it's 150 liters fuel you actually fill them independently so you fill each tank and they actually suck together so you fill this tank fill the other side check and they both have the line go to the fuel filter it works brilliantly when we designed the 545 hard top we did so in conduct in conjunction with another one great fair we get all the windows of all of our boats made by cmak aluminium and fonga a that's cmac aluminium and wongare bonnie and sometimes sheamus have come up with some really good designs so they shortened our windows and just made sure they weren't too heavy so our hard top redesign it and the windows are designed and created by c-mac aluminium and pony our good blokes craig and mike who own this boat have said to us we don't want to stay awake in this boat but we want the ability to have a little bit of a snooze and stay the occasional night it's a 5.45 metre boat so we put a little bunk extension have a look at this now i'm not the biggest chap around luke as you know but there's actually enough room to spread out and full up the front of the 545 hardtop we simply put a bunk extension in place makes a big boat out of a little bit gone with the garmin gear the garmin gear is really easy to use it's our choice of gear at the moment i find it full of features and i find the features really easy to get to you don't have to go through lots and lots of menus so the garmin gear we use we use the vhf radios and we choose to use their plotters and their sounders of course wouldn't be a boat if we didn't have a drum winch in it so we have the the drum wrench on this particular occasion just brilliant so this is the sev winch sev winch from australia another company that gives us outstanding service okay let's go into the fishability of this boat luke we have rod holders three on each side we have six up in the rocket launcher look at the room we have a 5.45 metre hard top boat there's a lot of six meter boats loot six and a bit meter boats don't have as much room as this boat here so um this hull is hole number 320 uh hell number 320 for us a very good model um and probably the kudata we forgot to mention the mighty yamaha the yamaha and 115 horsepower is one of the lightest engines in its category this is a 1.8 liter four-cylinder engine the yamaha f115 it's an ideal choice for this motor because of the weight it's quite a lot lighter and the grunt is particularly good so um we're looking forward to throwing this boat the water go for a ride you care i'm watching and we'll show you some more one of the great features of all of our boats is how tight they can turn you have a look at this we're going to do a couple of 360s in different directions have a look at this that's a couple of fights to fight figure eights if you're looking for a hat or something like that or someone's falling overboard or you need to turn in a real hurry the functionality of the kit is just second to none i'm just going to go over here whilst there's only two of us on board we've gone from having one of us on to two on let's go over this side of the boat luke it's pretty bloody snotty out in the wongary harbour today but it doesn't even move it doesn't even move we have 12 to 15 knots of breeze here and the boat just sits there great little boat", "xKneD8WPX5s": "[Music] hey there's not a scratch on it that's what I'm here for this thing's amazing it's beautiful you know it just represents a lot of work my arms are tired just think about what I already tell us about what you got here well we got to the work platform that's you guys size-wise you wanted and we made them so the doors overlap right you got air electricity right and then your front decks will lift up right here to back you got more safety smaller yes so you go in down or side on or full empty pot

there [Music]", "eHJ1A6umYME": "hye everyone nate from growershouse and its\nbeen a long day over here. the monsoons came in thru tucson and we only lost power twice\ntoday. it was a good day. And then something unexpected happened. these came in so this is what showed up at our door. the\nnew prototypes for the black dog led phytomax leds and these are the new four models that\nare going to replace (potentially) the models that black dog currently has the universal\nseries. this is the 800 watt unit, the 600 watt unit,\nthe 400 and 200 watt unit. so essentially black dog had some out with their third iteration\nof the Phyto-Genesis spectrum that they originally created the last one was the Universal Series now they are at the phyto max series.\nThese have just come out. it put a smile on my face when thse came in because now we\nget to test them. so i asked black dog as soon as they came in \"What is the deal with these new lights? Why did you guys make\na new light? whats different about it?\" So what they told me was they actually redesigned\nthis light to be lighter than the last series. they made minor iterations to their spectrum\nto make it slightly improved over the last model. Which still include alot of UV/IR infrared spectrum\n(365750NM) which alot of LEDs dont. We are going to put these under our spectrometer\nand see some of that but it is important to note that if you are putting a PAR meter under\nthese lights that the UV/IR is in part of the spectrums that PAR meters cant read. This\npart of the spectra for UV/IR wont be seen because it isnt within the standard 400-700\nnanometer range for visible light. but what UV/IR does for plants is increase your plants\noverall potency and compactness and quality. so alot of people are demanding that their\nled lights have UV spectrum in them. As this industry is progressing and maturing, it really\ncomes down to who can grow the best wuality plants. and that is what these spectrums outside\nof your standard general reds, whites, and blues do. We are excited to get these in to test and\nsee how they stack up to other LEDs in the market since the last time we their new universal\nseries probbably about two years ago. So one last thing to go voer before we jump\ninto it when comparing these lights to other ones, its important to note there is a difference\nbetween what some LED companies call, theyll call themselves a \"1000\" or a \"500\" but sometimes\ntheir actual draw at the wall for maybe their 1000 is 682 watts at the wall its important\nthat when you think of leds and you are refernceing a number that the led company gives you, you\nare thinking about it in terms of what is it actually drawing from the wall. that is\ntruely how many watts you are going to be paying for. with your kiowatt hour and your\nelectricity bill. but at the same time really that is the best indicator of how much light\nyou are going to get out of that unit. so what balck dog does is their 800 unit draws\n800 watts at the wall, and the 600, 400, and 200 going down the line. some companies youll\nnote even california light works, their 880 is a little lower than 880 watts so they are\nactualy doing the multiples of how many led diodes there are times the wattage. but keep\nin mind, not alll 5 watt diodes actually operate at 5 wats, they operate at less than. so always\nthink of untis in terms of their acutal drw at the wall i rhink its very imporatant for\nall growers, especially those looking into purchasing an LED, so you can compare what\ni call \"apples to apples\" so other than that were excited to test these, so lets check\nit out. So here is the black dog led phytomax 800\nspectrum and you can see its peaks around chlorophyll a and b the blues and the reds\na little more intensity in the reds. make sure youve got a little bit more penetration\nand spectrum for the flowering plants. another thing that we noticed with this spectral graph\nis that there is the uv a bump that you can all the way to the left and now i want to\note going over to these pr charts now at 12, 24, and 36 inches above the canopy. that uv\nand ir intensity of spectrum is not going to show up in these par numbers here essentially\nbecause it is outside the wavelegth range that the par meter measures, so there is some\nintensity out of this light that is not accounted for in the par chart you see here. you can\nsee how it maps out the par intensity over the 5 x 5footprint. i think that for flowering\nyoure going to have the light probably hung closer than 24 inches above your plants were\nwhen you are veg-ing you be at 36 inches above your plants. seeing the UV bump in this light\nreally prompted us to really do a test on all our lights in the industry that have UV/IR\nor claim that they have UV. So keep your eyes peeled for that coming out soon and i hope\nthat this information helps you, you know map out your grow room and choose the best\nlight for your particular grow space. this is nate from growershouse and happy growing!", "C7PkevjmqS0": "I'm starting by ripping 2-inch pieces out of a slab of walnut that will eventually become the trim around the top and bottom shelf next I use our table saw to create a rabbet joint in these pieces this is done by making a cut in one side of the board and then turning it 90 degrees and making a cut in the other side next I cut the main body of the shells at a 3/4 inch plywood using a chop saw I began to cut the 45-degree miners that the trim pieces need in order to fit around the body of the shell when cutting the second fighter I usually cut it a little bit long in order to get the fit exactly sometimes there's a little leftover material here I'm using the wood chisel I just keep repeating the process until the entire shelf is here I'm using the drops when I cut the trim for the top shelf to cut the trip for the bottom the process is the same as before cut the first miter measure and Mark the second and cut it a little bit long to make it fit once both the tops about itself concluded and metal together as an orbital sander to smooth out the joints and the rest of the surface once the rough sanding is done I used some wood filler to fill the small cracks that I have in the joints once the filler dries I can sand it smooth next I stain the shelves using dark walnut wood stain I then carry the shelves over to our painting areas and cochin with a satin finish we made the legs next door on our medal shot here they're getting sprayed a satin black next it's assembly we had a piece of glass cut at burn-up glass and it drops right in the top you", "8BE4lQynfzo": "hi guys is art for name are you calm today we've got this awesome box that arrived in the mail today from MRE Nation don't know what's inside we didn't order anything I don't hear any ticking so let's go ahead and open it up and we'll see what we have inside we're gonna be using the world's smallest knife this is in our kit store the story behind this is several months ago Black Dog Bob asked us to help him on a project we did and I think this is his way of thanking us let me get this laid out and I'll show you what we have and this was what's in the box first of all we'll start off the MRE nation mug have an alcohol-free bacterial wipe hot chocolate drink regular flavor package of Grande three-in-one coffee package at Nescafe three in one package of Russian sugar a package of milk sugar only or otherwise known as sweetened condensed milk package of Russian tea are you - Russian coffee package of digestive biscuits strong mint it says sugar-free gum a p6 gum and we have this awesome mug next thing we have looks like there's some chocolate bars in here first chocolate bar is the Atlantic chocolate then we have Romney's Kendal mint cake here we have a package of milk boy Swiss chocolate here we have a 50 gram chocolate ration and here we have a Russian chocolate bar sorry about that guys with all that chocolate that black dog Bob with amore nation sent us man I had to stop I had to eat some of the chocolate let's see what the rations the black dog Bob from MRE nation sent us and this one is very heavy this is a minion number 10 a chicken gumbo if I had to guess this thing weighs probably 2 pounds and then we have another one here a minion number 9 a curry chicken and this one is very heavy also and can't wait to get into this one and these are the other three rations that black dog Bob sent us so are you ready for this look at that pepperoni pizza menu number one would bully the logo on the MRE check that out and Bob black dog Bob amore Nations sent us three of them menu number one pepperoni pizza apple and spice sauce garlic mashed potatoes Chocolate Chunk cookies crackers peanut butter fruit punch drink flameless ration heater hot beverage bag accessory kick and a spoon the special date is December of 2022 wow this is awesome and we can't think Black Dog Bob enough wasn't expecting this but man here it is Christmas in April so Thank You Black Dog Bob and Maury nation certainly appreciate it can't wait to review these and if you'd like to get your fresh ration you get yours at MRE nation.com five zero two six eight two four three eight eight so give up Black Dog Bob a try we've ordered one of his build your own excellent fast shipping and thank you very much that's gonna be it guys thanks for watching have a good day [Music]", "ChRDunQoD0I": "I\u2019m from Roanoke. I grew up here, born and raised, and I moved away when I went to Appalachian State. So, that was four years away in a place that felt like home. It had a lot of the same vibe that Roanoke does, and that was one of the things that drew me to Appalachian in the first place. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be in Roanoke as long as I have, but I\u2019ve found this awesome job at Black Dog, so here I am. So, Black Dog Salvage is an architectural salvage company, which means we go out into the field when buildings are condemned schools, houses, churches, we\u2019ve done a jail, we\u2019ve done amusement parks, I mean, you name it. The weirder the better. We go in and take the reusable architecture and we bring it back here and we sell it either to be reused. as a door, for example, again, or we might re-purpose that door into another piece of furniture. We\u2019ve got a custom shop downstairs, a metal shop and wood shop. But you\u2019ll see light fixtures from all sorts of time periods hanging everywhere. Obviously a ton of woodwork, tiles, sinks, clawfoot tubs, stained glass, garden statuary, fountains, crazy whimsical things from an amusement park. You know, many stories. It\u2019s really fascinating how the show has progressed and how people have I mean, literally, from the U.S. are coming to see us. And when I started there was only like 10 or 11 people, and now we\u2019re about 31. You know, we hired her to work, and she turned out to be great at work and great on TV too, so it was a fortunate hire. It\u2019s been fun to watch her grow, because from the first time she was on TV real scared, and not knowing what to say, and now she\u2019s You can\u2019t shut her up. I\u2019m camera shy, so being on the show for me, at the beginning, was a bit nerve racking, and I was so nervous about being this girl in the field. You know, I didn\u2019t want to seem helpless or weak. Once I got a sense of what we were doing and how to do it, I realized that like it didn\u2019t matter if I was female or male or whatever I\u2019m going to do it my way, and that\u2019s okay. I mean we have our own ways of doing things, and our own viewpoint, it\u2019s all a balance, right? The Yin and Yang. I started school in 2007, and I thought I was going to study Geology, and I\u2019m taking courses and I\u2019m loving it, and about two years in, I realize I don\u2019t want to be a geologist. So. I started looking around for other majors, and at the time, Sustainable Development had just become a major option at Appalachian. I thought to myself, what was the most important thing to me, and that was the next generation. And the whole foundation of Sustainable Development is being able to develop so that the current generation\u2019s needs are met, without compromising the needs of the next generation. And what, really, is more important than that? You know, I mean, being a steward of that kind of responsibility, I think, is really important, and an honor. So, for Black Dog, I go out in the field when we have a salvage job, and I\u2019m actually getting in the dirt and grime and taking apart things, and it\u2019s so much fun. But when I\u2019m not in the field, I\u2019m here, either working at the front counter, selling salvage, or organizing the salvage jobs. I\u2019m helping to vet the emails that we get. Grayson really is on the front end of most of our projects - in other words, she is the gatekeeper. She gets the first look when somebody calls up and says, \u201chey, I\u2019ve got this\u2026\u201d I sort of feel like the guys are there to do the work, and do the job, and I am too, but I also have a little bit more patience, I think, with the owner who has this emotional attachment to what we\u2019re ripping apart. And usually, it\u2019s something very personal, like someone\u2019s home, someone\u2019s grandparents\u2019 home, their great grandmother or grandfather built this place, it\u2019s a farmstead, it\u2019s been in the family\u2026 It\u2019s very emotional to see it go. It\u2019s a destructive process that we\u2019re in. It\u2019s kind of like, it\u2019s kind of tough to watch sometimes, so we have to ease the edges a little bit. You have to be sensitive - you\u2019re dealing with people\u2019s lives that are history. You know, we\u2019re taking something down that\u2019s connected to the community and/or individuals, and you have to be respectful of that. And Grayson really helps us - I mean, Robert and I have done it for years, and Grayson does that too, but she does it with her personality and we\u2019re all sympathetic to the history. And you have to be She just does it better. Yeah, okay, I was trying to skirt around that, but it\u2019s pretty obvious. I love listening to their stories and their history. There\u2019s always a story. And so, I get to talk to them face-to-face, and comfort them, knowing that this stuff is being respected, and we really appreciate it, but they are almost tearing up when they know it\u2019s going to live on in another way, another form, just get reused. They\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t care what happens to it, as long as I know it\u2019s not being burned or being put in a landfill.\u201d They are worldly things, but they have sentimental value, I think. Save what you can. Well, our business is, in its core, is recycling. So the sustainability is reuse - that\u2019s one of the components of that particular genre, is don\u2019t throw it away. Figure out how you can capture the energy that was put into that particular piece - for what it was intended to be, or for an upcycling job, because that energy, once it\u2019s thrown away, is lost. And that, really in its core, is sustainability. One of the conversations I had with her about her degree - that was one of the things she said it was really about, was not only, \u201chey, let\u2019s just recycle,\u201d it\u2019s much deeper than that, and it's based on the fact that the only way that kind of effort can be sustained is for people to be sustained by it. It\u2019s got to make a living. Just out there saying you\u2019re going to do it is one thing, but making it a lifestyle, a way of making a living, then that becomes sustainable in its own right. It\u2019s got momentum, it\u2019s got the ability to provide salaries, and livelihoods for the people involved in all the insularly things that are happening around it. One of the main principles, the main principle, probably, of sustainable development is the emphasis on social equity, environment, and economics. And what I do here at Black Dog is, we are working in a business, so obviously our aim is to make a profit. But we also are salvaging reusable and re-purposing architecture, and keeping that out of our waste streams. You know, things that would have ended up being in the burn pile or landfill, essentially. So, it feels right to be working somewhere where I\u2019m kind of contributing to that social change. Yeah, I feel good about what I\u2019m doing, and I believe in the work that we do.", "sCsPmshuxfM": "black dog one day a black dog came to visit the hope family mr. hope was the first to see it my goodness he cried dropping his toast he didn't waste any time in calling the police there's a black dog the size of a tiger outside my house he told the policeman the policeman laughed what should I do asked mr. hope don't go outside so the policeman and put down the phone mrs.

[Music] well as you can tell Dina was fraught it was excited to be there look at that light that is a huge disk light and the big ol bicycle eyes somebody had a big imagination for that this table is pretty awesome-looking and some of these things are just thought of outside the box most people wouldn't think about it but these guys have a lot of talent and the things that they come up with the things that they find and that will for instance its tall is just taller than I am this table was made out of doors this table was made out of goers doors I mean the kind you shut and open and we're coming up here on some live edge the air right there that's live Edgewood very expensive but it's beautiful and let's kind of look around see what you see if you can see anything that you may have seen on TV [Music] which moved outside I would take a look around out here and I think you're gonna see some very interesting things a lot of the stuff I don't know what it is but seems to be something for just about every occasion that guy for instance I mean if people would need one of those but if you do they got it and some of the just kind of look at it as we pan through some of this stuff just look at it it's I don't even know what it is most of it barber chair any of this other stuff is but you see something you like you might want to get in touch with these guys they have got at least one that seems like of everything have a look [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] well as you can see that was quite a best stuff in there that you don't see every day now we're going around the corner here there's a house here that I know they saw some episodes where they had been working on this house and if I'm wrong and a lot of times I probably am but I think they rent this house out as like a bed-and-breakfast because they were doing a lot of decorating on the inside and a couple episodes as we watched previously this year so I don't really have any information for you on that so if there's something you'd be interested in on this about anyone we could ask and so you know just if you're interested in maybe staying in Roanoke and if this is an actually any bed-and-breakfast there's some information right there and so called Black Dog and see what they say about it well this has been fun I hope you've enjoyed it if you did I appreciate you leaving us a comment maybe hitting the light button especially subscribe to the challengers we use all the help we can get on that we're a new channel and we're trying to grow and so any help that you can get would appreciate it our next stop is Washington DC we're going to the Bible Museum and also from there also we will be doing Arlington Cemetery so hopefully we'll have something else and you're shortly that will be of interest to you again thanks for watching and see you soon [Music]", "Hc2v-FknnZ0": "it is sooner to kill the black dog because it is a devil the messenger of allah said if it were not that dogs were a part of a nation among the nations then i would order that all of them be killed so kill every one of them that is all black jamia tirmidhi great her son is um [Music] um [Music] um [Laughter] my father that's what make you say i really come back but have a good time i'll smell my little yawn i'll be going this back complained about it and the prophet saw sm did not keep any dogs in the house after that sahih muslim 55 11 it was narrated that aisha said gabriel supposedly the angel gabriel promised to come to the messenger of allah at a certain hour and that time came but he did not arrive he the messenger had a stick in his hand which he threw down and said allah does not break his promise and neither do his messengers then he turned and saw a puppy beneath a bed he said oh aisha when did this dog get in here she said by allah i do not know he ordered that it be taken out and gabriel came the messenger of allah said you made an appointment with me and i waited for you but you did not come he said i was prevented by the dog that was in your house we do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image so the archangel gabriel is petrified of puppies and pictures after learning about gabriel's phobias muhammad could have simply been careful to check his house for puppies whenever gabriel was coming over but this is muhammad we're talking about and it just wouldn't be muhammad without an epic bloodbath so the canine carnage began the type of attitude that muslims have towards dogs is completely unacceptable you are not going he is dangerous and i'm not going anywhere oh [Music] hold on [Music] you understand [Music] uh [Music] foreign [Music] [ __ ] um the sahih muslim 4016 it was narrated from ibn umar that the messenger of allah ordered the dogs be killed sahih muslim 4018 it was narrated that abdullah bin umar said the messenger of allah used to order that dogs be killed and i went throughout al medina until we did not spare any dog but we killed it to such an extent that we would even kill the dog of a woman belonging to the desert people yeah so most people get the impression that uh muslims somehow have something against dogs so we need to go back and see where this uh comes from there are some traditions that mention that the prophet peace be upon him ordered dogs to be killed and then he made an exception only for like for the sheep dog or the guard dog um or or the hunting dog but some of muhammad's followers complained because they had dogs for hunting and for herding sheep so muhammad changed his mind sahih muslim 40 21 it was narrated that ibn al-mughafl said the messenger of allah enjoined the killing of dogs then he said what is the problem with them and dogs then he granted a concession with regard to dogs for hunting and herding sheep and a woman a donkey or a black dog then his prayer is void to all kinds of dogs the answer is no it's only for a black dog who is completely black but some dogs were much worse some dogs are the devil sahih muslim 1137 it was narrated from abdullah bin ah summit from abu dharr who said the messenger of allah said when one of you stands to offer prayer he will be screened if he has something in front of him that is like the back of a saddle if he does not have something in front of him that is like the back of a saddle then his prayer will be interrupted if a donkey a woman or a black dog passes in front of him i said oh abu dharr what is the difference between a black dog or a red or yellow dog he said oh son of my brother i asked the messenger of allah the same question and he said the black dog is a devil and why is that um that such a dog is a devil meaning that it is the top in evil among his peers so the prophet described him as a shaytan and we take it as it is but uh if if one were to start with things in order like first we look at the quran to see if the quran says anything about dogs and then we go to the traditions and and we put everything together well the quran actually doesn't say anything negative about dogs in fact there is something positive because in the story of the youth who hid in the cave in the 18th chapter of the quran the 18th chapter we have it that they had a companion a dog and many commentators say that this dog will also be in paradise now we know that nothing impure or unclean will be in paradise [Music] some will say okay but god will make this doll pure so we'll be in paradise on the other hand there is actually a mention in the quran that the food that is procured for muslims through by means of their hunting animals is permissible to to eat this is specifically mentioned in the fourth verse of the fifth chapter of the quran hunting animals they were dogs at the time so come on man quit that thing it is well known that the dog would go hunt the animal bring it back to the um or at least retrieve the animal that may have been killed by a spear or arrow the dog would go retrieve it and bring it so the dog comes with the animal in its mouth something the saliva of the dog is impure but this seems to speak against that because obviously the saliva of the dog gets mingled with the meat which it brings to its master stop it now the meat that they bring in their mouths are good for muslims to to eat obviously after washing and so on as we would treat any other meat so where does this idea come from that dogs somehow impure where did it come from it could be that at the time were some dogs which were rabid and the best way of dealing with that situation to protect the population was to euthanize some some dogs and as the people remember the tradition they just remembered that dogs were euthanized without remembering the reason behind it so it's not mentioned that the dogs were rabid but that would be a good reason why dogs were euthanized otherwise there'd be no good reason [Music] more timeless wisdom about satan from the prophet who said that satan pees in your ears hides in your nose and farts when he hears the call to prayer surah 21 verse 107 of the quran declares that allah sent muhammad as a mercy to all creatures but apparently this doesn't include dogs and it certainly doesn't include black dogs because the color of a dog's fur determines whether it's the devil if you're wondering why muhammad said that black dogs are the devil keep in mind he also said that satan looks like a black man because to remove najasa is just whatever it takes to remove it bye", "0O0xOstahl0": "[Music] [Music] [Music] hey", "M5sQ3rz557Y": "hi graeme from black dog cat we've just got out of hot work um last week to be fair a 5-4-5 that we're going to take to the auckland boat show the first week of october so this is a 5-4-5 cuddy has a few features on it we can do this boat in drive away form with an 80 horsepower honda four-stroke honda a dmw steel trailer for 55 000. so that's fifty five thousand dollars the boat the motor and the trailer this boat has a few extras on it that takes the value of this boat up to seventy thousand dollars so it's got fifteen thousand dollars worth of extras the extras on it are the folding bimini top with rocket launcher the paint on the cutting the black paint on the dash the walk through transom with live bait tank the garmin vhf radio the garmin's 95 sv uh those are the on it's got squabs up the front too so um and the upgrade to the aluminium trailer so you can buy this boat for 55 000 new zealand dollars drive away or 70 with all of those extras come and have a look i'll give you a bit of a walk through when we put the white paint on the on the cutting or on the bonnet of the boat i think it looks great looks really good and on this boat we've painted the dashboard a nice matte color so it does look good and of course it sits on a wonderful custom made black dog aluminium trailer these aluminium trailers are really works of art they tow amazing they look really good and you're launching and retrieving is just out of this world helped by the patented catch and release system basically here it's just works it looks so simple i couldn't even explain it it just works so let's have a walk through this boat the black dog cat five four five cutting of course with black dog cat a mantra is two hulls twice the boat you come for riding it you'll find out why have a look at this for a walk through transit the water on this transom here is probably as big as quite a few eight meter boats it is huge fully plumbed live bait tank with light got a decent lid face is the right way to keep your bait in there cleats underfloor tank 75 litres per side 105 150 liters in total our tanks fill up independently you fill up this side then you fill up the other side and the two tanks come to one one five one filter and it goes into the motor that so two tanks but they suck together they go down at the same rate so what else have we got in this boat this is one we've called the ot transom we actually have a fitted bait board on here normally and it's just how's that for simple two batteries as standard a voltage sensitive relay isolation switch fuel water separator good gear all of our 545s come standard with hydraulic steering twin batteries they're not an extra let's walk through the rest of this boat the pipe seat basis the pipe seat bases have actually proven to be we like these because we put a 105 litre chili bin underneath them providing another seat facing aft a good place to look after your fish your drinks your food a bit of safety gear maybe put an icy kick on where either side of those it's great has the folding bimini top with rocket launcher so this will fold down completely folds backwards into the boat making the top of the windscreen the highest point to get it in a shed and if required we can even come down to the top of the dashboard at 2.1 meters to get it and we can fold the windscreen back make the absolute height of the boat 2.1 meters that should get into most carports okay let's go into the electronics that's with a lot of our boats lately you can have whatever whatever electronics you like we're running the garmin 95 sv in this boat bloody good gear easy to use same price as everything else so the garmin very good gear that's the gauge the honda gauge shows your fuel economy your reef counter your engine management functions it's just really good stuff put the garmin vhf radio one of the features on this boat we've actually gone through the full storage the full storage up the front and we're gonna put a set of squads in here so we don't expect anyone's ever going to sleep for a week in this boat but we're going to put a day cab in there so you know a set of squabs but that's the storage function so this boat as it sits is 70 000 new zealand this boat in basic form drive away with a honda 80 is 55 000 you want to come for a ride in this boat you give me a call it's a demo boats on my yard all the time love to take you for a ride black dog cat two holes twice the boat", "KdgxuMvCEBo": "we try to build boats for the masses that people want to really use them one of the things we get asked a lot of or can

emerald headband so to really factor in and really absorb that blackberry kush two two parenthoods right there an emerald headband two more paranoids right there leading down to black dog's parents that in turn made black dog so we have a big genetic lineage build up there all right and we look through these these are these are feminized seeds from humboldt seed as you can see it's got a very condensed short stout cushy structure which would be the kush from the blackberry kush um very evident and it comes through quite nicely as far as the bud development goes it's not quite far along yet so to get a real um proof or the smell uh would be a little little difficult at this point but it does have uh subtleties to it whereas some of the other ones at that same stage will have a little bit of a stank um again it's it's so ever changing it's hard to nail narrow it down when it's this premature but uh let's have a look at some of one of our bag seeds we have remember blackberry kush emerald headband okay so whereas the last two plants you saw were black dog they were also feminized straight from humble seed very short stout subtle smell cushy structure cushy buildup now we have a bag seat of our blackberry kush with emerald headband and bag seed like like i said in previous videos unlocks that very diverse uh lineage through the ancestry of that of that genetic buildup so when we look at this the blackberry kush it has a very i know obviously you guys can't smell it and that i apologize for that it's not doing it justice however this has a very evident or berry creamsicle almost raspberry in this case we know it's blackberry um uh stank to it the structure is is a total 180 from for from the cushiness uh the even even even the nug structure like the bud buildup is very opposite of cush it's very elongated type trailer park boy donkey dick buds that are going to be forming on it rather than ball ball ball ball ball as per the bali cush type build up um but again just some of the benefits and also could be disasters of starting from backseat or even choosing to grow bag seed is uh you could get some some gems like this with with large diverse genetic builds buildups or you could be getting something uh that sucks ass you know or as a herm or a male but i mean hey if you if you can unlock some some golden phenos such as this i say it's worth the risk",

this is the most intricate and feature filled boat we've ever built it's still a bit of a walk around Black Dog custom built aluminium trailers of box action has our kitchen release easy launch and retrieve system on it here's a bearer letter the paint job on this boat is magnificent the boys at cultural and Ross and Whangarei work really closely with us I've created a paint job on here it's just really really good we're really pleased with it customers of Ag chord it's sledge bloomin good name for one of our black dog cats so a six point seven and close of course behind every good both you need a very good product the customers on this boat have chosen that 250 Honda when VTEC 3.6 litre click 250 is one of the best 250 s I've ever been to see with the roar of it makes it sound like it's a performance engine zip wakes the so cakes are a gyroscopic automatic trim 10 you basically hit Auto and then matter what happens during your boating day the trim tab will automatically go down or come up and alter the trim of the boat automatically you only got to turn it on at the beginning of customers are obviously really into the efficient but they do a bit of open hiding at the barrier lovely live bait tank here really nice hand rows where they should be getting in and out of the boat we tried to actually get in the water ourselves and actually even look at where the handrail should be I think we've got it about right here a really good bait board coloring table at the right right there's nothing worse than filling your catch and begin to low or down to height we've got rod holders everywhere and have a look this is the very first time we've ever done this on one of our boats the Crillon see make it longer a marvelous we just see them we want to enclose they do all of our windows so see Megan father a they do all our windows this is an enclosed cabin absolutely just goes back on the bench it's neither gonna come undone it doesn't rattle gives the boat a real fishing sort of a flare a lot of the time this boats going to be used with just two people on and I really were focused on the sea conceit it took us a wee while but basically the customers said that she still wanted to lounge on the seat of it while still talking to the skipper this is what we've come up with the food accommodation or the bunk area all of our squirrel boots done by John humans and canvas the boys at JH see they're just fantastic so this will be actually used with a duvet and the customers will sleep across the boat of course you wouldn't have a boat like this without having great bolster seats so you get the visibility I'm sitting up here what are supportive sitting down here we've chosen the Garmin eco met teen to show us the depth and actually never get this appropriate on the Garmin ecomap tins outstanding here it's quite new very very easy to operate really good gear with the fusion stereo fusion of putting the marine systems on all of our boats now we don't use anything else we use fusion because it's easy to use marvelous warranty is just really good gear we use the set of which we have the Marvis sandwich here stainless steel one button self deployed really really good gear have a look at least four sliding windows yes beautiful no rattling in them really really good for keeping the boat call and Roy no boats have come such a long way and we want to go I never thought we would build a six point seven enclosed we got this one to frame up stage it just coming out of hot work a guy come into the factory he bought one he said I'll hit that boat well now we're just taking our water for our fourth six seven and closed this models got a really good future well that's because it's a great big little boat black dog cat - helps twice the

preserves and repurposes architectural elements and it also tells the stories of our communities through the show Salvage Dawgs joining us today are Black Dog salvage president Robert Culp and CEO Mike Whiteside both are co-hosts of Salvage Dawgs gentlemen thanks for joining us today we ready here all right tell us a little bit about Black Dog salvage and what you do and really what the your mission well you know in a nutshell the salvage business the architectural salvage business is just just a matter of standing between demolition contractors in the landfill and trying to get in between it siphon out the good parts of old buildings and businesses and leftovers of human human life you know it's people build and then they tear down we want to save those things for the future and that's what we've done for the last 18 years Black Dog 18 years congratulations that's a good while you've been doing that well you know we deserve congratulations it's been a bit of salade I bet and so you guys also upcycle things as well and so you take something and turn it into something new I mean well that's one of the things that is really been one of our calling cards from from day one is upcycling is a fairly new word it was called shabby chic or you know repurposing or whatever but it's taking stuff that was a d'Orsay and then turn it into a bed or a coffee table or piece of wainscot paneling whatever finding a different purpose for it and that's that's really one of our one of our shining moments that we really kind of are proud of is because you don't know really what it can be until you start kind of disassembling and then put it back together right the process works in the salvage business is you you save it you want to use it as is for what what it already was okay that fails you can't sell it for that well the next thing is to give a guy with imagination like Mike here and he's going to upcycle these items and turn it into something else and okay with if you can't figure out something else to do with it let's recycle it and started break it down to its smallest pieces and make it anything to it everything has a space element like a metal is you know what scrap to that yeah and finally you're left with the smallest hopefully the smallest footprint possible and that leads to the dumpster in the landfill and hopefully all that that process is a filtering process to reduce that impact on the environment right and so you all have taken this concept you put it into practice at Black Dog salvage and now you're also sharing that story week in and week out on your show Salvage Dawgs so tell me a little bit about that yeah we've been really blessed there's you know you couldn't write this it was truly accidental buddy mine is a producer and I dared him to do a pilot and 100 episodes later which we filmed last Monday is we're into it by almost 5 years I mean right I don't know how that happened but it does oh my goodness it would be it's basically a platform that really chronicles what we do from the from the the salvage part of it to the creation part of our business and just the kind of quirky personalities always positive that we always accentuate the positive that's a great thing about our show it's a family show we have people come from all over the country to visit us and see if it's really like that it really is I mean some young kids to old people everybody can watch the show it and not be embarrassed or watch something that you know who needs to see a train wreck on TV of a bad relation to a person there's plenty of that out there and you realize oh we accentuate the positive and it's on DIY network primarily and that's where it premieres we're on sunny nights at 9:00 and 9:30 right now and a premiere cycle of our seventh season on GAC as well and then across across the world on the Travel Channel and fine living it is really you really out of here right now Italian magnifico most of man that's right well congratulations to you all I know everybody in order gets certainly proud of all the work that you've done and to take your business and to leverage it into something that you can share not just for the folks here in Roanoke but nationally is certainly a great accomplishment so congratulations thank you great opportunities and this is chrome this is Roberts born here my wife something and I'm an alien I'm gonna live in here 20 years I'm labeled a lady lately but it's nice to to feature a home or a hometown in a national positive spotlight it really brings people here that might not normally come to Roanoke and it's a it's a great calling card absolutely well thank you both so much I appreciate you coming in and tell us a little bit of historic thank you if you're interested in visiting Black Dog salvage is located two miles from downtown Roanoke on historic route 11 you can also visit their website for more information the spotlight on I'm just Mary [Music]", "WUz74ku4ZxA": "yeah hey how's it going my name is John McLennan and thanks for joining me in this lesson today I want to show you some licks by another one of my favorite guitar players and his name is Jimmy Page for a while he was like God for me I used to just blast Aplin and he still is the man geez transcribing these licks and it's some serious guitar playing here on Black Dog so I'm going to zoom in I'm going to show you a few of these licks so the lick I want to show you is from the solo on Black Dog and Paige is playing out of the a minor pentatonic scale for the most part sometimes I like to call it the rock scale because it's what all the rock players use and the band is basically vamping behind him and a rock groove and he's got this lick that starts on the seventh fret of the third string and it bends up a whole-step d to e and then you put your first finger down and you smush it across two strings five and five Oh and it's just a repetitive figure that you kind of just want to do over and over until it becomes really natural and that's coming from you know Chuck Berry and Paige has just made it you know it's like the next step with that riff so then he adds a few more things in here he reaches over to the eighth fret on the second string and does a pull off from eight to five back here so you've got and that's a nice variation to the lick mmm so he repeats that over and over and just locks into it with the band and how he gets out of it is with a series of descending pull offs so that's eight five eight five seven five seven just using the notes of the scale and then down here to the root so that's seven seven five seven five seven so the way of escaping that repetitive figure is pretty cool little move there so I hope that gets you started on some page licks be sure to subscribe and leave some comments below and we'll see you in the next lesson thanks for watching", "16dTGU5D2pM": "g'day graeme from black dog here hey uh we got a 545 cuddy uh just getting ready to go out i just thought i'd run over a couple of features that this boat has that not a lot of our boats do put a transom cage on the 545 it's normally in the realm of bigger boats or transom cages so it has a neat little lobby really good ladder can you imagine casting some bloody soft baits or floating a few dead boats back to snappers and sitting out here the water is just around the soles of your feet so the transient cage is just a bloody good idea it just works on this particular boat we've put gunnel rails these gunnel rails have a multitude of uses first and foremost if you happen to be leaning outside the boat whether you're jigging whether you're pulling a cray pot they keep you inside the boat they also make a very very good seat they actually get under your rump there and they have a great rub rail on a wharf just means the side of the boat the pontoon can't hit the wharf itself these gunner rails here are brilliant i've had them on any boat personally they add very little to the price and great for protecting your boat great for protecting you and your crew i reckon they're a good feature and just move up here luke this is something we don't normally put in our boats we put in some squats now you're not going to go and spend a week in a five four five meter boat um we certainly wouldn't in my eye situation but the five four five we've got these squads here we basically you can just sort of get a little bit of a sleep a little bit of a lay down during the day and that's all most people need a little bit of a bit of a position you can even put a center scrub in and actually have a have an infill so that's a very simple idea on the five four five cutting just a couple of things we've put on this boat that we haven't uh you know new features give us a call anytime and just remember two holes twice the boat", "HWscQjIe2Pk": "hey guys for today's read aloud we have a great book called black dog by Levi pin fold and in this story we have this little girl

legend from the fork lore of the British Isles the black dogs black dogs also known as black hounds our class of monstrous beings found mostly in the folklore of the southern and eastern English counties and sometimes in some regions of Scotland and Wales the origins of the black dogs aren't certain however some say that it may have its roots in Celtic and Germanic elements within British culture after all they were very similar to the hounds of Allen a creature from wash mythology they were said to take the shape of a huge shaggy-haired black dog that was about the size of a cough they had enormous glowing red eyes and long sharp teeth some of them were malicious and evil and others were benevolent although the latter didn't occur quite often initially they were regarded as an earthly creatures that served as familiars for witches and warlocks black dogs were usually encountered on lonely tracks ancient roads bridges and graveyard entrances basically the places of transition in human lives some legends talk of the black hounds as a guardians of an ancient treasure such as the one in the English coastal town of Lyme rajee's in West Dorset it was said that if anyone attempted to strike or engage a black dog they could retaliate with frightful powers that inflicted savage wounds paralysis and sometimes death when they were finished with their victims the hounds simply vanished in front of any survivors fighting a black dog is one thing but according to some legends Murali seeing one is supposed to bring death within the upcoming year to the person that saw the Beast however in some parts of England instances of black dogs appearing to lost travellers or fighting girls to guide them at night and protect them are also very well-known black dogs are among the oldest and most popular legendary creature from British folklore which is why sightings of the creature have been reported in almost all the counties in and here are a few examples of some of the most popular folktales revolving around the black dogs in England on the 4th of August 1577 the English clergyman Abraham Fleming reported seeing the devil in the disguise of a black dog at st. Mary's Church near Norwich that day during a frightful thunderstorm the beast appeared terrifying and killing those attending the church after butchering most of the people there the hellhound simply ran off and vanished nowadays st. Mary's Church still attracts many visitors to see the place where all that happened the Newgate Prison of London was said to be haunted by a black dog that would often appear just before executions in 1596 a scholar suspected of witchcraft was sent to the prison when he arrived there he was killed and then eaten by the starving prisoners that were already there when the black dog appeared shortly after that he hunted down and killed every single one of the prisoners no matter where they ran off near the town of Lima oh jeez there was a farmhouse hunted by a black hound however unlike most tales revolving around the Beast this one didn't seem to be hostile and never caused any harm according to the legend one night the owner of the farmhouse tried to attack the Hound with an iron picker the supernatural beast simply vanished on the spot in a treasure of gold and silver was found where it stood before examples like these were very common throughout England hundreds of black dark sightings have been recorded over the last 400 years and not only in England but in France Denmark and other areas of Scandinavia as well black dogs are quite popular in pop culture as well The Legend of the black dog even inspired the Arthur Conan Doyle for the very famous hand of the Baskervilles where Sherlock Holmes was sent to investigate on the mysterious beast in Bram Stoker's Dracula the count transforms into a black dog as he arrived in London to easily go and noticed by the people at the harbour while he reached his mansion other than that black dogs are a source of inspiration for

at the solo here and black dog this is going to start with a little phrase like this pretty simple it's just gonna be a the low E string open hammered on to the second fret then come over to the a string hit it open slide from second fret to the third fret [Music] really quick back to the open a string and then to zero on the low E okay now he goes into what it's pretty much the main lick in the solo he does it kind of repetitively not only the beginning but throughout the the solo it's gonna go kinda like this [Music] all right so let's take a look at that that little kind of ascending phrase is gonna happen a lot in this solo we're going to start with a quick slide from the second fret to the fourth fret you don't really hear the second fret it's more of a grace note so slide it into the fourth fret on the 5th string the a string then on the D string play two and four then you come over to the g string and play the second fret back down to the four on the d string back to the 2 on the g string you're gonna take a step remaining on the g-string you're gonna slide from 4 up to 6 kind of a grace note as well you don't leave here the 4 and then grab the 5 on the high e with your second finger here and then come and hit the open a string [Music] okay so after doing that phrase in the beginning of the solo starts with that little present three times and then we do it so that is gonna be a whole step in at the fifth fret that after doing that opening phrase three times whole step in at the fifth fret on the g string and then picking the fifth fret again but just without bent it being bent and pick it two more times then four and two then come over to four on the D string then come back to the g string and hammer on two to four and then hit the low a again on the open Asian [Music] then you start that phrase all over again that's three times and then the same Phil so that's the same ending alright now we keep going off that's that kind of takes care of the beginning of the solo then we go into this is that was kind of the solo section and this is where the really kind of like bluesy soloing starts the one that's more improvised so we have so that's the first phrase we're gonna slide from four to six on the g string now the grace note from the four then we're gonna play it the high E fifth fret over to the fifth fret on the B back to the high e fifth row you're gonna do a whole step in at the seventh fret on the high E string and then picks seven five so we have this [Music] then we go five from the b25 on the e twice now you can let those notes kind of ring together then you get a slide from seven on the B string up to ten with your third finger so we all together alright now we have a series of little bins here at the tenth fret and between the eighth and tenth fret on the high E string we start with going 810 on the high E then you can do a pre bin so you're gonna Bend that 10th fret up a half-step I did a whole step and then pick it again and release that bin and pull off to the eighth fret so we had this then you pick the 10th fret again then pick it again and bend it a whole step and then back to 10th the regular 10 again to 8 then a whole step Bend on 10 again release back to 8th 10th fret on the B string now and then a quick quarter step in on the 8th fret on the high E so it's just it's one of those things where it's got a mixture of just pretty much just two notes over and over again so we have this all together [Music] all right so just it's about listening to it and getting that phrasing down and just knowing that it's just a it's a series of bins on this tenth fret always kind of resolving down to that eighth fret then the next phrase is this so we start now with the tenth fret on the B string then come over to the tenth fret on the high E do a quick whole step Bend then pick ten without a bend on the high e down to eight and then a quick pin on the tenth fret again all right the next phrase is gonna be this so we have this we're gonna do a whole step Bend at the 15th fret on the B string while you have that note bent you're gonna have your pinkie play the 15th fret on the high E string then you get to pick the 15 that's already been on the B and then release it down to the normal the flat 15 pull off to 13th foot then do a quick whole step Bend and 15 natural so we have it's all together they're gonna play 13 on the B string 2 14 on the the G and then a quick whole step in at the 15th fret on the B and then a quarter step Bend on the 13th so we have all together I want on alright now we have a series of slow bins kind of unison bins up here and the 17th position so we're gonna bend at the 19th fret on the third-string whole step in and then grab the 17th fret on the high e string while that note is being bent [Music] they would've been there 19 a whole step again and then this time plays 17 and on the B string and the high E [Music] so we just going to a whole step in I've did 20th fret on the B string grab the 20th fret with your pinky on the high E while you're holding that bend then pick the B string again that's already been to the 23 I've at least that been they're gonna play 17 on the be followed by a whole step in at the nineteen foot on the G then 17 on the high e 20 on the B then 17 20 on the B with a bending the 20 up a whole step so let me play this so far [Music] all right so now we have a bent xx fret on the height on me on the B string then we're gonna pick that again it's already bent and we're gonna release it then play 17 then I'll Bend on the 19th fret on the G whole step Bend again and then while you're holding that play 20th fret on the B then we'll come back to this 20th fret on the B string do a whole step Bend while grabbing the 20th fret once again on the high e coming back down to the B string picking it and releasing the bin place 17 on the B and we're gonna end this section with it that's a whole quick whole step Bend on the 19th fret on the g string then release that band and pick 19 then 17 then come over and played 19 on the D string back to 19 on the G and then a half step band at the 17th fret on g [Music] alright so that section is once again there's a lot of bends and kind of sustained note so it's a good thing to get the notes underneath your hands here and then listen back to the recording and just start trying to match the timing of its kind of the easiest way of getting it together now this next lick happens six times in a row it's kind of a standard blues lick and with the six note I'm sorry it's a five note lick but it's in the feeling of three triplets so it's gonna be like one whole step Bend if they own this third fret on the sorry the g string with the seventh fret then play five on the B string now the timing of those two notes because would be like one two three and then the next three notes are gonna be played just one two three so it's gonna be now you're gonna roll over to the five on the high E and then pull off eight to five on the B string that's me a one two three so we got this one two three one two three all right you're gonna do that pattern six times okay and after the sixth time you're gonna do a quick pull off again from eight to five on the B then pull off seven to five twice on the g string come over to seven on the D string then back to the seven on the G and five a half-step bit so with that band did you go just like just seven two five two seven on the D we got a quick now it's another Bend on the g string of the fifth fret half step in to the seven on the d and then play five seven on the g bending that seventh fret up a whole-step then we have a quick little section here we're gonna come over it's kind of muted sounding you're gonna come and pick the seventh on the g string once then seven on the g string three times think they pick it again with a quick half step bent thing that picks seven five now we're gonna pick a cross string we're gonna go seven on d5 on the g-eight on the B then a whole step in at the seventh on the G seven five now down to the seven on the D string then a hammer from five to seven on the G so it's kind of a lot of the same notes there's usually the hardest things to learn where it's long like two or three notes he's using but he keeps repeating and with little bins and stuff so it's all about the phrasing so [Music] so once again just get the notes underneath your fingers and then fought by following all in this video and then really try to listen to the record and follow along with there's no now be getting kind of a repetitive figure it's gonna go mm-hmm we're gonna go five six seven on the d-string I'm gonna alter it pick that down up down and then play five on the g-string do that twice then you're gonna go the same thing you're except you're gonna play seven on the g string instead of five and then do it again going back to the only the fifth fret this time then again back to the seventh and back to the five so all together we have okay so after that we're gonna do it again and do five six seven then jump back to the fifth string and go five three four [Music] and then come to the second fret on the low E string and do a half step Bend and release so we have then we have an open a string and then we get back to the same figure that we did earlier in the song sound we started the solo and we're gonna do that three times again now we're gonna have a little different fill at the end it's gonna be a quick great slide from three to four remember you'd only here to three it's just a grace note [Music] on the fifth string and then we're gonna on the D string we're gonna play to zero then three four on the open on the a string [Music] and you're gonna slide from three down to two on the low e so we have then back to the open a string start the phrase again but we're gonna kind of change the ending of it a little bit it just kind of leads into something else when you get to that slide from the four to six instead of just jumping right here we're gonna go from five on the bead five on the high e then slide from eight to ten on the B string so we got then we're gonna play pick eight to ten on the high E then a half step in on the tenth then ten normal then half step in again then normal have to pin again and normal and we're gonna go eight to ten whole step in then a quarter step bill in the eighth and then ten on the B then back to eight on the high E with a core step in and kill it so it's just it's not many nodes this then we're government over to the b-string we're gonna play the 10th fret and then I'll step in a half Bend on the 13th written and bended release at the 13th fret on the B back to the 10 then pick 10 again and play the 13th red again this time do a 2 hole stead bit two whole steps so you need this note to sign like this note [Applause] then release the bin and plate in so we have half step a step and a half end and a to whole step in pretty big bins then pick 10 twice come up and grab 15 on the high e then a whole step Bend on the B string of the 15th fret then pay 15 13 and then 14 on the G and then a quick hammer on from 13 to 15 on the be back to 13 back to down to 14 on the G then another quick hammer on from 13 to 15 on the B it's really starting to fade out at this point so a lot of this a lot of editions of this recording you can't hear this section too much these last couple measures but it is there on the original recording so 15 13 14 mangy quick hammer on 13 15 then 13 14 and quick hammer on 13 15 now we go to fit 13 on the B and a quick 15 on the high E alright and then we have a whole step bin on the B string a prebend at the 15th fret picot and release pull off to 13 then pick 15 again and 13 again with a slight Bend on it and then pick 15 once again really quickly on the high E so we have this [Music] then a whole step Bend and release again at the on the 15th fret pull off to 13 he's kind of repeating the same stuff here it's just a basic account of her based around these three notes and then down to the 14 on the g string then played 15 13 again back down to the 14 then play 13 on the B whole step 15 on the high E so we got this [Music] this might not matter for a lot of people because they probably can't even don't have the copy of this recording to where you can actually

and yeah pretty wicked down the reef but I didn't connect as many as I really really wanted to some reason they were just short striking I think it's because of the westerlies I just weren't really committing but cavi seem to have the golden touch until they died of sickness and he was pump and fish pump and pump and so now it's good good day black cat went really really well run back and show out for the rest of day because we go back tomorrow see back on me as you can see we've just made it back from the reef was an insane day really really really good ride was way better than expected

reef day and we pumped him as well so it was really really good and then it turned on yeah we just had to wait for the tar turn and the wind change happened and it happened it's actually really really impressed with cavium brixi cuz Briggs it every time I looked out look like he's gonna throw up oh it was dry reaching and everything but hung in there and then cavy started getting mad migraines to the point where it almost debilitated you man I couldn't even you couldn't even move yeah I have the magic touch somehow - and every time put the law and boom something sketchy yeah you got that Ranga

console with all the bling on it it's one of the guys at work it's a demonstrator we've got it there all the time so let's do a bit of a walk around this boat and show you what's in a 545 center console all the features in this boat can go under the five metre center console 6.2 670 in the center console form come for a walk like most of our boats sit on the black dog custom made aluminium trailer this one's a little bit different from most of the other ones we've done it's got a checker plate walkway so basically that allows you to walk in down the ramp and we didn't manage to put the spare tyre just another little bit of innovation to our product but as the product grows of course comes with the on our patented catch and release system just makes your boating so much easier launching and retrieving we think we've got that really good really good moving down the boat as i say it's the 5 4 5 center console same hull as the 545 cuddy 545 hardtop really well proven our most popular model [Music] this trailer we put guide poles on it um just where the guy launches most of the time a bit of current on the ramp just makes life a little bit easier for it okay like a lot of our boats uh not all of our boats but a lot of our boats this guy chose to have the honda bf90 now we chose this motor for a couple of reasons to just show we don't need lots of horsepower on all of our boats you might think 90 horsepower on a 545 sport fishing boat's not that much power this boat goes great doesn't need any more power it's the same block as the of the bf 100 in actual fact they're very hard to tell the difference in performance the economy this boat when it's live baiting or when it's idling or when it's trolling it's just brilliant not a big motor by any stretch of the imagination i've been out in this boat with me and three others and it just pops up onto the plane nicely [Music] okay so perfectly positioned here is a decent live bait tank this is a fully plumbed life bait tank just works you know good for your jack mackerels those sorts of things fish master transient we've got all our rods here rod holders here places for your knives it just you know it just works it's the right height a lot of bait boards and things like that are just too low you're bending over but if you're filling first you're rigging up a live bait it's just at the right height oh have a look at this here we like somewhere to keep rods guys that have boats like this have more fishing rods than most fishing fishing shops they end up taking out a half a dozen rods some of them take a half a dozen each so we make these little things on this a little clip on they're not new by any stretch of the imagination but allows you to to store six rods nice and easily of course in the fishmaster transom as usual twin batteries the fuel water separator your isolation switch is there everything's nice and dry it's just good soap catch on there bye have a look at this 105 liter icing tent chili bin or an s gear for in australia 105 litre so it can actually come out and she hasn't to sit there and drive with but just about without exception the guy that has this boat stands up to drive has an arrangement there to support the fishermen stop it going out anywhere else all we do there quickly put the latches on there that chilly bin is going nowhere how are these for drawers guys that are going to buy this boat they've got lures for africa they've got hooks for every different occasion they've got stuff so the more stuff you have the more places you've got to put it the drawers on here are just absolutely brilliant okay we run the c-star hydraulic steering we have the garmin vhf we've got the big fusion a big fusion no point having a boat like this unless you've got the good sounds and have a look at this the garmin 8416 has the sounder module in it so the garmin 8416 is top of the line gear with the sounder module coupled up with the big earmar transducer um johnny got a 66 kilo bass in this boat not long ago [Music] we're running a casting platform on this particular boat so the casting platform alley actually get up here throw your poppers your soft banks live baits just get away from everyone else and have a little list for a bow rail perfectly positioned middle of your thighs that you can actually lean into it put a bit of weight on a fish and just utilize all of the boat it might only be five four five meters long but every inch of this boat's a fishing machine what about these for rod holders an additional four rod holders on each side of the boat you know you can actually be fishing here and just about throw another one out so once again four rod holders there three down the side of the boat five at the back another four here boy i'll show you what we do under the casting platform it's under the casting platform here we've got a hydraulic ram we've just got this area for storage for your safety gear extra fishing tackle as we know they all need but just open boats suffer a little bit from lack of storage so on the 545 center console if you choose the casting platform option look at the extra options you have it is a good option okay just about every boat you build these days i'll have one of these this one has a maxwell drum winch so the maxwell drum which just fits nicely in there enables you to deploy the anchor and retrieve it just for the push of a button okay that's basically it the 545 black dog cat center console it really is a fishing weapon it's got everything where it should be a place for everything everything's functional the guy that built this boat here he's a fisherman he's really into his jigging really into throwing his poppers and really into his live baiting it's a blooming good little boat if you want to go for a ride in one of this boat it is a demonstrator it's at work it's available all the time give me a bell we're selling this package without all the optional extras for 55 000 give me a call black dog cats two house twice the boat [Music] you", "hmrQantyymc": "in garments new black dog cake 5 4 5 with a BF 100 Honda you're gonna see this boat along a lot around the country it's being towed right here on the bottom of the South Island it'll be at the hatch Wilco boat show have a look at some of the things we've got the radar unit on this the gamin radar unit I'm standing on the roof don't try this at home how's that for stability the old black dog 5 4 5 now top she's a beauty no matter how we're swinging on this boat you just can't get it to roll have a look at the bit of the gear in this we've got the all-new this is the first gammon plotter the first gammon combo that's showing all the new gear we have an autopilot the Honda's put it up to the Garmin gauges the gamin VHF radio we even have the transducer on a electronically rising lift on this particular boat the black dog cake 545 hardtop we've elected to go with the Honda B if 100 not a huge motor but on a boat like this it's perfectly suited we're doing about 17 liters in here at cruising speed really an economy you watch this my first week speed 4,300 ribs I'm doing them in 18.3 8045 nuts and it

naming names i have my internet through service provider a service provider b is tearing up all of our front lawns to put in their new fiber optic cables and in order to put their cables in service provider a keeps getting knocked out so my internet's been on off on off on off so it's been hard for me to make my videos the last couple of days so that's why i'm frustrated but it's back up now so i'm happy happy happy about that we'll see how long that lasts so i received a little present in the mail by one of our uh our channel mates his name is gaetan he carved this little bigfoot for me and it is absolutely beautiful it's absolutely beautiful it just is the most adorable thing that i've ever received and i want to thank you gaetan thank you so much for thinking of me that took a lot of work and i really appreciate it also while i'm on the topic um i've been getting some inquiries for my home address for people to send me mail so what i'm gonna do i'm gonna go out and get a p.o box because um like i'm fine with that really but it's my kids that don't feel comfortable with me just throwing my address out there so i got to respect that that's cool so i'm going to go out and get a post office box and then that way for those of you that can't email for whatever reason that's fine you can always mail it to me okay so the first story i'm gonna read doesn't really have a title um it just starts out greetings what i have to tell you is not so much an encounter but a series of unexplained occurrences none are very earth shaking but taken together they have left me perplexed i'm not sure they even fit the theme of your channel but i'm going to let you decide i will not be hurt at all if you don't want to read these for your audience okay guys remember what i've always said whenever they say that they're not that good or they don't fit the narrative it always turns out to be well worth the read and the reason that i really like this story is well you know what i'm not going to tell you right now gotta listen to the end and then i will tell you why this story really caught my attention okay so she says first let me assure you i'm a sane and logical person i'm not prone to letting my imagination run away with me and analyze things in a scientific way when i don't understand something i've camped hiked canoed and several different states and i love nature and all it contains i don't hunt or fish because i just can't stand to see any creatures suffer but i'm not against hunting and fishing either i never have had and never will use drugs or alcohol and i take no prescription drugs as far as i know i have never hallucinated or had any mental issues whatsoever on to my story i grew up in northwood minnesota but moved away at 17 to go to college in 2014 at 49 years of age i moved back north after getting divorced the divorce and what led up to it was quite horrible and i was traumatized to put it mildly but as i began hiking in the forest with my dog i felt myself slowly healing my dog was half rottweiler quarter labrador retriever and quarter english springer spaniel what she looked like however was a muscular black lab with white toes she was a fearless very energetic dog who loved other dogs but would freak them out a little due to her energetic level her propensity to growl and bite while playing and her lack of respect for other dogs space when she would see another dog she would tear up to that dog and immediately try to get them to play with her which always involved giant tail wags running around like a maniac barking growling and even jumping on the dog believe me it was playful in nature and a lot of dogs loved it and would happily engage in chasing wrestling and other doggy fun some dogs found her a bit overwhelming and would let her know in dog language to back off and behave which she never did so i would step in and distract her until the non-receptive dog had time to escape all of this is pertinent to my story i had been living in the north hiking and exploring the woods for a couple of years when a strange thing happened one day we were hiking along along the edge of a remote lake that is always quite deserted it's not impossible to run into other people there but it's rare especially since it was early spring there was a small trail that ran along the edge of a lake about a foot wide and not much more than a game trail my dog was ahead of me when she turned and stopped stared at something behind me then she took off at a full run past me so i turned around to see what was happening behind me on the trail was a dog it was about 30 30 feet behind me pure black and just standing there on the trail looking at us i instantly felt a strange feeling i knew something wasn't right but i didn't know what my dog ran up to this other dog but when she got to it instead of her usual crazy dog greeting she respectfully stood beside the other dog and just looked at it they greeted each other but there was no jumping barking growling or any of the usual antics the dog was slightly taller than my dog slim but not emaciated had black fur that was maybe an inch and a half in length overall it looked like a healthy dog but what was he doing alone in the woods a long time ago i made a commitment to myself that when an animal crossed my path that needed help i would do my best to help it while this dog did not appear to be in any kind of distress the very fact that it was alone in the woods told me that it needed help so i began walking towards it talking quietly and trying to make friends i know at this point people might be thinking that maybe it was a wall for a coyote but it wasn't it was a dog i have been a dog lover for a long time i know dogs so i was slowly approaching the dog aware that i was alone in the middle of the forest with only my dog so i was being cautious the dog gave no aggressive signals yet when i reached about 15 feet it stopped dead i stopped dead in my tracks why well this is going to sound a little hard to explain i suddenly just knew i should not go closer it was looking at me in my eyes and it just didn't seem like a dog it was confident intelligent different don't get me wrong it was a dog not a dog man not a wolf a dog but it wasn't this is why i have never told the story there's just no way to really communicate this well my dog was treating this other dog in a way i'd never seen her act calm and respectful the dog was looking at me as no other dog had ever looked at me and acting in a way that's not consistent with dog dogs alone in the woods and running across an unknown human and her dog nothing was right in this picture it showed no fear no anxiety no reaction to my dog other than acknowledging her mostly i just knew deep within that i should not get closer so i called my dog and amazingly she trotted to me and we continued on our hike i kept my eye on the dog for a few seconds but then i turned around to look at where i was walking for a second and when i glanced back over my shoulder a second later the dog was gone my dog just happily continued down the path which was just one more this isn't right thing for every other dog she would have been trying to get back to it running around all excited etc but for this dog she just turned and walked away i kept my eyes open looking for the rest of our hike thinking i would see the dog again but i never did there are no houses anywhere close to where we were and the lost dog would have wouldn't have looked so healthy nor acted so calm and confident it was strange and i knew something was not right but in the end it was just a dog that didn't seem to need my help so life went on and i just filed it away as one of those hmm moments my gut feeling at the time and what i ended up thinking every time every time i look back on it was that i was looking at something that appeared to be a normal dog but it wasn't about a month later we were hiking in a different area it was within the superior national forest and one of our favorite areas there is a rough dirt road that leads to a three-cell tower on top of the laurentian divide no vehicles are allowed on this road except for authorized workers that occasionally do maintenance work on the towers as a result we rarely run into anyone on this road so it's a great place to hike with plenty of trails that branch out from the road to explore also northern minnesota is a boreal forest so it's deep and dark and thick you cannot see from more than a few yards into the woods at any direction because the vegetation is so thick the road we were on first goes through the forest then winds between two swamps then climbs steeply upward through through more forests until you reach the top of the laurentian divide it's a hard climb a great workout but not especially attractive to most casual hikers we had just started our hike we were about a quarter mile in and my dog ran into the woods on my right a few yards behind me not more than five seconds later i saw black fur traveling through the forest to my left and even with me you know how you can have thoughts that are really just impressions and not actual words well i had the instant impression that one my dog could not possibly be in the woods on my left as she just ran into the woods on my right the fur is too high to be my dog as it was more the height of a deer than a dog there was absolutely no sound no twigs snapping no leaves getting pushed aside nothing and four the fur was not moving as as a dog or any other animal moves but seemed to be floating through the woods smoothly soundlessly and quickly all these thoughts flashed through my mind in an instant but just as quickly my brain told me of course it's your dog i only saw it for a moment before it was obscured by foliage i hate that word then from behind me my dog emerged from the woods on my right just where i thought she was so if this is not my dog what was it my only thought was a bear but bears do not float through the woods silently there was no way it was a bear there is also no way i only thought i saw fur no i definitely saw a black bird animal of some sort there was no doubt in my mind because i saw it clearly one final stage strange thing about this encounter was that my dog was oblivious she didn't smell or hear anything and had no idea other animals were close by this is odd because she was she was a dog who would put her nose to the air and locate a deer if it was within a half a mile to us although what happened was strange i did not know what to make of it i just put it on out of my mind and we continued our walk as planned a couple of months later we were at home on my and my doggy had just gone upstairs to bed she would often go to bed before me and once in bed for the night she almost never stirred until morning i went upstairs to check on her and to say good night and give her kisses and rubs before she fell asleep then i came back downstairs to do dishes i was in the kitchen but turned around for a minute and saw my dog in the living room through the doorway that goes from the kitchen to the living room i only saw her from the waist back as she was walking towards the couch and was then out of sight my brain instantly knew that it was not the right tail too much fur on the tail to be my dog but just as quickly my brain said of course it's your dog a black dog in your house has to be your dog silly so i went to the living room to see what she was doing and why she'd gotten out of bed but there was no dog there i went upstairs and there she was fast asleep just where i had seen her once again i saw this dog clear as day and there's no doubt in my mind what i saw about a month later my dog had thrown up on the living room carpet so i let her out into the backyard and began my cleaning up barf off the carpet routine which consists of cleaning up the worst of it soaking the water area with water and then covering it with thick a thick layer of baking soda after a couple of days the baking soda will dry and will have soaked up the water and whatever of the doggie barf was left left behind then i just vacuum it up and the carpet is as good as new i just put a layer of baking soda on the carpet and turned and walked three steps to my pantry to put the baking soda away all told my back was turned for about five seconds then i turned back towards the baking soda on the floor i immediately saw it a print in the baking soda yes a print i examined it examined it closely and it looked like a dog print but with only two toe pads plus a bottom pad what's more there was another print in the carpet that was from stepping in the baking soda i did everything i could to explain this was there anything that might have fallen on the area could i have made the print with my own shoe i seriously tried to come up with an explanation for what i was seeing but i could find nothing remember i was only out of eye contact with that area for a few seconds i have no explanation i took a picture and will attach it to this email she did send the picture and i will try to put it up so that you guys can see this at the same time there were four events happened within a matter of months none of them are spectacular but taken as a whole they are quite strange to me i can't help but feel they're connected somehow but beyond that i just don't know what to think i never felt scared it never felt scary to me just unexplained nothing has ever happened since and i lost my precious dog a year later i searched for any information i could find about abnormal black dog encounters legends myths etc but could find nothing this is how i i stumbled upon youtube channel about bigfoot dog man and the like and began listening to and enjoying and learning about others people's experiences i never heard anything even remotely similar to what i experienced but have become intrigued just the same i would be sincerely appreciative if anyone had any ideas to what i have experienced p.s one other strange thing happened during this time but i have no reason to believe it was connected to the others i'm ver a very organized person and when i came into the house i take off my shoes and put them on a shoe rack right by my back door i put on slippers for a while that i'm in the house never bringing my shoes beyond that shoe rack at the back porch one day i went to put my shoes on and one of my shoes was missing one shoe was still there on the shoe rack but the other was gone this was a big deal because i wear prosthetics in my shoes that cost about four hundred dollars and i only have one set that i transfer from shoe to shoe as i wear various pairs of shoes i searched everywhere for that shoe i live alone so only me and my dog could have moved it and my dog never paid any attention to my shoes after a couple of months i decided that she was gone and ordered a new set of prosthetics a few months later i was moving things in my basement and i found my shoe it was sitting perfectly straight on the back side of a shelf unit there's a small ledge on the back that i only got by moving other things basically it was one of the most hidden and hard to get places in my house since it was about four feet from the floor there was no chance my dog somehow put it there the only other explanation was that i had put it there and forgotten but this is just ludicrous not only because i never take my shoes beyond the back porch also because i would never have to move my heavy furniture items around to place my shoe on this shelfy thing and moved the furniture back and then forgotten about it the next day does not seem plausible i can come up with no logical explanation and that's the end of that story i'm going to tell you guys why i was intrigued by this story okay so i used to have a pretty bad temper so one of the ways to keep myself in check was uh when i would get mad at the kids or whatever i would get in my car and go for a drive just to cool down and you know come back in a better mood so one of these particular times this was about four years ago i went for a drive and i like this uh i know it sounds stupid but i like this uh graveyard by my house it uh it was beautiful it was decorated with beautiful pine trees and it was bordered on a big river that runs through our town there was a little pond that believe it or not people would go fishing at it was just gorgeous and at night it was lit up by all these beautiful twinkly lights so this particular night it was dark already i drove into the graveyard and out of my left eye i saw a movement and i looked and there was this giant black dog and it was saw me at the same exact time it stared at me for i don't know a second or two and then it turned and bolted i sat there and watched it zigzagging in and out of the trees and once in a while it would look back at me and then it took off and it was in the woods within seconds now the thing about this black dog that stood out in my mind was that it was giant it was really big um i'm only five feet tall i'm almost embarrassed to say that but this dog's shoulders came up to i'd say four feet the back of its shoulders were four feet the head on it was huge and it was covered in curly not really curly kinky but wavy black hair it had a giant bushy tail and normally dogs don't run from people like that um that's the one thing that i that stood out i stood there i sat there in my car watching this thing take off for me and it was like it was like a wild animal um but i i was like already into bigfoot and dogman and all that by this time but this didn't fall into any category i had ever heard of you know up till then until i had my second encounter and started reaching out to other researchers so the second encounter happened hmm just about a year and a half ago maybe two years ago now i was driving home late at night i was actually talking to my ex-husband i use a bluetooth don't no illegal driving here actually that's a lie i used a headset anyways i was driving on a back country road as usual i prefer back country roads and interestingly enough this road also paralleled the same river that is right beside the graveyard but these two places are geez miles away from each other so i'm driving along and chatting and all of a sudden this big black dog it very well could have been the same dog because it was the same size it was huge it bolted from the right side of the road the riverside right across the road from me and into a cornfield which then went into the woods but this dog was only probably about 20 feet ahead of me and i screamed and threw my brakes on saying oh my god oh my god and of course he's yelling what the heck is going on and i told him that i just saw this dog this unnaturally large dog run out in front of me and he's like holy god the way you're talking i thought you saw a monster well dude i did i did see a monster ah so those were my two encounters with this big black dog so as i mentioned i reached out to other researchers about this and i started looking into it and there is a thing about these big black dogs they're starting to kind of be cropped up all over the place and people are starting to notice them so keep your eyes out because these are not i mean when you see this dog it's not natural it's not a big you know so that's the end of my story guys i think that i'm gonna finish it there so you guys have a great night and let me know in the comments what you guys think of this black dog thing all right guys that's it have a good night we'll see you back here in a couple of days bye for now", "fRqu9n4TdEo": "all right what's up youtube um coming at you with another video i'm really on a roll right now did a video yesterday and did a video the day before got a video today for you um today we're going to talk about something a little fun um as you can see from the title of this video we're going to be talking about a trucker legend and that is the black dog for those of you who have not been on the road much you may not have heard about this may not know what it is those of you who have people who are on the road or know people who are in the trucking industry uh you may have heard of this mentioned um a lot of you who are not in the road have heard of this term the black dog from an old uh patrick swayze movie he had a movie out called the black dog um that's kind of where this legend actually got popularized from is from that movie so let's get into it what is it this is something that um this is something fun you know a lot of the truck driving videos this is something you just don't see a whole lot of truckers talking about even though they all know about it and i thought this would just be a fun little thing to to talk about um i do want to get into more uh heavier stuff more educational stuff when it comes to truck driving i just i haven't done that yet um i plan to start on that at some point like i said this is an all over the road uh youtube channel so from day to day week to week you never know what what type of video i'm gonna be doing i don't even know um i don't know what type of topic sometimes i'll be talking trucking sometimes i'll be talking other topics it could be anything so anyway let's get into this all right so i did some research today on uh the black dog i've heard about it i've looked into it a little bit throughout the years i've been out here but i decided before i did this video i better go on and do some reading up on it now apparently [Music] let me explain to what the black dog is and then we'll get into the history of it all right so basically the legend of the black dog is that a truck driver when he's been driving a long time and he's tired and falling asleep at the wheel [Music] legend has it that um just as he's dozing off at the will um this black dog will just jump out of nowhere and come running up the street at him as he's going i mean literally coming at you as he's going as you're driving down the road and that [Music] there's a couple different variations some say the black dog appears just before you're ready to have an accident usually resulting in the death of the truck driver some say the black dog appears as just a warning to let you know hey get off the road because uh you stay on the road you're gonna you're not gonna survive you're gonna you're gonna die he's letting you know you're coming up to the end of your life you're pressing your luck you better get off the road [Music] that's the way legend has it you talk to some uh you talk to some old some old-time truck drivers and they'll swear to be damned they've seen it and here's the thing you've been out here a while you're going to hear truck drivers use that term oh i've seen the black dog before i've seen the black dog now here's the thing when you hear that term usually nine times out of ten it's a metaphor he's just saying that he's he's had he's fallen asleep at the wheel that he's basically he's driven to the point to where he couldn't keep his eyes open he had no choice but to stop it's basically in essence probably what he's saying um although there are some drivers out there that swear they've seen a black dog they've even described that black dog what it looks like it's big hairy gnarly looking with very sharp some have even said bloody teeth i don't know that's what they claim they have seen um now let's talk about the history of the black dog well it was popularized because of that movie black dog now from my research it's got its roots um go further back european mythology and even to me i guess egyptian mythology from the website i was looking at um now i'm not saying that it was back you know during european mythology i'm not saying it was called the black dog but they had dogs that did that that did the same thing they were related to death they would show up just before one died um so you could see where it kind of you could see you could see it you know we could see what inspired the legend um some people do claim that the legend goes back further i i honestly don't know um all i know is that it became popular because of the movie and from my research it does have its roots in european myth mythology and um i think i think i saw something about uh germany too as well so it looks like it does predate uh the patrick swayze movie um just a fun little topic this video is not gonna be very long um i'm gonna try to make up for uh i re i did a video a couple days ago those almost 30 minutes long trying to make up for that try to keep this one short yesterday's was pretty short by the way i'll give you guys a quick update on yesterday um for those of you who still saw the video for those of you who didn't see the video well i'm not going to describe it you need to go back and watch the video that's not you know so um but i'll give a quick update for those who have seen the video uh it's not a long video it won't take it won't take very long just go back it's like it's literally just a little over three minutes long it's a short video so three minute you know so it should be really easy for you if you want to go back and look at it won't take you very long at all to look at it um now i think that's all i have to say about the black dog um if you know it'd be interesting if you know anybody who's out in the road if you yourself or a truck driver looking at getting into the industry which i'm going to be doing videos about that soon so stay tuned and hey you know you want to know when those videos are coming out i don't know right now but you can always hit the subscribe button and you can hit that little bell for notifications and well you'll get notified when they come out so that's that's one way you can be rest assured if you're looking for for um truck driving content [Music] that's a good way to to be rest assured that you'll you'll know when i start uploading those those videos uh good good segue good plug huh anyway i'm getting better at this so um if you know anybody who's truck driving or you know why not ask them about the black dog be interesting to see what people say if you've heard anybody talk about the black dog or you've had any experiences i'd be curious to know you know comment down below um if you yourself are a truck driver you know someone who is who's talked about it who has or if you know any more information i've done some research on this but like i said it's it's one of those things i'm just you know i don't know um so maybe you know maybe some of you guys might have some information that i don't have so let me know if you know if you anything you know if you have any more information that i have already given i'd be interested in taking a look at that again you can post that in the comment down below um now me personally you're probably asking well have you seen the black dog have i seen it well no i have not seen the black dog um do i believe this thing actually exists probably not the truth of it is we all want a good mystery we all want something magical mystical and we you men human beings are obsessed with legends we're obsessed with anything that can't be explained we want a mystery we want something magical we really do so i think that's the reason why legends like the black dog do so well there's also a lot of other great legends in my research to doing the black dog i discovered something about a highway that i had driven on many many times i did not realize was actually the u.s government actually changed the highway number because it was 666. i actually changed the highway number because of the fact it was 666 and because of all the reports of the horrible stuff people were seeing on that highway yet i've driven it time and time and time again and so has um my family you know my sister has just drove it literally a month ago so i just found that interesting um i've been driving up and down the highway my sister's driven up and down a few times i've driven up and down at night and uh never knew about that so that's i've heard of highway 666 i didn't know it was that particular highway though anyway so i thought that was interesting but a little quick little update real quick on yesterday um i got to ontario california last night ontario is in the los angeles metropolitan area uh got to ontario last night um shut down for what they what we call an 8-2 split broke that's something for another whole another video but instead of taking a 10-hour break you do eight hours in the sleeper birth off-duty sleeper births all off-duty sleeper birth means you're in the truck you're not outside the turn it's probably straight eight hours in the sleeper berth and then after that you get however as long as you didn't drive all your hours the previous day you get however many hours you didn't drive back so what and then you can drive that amount of hours then you have to shut down for two hours and then you get the rest of the hours so you're basically chopping up you're splitting your 11 hour drive time and your 10 hour break or splitting both of those up and you're doing them in small segments it's really confusing but dot changed the way they did it so i messed up on i messed up on it uh today and uh so i got yeah well i got yeah my morning was not i didn't have a good morning this morning um so anyway um but that's that i did get here to ontario last night shut down but even i was able to leave here at 3 15 in the morning and i go i'm on my way to riverside because that's where i was delivering which was about 24 miles from here and i'm on my way to riverside and i'm on uh i'm on the the pomona freeway california 60. well i'm getting on the pomona freeway from i-15 and it's the the ramp to go east is closed so i had to go west well then the exit the next exit ramp is closer i can get off the exit you know and go underneath the interstate go underneath the highway and get back on going the opposite direction well it was closed and i had to go down to the next exit it was closed not so available the update on that uh for any of you out there wondering what's going on or why why it was late well again go check out my last video i did um and uh it's uh yeah go check it out you'll you'll get caught up so anyway um thank you guys for watching that is the legend of the black dog that's what i know hey if i find out anything else interesting i will update um there i did find in my research on it some interesting uh some other legends uh that are interesting you just don't hear about as much but i don't know maybe we can do a little truck or legend series huh that would be maybe that'd be something that people would be interested in i don't know let me know in the comments down below i want to get feedback so i know what i need to do anyway trucker just got this guy just got in the truck next to me is probably wondering what the hell i'm doing talking to myself so i guess i'll sit back so he doesn't see me anyway so that's it um thank you guys for watching uh i will catch you guys on the next video i don't know maybe i'll do another video today i don't know we'll see um catch you guys on the next video you guys uh guys remember hit the subscribe button like this video drop a comment down below and that would be greatly appreciated all right until then i will see you guys

production workshop today we have a five meter black dog cat caddy cabin it's actually come up really nice it's a beautiful it's a ford color actually it's almost a ford ranger color but a bit darker it's a lovely color boat great taste by the people that own it so this comes on one of our black dog trailers our custom trailers that have the um the now patented uh catch and release system that's just proving everybody wants one that buys a boat off us so we have the lovely little black dog decals here actually one thing interesting about this boat the people actually come to us and said hey we've got our own motor and i said well that's right i'm going to build you a boat so they supplied their engine we built the boat around it so this engine was not brand new it's actually a 100 horsepower four-stroke yamaha great engine um oh it's it's still current technology basically but it's done a few hours and it's probably six years old so they had an engine from an existing boat and we've built a new boat rounder it's an option that we provide all the time quite a few people said us hey can you build me a boat put on one of your trailers but we want to supply our own engine no problem with that so this boat here we have a light bait tank on the back of it there's a lot of stuff for a five meter boat come and have a look at this here's our fitted bait board look this is a really big bait board for a boat of this size four rod holders slots for your knives even has a heap of room underneath it for all your bits and pieces for your knives and hooks and stones and things lots of room under here they've elected to go with tote tanks just where they fill up with fuel there's no gas stations so they've elected go with tote tanks takes a little bit of price out of it and a little bit more convenient but you've still got to look after your tote tanks so they've got the tote tanks there so the 90 liter icy tech chili bin fits straight under the pipe style seat basis it's a seat facing aft somewhere to put your fish respect your catch that's always our model respect your catch is just the way to go it's what legacy's founded on you can put your food your fish perhaps even a couple of drinks in this and it's in this chili bin it's a great little option and it's just out of the way so standard they come with the white plastic seats which has gone with the upgraded squabs on it it's a good little boat it's a great little boat now the rod holders across the bimini the bimini folds down completely so the bimini if your shed heights that height your bimini folds completely down making the top of your windscreen the highest point a lot of customers come to us and one of the hardest things they have is the width length and height of their garage i can't do much about the width and i can't do much about the length but what look all i can do about the height we fold our bimini top down like this we fold our windscreen back like that now makes your dashboard the highest measurement i think that's 2.1 meters so this will fit in any shed that's 2.1 meters and have a look at this for going backwards it's just a couple of clips and the bimini top has a couple of thumb screws on either side and boom you have your boat that goes from 2.1 meters to a boat with a bimini top with rocket launcher hey we'll just go over how to actually launch one of our black dog cats this is a public ramp in uh in whangarei and one of the first things we do before we actually get down the ramp but there's not many people here today our strokes are actually made we actually provide little fittings for our strops to hook into we don't just have them hooked over anywhere so it's just we actually have clips welded onto the trailer and um you know they're just not plugged in they're meant to go there so we take both of those drops off look at that for simplicity look at that so we throw those in the boat and now we go to the front of the boat now this is where the magic happens it's only magic so we just let the boat go back just a tear so the weight's off the safety chain now with the windshield we let the boat gently go back to the painted catch and release system and then i just put the spring there i'm just going to idle forward on there a little bit the spring's going to take the catch and release system will let go pull it out again it'll fall off the trailer have a look at this so with the appropriate amount of water around the propeller i simply put it in here it's a lot of boat for five metres we run these all the time i've got a demonstrator a permanent demonstrator if you want to ride in one of these you give me a ring we'll take you for riding the five meter black dog cat cuddy thanks for watching", "PAzg9yxv9Q4": "[Music]

dog of Newgate is a legend concerning the haunting of the former Newgate Prison of London which was located next to the Old Bailey the Central Criminal Court close to Saint Paul's Cathedral in London England this account of a haunting based at the prison is an example of the English Black Dog category of supernatural manifestation featuring a spectral hound of ill-omen or malicious intent which is a notable archetype in British folklore and superstition the story recounts that during a famine in the reign of King Henry the 3rd of England a scholar was incarcerated in Newgate Prison who had the reputation of being a sorcerer a warlock who had done much hurt to the Kings subjects with his charms and devilish witchcraft the famine was so severe in the conditions so bad during this terrible period that the prisoners had already resorted to cannibalism and soon after his arrival they consumed this new rival who was unable to physically defend himself shortly after this crime was committed the inmates guilty of his death reportedly began seeing the specter of a monstrous black dog walking up and down the prison which they were convinced was the Sorcerer's Spirit returning to avenge himself upon his murderers this being reportedly killed and consumed those responsible one by one until the last survivors driven mad by fear broke out of the jail and escaped thank you for watching

want to share a dream that the Lord showed me last Thursday I usually don't have dreams but you could look it up in the Bible there's many men of God who had dreams and you know God guided them and directed them and you know in in Scripture also you know it says that men will dream dreams in Joel 2 it specifically says that and so with that being said I usually don't have dreams but in the past I've been able to interpret people's dreams I've asked the Lord to actually give me that gift and so with that being said I'm just gonna jump into this real quick let me I'm just gonna say some prayer real quick father I pray right now the truth cause every listener and watcher to engage in what the Holy Spirit wants to speak and reveal through me right now God in Jesus mighty name Amen so check this out I had his dream right I'm on the street and this white dog is comes after me I see him from a distance so I'm ready for him he comes after me starts biting me he wasn't too ferocious looking it was it was just like the dog was not really that scary looking now that I remember it but obviously he was trying to attack me you know what I'm saying it so he's coming at me he's biting me and I'm able to like it wasn't even a struggle almost like I just kicked them off me he bit me a couple times you know what I'm saying and and I got away but then all of a sudden not even unexpected this was unexpected when this happened I look and all of a sudden this black dog I can see him coming and he just popped up out of nowhere though like like I looked I was sunning this ferocious black looking vicious dog just starts attacking me violently I mean he's going out of here I just like going at him and I'm like fighting him off man it was and I was literally like I felt like he was trying to devour me I felt like he was trying to kill me you know what I mean and and I'm struggling with this dog I finally kicked him off me and and I'm able to get away you know but this struggle is much more intense much more just all-out fighting for my life you know what I mean compared to this white dog that attacked me first all right so check this out you know I wake up I'm like man how's this crazy dream lower like I know I'm like man I couldn't have been good you know but I asked him I asked God I said God you know if that's something you want me to understand and then reveal it to me you know what I mean help me just tell me to get the interpretation of that dream and you know God's faithful you know what I'm saying when we asked the Lord and it's according to his will he'll show us things you know what I'm saying is so he revealed it to me later on that day and this is what it was check it out blew my mind basically that white dog represented trials you know what I'm saying in my own life before you know in the past things that I've gone through and I'm still here I was able to shake him off you know what I mean and but this black dog represented a trial that was coming you know I mean and I felt like God was speaking to me personally but I also felt like this was something the body needed to hear cuz I felt I was also saying this is something that that that that is also for the believers in the time that we're living in and so with that being said check this out so what happened I'm like okay Laurel so what was this all about you know what I mean and I'm like why was one dog white and one dog black you know and the first dog I felt like God spoke to me I know he spoke to me he said that trial that dog represented trials that that I've let you go go through to build your character up you know what I mean things that that I that I've fashioned for you look you know these trials and and and I've got you through them you know and those were of the past but this black dog represented what was to come and he was black for a reason because he was representing the kingdom of darkness he was representing Satan and there's things that Satan is fashioning there's there there there's trials and salts and attacks that he fashioned you know I mean he's he's planning on dropping unbelievers in these last days you know and I was and and I felt like I was something you need to be prepared you need to understand that there's things coming on this earth that we have never that the earth is never witnessed the assault of the enemy that's coming upon believers and on this earth is is gonna be just something unlike we've ever seen ever ever and and we need to be prepared because you know I praise God that you know I was able to get away from that dog and I felt like God was telling me like you know if I'm for you who can be against you you know what I'm saying and God if God's for you then he'll get us through anything you know and um when I saw that dog I knew you know I knew I knew it was bad news you know what I mean and you know enough me enough of me just kind of talk I'm just gonna show you what God showed me you know what I'm saying because I felt like God was saying his people aren't ready just like what I was saying with the eleventh hour you know there's a lot of people who are asleep and named ready whether you're believer in Christ or not you know what I'm saying you've seen this if you don't believe in Jesus Jesus is calling you right out right now he is the way he is the truth and the life no one gets to the Father except through him so if you want to understand what's about to go down on this earth you need to you need to be saved you need to repent and get right with Christ and I'm not offering you religion I'm not even invited you to my church I'm telling you believe in Jesus he'll set you free and check this out so this is out of mark 13 it says for in those days there will be tribulation such as has not been since the beginning of the creation which got created until this time nor nor ever shall be this is Jesus speaking of what's to come and unless the Lord had short in those days no flesh would be saved Wow but for the elects sake but for outs people the elect whom he chose he's short in the days what does that sing he's speaking that there's gonna be believers in the midst seeing this but because we've been saved he's gonna take us out he's gonna shorten those days you know and I believe he's speaking of the rapture right there but I believe we're entering in to this tribulation that Jesus is talking about let me go on for false then if anyone says to you look here is the Christ sir look he is there do not believe it for false Christ's and false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders to deceive if possible even the elect there's gonna be dudes walking around with power deceiving doing signs and wonders and if we're not ready and prepared we're gonna be deceived if possible but take heed mark 1323 but take heed see I have told you all things beforehand God's warning us letting us know what's about to take place the end of the devil Satan and Retin revelations says he knows that his time is short and so that he's trying to pour as much wrath as he can he's already been defeated Jesus made it made his defeat on the made it up up made a public spectacle of his defeat on the cross you know what I mean when he died on that cross Jesus defeated him but see Satan he knows that he's headed for it for hell and so he's trying to take as many people as he can with him he knows that he knows that he's bet he you know he's gonna be drowning in the lake of fire for all of eternity but that's not what Jesus wants you to go and that's why I died you know I mean that's why he died us we shed his perfect blood made that sacrifice for you know what nobody had nobody else made that sacrifice you can think of any religious entity out there where's the sacrifice for what you've done for all the bad you've done in your life Jesus is the only one that died for you on that cross you know what I'm saying and so with that being said Amos 3:7 says certainly the Lord God does nothing unless he first reveals his secret to the prophets and I believe God is trying to let his people know it's about to pop off y'all and we need to be ready we need to have iron in our spirit and movable and unshakable pray and watch Jesus said to pray and watch you know what I mean and we're getting close y'all United States of America you know recession we ain't seen it yet it's it's gonna get worse we ain't seen nothing yet so be prepared be repaired ja you know I'm saying I took that word for myself you know the white and black Dawg y'all be prepared

dangerous let us go and get a picture of a women so because many of you do not know how women look like okay I found a women mm-hmm no this is not a women okay what about this one no this is not a

disturb the prayer and Allah will not receive your prayer how he knew that it's obvious it's so clear it's like light I just saw a vision now the vision I'm praying to Allah and then a donkey walked

say a red dog will disturb you well before the Prophet he answer I will explain to you the difference between a black dog and red dog Red Dog I never saw her in really red look at this guy I mean look at this guy I mean you cannot blame the Prophet hello I mean come on and he was wearing a jacket - I mean this is this is hilarious okay now we found a red dog so a red dog will not disturb your player only the black dog like okay well I don't know I mean both of them they have teeth and both of them when they speak they say ho ho ho and both of them they can bite and both of them they have

Gibson 2014 lpj with seymour duncan a logo two humbuckers and only use stock logic plugins completely in the box so this is what it sounds like [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the tune like I said I tried to faithfully reproduce the sound and the feel of Led Zeppelin fours black dog and the reason that song was interesting and challenging is because Jimmy Page as I understand that he didn't use an amplifier for the rhythm tracks instead he plugged directly into the the preamp of the console and used the gain on there to overdrive the guitar signal so I tried to do that using the the equivalent within logic which would be compressors eq's and some of the distortion plugins that come stock and logic the only thing that I used that wasn't stock and logic is the vintage the selection finished 30 IR that I downloaded for free on selections website which I'll link to in the in the description box but the whole point of this was to instead of buying gear specifically for certain things was to use what I had already and use that as a way to kind of push myself creatively so I'm gonna follow this up with a video on how I mixed it and go through all

watching an interesting and informative video on the meaning of dreams about dogs dogs mean far more than just loyalty please read the disclaimer carefully introduction to dog dreams while loyalty may be the first word that springs to mind when one contemplates the dog's attributes and symbolism it does not encompass the entire meaning of dog's dream symbolism nor does it encapsulate the dog's place in mythology dogs in dreams to empty's do indeed symbolize loyalty but they may be viewed as guardians guides fidelity symbols death omens while this article seeks to give the reader background into the dog's mythological history and provide insight into its common usage as a symbol reader should bear in mind that when it comes to interpreting a dog dreams meaning the final authority is oneself no dream guide not even this one should ever substitute for one's own intuition and mythological canines since dogs like cats have a rich mythological heritage they are also symbols with deep roots in the collective unconscious psyche when dogs appear and dreams the message they symbolically carry can have deep meaning for the dreamer some important method --nt mythological canines include Sirius Orion the hunters faithful dog who is so important in Greek mythology that he has his own constellation Anubis Egyptian mythology is god of the underworld who is picture with a jackals head foo dogs China's part dragon part land Guardian dogs whose statues are often found guarding temples the black dog known as Black Angus who according to Irish and British folktales visits one just before death each of these mythological dogs are embodiments of archetypal imprints left on the collective unconscious psyche unraveling the meaning of that blueprint will yield information valuable to uncovering the meaning of a dog black dogs in dreams dogs not only inhabit a place in the heavens as in the cases of orion's Sirius and the constellations of Canis Major and canis minor they are also figures of the underworld as the fearsome three-headed Cerberus who guards Hades his entrance and the cwn on the dogs of the Celtic Anand the dogs of the Celtic Otherworld on will attest since the dog is associated with the underworld and since the color black is often used to symbolize grief and death it may only be natural for the coupling of black and dog to end up in folk tales of black dogs as harbinger of death this is in fact the case in both Irish and British folklore variously called the churchyard beasts Padfoot and cous ice the monks other names the black dog is an entity whose encounter is means death is on the way usually tales of encounters involving this entity occur King life happening in much the same way that reports of ghostly encounters are reported the experience is usually of an altogether eerie nature with the dog reportedly being of a monstrous size with glowing red eyes when black dogs show up in dreams however the interpretation is likely to be highly symbolic as symbols of the language dreams speak to interpret a black dog in a dream one needs to break the symbol down into two parts first there is the symbolism of the dog itself to deal with as well as the color black dogs most readily symbolize loyalty and black most commonly symbolizes mourning or depression dreaming about a black dog therefore might symbolize a disloyal friend mourning over the betrayal or mourning over a lost or unfaithful lover one might even do well to consider the black dog a warning that the possibility for a depressing betray exists even if a black dog is Harold in death that death is most likely itself symbolic death symbolizes radical change the leaving behind of that with which one is comfortable and familiar in favor of the fleet unknown black can stand in symbolically as a symbol of the void one might interpret as being the unknown change and transition often involves loss if for instance one is moving to a new location in favor of pursuit of a career or relationship the loss of friends that will result from the chain result from the change might be interpreted as a black dog what is encouraging as as death dreams may sound is that as much as it is relegated to a spot in near the back of the mind death is actually a natural occurrence therefore in dreams this can indicate that the transition that one might experience will be a more natural step dogs as guardians the Chinese food dogs whose statues often sit outside temples in China are perfect examples of dogs as Guardians if the dream dog is one associated with comfort and it appears calm and at peace then the dream may indicate that the dreamer is enjoying similar things similar feelings that he or she feels safe satisfied and in the waking world one feels particularly secure dogs are not only mythological guards but are also trained by everyday people to guard homes and their owners some dogs are trained to guard by force others by bark check to see what the dog is doing in the dream is it barking if so the dog dream may be trying to call attention to something awry in the subconscious or to an unsafe situation in the waking dogs as guides in waking life dogs are often used as assistants animals in dreams the dogs that help guide in waking life can become entities that help one navigate the territory of that which is hidden in the subconscious just like dogs who can alert one to seizures or seizures or if out duma's in the waking world dream dogs can help one to see what is hidden in the realm of the unconscious that which is hidden can be surprisingly pleasant such as unused gifts or talents alternatively dream dogs can help point out an unpleasant aspects of the personality or subconscious ways the dreamer is engaging in self Saboteur conclusion in dreams dogs mean far more than just loyalty however dogs still retain characteristics they have in waking life to discern what a dog means in a dream requires one to be completely honest with oneself and always use one's own personal associations rather than blindly adhering to what is written in a dream encyclopedia always use articles such as this one as a starting rather than

so I did the recording last week I think but Windflower January 2nd January 25th three weeks almost four weeks now I've been still hand watering all 30 plants I need sick and tired of it I think I'm gonna start putting automatic drifters or just rippers I can manually activate I'm getting pretty tired of it I've been head watering these and last week I got a little busy and a lot of little leaves like you died Plus when your head water you can't really water too well sometimes see how I just watered the middle but yeah I'm gonna switch to drippers I don't know I've showed you guys but I used a wand and a pump and a hand water everything but I'm getting tired of that [Music] look at this one three weeks old he's hearing a nice little fat stop right now is gonna stop growing but I do feel like it's gonna burn eventually it's about 10 inches almost it's about 8 or 10 inches away from the light I think it's gonna start burning pretty soon typically what I would do is I'll tie it down I guess strong about to pee down from the canopy top Academy to be down from the top of the canopy when I want to do is tie it down sideways [Music] like that more gets light and it doesn't burn [Music] I don't know if anybody knows this after some people do I believe they call dragon dragon elder dragon tips here's a huge suggestion when your plans crawl up that way I think it can get a lot worse when your plan troll up that way that means they got too much water they got a little bit too much water and you need to cut it down on the water on them I believe they called the dragon or dragon nose I don't know but that's a good sign to look for when you do not want to overwater them under watering them does damage but it's better than over watering or overwatered I was gonna kill them one of the only ones I found a little bit too much water that one's not too bad you'll notice if you ever pay attention when you're starting ordering it look at it the next day and they'll curl really bad they can crawl really really really bad you can look it up online to see how it looks like when you're over water them that's what helps me a lot learn from their mistakes again this is 13 30 clubs 30

climate here the warm weather tourists love it but unfortunately so do parasites oh here's where they found me she rescued me her name is Talia she has rescued many dogs she's been doing that for years all found on the streets like me or worse anyway at first I was here it's a separate space she keeps in her home she can't have all of us together with too many and she's scared we'll get into fights she's not around all the time anyway she has to work although I know she'd love to spend all day every day with us so here is where I recovered and I became the gorgeous boy I am today all my friends from this cannot have been adopted Louise Thelma thrash us so I was left alone I started escaping and spending time with the rest of the dogs outside she put me back in I'd escaped again and so on and so on until I finally convinced her that I'm the best boy ever and I won't be causing any trouble so now I'm here with all the rest my place in the old kennel has been taken by new dogs there's always new dogs you won't believe the number of strays that are around here in a way I was lucky I got sick because that's what got me rescued the dogs are so many in the homes are so few that rescuers simply can't afford to rescue any dog they spot on the streets my life here well it's not that bad I get to hang out with my friends I get to take walks sometimes when the volunteers have time but what I really want is to hang out with people I'm a people's dog everyone loves me Charlie agrees that I'm the best dog she has George agrees to valya agrees oh she's secretly in love with me I know it and Lara agrees she would adopt me if she hadn't already adopted another perfect dog generally everyone who meets me loves me everyone who just sees me never looks twice they say it's my

you're too plain or too tall or too young or too old we just care about what's inside that's what matters my rescuers hope that someone sees me for who I really am and as they say Who I am is the perfect doc unloyal loyal to humans I just love them I think that there are my species actually I just belonged to them with them among them you know so why do I feel invisible sometimes it's as if

waistband light bearing Ulster I ordered this one from Black Dog concealment I would say that I'm happy with the holster seems to be a very good holster seems to be well made handmade one of the things that really stands out with this holster is the fact that it carries surprisingly well for how large it is it's a pretty big pretty wide in fact here's a table in here some idea it's about seven inches wide it's wide enough it really does impede with your ability to get to your pockets if carried about the four o'clock position and I knew that was gonna be a problem you know and that was one of my reservations about getting a holster like this initially to begin with so it's not the the company's fault the gentleman who made this it's not his fault it's big it just has to be it's not so very wide for those of you there's no reason why it's so why is because the light is wider than the gun do the surefire x300 and so you know how often am I gonna carry this this isn't my everyday carry gun just not I'm not gonna carry on I am I going everyday my carry flashlight with me everyday but I can't carry a light I'm a good every day so this is gonna be a very limited use holster but you know it's something I'm confident in I carried it for about twelve hours actually just yesterday and it surprisingly was comfortable you know outside the waistband holsters are I can conceal it actually underneath a light jacket and it's fine you know the I originally went with Black Dog concealment because I read some pretty stuff about them they were recommended on a forum I think somewhere somewhere point in time I can't remember who or where or when it's been too long ago um so I've kind of been keeping an eye open on them for a while I think I like is that this holster is only like 60 bucks I think as of 2014 December 14 you know the thing that really blew me away as I ordered this on a Friday night or Saturday Saturday ordered on a Saturday I got an email on Sunday that says it was shipping and then I got it on Thursday so it took less than a week and they even advertised on the website that they do not keep any holsters in stock they're made to order so then they got right on it they didn't take the weekend off and decide to wait until Wednesday to ship it and goof around I mean they got they got on it so alpha not a lifetime warranty which I thought you know is for me a requirement anymore for a Kydex stuff I opted for the little bit Pickers the 0.08 Kydex they come standard with 0.6 0.06 rather one thing that has changed with this holster is the amount of retention is these X 3 hundreds actually have a really hard with sharp you can see it's actually scraping my thumbnail off right there and so what it's done is that's where more the retention points are this holster that's right down here and so if you after all it just scrapes off a little bit and with this slightly compressed for the belt it's gonna have more attention than here on the bench but so far I'm very happy with the pretty satisfied with it also did get a double mag pouch from them this kind of happy with this too I didn't know it was gonna do this but I have these little Uncle Mike it just so happens that I can get like a double carry and six Glock mags in this bag so this is double mag here and this is what really surprised me is the other kind of stuff is just big it's gonna be bigger and bulkier and less we need to carry than the leather stuff it's just the way it is this one I mean it's it's realistic I mean it has to be able I'm gonna have to get the belt through here little loops are tall to get through so this actually carries really comfortably you know somewhere on the seven or eight o'clock position for me and it's a very concealable the mags are used to mix gold plating forward can still get a good grip on the mag I have a hard time with my hand shapes the shape of my hand actually get on a 70 mag and actually get my finger on the tip of the bullet the Nike mags for me or a lot easier in the 17th but it carries a 17 19 minutes just fine very happy with it so the guys are in the market for the Kydex holster man carriers whatever they got I would recommend them at this point I think that they got a good thing going five time warranty quick service actually there was a bit of a mix-up on my mag carry the loops here are one and three-quarter inch as opposed to the one and a half inch there it don't matter they sent that friendly well you now told him that these belt loops were the wrong size and they said no problem worshipping the right size out to you sorry that happened don't worry about shipping the old ones back to us so anyways it's nice little holster it says nut so I'm gonna use a whole lot I'll probably use this a lot more than the actual holster but you'd be very well made big kitchens right and I'm finish is good it's not perfect but it's good I've got the change of different sweat guard options I got I think no mid or a full I got the full I know if I've liked the full or not figured if I didn't like I could just cut it off so anyway you know his molding but he does seems good the jigs or whatever it is he made to accompany the light seems to be clean and nice and happy with it not sure how I'm going to attach this jacket I'm gonna probably attach this to a to the belt system permanently probably ain't gonna do away with these loops all together come up with a different fastening system do not tend to me be like a Molly belt or a duty tied belt that's so far I'm very happy with it generous side channel actually surprisingly I didn't know should but will actually carry a 17 or a 19 Glock with the x300 on here because the only difference is a little bit different length in the slide but all the controls everything are the same so you can carry if you get the 17 model you can carry the 19 and also know what this name live it's a nice little surprise the cutouts here I'm really generous they very well clear the lines across the top of the slide and no unnecessary material there stops short they're shorter the Tang I can get a good solid grip on the gun I'm gonna just use my thumb to push it out a little bit because the returns are there but if I get a post I got it on the belt I can just pull it out I can obtain a good firing grip on the gun while it's holster which obviously the guy who made this holster is a shooter and not just a holster maker so he knows what's going on so you good job very happy with it check him out Thanks", "-a95F0LA27Q": "Jedi I want to come to you today with a review of a outside the waistband codex pistol holster and double mag pouch holster I bought these with the intentions I needed something for my defensive

soft-sided mag pouch but they just weren't they weren't working for me I needed something that fit real close to my hips something that fit in tucked in tight but I could also wear as a concealed carry outside the waistband during the wintertime or in a situation if I have a large enough shirt or something that will conceal it without printing so what I came up with was the Black Dog concealment I put the links down below to their website check them out so far so good I ran about five pistol classes with them and they worked great the retention is really really good and they hold up to beating and banging and moving around and rolling on the ground and shooting prone and shooting laying on your back and they clean out really easy they don't hold a lot of dirt things like that so this is what I got I got the pistol holster with the ting degree can't for drawing from the waist like this and it works really really well you can adjust the can't further forward or further back depending on the adjustment on the belt loops but it works really really well it's made really really well sturdy it holds up also got the double mag holster that matches and they fit really snug to the bottom if you can see I raise my hands above my head they're tucked in tight the pistol and the mags as far as for quick reloads you can you can order how you want the bullets to face when magazine so when I pull it out I can index my I can index my my reloads so say if I was to have to reload quick pull my mag put my gun drop my mag pull this one I got my finger indexed on the bullet I can push like this slap it in place rack around and you're back in the fight once again you can stop the mag pull the mag out it's already indexed the bullets index you put your finger on there bring up to your mag wheel you can without having a look you know it's at pop it in rack around ready to go it's working really well for my classes it's working really well for concealment wise this four is what it looks like far as what it looks like with the shirt took down you can see a shirt tucked in which is how I wear if Texas ever goes to open carry but as far as the shirt tucked out it doesn't print real bad I mean of course this is I'm put my gun more forward more to the three o'clock position and standing here talking Eve it doesn't print real bad of course this is a little smaller shirt but y'all can see that but you know they they conceal really well I recommend them for anybody who's looking for a Kydex holster for training purposes or just for range purposes concealment purposes outside the waistband concealed carry i recommend this product to anybody I hope you enjoyed this video I'd like to shout out a few channels I like to shout out channels that are sub to me and try to

this [Music] going through it [Music] so [Music] you", "Msvu2UmZeQI": "alright guys so the basic the basic premise for doing your shelter is you want to find a place where you've got like some type of depression area if you have a creek bed or a river bed that's ride up and it's higher off where you can just take and lean them the more space you get in the better but for a shelter purpose quick expedient you want to get out of the elements you want to get some heat going you can take cut up some branches drop them down once you've got your your basic roofline you could take a emergency blanket you can take a couple trash bags you take the tarp whatever you want get your tarp up and over as much of it as possible pull it down to one side so that you're blocking off all air coming in from one side okay so basically what we've done here is we've taken the tarp we've covered up the shelter we got brie back here sorry Britney we got Britney back here covering one side of the the tarp with with dirt we're not too concerned about the blue on that side because there's no Avenue of egress or egress at this point so we don't have to worry about our security or safety from this point in time it's better if we do you always want to be concerned with being completely concealed but in this situation you know it is what it is so Britney if you could go ahead and pull that tarp Philip Lasser before you tarp as tight as possible okay once you've got it tight remember guys we were talking yesterday you don't just use your paracord use your individual strands as much as possible and this is about a three foot piece of paracord that gives us her strand still imma let you hold that brink with seven pieces so we're gonna use about two on each side there we go it's my favorite nut yeah my favorite knot is just tie loop on one side just secure it here it's not going anywhere or give them better you can actually tie loop in the next piece move it through pull it in and then that's nice and secure okay actually we don't need it on this one but duct tape phenomenal stuff highly recommend it ever get home bag you just have to have it every emergency kids go bag whatever you want to call it back to home bag is the newest terminology bth also highly recommend a lot of people rely on on tarps in their get home bags highly recommend Walmart camping store whatever automotive stores even get you a grommet repair kit otherwise once you once you start wearing that tarp out and the grommets start coming out your you're gonna have to start relying more and more on your it's no sense in wasting a whole piece of paracord for that when you can just use one of one or two of the strands save your paracord as much as possible okay once Steve gets that secure we'll have the first layer of our roof on after that we're gonna take who's got a neat tool on them get for training purposes scuse me up sir really it's better to do it off the trail some I'm gonna take your etool you want to get up underneath you want to get up underneath the grass too many rocks here no who's Ito is this who's Ito is this green tool yeah it's uh might want to get that replaced brings up a good point guys tools a good tool will save your life quality good quality a bad tool will eventually cause cause it to break and then your without that tool the different swing quality and cheap is typically just a couple bucks invest in a good etool I highly recommend Gerber Z tool you wanted by commercial one if you want military surplus that's always best because milspec has been put through the wringer you want to get the grass it's going to hold the dirt together but you want to get the dirt underneath because the dirt is your insulator and basically you just go on the other side of your tarp start covering up all of your logs from ground level forward then Pat them in there you go you know what let me have that your job is to start patting it in when it comes in we're gonna need quite a bit more that II don't need some work all the way up in there let's start patting all that down get it pushed down okay now I want to start doing this side over here you want to get up in there filling those logs first anybody have any questions about what we're doing so far no okay remember it's best to have gloves within you get home bag you need time anything you can do to protect your hands you want to be doing especially when you're in a situation where there isn't a hospital readily available and it's more than just placing them on the logs you want to Pat them down in because what you want to do is you want that dirt to fill any holes in the gap going from the open holes on top of the tarp you want to make sure you put it in kind of like an angle where it comes up and presses against everything okay now at this point I'll hold off on any more guys at this point your shelter for the most part with the exception of right here it's going to contain everything it's gonna continue heat it's gonna keep the rain out we've got sat on the back of the roof we've got the edges covered once you're ready to vacate this let's say this is your area for a couple of days where you want to do some hunting fishing whatever start rebuilding your food resources and purifying water come on under there okay so at this point y'all get the basic idea right you got your shelter covered you got the back covered you got your hedges covered once you vacate your shelter and you want to start smoking your meat whether it's fish or deer if you're fortunate enough to find a farmer's cow whatever right you want to make sure that all the rest of this is airtight so at this point in time because you're only going to be a little while you're not worried about tactical stuff you're not worried about being seen inside he's got their wire with them standing that's a great little kid dude you put this together yourself nice and and you know the gauge of the wire is up to each person I would use something a lot heavier gauge if you if you know anybody that's electrician or anybody that's in a voice dad audio/video communication network setups type things get some they're cat5 cable from cat5 cables phenomenal you take a little 20-foot piece coil it up dropping the bomb you packet doesn't weigh hardly anything but inside you have four pairs of wire that's about three times as thick as this right you can you can always strip that back as you need it but the basic premise once you turn your shelter into a smoke house the basic premise is to contain all the smoke because the smoke is what cures your meat right so before you finish covering everything you want to get your meat inside so you would take your wire run from one side to the other you want to keep it elevated off the ground quite a bit you want this to be as close to the ceiling as possible so when you lay your meat over the wire it'll it'll keep the meat up off the ground okay so for training purposes we'd say let's run you know three or four across and then have them set where we can just drape the meat over it's good to go ahead and get your meat hung if you've got something thicker than this go ahead and get your pieces of meat hung that way you're not actually laying in there while you're draping meat over okay you can just get a couple pieces three foot that's why I like a shelter to be four foot wide some three foot pieces of wire get them in to get them secured and have your your meat hanging on it you want to get your fire in the deepest part possible and you want to use as many embers and cause you don't want an actual flame going with wood burning right your main premises to smoke your meat so you build your fire somewhere up to here okay you'll have your your meat all hanging in here so you'll want to feed in a lot of leaves stuff things that are real smoky because it's the smoke that cures the meat you don't want to cook the meat you want to smoke it to preserve it once you've got your fire going you got your meat hung and everything then you need to close on this side at this point time you in this location tonight you're not overly concerned about it somebody conceder it's like a surface right that's when you want to get just a base cover on this side you're gonna secure with some kind of rock or something you're gonna keep lifting at the feed your fire right so get this over somebody grab some dirt and start piling up across here grab this again the premise here is to lock in as much stuff as possible and you could you're gonna have to come around behind me you could if you need to if you've got the additional resources and you got an extra tarp or something and you just want to take a piece of duct tape and tape the two together you can do that I say keep your duct tape for when your life depends on it not when you're just feeling lazy get that grass guys are gonna need some more this I thought we'd have enough but so you don't want grass across me and tie it over the entire thing you can if you're building this is a shelter you want to be here for several days you can we need some more the sod it make sure you get this area over here to real well okay matter of fact what we're gonna put some sod over there in a minute see now apparently we've got a couple areas where we've torn some holes in the emergency blanket who's got the duct tape I'm picking you're the star of the class this weekend look at you standing nice thing about the emergency blankets purchased sleeping bags you can always take the whole y'all it it's hot whose idea was to do this on this weekend train like you live live like the Train nice thing about doing training on a weekend like this is you know that if we do face the society Indian event at the end of July beginning of June or end of July beginning of August you know that you can get hump you can know you can deal with the weather okay you want to get this compressed down as much as possible Brittany we're gonna need to hit this corner a little bit more your basic premise is to make as much of it airtight as possible till it's done it's smoked through and through it depends on the type of meat like if you're doing salmon it all depends on the thickness as well I like to cut my meat for smoking it about between a eighth and a quarter-inch you don't want it overly thick so once you've got it when you're you're pretty much your open areas are covered you want to leave a little opening you can get into to put fuel mostly leave this stuff on your fire one of the things I want to point out is remember I know we did this yesterday when we built the shelter but remember it's not just about having a place to get out of the elements it's also about making sure that you're in a secure location okay yesterday when we vacated this area to go back to base camp we left logs and stuff like that cut up around here if this is really your shelter location you want to make sure that anybody that does start to walk down this trail doesn't see any disturbance broken branches that have dead leaves on them are perfect okay not live branches not not branches with green leaves on them okay because then it looks like you replace us up scattered around make sure you clean up your mess where you're cutting up the wood and all that kind of good stuff you're good to go footprints footprints you're good to cover so folks that's that's basically your shelter you turn your shelter when you're done you turn the shelter in your smokehouse and smoke your meat you've got good cover so any of the smoke that does get out is gonna get dispersed among the branches it's like when you're when you're building a fire in the brush step back a little bit instead of if I'm worried about the security situation sitting me building my fire here I'm gonna build my fire up in here underneath the the the branches with all the foliage and everything because this foliage would like to dissipate that smoke so that we're not looking off somebody's not looking off and seeing this huge trail of smoke coming up right you should not beat your smoke house location for more than 18 hours okay okay you want to get your meat cutting strips that are small enough and thin enough to where you know you're talking six eight hours max okay you know you the premises you get up in the morning get your final day here you've done your hunting you've done your fishing right your final day here you want to immediately turn that into a smokehouse get your meat the smoke and get away from the area get up in here because even you know even though you're doing it in the area where most of the smokes gonna be captured in the leaves you're still gonna get some out so for security you want to get over here you want to get up over here we can keep an eye on and still feed it but watch it from a distance so if somebody does stumble across it yeah they're not somewhat across you when this is a shelter when you're up in here before we converted this into a smokehouse this was all wide open when you're up in there this should be the place that you've got your fire going anyway you should have had if you're here for two three four days you should have some really good Emperor's already going some good cause already going because you've been in there building on this this little fire the whole time you're there that's why that's why you leave a little bit here and you would exposed so that your fire has a way for the smoke but you're still trapping in the heat inside the shelter as much of it as possible you just you need a place where you can log her up for a couple days gather up some resources get it prepared to last you four five six days while you're continuing to move trying to get home alright guys let's wrap it up here then grab your emergency blanket you tart get rid of all that clean up the area so make sure we don't leave any trash down here for Jerry to a bush hog over later and let's head back to base camp", "vgAHKbUci6Y": "all shocked yes I see mi sits there about 30 years ago what a wonderful night it was I always remember the moves is fullest in fact I'd never seen such a beautiful night and as I was pushing the old bike I heared these rattling of these chains and I thought to myself oh well that's nothing that's just a matter the horse ran off the marshes that kept coming nearer and nearer local people still talked about the black dog and there are very regularly eyewitness reports cropping up and I thought sure well I better stop here and let it pass and it was past me as a forum is a great big black shaggy dog and do you know what it was a gate dead opposite and that passed through this gate but when I got to the gate that never had been opened it's not just a fuss the old legend dating back to the 16th century [Music] this tale begins in 1577 and deep in the heart of eastern England a hellish monster appeared one day outside Blythe a church amidst the mightiest of storms closer and closer he got to the door while a large congregation sang pensively inside with a huge clap of thunder the church doors burst open and the ghostly black dog made its deadly entrance crashing through the building this hound from hell sent parishioners scattering killing to and toppling the steeple through the church roof the dogs parting gift were scorched claw marks in the church door and they remain to this day what is it about black dogs why not dogs of any other color and why dogs in particular black is of course a color of ill omen and is associated with death so that has something to do with this I think but dogs are also such interesting animals from the point of view of their relationship with humans and their kind of role in in human symbology the doggies are our closest friend we domesticated it 15 thousand years ago and we rely on it for help for protection for keeping us company but at the same time if you call someone a dog that's very insulting a dog can turn on you and bite you the black dog store has become a very popular legend and narrative heather's almost certainly been passed down by word-of-mouth like quite often give lectures to educational groups and to the local school and a few years ago I had a group from primary school here these were 6 or 7 year olds and at the end because they were very quiet and that rather frightened I said well if thought what happens a long time ago and I don't suppose the black dog everything's ever around now and at that point a little girl stuck up her hands and said please sir he is my granny's seen him and then a boy stuck up his hand and said yes my brother's seen him too sir so it for them it is something very realistic because they've heard about it from their own people within their own community so I said to the villagers the next night when I got there the whole store and they said were less nothing that's what they call old shucks he ruled these rules pretty frequently he's been seen many a time but I said I never see anything like that before these stories tend to take a very similar form across the world stories of creatures which Herald the the fact that somebody is going to die quite shortly or that some disaster is going to strike the community but you can slot in different animals into that global story depending on what local belief ascribe to those those creatures the logical explanation would be that it was just a thunderstorm a fairy die consequences it certainly was one of the worst storms has never been recorded there's probably never been anything like it in our area before but because people that time the very superstitious they tended to think that anything that happened that was good came from God and anything that was rather worse came from Satan in Britain they do tend to be dogs but they're not always dogs for example in Denmark the kind of black dogs that we have in Britain which God's church shots and prowls around them to keep out and keep in spirits of various sorts in Britain that's a black dog but in Denmark this is sometimes a sow which is a rather unusual animal perhaps to be patrolling a churchyard and if you met one I think you would be suspicious that it was a supernatural being and not just an escaped Pig [Music] local people have taken it to their heart we've got a number of organizations that call themselves after the black dogs we've got the black dog football team called the black dogs we've got a black dog arts group as a black dog antique shop in the town and funnily enough the coat of arms for the town also has a black dog on it there are let's say energies that's perhaps the the kind of closest thing I would come to identifying that make certain places feel strange and then when people are spooked by those energies then what they see or they think they see or they hear or they think their hair is is culturally formed by these stories and the beliefs that they know the stories come across as very realistic so when I'm told the stories I tend to think that it has been a real experience for the people involved what they're saying is what they actually experienced and witnessed myth or not the tales of black shock have influenced generations and left a legacy and a legend burned into English folklore you you",

"keeping a dog's claws in perfect condition is imperative to avoid leg injuries if we acquire the right tools it's possible to trim the nails ourselves of course we need the right method along with these tools so animal wise brings you the step-by-step guide to cutting your dog's claws at home but some helpful tips to ensure it goes smoothly [Music] why is it important to cut your dog's nails normally dogs wear their nails darn when walking on hard ground this might not always happen so we should check them ourselves to see if they are too long if a dog's nails grew excessively they will be unable to walk properly uncomfortably they begin to adopt awkward postures leading to serious health problems such as sprains or injuries to their paws also the nail can grow so long that it burrows into the skin leading to pain and potential infection how often should the nails be cut a dog's nails should not exceed the pads of their paws as soon as we see them start to approach the end of the paw pad it's time for a trim what does it take to cut a dog's nails to be able to cut the nails of a dog at home without hurting them you'll need the appropriate tools for small and medium-sized dogs the most advisable thing is to use a pair of clippers preferably with a guard like this it's important to note that trimmers like cause come in several sizes so it's essential to choose the size which best suits our dog for larger dogs it is best to choose a guillotine style clipper with a more effective design and if we are to unsure of our own ability to trim a dog's nails with clippers as they do not like to be manipulated we can still use a nail grinder instead it's easy to use and allows us to file the dog's nails to the perfect length finally we recommend having styptic or silver nitrate harder to stop hemorrhaging if you accidentally cut too much both can be found in veterinary clinics now that we have the right tools we can talk about the formation of the dog's nails and how far we should cut inside the nail is living tissue which we should never cut since this would cause great pain to the animal the tissue can be observed by looking at the nail and the light showing a line of pink coloration which doesn't extend to the tip this is our cutting limit it is also imperative we cut in a straight line or at a slight angle which follows the natural shape of the nail if your dog has black nails and you cannot see the tissue you should place the dog in a flat surface and trim the nails on the grind now we start with these steps if this is the first time you've trimmed your dog's nails you should familiarize them with the Clippers and relate them to positive stimuli to do this let them smell the Clippers and give them a reward when they do this must be done for a few days before the Clipper create a relaxed environment and accustom your dog to being touched on their legs if you haven't done so already ask another person to help by holding the dog grab one of the nails and examine it see the living tissue and know how far to cut cut the nail with clippers in a quick and safe motion if you take too long it can make the dog nervous and they'll try to escape repeat with all the other nails for black nails you can use the grinder simply turn it on and place the nail on the right part following the product instructions if you cut too much stay calm stop the bleeding with the partner and reassure the dog so there can as well in addition to the previous guide we share some tricks and extra tips to ensure this is a positive experience for everyone touch their paws and nails on a regular basis so they get used to being handled present the clipping tools positively and reassure them not to be scared avoid cutting your dog's nails when stressed nervous or in a hurry it's best to carry the side one cam during the nail cutting session don't forget to use words of encouragement and reassuring pets who they associate the experience positively if you notice you're too tired or nervous stop and do it at another more appropriate time synthetic pheromones can sometimes help create a relaxed environment if you adopt your dog as a puppy start this routine as soon as possible only use clippers which are dogs specific be patient and positive as not all dogs will get used to this routine quickly if your dog

breeds and sometimes it's just all about their looks among the various breeds are some of the black dog breeds that always stand out the color black resembles strength power and authority in fact black is often regarded as a prestigious color it's also probably why black is one of the most common dog colors too there are a large number of dog breeds that have black coloration but are few breeds as mysterious yet elegant with that said we listed ten of the blackest dog breeds before we start what would you name this black puppy let us know in the comments number 10 Connie Corso well the Connie Corso comes in other colors apart from black a black Connie Corso can strike fear into the hearts of people who aren't familiar with the breed Connie Corzo were bred to hunt game like wild boar and guard property so they can appear to be quite threatening although they can be loyal companions and protectors when well-trained and properly socialized but they can become aggressive or even deadly in the wrong hands so this isn't a breed for the novice dog owner number nine Newfoundland Newfoundlands also come in chocolate and Landseer color variations but black is by far the most common coat color for this friendly family dog while new fees are some of the friendliest dogs you can meet they shed and drool excessively they also need quite a lot of brushing especially when the seasons change the Newfoundland was bred to retrieve nets from water and they love to swim especially since they're thick black coat can cause them to overheat in the summer number eight Scottish terrier while black Scotties are commonly pictured these terriers do also have gray whedon a sandy blond or brindle a multicolored striped pattern fur coats with any you're looking at the personality of a big dog and a little dog's body high-energy excitability and independence though the ten inch tall dogs may seem the perfect height for toddlers this breed is best for adult households or those with older respectful children number seven black norwegian l count the black Norwegian L count is nothing short of a versatile and amazing dog breed they were bred in Norway to help take down some of the biggest and baddest game in town despite the relatively small size these dogs assisted with hunting bears and moose when they're not on the field they make superb watch dogs because of their high dog IQ even when it comes to herding and agility they thrive because they're so athletic number six flat-coated retriever the flat-coated retriever has been affectionately nicknamed the Peter Pan of dogs due to their puppy-like demeanor throughout their life no matter what they'll be cheerful and playful dogs as the name says this Retriever has a flat coat that's usually solid black but sometimes in liver they do have some feathering on the licks ears and occasionally on the tail if you're looking for a big black dog but loved dogs in the puppy phase this is the dog for you number 5 Giant Schnauzer the Giant Schnauzer maybe the big black dog breed that can grab everyone's attention giant schnauzers probably descended from standard schnauzers rather than the other way around they are intelligent active dogs who are happiest when they have a job to do especially if that job involves protecting their favorite person their coat needs regular brushing at home and regular clipping otherwise the giant schnauzers beautiful black coat can become matted and painful for the dog number 4 black German Shepherd you're probably familiar with the typical black and tan or great coloration of the German Shepherd but did you know they also come in all black varieties if you ever came face to face with a black Shepherd your initial instinct might be to run away since they look like a black wolf dull fret there's more to love than to fear from this canines majestic features contrary to popular belief black German shepherds aren't months they're actually the result of recessive gene that affects coat colour thanks to the recessive gene it's possible for two German Shepherds with normal coloration to produce one or more puppies that are all black number three Black Russian terrier a big black fluffy dog breed that doesn't shed much and won't be found in every dog part in the country so Black Russian terrier a newer breed that's still rare in the United States also called Blackie's the Black Russian terrier was bred to be a military and police dog don't let this worry you they're quite friendly with their families unlike most of the other dog breeds on this list the Black Russian terrier needs regular haircuts this is because the hair that doesn't shed just keeps growing if left untreated and can become matted and uncomfortable number two skipper key the skipper key is a small breed from Belgium that made its name as a barge dog in the early 16th century on ships they serve jobs such as catching rats and guarding supplies for this reason they even called the little captain dock the black coat is profuse around the neck shoulders and legs giving the breed a silhouette that accentuates a thick substantial body the foxy face completes the unique look of a unique braid if you can't tell a skipper key from an ordinary dog you simply haven't been paying attention number one Belgian Shepherd the Belgian sheepdog known as the Ronin Dale in Europe is the solid colored variety of the four Belgian Shepherd dogs elegant and graceful he has a long black coat and an imposing appearance that would make everyone amazed another handsome feature of the breed is the exceedingly proud carriage of the head and neck he's athletic as well as beautiful and maintains the working ability for which he was originally known the Belgian sheepdog combines the versatility of a working dog with a gentleness of a family companion like the other herding breeds also the Belgian sheepdog requires a good amount of exercise every day so these were ten of the blackest dog breeds which is your favorite dog breed and its color let us know in the comments and if you like this video then subscribe and turn on notifications soon we'll be the first to know when

for as always you've got four points to cover on this strain smell no so I smell ya your toys face you do why do you want everybody together okay so I do one you do one yeah I don't want you do what I do want if anything we do if the effect sir hello welcome back to another episode of strain cane as my name is Rizla and this is a spoiler TV channel for stoners just let you don't be scared don't be afraid don't be shy you are okay guys it's okay to smoke weed and this is channel that loves you and hopefully you love me and if you do love me I'm gonna search straight away give me a thumbs up on this video this is a weed view it's a Wednesday which means it's weeds day so too much talk as always let's get on to the next strain of reviewing what are we reviewing today on weeds view well there's a story guys I've been saving my buds for this very special day and on today's episode we're gonna have to cover this one because I thought if you'd be in this situation before you've been saving a bud and you've put it in you've put off but actually knows what it was I put it on a tray I first was gonna pin a pot then I moved the pot and put it on this tray because I was using the popper saying else so then I put the draw on the train the thought the the bud on the tray and then I don't know how much just not realized and I've put that in a grinder and grinding it up didn't smoke it just grind it up and then I realized wait a minute what have I grinded up and I've grinded up the black dog oh gee also known as black do gee I think it's the same thing let me know if it isn't on the comment section if you know they are two different strains I fit they're the same string so black dog or black do gee he's getting reviewed and this is what's left of it guys I did rude mash up in the grind off do apologize but I think it's mochi though did I so that's something I'm smoked it and if you want to see what it looked like it's anyway looks like good job that I actually recorded the clothes socks before this [ __ ] off so yeah that is the read we're reviewing today have you smoked this drink before I'd love to know if you have if you've heard about the strain and you haven't smoked it but you really want to smoke it then put that in the comment section as well put everything in the comment section give me your phone number whack it in the comment section don't give me your phone number if you want to give me your phone number won't you give me your phone number you became mean everyone abused this video your phone number so do that at your own way your own a call to just do it and if you want to do it people phone you don't blame me blame yourself so too much talking there's always on the on the weed view auditions where we don't cut it out most of people don't cut it out really any time it does get cut out if the battery was to go and the batteries on about 30% right now and that's okay and another reason why we've cut it out is if someone phones me my phone is here somewhere so there was a chance of that probably will happen some probably does foamies you in a week view and it will cut out then if not should be just me blabbering away flagging my way through this review as I try and give you what my personal opinion is of this amazing strain which are always so amazing that I would say make amazing strain I just smoked amazing strength so this is an amazing strain they're all amazing and their own little way really very seldom do I come across the string that hasn't got some kind of unique amazing points of it this is not this is saying I was this green boys I'm making right now don't you smoke a spliff while I stop the show actually but hey it was already half smokes and I want to spray the rest of it so sue me so four points the cover as always on the weed view we are looking at the site the sounds silly again don't mean this why why why do you say the sound this comes it just comes out so easily sight sound we're looking at the sights the smell the smell of it not the sound the smell of it we're also looking at the tastes and of course that was important the effects I do give Hoffs and I have known to be quite generous with the scores so if you do disagree with me and then again comment section below slag me off tell me what you really think of this train if I'm screwed up too high or if I screw it up too long as well let me know as well so just finish this last bit of it we see not - what you smoking right now there's another question for you before we even covered the strain another question what you're smoking right now how you actually smoking the black do G can you smoke in a black dog so let's talk about the history of this and I always get my history from various websites such as Leafly so if you want to find out what I find out just going to leave things we do together me there's the phone call there's the cup [Music] sorry guys but yeah I knew there was going to be at least one phone call during the show and that was the one hopefully that only one of the show so that I've been done with let's get back to the black dog or the black do chief I haven't decided which we're going to call recently a black dog make it easier so let's go to the black G which we do get site no but the line is first song we and the PhD from this so it's coming up now anyway Shh but it looks like it's a cross of emerald heads - no yeah his head special or emerald headband no you'll find out cuz you'll be reading it and the other one was a Blackberry or a think blackberry maybe blueberry but it would make sense if as black bear with it so you'd be expecting some of the blackberry or blueberry to be in the taste of this and the the pictures the photo is coming up now guys again so you can see what we're looking at it was very very dark I'm looking at the grinded up leftovers now but it still looks very dark very very dark I mean I'm talking extremely dark I'm dark Browns dark greens and then they and again I'm not just saying this because it is called black dog but even so dark the greens that they do appear black and yeah okay I'm not just saying because old bloke in the title really it is got black in the buds in that dark I mean it's not black so dark green so dark that it's just you know you can't retell that it is a green it just doctors black or Satan that yes thank for you guys humans can pick up different variations of one color than more than any other color and that is green why if you know why I put in the comment section and if you don't I'll let you know at the very end of the video does it know maybe I'll watch the whole thing if I remember anyway try try and remind me during the video dry and remind me somehow if you're watching this live which you wouldn't maybe if you are somehow or you're a time traveler come on think let's do it let me know what we're talking about I have no idea what it's all about do you know what I talked about hopefully you do hopefully someone out there doesn't because if you do email me all right sites first we're gonna go site scoring at a 10 and as I said it looks amazing and it's half me to tell now but it wasn't that compact it ruin he's not coming back now is it the bug was in compared to some of your oh geez out there and some of your buds that you're getting not knowing near as some of the buds that I've got lined up for reviewing and ass I mean I'm gonna give it a very because I like the darkness of it very very just just layered with different colors of of dark Browns oranges greens just loads of them I'm gonna give it to give it a seven give it a seven half not as much frost coming from it you know could we see too much resin and I don't really you know don't really think is probably maybe the the best sample of the black dog oh gee but you can only review what's in front of you so yeah I'm gonna give it 7 for the look for the site up next not the sound oh no no no no no we're looking at distinct facts are what smells like I wish I could smoother but there but this it breaks it up nicely in a way so weird it smells a bit hazy it's a cush this must be hazing I think that's the finest in it very piney very just smells like you know if you're having a naked bath under a waterfall in a shower under waterfall and you know it just has hitting you mmm nature mother nature hit me mmm like that it's like fresh goodness outdoor mother nature us so it smells like we've Oh snows oily like like you know the oils that you got a bio oil and stuff I know just seeing the oils feel no like scars and stuff to do that the ex used to use boil off the scar here 26th birthday there's 20 ships birthday someone might trip me over and was bashing into each other like that in London and you know just bashing like that anyway he changed the whole rules of the game about and let me know when we're quite drunk to come back from my birthday and been on the piss all day and instead of just bashing into me he decides now to put his foot out and trips me over so I trip over and whack my chin first first thing to make contact to the hard floor of Westminster or yeah if it was West Minister's train station the hard are always metal floor that I what floor is marble floor straight onto my chin spit the whole thing open just blood coming it everywhere it took me about three hours to get home I was living in Greenwich at the time so maybe free maybe longer food four hours to get home and to go hospital straight after that and got the food stitched up yeah by your will and smoked quite a bit of it this the spin a bit vile oh really so yeah wailing it's a helicopter going past hopefully not after the Black Dog you know after me are you guys they found me [ __ ]

what it tastes like take that [ __ ] [ __ ] don't nobody move it tastes really nice did you know what when I was smoking this quite a bit when I first had it I had quite a few different oh geez with me and it wasn't tasting it was definitely one of the least frame for other oh geez that I had at the time and now I haven't smoked some oh gee I haven't smoked for quite a bit and I'm it smoking Herms and various how am i smoking but if you're Hayes's recently into them and some upper cookies but no GQ issues and I can really taste the edginess now what is what's going on with the taste of the new place dog the first bit you've got is that oh gee that really oh gee murky powdery darkness yeah you got that straight away but then it tastes in the taste changes but it doesn't change like a gradual taste it's like almost like a Shh stop and I'm getting dirt a dirt wall taste this is crazy oh gee stop dirt dirt like mud proper muddy Rudy dark I mean I I bring a taste like it what the name really is proper black taste dark taste some people hate this I think your og lovers out there would be confused with this people that like your flavors would find this disgusting it was a really small niche of a stoner I think that would really appreciate the taste in this and I'm I think I'm one of them I think I like it doesn't give me doesn't give my brain a time to a time to rest it's like straight on with sank else read really dark taste alas I'm gonna give it a night I mean I get the taste hey you again want I get anything enough but I'm gonna give it a night hold on I'm gonna

getting onto the OG getting onto the cookies giggling because I think this is a hybrid maybe you looking about again roughly your 70/30 dominant to the in decide indica site but don't hold me to that information will be popping up hopefully but the effects on this not much of a couch lock one you know like you can really glue or you know you know maybe you grind any purples and stuff like that maybe from the ones I've not reviewed manipulation big nuclear ago but yeah grand navy purple you know very relaxing well all-around hybrid really with the effects not a too strong I think it was between 16 and 20 percent and the THC I couldn't even smoking this exactly what the THC than if you could be if there's any stoner out there that could smoke a strange oh yeah that's 19 and a half th see the but I think it's quite strong but not your strongest but you saw what was about the strength visit really it's all about the other decides to it as well the textures are the smoke they mean

you move gonna make you sweat gonna make you groove uh-uh child where you shake that thing gonna make you burn gonna make you sting hello karen that's how we're starting i don't know i could use it welcome friends fiends and everything in betweens and let me tell you a tale from gods and goblins this is a podcast exploring the bizarre and beautiful mythology folklore and fairy tales of the united kingdom we will share tales of fearsome giants valiant heroes witches and wizards ghosts and ghouls and fantastical fauna and flora and fauna is the name of the game today because this may well be the best doggone topic we've covered so far yep get ready to howl at the moon with fascinating and far-fetched tales and perhaps even a few shaggy dog stories oh question are these the hounds of love that are haunting these fair isles or must we ask instead who let the dogs out could it be the devil himself well hot dog perhaps i've hounded you with enough puns at this point there's more than you can shake a stick at yes today we will be examining the law of the black dog jurassic bark you're you're the worst you are you are the absolute worst i don't care is this is it just you making up for for all my dog plans last episode yep these are all mine now stop chasing your tail you idiot and let's introduce ourselves that means nothing you are so critical of me stop nagging me oh my god okay look let's introduce ourselves shall we my name is heather morehouse and i am your co-narrator for this one we're going to be splitting it in half a little bit i'm going to be taking some sections and my co-narrator over there will be taking some sections too who are you my name is bamba gascoigne that's not a dog pun no i'm kieran hill yes the lone wolf oh and i'm a bad dog no no i'm a good dog i'm a very good dog the whimpering chihuahua the beagle of brighton the brighton beagle like it i've got something to tell you are you ready i think i might be it's spooky season [Music] yeah exactly it's the time to get spooky it's absolutely freezing all of a sudden the autumn equinox has occurred and now it's cold and that means getting all cozy inside and frightening yourselves with ghost stories that make you be frightened to go in the bathroom and look in the mirror that that sounds like a very personal experience that's usually the bit that scares me [Laughter] um okay i thought i was going for something universal but that's fine in the podcast we are going to be getting a little bit frightening a little bit spooky the bit that scares me is after watching films having to pass open windows in the dark yeah yeah i say open i mean windows of a curtain's open not just opened up windows yeah and because we're really tight we have like no curtains in our house basically every window you go past is uncovered and as such who knows what kind of scary faces could appear we do have a massive massive window uh just just before the stairs so if you want to go to the loo at night you have to go past a really big completely unsheathed window scary it is quite spooky yeah we should probably put a curtain up wait no we shouldn't we must embrace the spooky what if some kind of zombies there that would be cool no sure yeah okay i really struggle to understand how people can be scared of zombies well particularly if they're old-school shambling zombies they don't seem particularly frightening but like maybe the more kind of modern super fast hyper strong zombies i see i actually find these shambling ones scary they're more creepy but they're less scary as in they're gonna kill you yeah i suppose it's the inevitability of this shambling zombie no matter how far you go eventually they will get there crawl of the shambling yeah i hear their metaphors are they a metaphor for capitalism you know some but yeah they actually kind of were working yeah that was that was for point i think okay kieran has a degree in film theory he didn't do a lot of work but he's got one it was a pity degree the fact that i showed up in my third year was enough for him to go you know what he he kind of tried i i spent five years studying film altogether to discover i don't really like watching films so how have you been i've been fine i think i've googled can you die of tired almost every day for the last four weeks [Music] and the results inconclusive nonetheless i have been in high spirits regardless i've been having a nice time watching the g1 the wrestling apex of the year it's been very nice we in fact woke up this morning had a little lion had a pot of coffee a quasal and watched some japanese boys beat each other up and it was a beautiful start to the day you couldn't ask for more there's a crisp wind in the autumn air japanese men are hurting each other and i feel great speaking of escapism i've been fine by the way okay how have you been i've been doing great i i was gonna say just the let people know ahead of getting into the episode this is our third attempt at recording this one first episode was delayed by construction work next door and then as we're getting in to the second time so this episode is about black dogs ghost dogs i got a text as we're getting into the meat of the episode so that my my my childhood dog had died yeah um so this episode is dedicated little murphy rest in power buddy what a bloody good dog he was he was he was maybe there would be a picture of him posted at some point on instagram yeah oh that'd be nice everyone should see what a cutie oh so where are we starting heather well i think we should start with giving a little bit of an overview of what a black dog is in this context this isn't just a dog that's black of course the apparition known as the black dog is one of the most prevalent creatures of folklore that inhabits the british isles they are spotted almost everywhere and they have been spotted throughout many centuries you could kind of say that they are a consistent aspect of the british subconscious since the beginning of the 18th century to have a black dog on the back was a phrase that meant to be depressed or melancholic and indeed the famous british prime minister winston churchill famously used the phrase to describe his own mental health struggles i can imagine having to carry a large black dog around on your back would be would lead to melancholy tiring and also it's probably going to hump you yeah it doesn't it doesn't allow for much privacy either or freedom of movement no however the origin of this phrase is rather more sinister this demonic specter in the form of a great black dog haunting you in the night would be enough to make pretty much anyone feel distressed you're not wrong i mean perhaps we're just an unlucky people as this ghostly hound has appeared to a great many unfortunate people throughout the years as i previously mentioned one standout aspect the black dog myth that has been noted by many a folklorist is just how prevalent this apparition is throughout the area richard jeffries in wildlife in a southern county notes the black dog has perhaps more vitality and survives in more localities than all the apparitions that in the olden times were sworn to by persons of the highest veracity they may still be heard of in many a nook and corner and in english fairy and other folk tales edwin sydney heartland similarly calls attention to how commonly the idea of these spectral black dogs has been believed even by minds skeptical of other folkloric creatures and concepts he says they seem to occupy a distinct branch of english mythology they are supposed to exist in one form or another in almost every county and few kinds of superstition have more strongly influenced the credulous mind i do like how in a lot of these old folklore texts from the turn of the century how often the writer will be like here's a story that was related to be by someone who's very very honest and super super smart as if they have to preface it by going so it's probably real as if we're not just reading it because it's kind of fun and interesting i've got a couple of those coming up in later bits like there's one that like really goes too late to go oh he was a soldier and he was he he'd risen very high in the ranks and he was quite old so he must have really known what he was talking about which is why he's going to tell you about a ghost dog that kills that kills people through fright oh spoiler i've also noticed the myth of the large cat seems to be as prevalent like almost every county i've ever lived in has had some sort of mythic large cat roaming the countryside it's almost like we've only got like two animals yeah anytime like a pharmacies are shaping a distance my god that must be a giant cat i mean in fairness i am a cat owner and always have been and pretty much any time i see like a bag on the floor or a jumper or a shoe or a bowl in the corner i'm always like oh it's the cat no yeah i'm exactly with you so i think you know if your brain just sees a blob you're like probably probably an animal isn't that your house no no that's a dog no it must be from the pits of hell that's sulfur your house is on fire jeff no no no i'm incredulous i am a man of the utmost veracity look at many books and whiskey i carry in my arms okay so as tales of black dogs are such a frequent occurrence in british folklore we are fortunate in having tons of accounts of these creatures at our disposal very handy for us and there are so many in fact that folklorists have been able to put these stories and anecdotes into distinct categories and pick out some of the most common recurring traits from the most obvious for example it looks like a big dog that's black to some a little more otherworldly but let's commence with the broad categories that have been described to these hounds expect some overlap of course it can never be totally simple there's always variance and contradictions but for my convenience and your convenience let's organize things i do like to be organized once again edwin sydney heartland in his english fairy and other folk tales published in 1890 wrote according to popular psychology making it a bit scientific there the subject may be divided into three parts one black dogs which are really fiends in the form of dogs two the spirits of evil persons who as part of their punishment have been transformed into the appearance of dogs or three evil spirits that to mimic the sports of men or to hunt to their souls have assumed the form and habits of hounds and then theo brown in his essay the black dog which was published in the publication folklore in september 1958 volume 69 number three page 175-192 published by taylor in france is limited on behalf of folklore enterprises limited we are not being done for plagiarism how dare you i cite my sources now the first couple of episodes i really didn't it's available on jstor if you make a free account you can read it it's really good and i'll be referring back to this source quite a lot throughout the episode and although theo is writing almost 70 years later than edwin sydney heartland he splits his dogs into pretty similar categories he says we may distinguish three separate species of this ghost dog a the bar guest which i'd say is closest to the evil spirits category that heartland provided us with remember this name i'll be talking about the bar guest and other specific named black dogs in part two oh yes it's a two-parter it will never not be a two-parter oh yes i just can't stop myself this is not a snappy podcast alright episode two will be even spookier than this one so if this one turns your blood cold then just you wait i'm going to be with you if this one turns your blood cold you probably shouldn't listen to me you're a wimp bee is another variety of black dog not mentioned by heartland and theo brown does mention is rare but appears in a certain locality in conjunction with a calendar cycle for example guernsey wayfarers are worried by large black dogs between christmas and epiphany what's a wayfarer someone who's hairing um a traveler just like a journeyman journeying guy or gal but let's not worry too much about that category because the third category that theo brown gives us is the big dog and it's simply known as the black dog with capital letters this is a particular kind of black dog myth and is the one that we're going to be focusing on pretty much for the rest of this episode what details are there in while the other categories of paranormal dogs found in the united kingdom may change shape or have originally been a different kind of creature whether a demon or a human the black dog is the doggest dog of all black dogs it is nearly always known as the black dog is always black and is always a dog and it's nothing else but it's also spooky english and not known for metaphor look we're not we're not bright people indeed heartland mentions that in almost every county there is a popular belief in a spectral dog which although slightly varying in appearance in different parts always bears the same general characteristics and they are thus the black dog is large and will often have a shaggy black coat it will at times look like a normal breed of dog resembling a retriever a setter a shepherd dog or and this one i don't know maybe reflects the time a terrier which is not a big dog nor is it a particularly scary dog i have to disagree with you there oh yeah not on the big part that's objectively that's just not true um i've i've been around some ferocious areas in my time make a nip man well i guess they're small but they're all muscle yeah most like retrievers i've met russell's a form of terrier yes yeah jack ross was a terrorist what does terrying mean that's a good question google uh see i use ecosia these days because i'm eco-friendly so it's not as easy i'll google it because i actually use oh a dog that takes the earth terror as in earth it's a digger dogs so they they go down in like rabbit holes and stuff yeah that's what jack ross is often used for these days is rabbit hunting look at that we even had a quick trip to dictionary corner so while the black dog might look a little like a recognizable breed of dog upon closer inspection the witness will notice that it does not belong to any species that they recognize perhaps an older species that no longer exists or perhaps it's an otherworldly dog entirely is it a cat i don't think so because it has long ears of a tail it looks like a dog the fur may be long and smooth or curly sometimes it's gleaming but often it's more shaggy like a bear is it a bear it's not a bear it's a dog but its size can vary from just big to terrifyingly huge larger than a newfoundland in fact brown notes that the descriptions used for the size of the beast are remarkably consistent as big as a calf a donkey a newfoundland a mastiff or classic unit of measurement two or three mastiffs compare it to something nearby and then another one of those one notable exception to the rule of it being around the size of a donkey or a couple of mastiffs is the famous mother duke of peel castle in the isle of man that's definitely not the correct pronunciation look this is just part of this podcast you're going to have to deal with it which one authority says was the size of a black spaniel that probably not i bet it had other aspects that were frightening like the fact that it was a ghost okay a very pale black spaniel look you're thinking of too much about like modern ghosts okay you gotta inhabit the mind of our forebears okay about the size of poor bears so those are general physical characteristics but let's talk about the black dog as a person what does it feel like well it yearns for pain because it's generally seen as a malignant spirit and being a spirit it will haunt a particular place most often a particular point on some lonely road where an evil deed has been committed or perhaps where some future deed will be done more on black dogs as bad omens coming up the ghostly black dog when haunting a home is often a symbol of a death that has happened in the past or that the specter of death is over the house and may soon claim a life you are stealing all my best stuff here no i'm i'm a wetting they're a whistle i mean that's all i've i've got two sentences so that's what the general idea of the black dog is but theo brown being a thorough folklorist didn't stop there he provides us with a lovely survey of some of the most common variations in those characteristics should we have some variations amongst individuals do let's one dog was described as though it felt as it was covered in pig's bristles one being touched by a man there are two instances of dogs with two heads for example at kildonan in sutherland treasure hidden in a pool is guarded by a two-headed dog which i would say brings to mind cerberus the three-headed dog of ancient myth don't you think i i would but i'd also question whether or not the farmers of that area would be well read enough to it's all part of one great tapestry kieran particularly given the fact that britain was ruled by the romans for a good period of time and i lost their myth oh my god yes there's an old phrase that goes those who learn from mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them and as such you don't want to be influenced in your choices exactly i am a free man heather lords do not hold me down you're not a sovereign citizen i absolutely am they're not even a thing there are two instances of dogs with no head at all in devon alone and it's common in north and west lancashire and occurs occasionally in norfolk are they still moving or if it's just headless dogs that people are not just dead dogs i mean they are dead undead but they're walking around and being scary they just ain't got no head that's very scary much like the headless horse man which i believe is commonly associated with the black dog often the black dog is the companion of a headless horseman oh or like headless chickens well they're not a phantom that's just a weird thing that apparently chickens are so stupid that they don't need a brain to keep moving for a bit is that real or is it no that's entirely rude have you ever chopped the head of a chicken and seen it run around have i personally know but they're they've been recorded instances of chickens living for like months even years if it's like fed down there like gullets does it still lay eggs i don't know also right in if you've ever been befriended or had to feed a headless chicken through the garlic yeah the black dog of lower quentin in warwickshire ran downhill and turned into a headless woman and speaking of women there are two instances of black dogs that have a little lady's face a little bit like the dog in mars attacks at nath in lincolnshire there used to be a roadside cottage now gone inhabited by a widow her name was mrs dog i think you're really stretching the definition of what counts as a ghost dog here she had a woman's face well you can tell the specter of ill omen was over mrs dog because she was supposedly murdered because she was supposedly murdered by a bagman a traveling salesman or homeless man for her wealth and afterwards her home was pulled down however she haunted the place of her old home in the form of a black dog with a woman's face in fact everyone in nath was afraid to go past that place at night and behind where her cottage stood there are two small hills with a tiny stream issuing from them and the dog came from these hills the murder was not a recent event even at the time of this story being recorded but it was an ancient tradition maybe not ancient but a pretty old tradition and was told by mr g walsh of old brumbly hall [Laughter] i knew as i put that in the text that would make you laugh it was unbelievable sounds like a typing error yeah it was meant to be called bramble hall are you kidding me i spent hours engraving me carved the stone it says brumbly it's called brumbly now but there's actually a few that have one eye in the middle of their forehead cyclops dog yeah wait is it one just one eye in the middle or is it two eyes with an extra eye the dogs with one eye in the middle of their forehead are particularly common when they are churchyard specters so if it's three eyes and they're found in churches do you think anything to do with the holy trinity or am i just maybe it's probably all in there it's probably all in the big soup of ideas that we call folklore gumbo we we have never called it that folklore peas pottage there you go oh yeah that's the surface station i meant peas pudding it's potted you think yes but peacefully it's just a mistake that you like did you have a greg's anytime you go past it heavy gets very very excited about going sweating profusely thinking about greg's see she's trying to she's trying to exaggerate it to make it sound like i'm joking no i'm not she gets very excited about going to peace potty's service station to eat some greg's and use the toilets and wash my hands i like the mms in there oh lady dog the other half live eh speaking of eyes references frequently made to enormous glaring eyes there are at least 18 recorded black dogs with eyes as big as saucers specifically one miss p spoke of seeing a black dog don't laugh at the name miss p it's just the initial it's not miss piss no it sounds like like a cluedo character or something or something from [Music] one miss p spoke of seeing a black dog with eyes as big as tea sources that would be having hold on us if we didn't behave with sense she often said to anyone who would pass by yes we know biggest sources yes having hold on us we know i'm trying to get my washington the dog occasionally accessorizes with a chain this is sometimes seen or heard it is also often described as darker than the night itself for example a retired foreman quoted no matter how dark a knight is you can always see the dog because he's so much blacker which i really enjoy that visual idea of yeah the shadow in the darkness and when it comes to attributes there are also a few common variants we've seen a few examples of the dog swelling up for example the black dog of up lime grew bigger and bigger as he went along till he was as high as the trees by the roadside and then seeming to swell into a large cloud he vanished into the air that's awesome there's another example of that's such cool imagery there's another example of its size greatly surpassing a hippopotamus not quite as delicious in its symbolism there there are two stories not very many really that involve the dog talking the legendary treasure guarding dog of dob park lodge oh what a tongue twister in lanquisher talked and the bell hole boggart of lincolnshire is said to have run around the district nurse saying put me in your pocket put me in your pocket though the story does conclude that it might have been a mishearing of a distant train going past no trains go put me in your pocket put me in your pocket put me in your pocket in a few tales the black dog will become even more anthropomorphic and will walk on its hind legs at newton saint sires in devon in the middle of the last century a dog used to walk in its hind legs past the door of a cottage which was the scene of a murder at a certain time each night that would look hilarious as everyone's thinking really gravely about the terrible deed that took place you just see like art brown notes that it will be remembered that the devil appeared at a guernsey sabbath in 1617 in the form of a dog with horns and paws like hands that stood up on its hind legs very presumptuous that i would remember that but thank you for your input theo brown so if you ever see a big black dog or sometimes quite a small dog but only occasionally and it's either growing in size it has a lady's face or is demanding to be put in your pocket then it's probably the black dog itself exciting but also probably a bad sign for your future perhaps it will be best to proceed knowing where these dogs are usually spotted so that you can avoid them the following are the habitats of the hound based on where they have been most commonly witnessed so first up you're definitely going to want to avoid roads easier said than done i feel well perhaps so but these are easily the main haunt for the black dog and we have at least and we have at least 55 examples of these i should tell you all of them from here on in perhaps not but roads in lincolnshire are what you should steer clear of most of all with 25 of those examples hailing from that county alone a great many of these accounts were recorded by the folklorist ethel h rudkin who wrote an essay also called the black dog which was published in folklore in june 1938 volume 49 number 2 pages 111-131 and she is quite clear on the matter the black dog walks in lincolnshire still and there are a number of living people who have seen him heard him and even felt him the people who can supply these details are of hard-working normal strong-minded type who can tell you quite truly and simply what they have seen because there is no doubt about it in their minds they know that what they have seen is not a real dog they will tell you as much but should you cast the slightest doubt on the story you will find your source of information suddenly dried up perhaps it is because i have seen the black dog she says and can therefore believe that the narrator has also seen him that i have been able to get such good first-hand stories also i was born at the right time i.e in the neighborhood of midnight so should be able to see things i it goes a bit off the deep end though but she was able perhaps due to her open-minded character to gather a great many first-hand accounts of black dogs roaming in her native lincolnshire and from these we can see that dark and deserted roads are definitely their main habitat it said that normally this bogot is only seen by one person at once of course as we have spoken a bogot is a malicious spirit fairy they're all more or less synonymous it's very often spotted when walking along the very lonely stretch of road up to curtin k-i-r-t-o-n and is described as being a very large black dog also the road up to moore town hall is haunted by this dog he always appeared in the hedge at the same place he made no sound but was sometimes seen as a shadow and sometimes he was felt to be brushing past one's legs so you might be thinking sure the trick is to avoid roads in lincolnshire at night time right but alas not the black dog can appear in all areas and at all times of day rudkin relates another tale for us that one evening during the discussion after a lecture that she had held the black dog was mentioned because he has often been seen at bell hall which we mentioned previously a farm about a mile west of the town as these stories went on the genial school mistress from manton became very grave and whispered these words to ethel does it mean anything if you've seen the black dog she looked rather alarmed but was relieved when i assured her that in lincolnshire no harm ever came of seeing him that's alright then she said for i often see him when i cycle back to manton alone after a lecture the teacher goes on to say that she would often notice a huge dog trotting along beside her that would then disappear suddenly but that when she inquired about it none of the school children knew of anyone who owned such a creature hence it must be the black dog we have six also that guard treasure sites which while seeing the black dog probably means something bad is gonna happen there's also a good thing on the cards in that you might have just found some treasure they also frequently appear around rivers or streams and other such fresh water sources with at least ten examples of them appearing around these places we have nine examples of black dogs appearing specifically on the bridges over streams we have several in or around wells including the ancient well known as bubbling tom at hibbeldstowe we have six that appear next to ponds so it's not always moving water in my experience it'd have to be a ghost dog to be on a bridge every dog i've ever had has hated crossing bridges sometimes the aforementioned treasure is supposed to be in that particular pond or otherwise theo brown notes it's just a convenient landmark so we've got roads we've got water sometimes they also haunt fields which is less specific with barely a landmark to help sometimes they pop out of a gap in the hedge we have quite a few at least five that come out of live in or return to underground places for example the lincolnshire trash striker sinks into the ground with a strange noise could be that's the noise it makes when it goes into the ground yeah that's a co-rock you found me i think you're correct again aren't you no i'm not i'm thinking about mrs dog previously mentioned as we remember she seemed to emerge from the hills beside her old cottage often also they're spotted near trees although this may be due to notable trees being good landmarks when you're recounting your story elms ashes willows and ancient thorn trees at times marked parish boundaries sounds unrelated i'm getting somewhere our good friend ethel robkin born at midnight you know so she can see things does note that parish boundaries are a recurring feature in these lincolnshire dog spottings does that sound weird does that sound wrong do you think he sounded like you just weren't people who were spotting doggers oh no in thorn saint margaret in somerset there was a tradition in which every year the churchgoers would drive the devil down to the river parish boundary the devil was said to be in canine form did they just chase a dog and drown it they didn't not do that so there are also many more places that they appear in the sides but with trees boundaries streams roads night and day all included in potential places where you could be set upon by this beast it's starting to look like pretty much anywhere in the british landscape is at risk no wonder so many have witnessed the black dog you use the word set upon i think that's really interesting it's something i've only really just come to realize but in almost all the stories i've come across like the spectral dog the black dog is fairly benign unless you act first yes that was something that i had noticed as well in a couple of the sources that i was looking at it suggested that the purpose of the dog somewhat defines whether it's good or bad like if it's a guard dog it's gonna be pretty mean to robbers and other such miscreants whereas if you are nice to it it's perfectly fine kind of like real dogs as well as being very prevalent in british folklore the role of the black dog seems to vary goes from general boogeyman to a portent of death to in fact and we'll get into this next episode the devil himself so we've talked about the general characteristics of these spectral dogs we've spoken about where we can find them but would you like to take us a little bit further into the bowels of these spooky dogs i'm gonna show you the guts of these dogs uh i'm gonna relay a couple of stories specifically relating to ghost dogs possibly the most prevalent of the sub of the black dog and we are going to start with a tale from edwin sidley heartland friend of the podcast and his book the english fairy and other folk tales the iron man plays home to peel castle peel castle plays home to the mouth dog the move dude the mutha duke or whatever it is the one that we were talking about earlier from the isle of man that's possibly the size of a spaniel yes it was seen in every room of phil castle but his presence was especially known in the guard chamber here as soon as candles were lighted it used to go and lie down before the fire in the presence of soldiers who became so accustomed to its appearance but they lost much of their awe which they first felt at its presence i love that they've just got bored of it yes and i i think this is something kind of exemplifies the spectral dog a lot is that villages come to just know it after a while but knowing it's malicious character they never ventured to molest it till one of them in the drunken fit saw that he would try whether it would dog or devil to molest the dog as in harass it i i'm going to say yes he made his trial and was instantly sobered but rented speechless he lived only three days afterwards and then died in agonies more than is common in a natural death i've heard mr tested says mr wardrone by several but especially an older soldier who assured me that he'd seen it often when he had hairs on his head well there you go bro i'd like to point out at this juncture we do not know how many hairs that old soldier had on his head that's a good point he could have been a bit of a homer simpson type yeah i've seen it at least thrice in fact a similar fate befell a milkman from aylesbury in buckinghamshire oh part of my area yeah but bucks is next to walks that's what they always say the box bones connected to the fox bone part of this gentleman's routine was to use a neighboring field as a shortcut hope after a long day of delivering rounds one night if he searched for the gap in the hedgerow he happened upon a large black dog perfectly blocking his root and seeming quite unwilling to give way as you can see another black dog appearing at a gap in a hedge yes a captain hedges like a thing i can easily see a situation where like a gap in the hedgerow could be like a division between two worlds or two rounds or something well you do see that a lot yeah i mean as we mentioned boundaries parish boundaries but perhaps the gap in that boundary yeah is a suggestion of that's where the uh the other side okay the devil gets in i thought i was gonna say something cool but i couldn't think of anything so i just made a noise so figuring it was easier to simply walk on by than try budging this beast movement kept walking and used to gate at the end of the field the next night the same thing happened the milkman decided to try his luck and as he got closer to the dog he began to notice that not only was it somehow larger than his anticipated but his eyes were quite unlike anything he'd ever seen before they glowed like burning coals and they were trained on him in a way that made him feel like there was something more than a simple canine brain behind them this happened night after night until one evening after a few in the local a man came home with a companion in tow as they approached the shortcut sure enough there was the black dog boyed perhaps by liquor perhaps by his friend or perhaps by toxic masculinity and a fear of looking weak the man yelled now you black fiend i'll try what you're made of he took his yoke and struck the dog between the eyes the man's companion looked on his shock as the beast vanished in a puff of sulfurous smoke he turned to congratulate the milkman who had fallen limply to the ground he was carried home that night by his companion but died three days later speechless and paralytic and in more pain than is normal for a death once again speechless and paralytic oh you're gonna go no no no no i once again screaming bloody and drunk like how i came into this world i was your mum on the on the drink yeah it was back in the 1880s the 1880s and oxfordshire were a different time i know gin lane tell me about it tequila was the main anaesthetic tequila yeah were you twinned with san juan we were we had amazing shipping routes for for a land lost county [Laughter] maybe it's my own fault but that story took a little bit of swerve in that i thought he had pulled same same thing but maybe maybe i think maybe you the use of the term companion might have been um maybe somewhat suggestive i'm loving this give me more stories okay we also have a story from the same book that provides an explanation as to why why a spectral hound is about but this story supposes that there are people so evil in life that they find their souls transformed into hounds upon death take as an example one lady howard a wealthy woman from devonshire from the time of the stewart's reign maybe howard with a woman of remarkable grace beauty and charm just like me just like you and your soul is corrupt and evil because you can't be beautiful on the inside and the outside it's true all beautiful people are evil all ugly people are angels i agree do go on tell me more about lady howard and her beauty grace and charm but her evil character her talents and accomplishments were spoken of far beyond the county lines however there existed another side of lady howard privately she was exceedingly cruel to her only daughter in each of her four husbands met mysterious and sudden ends it's a shame that all her husband died of terrible illnesses that weren't her fault upon her death her spirit was turned into a large black hound and every night between midnight and daybreak and every night between midnight and daybreak she would have to run from her former home of fitzforward to oakhampton place a distance of 60 miles where upon her arrival she would have to collect a single blade of grass in her mouth and deliver it back to the gates of her home this act of penance she is doomed to repeat every night until every blade of grass has been removed from oakhampton park an act that will supposedly take until the very end of the world wow which is quite a lot of punishment for murdering four rich men i mean that's the whole thing about your soul being down for eternity if you do evil deeds isn't it yes i would like to hear her side of the story i think it was i'm hot but i'm a murdering bietch and i hate my daughter oh i'm so gorgeous look at my hair i look lovely today i'm gonna be honest she sounds like she'd be fun to party with well i hope you like parties that involve fetching blades of grass oh no no when she was still alive lame thank you very much for giving us some slightly longer stories that include some of the aspects and locations that i was speaking about earlier we have some dogs appearing out of hedges dogs appearing on roads but now i would like to talk about some aspects and habitats of the ghost dog that expand upon its ghoulish character i would say that if a large dark hound is trotting along a road by a stream or over a bridge it's really the massive dog thing that's the scary bit but there are some aspects that are a little more spooky in and of themselves indeed sometimes these black dogs are sort of psychic remains of some sort of tragic or evil event for example in his popular romances of the west of england robert hunt shares a tale that centers around a particular mine shaft at wheel war two miles north west of helston and one mile north of the village of briarge bree breeg in the west of cornwall england uk it goes as follows a man and a lad were at work down the mine shaft and one through carelessness or accident missed in sending a charge down a hole that they were excavating meaning that they would have to undertake the extremely risky procedure of picking the charge back out do you know what a charge is okay explosive device right it is it's like proper looney tunes tnt in a kind of paper package i had to do some extensive googling about how mining works to understand this the other miners watched on from above calling out advice when the charge suddenly exploded sorry that's yeah i've just got such a strong image over there yeah no put it over there you do it wrong mate you do it right come on mate because it's simple it's simple mate some serious backseat mining happening here but unfortunately the charge exploded and the two men were thrown upwards in a huge plume of flame i told you i was wrong and in the choice words of robert hunt the remains of the poor fellows were found to be shattered and scorched beyond recognition when these men were brought to the surface the clothes and a mass of mangled flesh dropped from the bodies and then to spare the feelings of the relatives the grizzly mass of their remains were swiftly shoveled into the furnace i thought you would say we were just blown up again oh no your husband and son have been exploded but not completely let's thoroughly explode them i'll show them how to do a charge proper this time no they were shoveled into the furnace much less alarming so not only were they exploded in mine shark horror but they were declined a proper burial ah and so from that day on groups of black dogs would run about the place even when the doors were locked shut and knowing the origin of these hounds very few men would agree to work in that mine so there you go obviously i mentioned mines and underground places previously but this is a much more calamitous mine yeah that was brutal yeah i was quite taken aback by just how grisly the description was speaking of undisputably spooky locations black dogs also often appear at graves those are creepy yeah in staffordshire a jacobite burial site that followed a battle is haunted by a black dog and we have six records of black dogs appearing at churches two inside rectories and churchyards meaning graves are generally nearby and the ghostly dogs of yorkshire are said to be goblin apparitions of the animals buried beneath the foundation stones of a church hence they are tied to that location so that gives a little bit of an explanation perhaps why these animals are haunting these churchyards but in devon they mix it up a little bit with one churchyard being haunted by not only a black dog but also by two white sows a lamb and a calf it's just a farmyard can you imagine being told this t this tail by a terrified countrymen and then i walked through there was a car there and two pigs and a lamb a lamb can you fathom it from the most horrifying lamb you've ever laid eyes on so it was in any way frightening it was slightly frightening in the sense i wasn't expecting it to be there it startled me i'm not gonna lie i jumped less common than appearing at churchyards but even more ghoulish we have a handful of black dogs that appear at places of execution the place at which the gallows once stood at tring in hertfordshire yielded a black dog spirit but it is unclear which person in this dark tale the dog sprang from a man falsely accused a woman of witchcraft in 1751 it was all the rage at the time and so she was drowned as a punishment did you know they were usually drowned not burned at the stake i'm sure everyone listening to this already knows that i believe in germany they were fairly commonly burned in england they were most commonly drowned in america they most commonly hung takes all sorts i might be wrong about germany this poor woman was accused of witchcraft and she was drowned however it became clear afterwards however as it probably was in most cases it became clear afterwards that she had been an innocent and she wasn't in league with satan at all so as recompense the man was hanged upon the gallows you know what i'm gonna think quite rightly so in this case then the black dog apparition started appearing not long afterwards but do we know if the dog is the ghost of the woman who was drowned or the man that was hanged i'm going to suggest a theory here oh yeah go for it i think it's more likely to be the man who was hanged why is that because it seems that the black the spirit of the black dog is often more a thing of punishment yeah that's a good point actually that is a good point mystery solved science seal delivered thank you kieran hill another such place of execution that has a black dog story attached to it is one shared by ethel rudkin she was born at night you know she can see things and it talks about and it tells of a black dog at the beheading stone at sterling castle where the heading took place in sterling castle at the castle however their connection to places can also be a little bit more benign while still ghostly they are often spotted at the boundaries to towns such as aberystwyth and saint austal winchester norwich newcastle york and wakefield in fact some early writers on the topic believed the bar guest the name of a particular type of black dog which i will discuss further in episode 2 derives from the words berghost or town ghost which suggests that they may even be guardians of these cities i'm sure that most people who have pets will have seen them suddenly jolt up and stare into the distance or at an utterly unremarkable corner with a look of wild-eyed horror i'm sure that a good portion of those people would have then joked that ah they must have spotted a ghost we have never done this we do this all the time well we have a number of stories in which the black dog will interact with real dogs so in these instances perhaps they really did see a ghost leaving my thoughts but they're seeing every night yeah she's seeing demons she's seen dogs she's seen all kinds of horrors that are just in the wall why doesn't she do anything about she's just pointing them out she's not our savior once a small dog from lincolnshire was frightened by a large ghost dog that couldn't be seen but was felt by its owner a tough black mastiff from pembroke came face to face with a dog similar to itself in stature and fled in fear it was in a mirror well maybe that that dog was the size of two or three mastiffs two small ones tied together one tied to the back of the other one so his legs are just like in the air my god it's some sort of spider it's got eight legs that's awful it was once a folk belief that most dogs hated black dogs of their own species let alone if they're ghost dogs are dogs racist perhaps i'm not touching this one are our furry friends aware of the ill fortune that will be wrought upon their humans if a spectral black dog appears almost certainly [Laughter] i think you're editorializing but when it comes to dogs as signs and importance kieran has something to tell us i most certainly do as well as being spooky stories to try and ward your sprog away from touching the foaming-mouthed mutt that hangs around the back of the butcher's tails of dogs have often carried with them omens and signs that point towards future events it was believed in branston home of the pickle but should an expectant mother happen across a black dog then she would certainly bear a boy in oxfordshire a dog coming in between a bride and groom on their wedding day was a surefire sign that marriage would be a short one while in norfolk there was a belief that the sight of a lone large snarling black dog in one place would signify that a violent crime would shortly take place there friend of the podcast lady francesca sperenza wilde mentions in her indispensable book ancient legends mystic charms and the superstitions of ireland you don't necessarily have to be so sycophantic to all these dead authors that we're using how am i being sycophantic you said that she's our friend and that her book is indispensable you you have practically follated word sites on this podcast and i'd do it again admittedly it is a very good book i'll grant you that thank you and what does it say within it pray tell but the name of the cry raised at a funeral a cane or keen is derived from the word the dog she says this doleful lamentation was also common to other nations of antiquity who with disheveled hair and mournful cadenced hymns led on the melancholy parade of death thus the trojan women keemed over hector for chorus being led by the beautiful helen herself the howling of the dog was considered by these nations as the first note of a funeral dirge and the signal for the coming of death was near she goes on to explain but should a dog be heard howling outside an ill person's house and it was not uncommon for all to give up on the survival of the afflicted one though this could be hyperbole it's just about ott but i like it i've noticed her stuff often runs slightly she's prone to drama but she did obviously call herself spiranza yes did she call herself that i think she's she she was just called francesca wilde and she put speranza so she's one for the theatrics for sure i mean i wouldn't mind calling our child sperenza we're not gonna have a child we can call perhaps another pet it she goes on to say this strange superstition concerning the howling of dogs when as is supposed they're conscious of the approach of the spirit of death and see him though he is shrouded and invisible to human eyes may be found pervading the legends of all nations from the earliest period down to the present for it still exists in full force amongst all classes the educated as well as the unleashed peasantry and to this day the howling of a dog where a sick person is lying is regarded in ireland in all grades of society with the pale dismay of a certain sign of approaching death perhaps among the other examples of dog's importance of death are a variant of the wild hunt mythology do you know much about the wild hunt we've spoken about it a little bit in the past haven't we it's more of a it comes from the germanic tradition and it's the idea of kind of the force or spirit of nature going through the countryside and sort of churning things up and causing chaos yes yeah i think i think this is once again me going out on a limb i think it might have something to do with storms coming through and then being kind of put down to these wild natural spirits just tearing through the countryside laying waste to everything yes we talked about it in the past yes i remember now when we were talking about um the unseelie the uh evil fairies or at least the more malicious fairies um going through the countryside and churning things up with these winds and blusters and noises and howls when they're on their hordes yes there's amazing traditions surrounding it that involve lots of feasting going from house to house kind of like a washout oh so you're being the wild house yes yeah i think it's like groups of young men would do it and they'd like terrify all like terrorize old folk who wouldn't give them stuff lads on tour kind of that yes this sounds awesome and i want to talk about it more because i'm hype yeah no it's really fascinating something i'd really like to get into but you're saying that this example links in with that which makes sense if it's a wild hunt dogs are involved in hunts of course exactly in the north they're gabriel with hounds in devon the whisk the eef or heath hounds and the cornish referred to him as dando and his dogs oh and this is my favorite the devil and his dandy dogs ah it's so good they're said to be large black dogs with eyes of fire and coated in blood they float overhead are often invisible and emit awful sounds above those whose end is coming near they've got flaming eyes they're black they're covered in blood but you can't see them yes what what of it are you going to doubt the devil and his dandy dogs i would never doubt the devil and his handy dogs in fact i think i can hear one right now right that's a plane or is it the devil and who's done your dogs i think you're close-minded heather no i was born around midnight and so i can see things were you i don't know i have no idea i i don't know i was born on the 2nd of july if anyone would like to send me a birthday card when it comes around in the following poem provided to heartland by one mr holland of sheffield edwin sydney heartland that's the one the one and only we see the legend is told in yorkshire oft have i heard my honored mother say how she hath listened to the gabriel hounds those strange unearthly and mysterious sounds which on the ear through murkiest darkness fell and how entranced by superstitious spell the trembling villagers not seldom heard in the quaint notes of the nocturnal bird of death preminished some sick neighbors nell preminished a little bit suspicious death preminished sorry some sick neighbors now i too remember once at midnight dark how the sky yelpers star startled me instead how these sky yelpers how the sky yelpers saddled me and stirred my fancy so i could not have been averted a mimic pack of beagles loaded bark nor one did i that rustic fear should trace a spectral huntsman doomed to that long moonless chase even wordsworth himself had a few lines in regards to the dandy dogs he rhymed he oft times will start for overhead are sweeping gabriel's hounds doomed with their impeach lord the flying heart to chase forever through aerial grounds oh that's much more exciting than a flock of lovely daffodils oh maybe they're chasing the daffodils so yeah crazy flying invisible bloodied dogs who chase you down if you're gonna die that's some metal [ __ ] man much more frightening than just you know tuberculosis game yeah of course this being folklore there exists more than one idea about the man who leads her dogs on their hunt for the souls of his soon to be damned but tell me who is leading this pack of fearsome hunting dogs one popular tale from cornish folklore written by robert hunt in his popular romances of the west of england as previously mentioned can perhaps shed some light on the origins of dando and his pack of hounds so before we were talking about the devil and his dandy dogs but this is dando a character this is dando a character so me name the kind of interchangeable and possibly getting a little bit kind of corrupted over time gotcha here's the thing though this story i'm about to read features both dando and the devil no way oh yeah before we begin this got a few notes up top you're looking very uh baleful it's kind of long does it not make a lot of sense doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense i'm not entirely sure it's meant to be in this episode but i loved it so we're going to use it besides nestled in the cornish countryside the picturesque village of saint germain's i thought maybe saint germain's would know it definitely germans saint germans where once lived a priest who was not quite as holy as one generally expects it's normally at this point in a story but we go into detail on the brutal sadistic or perverse practices of this priest not so with dando his proclivities were not violent no dando just loved to party far from being unpopular however for residents who said germans were ecstatic with their holy man indulging far beyond the limits of good living dando was often quite blind to the sins of his parishioners and would freely and happily forgive all who sought confession oh he sounds great right just a partying priest he's just like yeah yeah don't worry about it you're forgiven you're forgiven absolved go for it fevery who doesn't actually dando that's my wallet don't worry about it have some mead old age did little to quell dando's appetite after all as a man increases in years he becomes more deeply died with the polluted waters through which he may have waited and dando was no exception to this on the contrary old age seemed only to bolster dando's indulgences the old priest was a remarkable huntsman and used his ample free time to gallop across the county in search of game when he and his faithful hounds there they are found their target the concept of property with one entirely lost to this corpulent clergyman neither rose garden nor desperately needed crops were he did and many curses were leveled of a priest quietly he was after all still a man of cloth as he aged it became ever more apparent that the only worship dando engaged in were the sensual gods of excess and his proclamations towards worshiping the god of abraham became more transparently hypocritical lies with every passing year it wasn't just his congregants that saw this you see the devil himself kept a careful eye on his prize after all securing the soul of a man of god even if name only was quite a catch he does seem like an easy bag for the devil oh very given that he's some sort of dionysian grandpa i really hope that's what people call me my later years kieran bacchic granddad hill i mean i'm pretty much i'm back at uncle kieran hill already like and so the devil carefully lured dando into his very undoing health and wealth was secured to him and by and by the measure of his sins were full he was left victim to self-indulgences a doomed man with increasing years and the immunities he enjoyed dando became more reckless while in wassel a board groading with dishes which stimulated the sated appetite and the company of both sexes for diseloomed habits exhausted his knights bisexual king yes indeed his days were devoted to hunting and his wicked friends happy to supply drinks to maintain the mood we stand dando right i mean i'm not gonna lie i'm a stando right he might he might be my favorite person we've covered so yeah he sounds like a ledge one sabbath morning dando and his gang of riotous ruffians were in full cry over a lord's estate when he called for a drink each in turn checked only to discover that the priest had drained them dry despite the sun still hanging at the very top of the sky did notice it's on the sabbath by the way i certainly did a day of rest well that's no bloody good isn't it no drink i say give me drink he cried when can we get it asked one of the gang go to hell for all i care if you can't get it on earth said the priest the bitter laugh of his own joke good one dando at that moment a dashing hunter dressed in black velvet and silk fineries approached from the crowd and presented dando with an ornate hip flask saying here this will warm and revive you i'll warrant drink long and drink deep friend drink and dando did drink deep the flask appearing to cling to his lips when the strange hunter looked on his face a mixture of joy and malignant a wicked smile played over otherwise tranquil lips once he was sure he had drunk the flask clean dando sighed and exclaimed by hell that was a drink indeed do the gods drink such nectar devils do it's not all the hunter if that's true i wish i were one said dando who is now so drunk he could hardly stand looking up dando saw the mysterious hunter was removing several rabbits from the back of dando's horse full of dutch courage dando gathered himself to the entire of his formidable height and bellowed none of those are yours well then what can i keep asked for hunter by the devil's fair mine screamed dando the hunter quietly bowed and with that dando's wrath exploded he rolled himself off his horse and began thundering towards this new hunter uttering curse upon curse the hunter's horse an ebony black creature with eyes at sean like stars stepped a drinkly aside and dando crashed into the ground only adding to the fury in no time at all given his age and size dander was back on his feet and again of a hunted side the hunter now sat shaking with laughter waggling the game just out of dandos reach and quietly mockingly whispering well mine i'll go to hell after them but i'll get one from thee shouted dando so thou shalt said the hunter and seizing dando by the collar he lifted him from the ground and placed him as though he were a child before him on the horse with a dash her horse passed down the hill it's who's striking fire at every tread and the dogs barking furiously followed impetuously they reached the banks of velina and with a terrific leap the horse in its riders followed by the hounds went far out in its waters disappearing at length in a blaze of fire which caused the stream to boil for a moment and then the waters flowed on as tranquil as ever over the doomed priest all this happened in sight of the assembled peasantry dando nevermore was seen and his fearful death was received as a warning by many who then gave gifts to the church one among them carved a chair for the bishop and on it he represented dando and his dogs the memory of his wickedness may always be renewed there constant german's church stands to this day the chair and all who doubt the truth of this tradition may view the story carved in enduring oak if they please they can sit on the chair until their faith is so far quickened they become true believers on sunday mornings early the dogs of the priests have often been heard as if an eager pursuit of game that was great right but before we get to our last segment let's just charge your drink to dando trujando you dirty dog he's probably still being flagellated in hell as we speak and i bet he loves it he's leading his dogs to the very souls of the damned which means that he's finally actually doing a bit of good yeah all right all right all right all right we've had the devil we've had dan know we've had some dandy dogs and we've had some eternal damnation so you you reckon we should just stop here because we're not going to top it but for the sake of balance and the avoidance of too much dog distrust i'd like to round things off with some examples of spectral black dogs that are actually quite nice oh just because a dog is a ghost doesn't mean that it was necessarily born of some calamity or is in league with the devil there are some stories in which black dogs simply accompany the ghosts of their owners haunting the places in which they live while on other occasions the black dog apparition will replace the human ghost in the afterlife ethel rudkin our expert and the black dogs of lincolnshire makes a strong point that the hounds of her county are much nicer than all the others and she would know she was born at midnight after all and so she can see things she asserts that in other counties bad counties er the black dog is looked upon as a bad omen with ill luck disaster or death attending his appearance but the most striking fact about the dog in lincolnshire is that he has never feared the spectator may be startled or annoyed at first by this huge creature trotting alongside but fear of the dog never enters into it once he is recognised for what he is his physical traits don't differ greatly it's still big it's still black it's still a dog its eyes are often round like saucers although this black dog may not be quite as terrifying due to being a little smaller than the beasts in other areas is it impacted terrier the size of only one mastiff it's still blacker than night it still crosses streams but not parish boundaries it has a rough coat and is long bodied but catching sight of the black dog in this area is seen as a blessing and a sign of good character as they see it as a spirit of protection that is only seen and i quote by good folks and the badens look in vain one mrs l of willetton shares a story of one dusky evening at the start of the 20th century when she went to visit her friend in kennington who was sick with pneumonia based on what we've heard so far we might expect in this juncture of the story for a black dog to appear jump around in the blood-soaked clouds and wreak death upon mrs l's friend but not so mrs l was climbing the hill that was between their two houses when out of a gap in the hedge next to a big ash tree came a big black shaggy dog not at all nervous mrs l was a fan of dogs and she was glad to see it and spoke to it gently as it followed her along the streets in the allotments where it stopped and she continued her journey met with her friends and then when she returned it was 10 p.m and pitched dark out so she was nervous to walk alone but as she got to the allotment gate the same black dog appeared and trotted along with her over the hill before departing back through the same gap in the hedge in fact she was extremely glad of his company coming back because she felt that he protected her it was more than two hours between her going up the hill and returning and she thought it was nice of the old dog to wait for her and it was so cute and we might wonder why it is that the interpretation of the dogs is so different in this locality well rodkin does offer us a small amount of speculation on the topic nothing conclusive but she does say that black dog sightings have often correlated with places of scandinavian settlements in england and ireland whereas she suggests that lincolnshire was the home of the anglians the angles the peoples who joined with the saxons to form the anglo-saxons anglian is also where we get the name england from so perhaps the gentler dogs of the east midlands are something to do with the cultural echoes of the people with a more positive view of dogs and their spectral forms rodkin concludes that all i know is that we have a nicer more comfortable sort of dog in lincolnshire than in any other county she's clearly never been to west sussex quite right too all we have is bloody chihuahuas here i see a lot of pugs so we can see that black dogs aren't always bad dogs but they usually are and we're going to talk about some very bad dogs next time oh we are from vargas to black shuck to which is familiar who's that i hear is that the devil oh yeah oh what's the devil and he's back for more so do please join this next time you're going to have a lovely time i assure you we're fat did i did i slightly kill so do please join us next time find us on all the social medias if you can't wait until next time we are at gods and goblins on instagram on twitter we are gonna be doing something fun for the upcoming

to watch along with us that would be super cool there's going to be some folk horror in there there's going to be some trash camp scary actually scary maybe who knows we'll see i don't actually know what the list is myself neither do i but i will as you might be able to tell we like halloween a lot if you want to read any further about any of the sources that we've covered there will be a bibliography in our show notes which will link you to all of the sources once again thank you very much for listening we really do appreciate it we've been having a lovely time we look forward to joining you next time for dogs part two and all that's left to do is say a goodbye from me heather moorehouse and a good tidings and good riddance from me hog boy kieran hill circling it back goodbye goodbye goodbye we love you [Music] oh some trees you're the best jesus man though the best thing to come out of staying after me that should be being first devil's drew", "Qu0od8aLNyw": "hi I'm dr. Julie Busby we're on video two of the series trimming your dog's nails and we're gonna talk about an intimidating topic today and that is trimming black nails but I want to encourage you that it doesn't need to be intimidating and I'm going to show you how you can successfully do this at home we're using Zeke who is one of my dogs we have we adopted Zeke a few months ago so he's still a little bit nervous but trained and cooperative enough that he's just gonna lie here while we do this the first thing we do is actually take the paw and you want to firmly but gently hold it a dog does not like to feel that they're insecure and can flail about they actually prefer just a gentle firm firm hold and I trim his nails every one to two weeks so you can actually see that there they have a little bit of an edge on them from the last nail trim the big difference in the way that I recommend a nail trim versus potentially other things that you may have seen and granted there's a lot of different ways to do this trembling is a great technique it's just not my personal technique I like that I always have nail trimmers handy and can do them whenever and wherever but instead of taking the nail trimmer horizontally in other words parallel with the surface of the ground we're gonna hold the nail trimmer very vertically and that's because the blood and nerve supply runs low in the nail and by going vertically we can remove more than nail and make the nail functionally shorter and be less likely to hit the blood and nerve supply and I just use this is why I like this kind of a nail trimmer I'm just gonna shave off just in this angle just shave off good boy Zeke shave off the white dead tissue and I've already gone as far back as I can go I call this black licorice this black center of the nail tells me that I'm starting to get close I don't want to go any further towards the blood and nerve supply and then I just use the nail trimmers to shave off the sharp edges on the side and that's as far as I can take that nail from the side view that what it looks like to go on to nail - again I'm not taking that much off of him because I do him so frequently but if your dog had long nails I would recommend just taking a shaving and then seeing that it's just dead tissue basically and then shaving back some more and just keep going with sequential touch until you start to get this live tissue this like I said this black licorice tissue and that tells you that you're getting close to the blood of nerves of play and you need to stop and then again I just kind of round up the edges so there's no sharp corners and I'm happy with that now so I really use these nail trimmers almost as a sculpting tool as we sculpt back you'll see how vertical my cuts are and then do the the edges so there we have all four nails if you look at them head-on you see that we've got the black licorice dark tissue I call it the pre quick and I really wouldn't want to go any further than that you don't want to cause him any pain and we certainly don't want to cause him to bleed so here's our completed saw with short nails and now we're gonna go to a hind nail in general dogs crying nails are shorter than their front nails so keep that in mind when you're trimming you can pretty much know that you're gonna not have to cut them back as short so I'm focusing on shaving off vertically good boy Zeke click my seat and then just taking the little sharp corners on either side and that's about as short as I can get these nails can see the black tissue starting in the center I really don't want to go beyond that your dog you may have a lot more to take off I trim his nails so frequently that there's not a lot of extra excess tissue if your dog has long nails and again you're not sure where the quick and blood supply are you just start further out and take off segments just take off cross sections and continue shaving back until you get away from that gray flakey tissue and start to get into this more live looking tissue that we discussed and here we have a white nail that grand finale this is a great illustration of the pink down below the blood and nerve supply that we talked about that's what we're trying to avoid so just this little tip here is the extra that I can take off but by taking it off vertically there's less functional nail for him to have to break over or move past every time he picks up his foot and swings it forward in a gating phase so I'm gonna take my nail trimmer vertically and cut back stuff up here it is not live tissue I can just like your fingernails I can trim that right off click Boise boy buddy and then just shave back the sides to sculpt them back and trust me you will get good at this with practice and there I have trimmed that nail and avoided the quick always keep it positive and your dog will get better and better over time about having his or her nails trimmed my vision is to inspire you to empower you to be able to do your dog's nails at home to be able to do them regularly and frequently to maintain short nails for your dogs because I believe it's such a simple easy quick thing that you can do that really has a huge impact on a dog's quality of life", "C6GTwMc7o1w": "[Music] so hahaha [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] huh [Music] you", "6onRY6akiM8": "today at the shop we're gonna be making a Zen Bell out of an oxygen tank [Music] so we're gonna start out by cutting it in half for the plasma cutter and then we're gonna build a a hanging structure for it and then we're gonna put a bail in there and and that's it this is a pretty thick wall so it resonates really well and it's kind of like a deeper tone to it so it's a it's a really cool nice sound these things are really heavy and solidly made it weighs about a hundred pounds as is so I'm gonna cut it to a reasonable size that someone could mount it on like a porch post or something [Music] so it cut the bill to about 15 inches so this wrap is a good way of getting a a round object square what you do is you just start wrapping it around there put it right on your mark and then you just start wrapping it around itself [Music] a plasma cutter is essentially a handheld lightsaber elegant Whitlam and it's it's a lot quicker than a torch a lot cleaner than a torch it's really easy to use I'm just gonna freehand this line if I wanted to I could make a little guide around there to get it perfect but part of the beauty of these is that they're they're kind of rough and and cool and you know you can definitely tell that they're handmade [Music] that's gonna be our bail so the bail is gonna hang like this with the open end down we always want to watch out for anything that's gonna hold standing water well attract mosquitoes it's just something we want to avoid so I'm gonna try and find some sort of a a hat essentially for this piece that'll draw the water out words and hopefully it'll be something that's more decorative and it'll also like just enhance the Bell is uh not just a functional piece but it'll be a aesthetically pleasing piece as well I could always just weld a plate on it and then cut a circle out but I don't want to do that and how hard is it to find a rusty piece of metal that looks like a hat [Music] we couldn't really find anything outside to cap this with so what I'm doing is I'm gonna take a piece of this quarter inch sheet steel and cut a circle out with our circle cutting jig right here this allows you to make a perfect circle with the plasma so you don't have to freehand it because you freehand something at always you know you could always mess it up so what it essentially does is it pivots on this little point right there so you would take a punch put a little a little hole in the steel put the point in it and this allows you to make a perfect circle going around that [Music] [Music] this tanks down outside the metal shop for years and years and when we first cut into it it was probably halfway full of water and just grime the mud and rust so this is what that looks like this all just fell out of it right here just from sitting on the table I have a feeling that's gonna interfere with our little bill that we're gonna put inside so we're gonna have to probably try and get a lot of that off at the wire wheel or wire brush and whatever we can so but I'll save that for later I don't yeah I just wanna save it that's why I'm saving it for later [Music] so her bill has a hat the I envision this Bell being mounted on someone's like six by six four by four front porch post or something similar to that so I'm using this 90-degree square right here so that I can build this Bell and the orientation that it's going to be when it's finally installed and someone has bought it this makes it easy [Music] so now we got to find the piece that comes out and supports the Bell 3/8 material yeah that perfect these are all just drops for from projects that we hear that we work on these specifically our leg drops from legs that we build for firepit stands it looks like we've already used it for something so I'm gonna grind this weld out and then I'm gonna tack it to the to the plate over there I'm thinking I'm gonna have it welded about halfway up this plate but the goal is to make sure that this top part so I'm gonna drill a hole through here so we want this to be level right here there we go okay can you just hold that there while I clamp the while I tack weld it thank you John yeah the next step is to find our decorative piece that is going to support the weight of that heavy Bell that thing probably weighs 60 pounds now so it's just going to be something that comes up from the top and goes there we have a whole wall full of decorative metal pieces to choose from can may be that looks expensive we got this that could that could be good we've used this for something as you can see we got some welds on there but we'll use it for our bell now this has been painted before so I'm just gonna grind off some of this paint so that I can get a good clean weld on [Music] so my plan is to weld this in the center right here and then I'm gonna cut a hole and the end of this the same diameter as this 3/4 inch pipe so I can put this threaded piece in that is what and this other end is welded to the bell and then I could put a cap on it and that will finish it off and it'll hold it there I'm gonna cut a little oversized hole because just to make it easier for everyone to put the bell onto the mounting fixture so I got a little circle there so I'm just gonna freehand cut that with a plasma I know where my Center is on this the circle because I put made that punch mark right there so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just draw two lines through there and then another one like this so now when I go to put my pipe here I can see exactly what dead center will be [Applause] when metal cools it um it contracts so if I was just to do one tack on one side or do one bead on one side what will happen is it'll start pulling like let's say I did a attack over here it would start pulling this whole pipe over to one side so it would not be plumb anymore so if you do four points around there then you can start welding around without it pulling to one side there we go yeah so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a piece of quarter-inch pencil rod and I'm going to use that as what's gonna suspend my ball that's gonna be inside of here I gotta clean up the inside of this tank where I'm gonna make my weld because you need a good clean surface to to weld on get a good arc so I'm gonna grab a die grinder this is what's going to be welded to the bottom of that the inside of that tank that I just ground out the challenging part is welding this inside in that little hole with the pencil rod attached to it my balls should be really sitting just below the bottom of the bail which is about 13 inches but I got to make a loop on my pencil rod so I'm gonna cut a I'm gonna cut it long at 20 inches because I don't know exactly how much I'm going to use for that for that Lou coming so all I got to do now is close up this little side right there and then that'll that'll slip over this chain-link nicely I have to weld this chain link inside of this 15 inch hole with this pencil rod attached dude they got a little trick that I've come up with to do that what I do is I just superglue that chain right there to this Lube put it in here and I'm gonna put it in at a little bit of an angle so that if this rod doesn't get in the way of my my hand in the welding torch so now that it's attached to the rod I can just precisely precisely put it exactly where I want to stick my hand out in there and attack water so what I'm doing is I'm drilling a hole through this ball so that I can uh if this is a little bit bigger than the pencil rod that the ball is gonna be welded to so I can just slip the ball on to the rod and I can get the correct distance that I need inside the bill so I'm just gonna tack this guy this chain to that what is going to be our ringer handle so now the last step is to weld it back to the ball I'm gonna give it a pull test is that I want it falling off on anyone and that feels really good time to that Isabelle so I'm gonna put this little tab up here I'm gonna weld it to this bar I want to have a a good hole that we can put a screw in up top because the way this is situated as it wants to pull it out from the top so I want to get a big screw up there I'll probably get two more here and maybe a couple more down here so that we got a good five or six screw holes that we can mount to mount with it looks good it does its job it rings not only is it a cool decorative piece but it's it's cool that we could got to use this oxygen tank that otherwise would have just gone gotten thrown into our scrap metal bin upcycling 101

anybody don't know about Black Dog it's a motorcycle ride organized it's a regular thing they do around the country big rides little rides and it's all to raise funds and awareness for mental health and suicide prevention so they got one today got a ride up to Belle divers I believe from there it kicks off and we go down to her owner not sure of the route and then for una to dwelling up so once we get to dwelling up I can have a bit of a look around at the bikes is usually a good creative bikes did one a few years back for the bushfires and this probably has three 400 motorbikes today I'm not too sure we'll wait and see the weather is a little bit less than average there is rain predicting so that could put people off and also the interesting thing the old coronavirus panic so and have people a ride bikes would be too worried but we'll see so I'll do a bit of footage a bit of footage where I'm riding and have a bit of a walk around and look at some of the bikes and see some people over chat okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we've got here we're at bill divers that started the black dog ride I think is heading off about ten o'clock we've got a few people here so far probably numbers mob began a little bit due to the weather just sort of sucks balls a bit yeah I have a quick look around quick wander and have a look at some of the bikes and I'll try to get some footage of the bikes at different stops hopefully we get bigger numbers as we go Cheers Oh I remember your face how excited there's a few different rigs here today that come out these ones very Australia and it's got a sidecar to carry their s key here he got Winston Rawdon up back he's the mascot for the black dog right obviously somebody used to do with it here the event vehicle on me check out the tank that is a very very nice bike all right everybody's heading to their boys ready to go hopefully she don't get too wet and see is probably Varuna toilet stop you're gonna love this and all these bikes are not favored a bit here we go playful a little bit ready to roll [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right guys fear stop off the marina on the freeway just give you a little look at some of the

[Music] [Music] [Music] although the rides all done raffles have been drawn didn't win anything but that's not what I said they're just a few just a few words I suppose just what the ride is about and like I mentioned at the beginning it's raise awareness of a mental health and suicide prevention I think most people have had some encounter with it with our friends or family so you know keep an eye on your friends and probably more to the point part of the reason why I've started doing these videos is just that people know that get out there and do stuff for yourself that's what I'm doing it's a fine time for me usually it's in the boat you see us on the motor voice but it doesn't matter what you're doing just get out there do something keep you keep your mind healthy and yeah I mean hopefully that helps you but keep an eye on your mates you", "oB3yJStzlow": "my grammar rhetoric and again this is an interesting photo this photo is a molder of our 670 hull so it's our 670 how will the walkthrough so you're going to be a commercial boat then fourth survey it's going to do a business called sea cleaners now see clean is our operate throughout the North Island and you're going to see a lot more of their boats am they'll be cleaning up the auckland harbour for the America's Cup recently they have two black dog kits and they've just given us a mower for another - yeah you're gonna see these things over around a lot so imagine repainting Black Jimmy powered by mercury but the 670 walkthrough built to survey of interest we do quite a few boats built to survey to maritime New Zealand survey we have a local server as Steve Mehmet Steve never at the server he's basically across the road from us so Steve can just walk down although I do know he does drive down to see us but he is literally across the road pips next time Steve you could walk but the 670 walk through it's going to be a boat and full survey used for keeping our harbours clean it's still a lot of boat to go but come and have a bit of a walk the room inside the spoke has to be seen to believe it is literally it is just absolutely huge so no cutter have a look at the inside of this bokya it feels like you can down it's just huge it really is the whole leaf overall of the boat is six point seven meters believe it or not here they'll be picking up rubbish is a rubbish tip so they pick up plastic and logs and bottles and just anything that's not natural in the water so this boats special and has a red on the top the so if they see some rubbish they can't drive in they get in the client can go and get it see clearance we should all remember that name they're doing a great job keeping our harbors clean now G we have a stern capstan electric powered air so they can't you're stood on to the water but it is just huge Here I am a working space back to this over three meters of uncluttered dick space in this boat not to mention the walks are on the Bell so we're really proud that we've been able to build true boats for sea cleaners and keep them happy enough where they basically said to us guys go and build us another two so we've got another two under construction and these will probably go out to them probably a month after everything kids sixteen in the walkthrough we actually sell a few of these in turn northern Australia are from the Great Barrier Reef really good beginning to an island just card in your passengers they can walk through the front of the boat have a ladder on the front and you have access to the land rather sure you don't have any squirrels but every boat were you using every square centimeter of the room the 670 walk through was a really good option is one of these here and former ap ever want to ride and one just give me a call to know Jackie up a sea

takes more under the age of 40 than the National Road toll it's a sobering thought those lives that were taken need not to be in vain as depression is brought more into conversations everywhere one of those pioneers to deal with this so-called undoable subject is the black dog right and it just gets bigger and bigger take a look at this [Music] so this is the Penrith black dog ride we had 641 pre-registered riders which is a new record for the Penrith right before this the the largest amount we had was 447 so it's quite a good quite a good turnout on top of that we have around 100 or so walk-ins on the day put it and be more at the moment but there's quite a few people turning up and this is all to raise awareness of depression and suicide prevention we bring awareness simply by turning up in a massive group what we have today as you can see and simple thing is all you got to do is ask for friends are you ok simple conversation starter that made to save a life with the military clubs on the front oh there was a respect we lost over 70 for veterans last year to suicide we lose more people at then we lose in battle which is something that probably aren't necessarily aware of at all times and the current suicide rates are more than double the road toll and it's the highest cause of death in adults under 45 in Australia so it's a real problem quite a few of us actually do suffer from PTSD myself I actually do something pretty bad and seeing a lot of young men and women actually taking their own lives we need to get the word out and if we don't too many are going to take their own lives a bit of a Winston plague inventor at the moment which is nice to see we actually had needed to get someone to steal some for us on the way up from all breeze over his

try and make something work makes it work but the ride should be good today a suspension that's been really good it makes the right bit more softer the putty Road no matter what the conditions are you'll have a nice a nice easy ride it's gonna be an awesome day on the putty Road today it won't be a fast road we'll ride out Cody Rhodes nice and steady and Greg and Kathy we will have raffles that we live music entertainment it's one of the best motorcycling roads in Australia in my opinion it is a very nice right it's also it can be a dangerous road it's taken a toll over the years and that's why we today will be sticky fruit nice and steady on the way out there we're heading to drag on cafe which is run by young king grace and kids have really big supporter to the data cycle community and

Boise today are Jennifer ah joins us with more on a story that's positively Idaho Gemma it's called the black dog syndrome where people pass up black color dogs for lighter colored ones organizers told me they hope to raise awareness on this issue he's our pride and joy now louder proud owners of black dogs came out to bring their pups for a walk featuring free raffle prizes and dog food samples organizers of the black dog walk hope to raise awareness on the discrimination of black dogs more than fifty percent of cats and dogs and animal shelters are black colored like Greg here and organizers say it's very important that they find a home Greg is up for adoption at the canyon county animal shelter along with many others the Idaho Humane Society also reports having many black dogs and cats pet owners say they don't understand why regardless of any color or breathe dogs cats whether they're black white grey they just give unconditional love because of the black dog syndrome any black and even dark-colored dogs end up doomed to death at these animal shelters the faces and the eyes are black so they don't see the expressions on their faces and then some are superstitious just like cats as people connect evil with black so if they think that the dog is mean or whatever that takes over common sense sometimes but the worst thing this dog will do two years organizers say they hope more people will look into the heart and soul of these dogs instead of the color of their fur the monthly black dog walk always features free raffle and food samples it always starts at noon in

love it the old farmhouse to an abandoned mill together they restore repurpose or resell whatever Salvage they can find they're saving pieces of history and America one Salvage job at a time value just keeps going up they are the salvage Dawgs yeah we got a large collection of them come on in Ted the big project we got in Norfolk this week build a cleat all around the base this week at the dog another opportunity to excel clean it up for us do a light sanding let's cut it sixty inches I want to build a swinging daybed this wood is just got so much character to it it's not like a horror movie doesn't I've got to take off I got a salvage job like I do up in Edison New Jersey you got any questions give me a call all right y'all move your lighters out down and tilt back tilt it back you're not gonna do it guys pushing it up against that wood now let it come down I've been told that it's one nil on every structure called the Jesus now and when you pull the Jesus nail out so Jesus everything falls down to get that that's gold baby it's a toothpaste don't underestimate the dung man the value keeps going up that's our main thrust besides its intended purpose for ease of another purpose another function so people like pieces like this because they've got stories everything's got a story and it's being saved from the wrecking ball or the landfill so people feel good about buying stuff that has been used in that fashion and everything that we produce primarily is just that let's repurpose come on on Mike and Robert grab a seat first of all wouldn't all of you love to have your own trailer would that be great when you can introduce Michael Michael Mike Whiteside and Robert Kyle Pierre kind of unfiltered unscripted to talk about what they have and I want to say first I want to personally thank them because um when I shop for my wife's birthday or Christmas or anniversary I'm a hunter not a gatherer and you can go right to Black Dog and I've bought more things there I think I may have helped you be successful because I'm buying lots of things there it's just a fantastic place and during our lunch break it's really close to here and you can go do some shop in there if you would like and then and then it's community leaders you probably wonder why are we talking about this well I can tell you that that something like Black Dog salvage has an incredible impact on your community and I think it's it's really immeasurable folks in Roanoke don't realize the impact that they have not just around the country but around the world I mean there are tour buses that come in to see their shop to meet these guys really to meet Molly May there and to and to just be part of the experience and and I think they really represent what's great about it yesterday I talked about the importance of being authentic and quirky and I think they they get bigger both down really well um and then I think my other message to you is that you know you don't go back to your own community you don't know what your Black Dog salvage will be you know in Savannah it was Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil who thought a book would have launched a whole industry down there and and here black dog really is doing that you don't know what it is so what you have to do is just nurture everything look for those creative folks look for the people who really are part of what you are and so with that I'm gonna jump off with a few questions but then we'll make sure that we leave time time for you all to so let's start off first with so to tell us about Black Dog you know how did you get started and why do you think Roanoke plays a partner story well Roberts from Roanoke so that was one of the reasons that half the equation was here my wife's from here so she drugged me up not kicking and screaming but just she told me she was gonna go to Roanoke if I had to come come on so I figured they had an airport in the phone I could I can do business and that's kind of looking for something to do and I needed a barn built not a barn a garage and I got Robert third-hand so you never know kind of how twist of fates gonna change your life and he didn't build a garage for me but we we did collaborate on our first salvage job as a spec venture right here in rona yeah that's that's we found ourselves here and an opportunity presented itself which was a old house that was gonna be torn down did progress and Mike and I were talking about other things like his his project and start talking about old architecture and things that we loved and we had a lot in common when it came to that and that opportunity was there so we took it and now Roanoke has a good stock of of houses to be so harvest as well as some that were available for picking that's what we like to call it we we never like to be the catalyst for that picking but if it's gonna go to the landfill we want to get in between it so that's how we ended up here and it's you know this is where we've decided to live and so we needed to find a way to make a living and that's what we did yet so um you know recycling I mean what they do is they recycle buildings I mean that's pretty high level of recycling there and in addition in addition to selling the old house parts you also create new works of art with with what you salvaged and maybe you could talk a little bit about that well it's easy to get the stuff I say easy it's there's it's plentiful out there it's a lot of hard work to remove and reclaim but the repurposing part of this whole thing is really kind of what is kind of put us on the map a little bit due to the recycling movement never come on stage with children or dogs I'm comfortable with it right and so the people came in and say I need a table I need this I need that and you know you either send them out to find it somewhere else so you add you add value to what you already have and I think I see Beth Macy out there and she was one of my first customers or victims maybe and and we started creating from from the salvage pile and it's a resource pile it's it's vintage materials and so we were able to create these pieces for people and what they wanted no there's only only only limitations are physics moon gravity and the bottom of your credit card and and and it's been it's been an adventure ever since we we've gotten thousands and thousands of people we've shipped to Australia and Greece and some of the UK and and all over the country so Black Dog has kind of become known for its it's repurposing prowess so to speak see mom when you look at a like like Mike said finding all this you know the salvage is fairly easy to do except for the work that you see us doing they're selling it can be challenging depending on the community you live in and you know the size of the community and the and the budget of the people that live in the community Mike and I sat and really admired our collection for a long time and decided that you know we need to do something else with it and luckily Mike's got a great imagination and he is not restricted by all the right angles that I am so it it was we were able to just jump out there build ourselves a shop cobble ourselves a shop together and start building materials out of all this inventory that we had turns out there's a word for that it's called upcycling and we've been doing it for about 1516 years long time long time and then we recently or in the last 10 years or five years somebody put a name to it and and really what it amounts to is we we are collecting all these things that have this fantastic energy already invested in these materials whether it was a carpenter 150 years ago or a stonemason 100 years ago and those those materials have that energy invested in them and now we're giving it additional life we find it you know we're always in the recycling business as well but that is the last stop for our materials besides before the landfill it's much better to be upcycling it and conserving all that energy and putting it into new fantastic creations well you know tell us a little bit about how do you build a sustainable business I know a lot of us are trying to you know creating makers faces we're trying to encourage entrepreneurship well here's an example of building a business from you know really from nothing to where it is today and then we'll talk a little bit about the the TV venture but let's start first with it how do you how do you build a real sustainable business like this and what role might the community play in that well you might want to start with a business plan I'd highly advise it I've tried the alternative family much yeah and it's what you see today you know we've stumbled our way to success and so but it's it's you know figure out where you want to where you want to go first where you want this business to go you know if I had this knowledge of my head 15 years ago I probably wouldn't be doing this but the having a destination for your company is is very important and nobody could ever have predicted our destination it was it was truly fate it's bringing a salvage job or a business to Roanoke was probably not in the grand scheme of the Roanoke Planning Commission or a the destination it's always easier or Chris's bretty predecessor more expensive to to take this to a bigger metropolitan area Charlotte Richmond DC these companies thrive a little easier there Roanoke was really well that's where we're gonna live and this is where we're going to start it so that's how that's how our decision to start this business and do our best to be sustainable the product or the the product coming in is very sustainable because it's plentiful it's moving it out there and to the public and getting people to buy it that's really the hard part yeah you know obviously we're a sustainable business I mean the idea behind the businesses sustainability but our goal in our struggle has been how do we how do we turn that idea into an actual sustainable business model it's been difficult there's no question we pride ourselves on being environmental capitalists and that means that we we're standing on our own financially speaking it's it's it's our pocketbooks that have been financing this we've had some help along the way thankfully from the city on a couple endeavors that we've done but really the only way we can continue to do this sustainable idea and process is have it financially sustainable in the long run and I think that's a something to keep in mind when trying to encourage entrepreneurs and others to get into this type of businesses is that it's it's got to work you know for the long term if it's not going to have any government help or grants or anything like that this this sustainable idea has to be financially sustainable and it's it's difficult and the community has to support it and it's you know again it's there's only so much that Roanoke can buy from us so we have to we've done our best to to advertise to the region one of our best probably ventures or advertising was NPR and their reaches is vast for its footprint and it's and it brands you as a you know your W vtf in particular I would say yes yes Robert said but that's you know that's part of the the success story is how do you get there and and Yan business plan keep that on the front page and then figure out where you want to go because you know Ron oh it's a great town it's I'm not saying it's been easy to create what we've created here but now that we're here it's it's got legs so to speak right and the great corporate citizens I know you know the sponsor things around the community when Sheryl Crow came for our kickoff at Elmwood Park they did this really cool green room she and her kids just had a ball there it helps us tell our story better now let's move on to the TV show so when you all started this business you knew you would become you know international media celebrities and by the way part of their business plan was okay first we get a TV show that was our advertising grab that plan last week so what is the impact been of you know you're going on TV you're you just talk about you're gonna start filming your sixth season now how's that impacted your business and and and just just the way that that black dog is right now well you can never plan this I think there's a lot of people out there trying to do the reality TV genre and there's many many failures and probably more failures than successes we didn't go after the reality thing we were approached a few times failed miserably and just said well I guess we don't have what it takes and kept on with our business but a buddy of mine happens to be a producer now if you have a buddy it's a producer successful reality producer then go after it the next thing you have to do is have something a story to tell you have a personality we did our first pilot with in South Boston and Robert was a day and a half late and getting to the salvage job and we were out there being filmed and Billy bill Hayes figure eight films says you know I'm gonna go on home and leave my cameraman and video audio guy here just to finish up I'm going like what happened we missed it Robert shows up here comes the right angle boss clipboard carrier and immediately identified there's the combination and that's what's really kind of sustained us I will buy you guys carpet here before there's gonna be a different color but it's not gonna be beaten up like this so that's the the that has been really something that is that's how it started we thought we were going to they said we'll have five episodes Robert says there's no way we're gonna get past five episodes and we figure we'd have really good commercial right and it's worked out well well then the under commercial ization at scale impact on the business itself and we've been filming I guess for about three years November for 3x we've completed 65 episodes 52 of them have been aired so far we started out with a very tight-knit 7 to 8 employees three and a half years ago and we're probably around 32 right now and that's I'm not beating my chest on that and thinking about payroll and and the management of the same thing but it's that's a that's an impact our sales have increased dramatically the visitors from out of town it's it's unbelievable the people that actually watch TV it amazes I'm not a TV watcher but it appears there's a lot of people that are he's watching now for ya and the NA and they honestly are excited to come there they may be on their way touring or they they come here as a destination and then they come visit black dog and there and they're not only impacting my business but they're impacting my neighbor's business restaurants hotels other shops and we are pumping it all we've got we've got stuff so how do we create a this synergy and make everybody in something out of a benefit out of it and and also spread it around and also all of it is designed to come back to us and say okay well how do we get our local community knowing what we're doing because people all over the country did so it's been impactful q Chris Chris has been a real supporter of ours and has helped us through the the process of expansion and what it takes with the city to she's having fun to grow a small business and really truly folks we are a small business and with all the the pitfalls and and pains and everything that goes with it so anybody wants to feel or wants to pick our brains on on how it how it is that a little business like us has gotten to a national stage I got Beth Macy over there to write me a book and bath you even though you're writing your book but it's it's it's truly a bit of benefit to rona because if you watch the show and it is it is it is touting she's really taken off now and she well maybe one of the girls can come pick her up here and so I don't have to buy as much carpet but the the impact I think what Robert was saying to Rhoda has been huge and in our show we are we are shameless in touting our own hometown and and and what it means to us because both our kids grew up here are all our kids grew up here are and we're proud of it we're proud of our community and and we we do our best to support it and put it on probably the best legs that we could do on an on national TV show and one of the other things I'd like to make sure what we're talking about the television show is is that many of you probably haven't seen it but it is and and when I try to tell people I'm in a reality TV show they kind of look at me a little crooked but it's a it's a very positive it's a very positive show and it shows business relationships positively personal relationships positively and certainly our community positively so we're we're very proud of that there really if you if you go by their place there in the place making business you can see what they've created out there it's just incredible and you all don't know this but you know our first target was honey boo boo but then we couldn't get honey boo boo you know we had we had go for Black Dog salvage but we've been very pleased we got some honey boo boo in it now that we're this far into it we could kind of do pretty much anything we'll lose but it'll be it'll be a very exciting exit they call that jump in the shark well we're gonna get to question is just maybe it maybe just to wrap up this question answer between us is so what's the next step for Black Dog what do you see the future going well we're in the process of branding ourselves now we've worked real hard at this that and we are taking it to a to build product that is reflects what we do Salvage inspired furniture we're creating a furniture line we have a paint line coming out we're we're in the capitalist part of the business at the moment and and it all reflects the show black dog and how how we've gotten this to a platform that is marketable and you know it's it's much easier to build a product and then try to find the market we've created the market and now we just filling it with product so that's you know everybody says we're your sugar capitalists you for the money yes we are but we give that's that's more the shameless part that's the shame Roberts part up I'm the freelance so we're I mean we are certainly expanding our own employ employment base we're also outsourcing things locally with many craftsmen are taking some of the load off of us where we're taking we we make a prototype and then we supply them with materials to expand that to limited runs of furniture through you know mike comes up with these designs and might might might borrow some of those designs from things he's seen and you know obviously the the ability to place that stuff on a on a television show and that repeats over and over and over again as an opportunity that we're gonna take advantage of and that's what we're in the process of doing and i think we're we're gonna do that locally and we're gonna do that nationally and we're gonna do that internationally in some phases of the types and lines of furniture that we have in mind we're also expanding our our location our headquarters our world headquarters and we we were just able to purchase a little expansion land for parking parking has become a real problem for us and the city if we're gonna helped us with that they had some surplus land and with the right plan that we are going to put in action present to the city they were kind enough to sell it to us so we're getting ready to take action on that and maybe there's some more possibilities for synergy with other companies to move in alongside us with the the additional land that we have here we're hoping that the Roanoke community and surrounding areas really embrace what we've brought forth so to speak and and that use this as a bounce to to Korea more businesses ie whatever you know beer or wine or cookies or whatever whatever call devices they're making and drinking I'm maintaining this what I do folks but you know again they've been supportive but there's so much more coming and and this thing's gonna have legs for many many years to come now a couple we've got some questions from the audience out there I'd like to ask anything come on up we got one right here that's Jim Crawford one of the neighborhood leaders from from that area mr. tobacco man hey hey Robert Mike congratulations to you in the whole black dog crew as fabulous the impact on our neighborhood has been tremendous and continues I can attest to the impact of the show I know at least six times I've been up at the community garden working and there will be some car from not from Roanoke sort of wandering around they'll stop and say do y'all know where Black Dog salvage is and always happy to tell them not questions to both of you what do you think makes you - good business partners or polar opposites there's no question about that that's first you have to respect each other in Robert not have a similar background both ex-navy Robert was an officer I was nosed so that creates the hierarchy not a chance and it's it's respect for each other no matter what happens you know we've got each other's back we have our mutual interest in heart at heart and in our team and our business so that's probably one of the most important things when you're when you're with a partner to share the pain to share the glory and and and have someone that that you know it's a I always say that you know Roberts my other wife or I'm kids otherwise I'm not sure which way that guy's without the benefits I got more debt with him I got my my realize that we're we're anchored pretty hard together so that makes it's a bond hopefully we're going to share the the upside yeah it's it's nice to have somebody that you know you can bounce things off against and Mychal often times come in screaming yelling at me and and Sam it's just between you and me this is you know as far as trying to keep it down there we all we were able to vent to each other while then out to the public most of the time it's always that you know that it's the positive foot forward and you need that and you need somebody that you can a trust and be trust not to spread it around and just you know keep it going so we've been at it for about 16 years some very tough times as far as financially going many of them just constant investment but hopefully it's gonna pay off someday we keep investing and and we're still talking to each other so it works out good good morning as the daughter of a veterinarian I first have to say Molly Mae is so beautiful very healthy very well and my dad the veterinarian watches your show so I've seen it when I when I've been home so it's really really fun to have you all here today Krista with she got she she ramrodded that save save a lab Foundation and shamelessly got me loved and loving her so there you go my question is actually what you just referenced your military service the Expo team had shared your background online and I had wanted to ask did that initial public service and military experience has that informed or helped you along the past 16 years and does it continue to play a part in inspiring you to do this great public service for a rono conferred the world well I'm both Rob and I are very proud of our service and we we served voluntarily voluntarily and it's it teaches you a discipline okay and that's one thing that if you get nothing out of the service you know how to get along with others and how to work as a team and that's where robert knives discipline through the service has really kind of kept the core of our business solid you know and everything goes chaos is going wild which happens daily over there you know that we got two anchors and then the other anchors are out there the rest of our team were the people who run this thing and you know we kind of liken it to running a ship Robert was a lieutenant on a boat and drove ships that's a ship it's not bus yep yep I used to run yachts for a living so I had you know 15 years of command experience there's there's you know people looking up to you for leadership and and I guess when it comes right down to it that's the main word is leadership take it own it and drive it forward and it certainly was one of the driving forces of our the beginning of our partnership is that common background had a lot to do it started the conversation what did you do what did I do you know that type of thing got it going but from an organizational standpoint and trying to keep you know you know from hurting cats basically is is one of the things that you you got to deal with on a daily basis in a business and we're gonna edit that that experience of leadership which is what the military really stresses has been a real real plus for both of us to have in our back pockets a question here from Bruce who will be performing and healthy happy cook November 19th the plug for is that a song it was yesterday so here's my question a lot of people have started businesses or organizations a lot of people have been through the startup phase maybe even been through the the initial sustaining phase talk about the growth phase you guys were busy businessmen working lots of hours before the TV show and and that doesn't take away all the work that you still had to do you're still having to do now you have basically a second job talk about balancing that is there any chance of balancing that and how that all fits together I wish we only had two jobs I've got three myself at least but you know you have to do it you have to figure out a way to do it because let's face it our explosive growth right now is it's going to be you know I expect it to be fleeting we're not going to have a television show forever we need to strike while the iron's hot and we're going to a year from now who knows two years from now we could we could be completely out let's take care of it while we can so you work you hire when absolutely necessary and you split up the work and you try to compartmentalize it so you don't go absolutely insane and I think we're about maybe three quarters we're in therapy folks the main thing is have good people around you we've always had a good core you know people come and go but you get good people around you that can implement your your dream and and let it become their dream this is really kind of key you know when people own a company if nothing else in their spirit they're your best salespeople you know people come in to us and say you guys got the greatest staff in the world oh so happy I said you know thank you that's that's a feather in our cap it's it tells that Roanoke is a place to come and visit and do business if that's your if that's what you desire so so I actually have a really good friend who grew up in Roanoke and actually just started his own salvage and repurposing business in Raleigh North Carolina and so he's I've heard a lot of stories about the picking process and just some really interesting finds that he's gotten and some really great history that's come out of it was a big shopper I think still is that Black Dog salvage so it was kind of fun to see him shot there and then move on start his own business but how do you feel like the work that you are doing through this through picking through historic homes and saving these really incredible pieces how does that kind of further the history or celebrate the history of Rona wherever you are are there any great stories that come out of it like do you have any real interesting pieces that you found you wanna share about her you know one of my favorite stories and to get right to your point first what's what's the name of his company or whose business Ferdinand and El Alexander that's Raleigh North Carolina yeah we the Cheshire Cat in downtown Raleigh fantastic the great thing about our business is there's no I mean as far as we've concerned all the 1516 years we've been doing it there's no competitors they're all partners all resources absolutely and we're all at the same goal is to save these things before they head to the landfill and each one of them has a story they have a maker long since dead probably and it deserves this story needs to be told and you can tell it by recreating it reselling it the one of the things that tell people that get into the salvage business is is yes it's it's a great business but concentrate on selling it's called hoarding and we've turned hoarding into a because if you're if you're trying to save it from the landfill that's great but if you're just trying to temporarily keep it from the landfill that's another thing all together we all wind up in the landfill we're just trying to prolong funniest peace I mean it's one of the interesting pieces we got and we've got so many 30 years it's really kind of hard to put your finger on but one was the Eiffel Tower scale model Eiffel Tower 45 feet tall was one of our episodes in Columbus Ohio which was now I think it's living over there in Northeast you had to bring it up that's the continuation of the story what we're what we're doing here is adding where we're creating antiques of the future basically these things have story they've got an energy and what we do is is is kind of just prolong their the store they live on past us the pieces that we're building they have two or three stories and there's nothing wrong with embellishing their stories either is or Mike and yeah that's like never everyone something needs an extra helping hand now Robert that doesn't happen folks but there's so many different things it's hard to put your finger on one of them it's they change every day you know I just I just love when there's four out of it out I love when the truck pulls up in the lot goin like what's this guy got alright I'm gonna ask the last question first of all I'm gonna thank you guys I want to thank Black Dog and Krista for making this possible I know it's Saturday morning and there are a lot of other things you may rather be doing but we really appreciate it so much a lot of what Expo is about is sort of redefining sort of reimagining what's possible versus what's thought to be impossible and nobody loves a wild idea any more than I do and I must say you know when I heard about doing the pilot for the TV show it was like wow that is Adam that is amazing and I want to hear more about how that actually occurred because that's a very difficult you've got this friend and all of that but there were some conversation about hey do you think and somewhere along the line the sense of what would seem impossible became possible and I'd like to just hear more about that from you guys and then Jeff may is going to come up thank you we Mike mention this briefly but I receive calls for in five or six years from from production companies and they say hey we'd like to we think you'd be great on reality TV or an unscripted television show and we'd like to come up there and film you and it will only cost you I say well you know I've got I've got Bruce Brian doing my advertising I'm really happy with him I don't need any additional help and then serendipity strikes you know Mike Mike's buddy fishing buddy bill Hayes who is the creator of John and Kate Plus eight and sister wives countless other shows one recently burning crashing and burning the Duggars was his as well happens to be a fishing buddy of Mike's and Ned Hooper's a local local surgeon right you know you know you can't plan this like I said you'd said it happens organically and by chance and and Ted Ayers and myself four characters Robert is a secondary player reluctantly reluctant reluctant celebra he's a reluctant reality star but what you have to have is a story to tell and in personalities the carrier we have a building full of person out I mean stories to tell and the rest of it is about the day-to-day antics pain creations at Black Dog salvage and that's what the public has has locked into and so to start a show like this and I'm sure there's million people out there going and we've been propositioned after the fact is hey I just want you to come and follow me around because I got a cool life I'm really cool I'm really cool and so we point them to the producers as they go talk of those guys and they they they never you think about what the cost of that production is and trying to keep it real and then we literally have people saying you know I I'm really cool I'd like a camera to follow me around 24/7 and it just doesn't work that well I don't I don't want a camera phone and I wouldn't have thought it would work for us either but the production company Trailblazer studios and figure eight films out of the Raleigh area really came up with a great way to showcase the relationships showcase the store because the other thing that you really want to do if you ever want to have that have the need to be on unscripted television is have something to sell that's not you or your family maybe you but not your family so make sure I've been told me a long time when a guy really respect he says he's in business it says make sure that this business will run without you and and of course you know they play these episodes over and over again and you put good people around you you get a machine move in one direction and you're able to step back from it and watch the creation and still be a part of it but it's important to do that yeah well I want to thank Mike and Robert for share in the morning with us and and for those of you from Roanoke and from those of you from other cities that you have businesses like this and we have to make sure as community leaders that we celebrate them and we celebrate their successes because I want good people like this to make a fortune because it's good for all of us I'm with you Chris yeah you", "j8W2pNYfmls": "you saw the Balvenie what dog the black you mean like the Led Zeppelin song no Cruz knows what I'm talking about

Bernard has but put a treat in front of these guys and it's waterfowl City and on how gentle Connie courses are watch this Bruce okay the most gentle dog I've ever had my entire life this is not typical that's if you have a treat typically conic horses do not drool that much are they dangerous a well-trained and socialized Connie c\u00e1rcel is not dangerous in an aggressive manner now due to their extreme size like I said these 152 pounds you do need to take necessary precaution when you're playing with them they're large when they're running around with you playing they can knock you over resulting in injury other than that they're not dangerous and they're an extremely loving and gentle breed how are they with kids Connie Courcelles make amazing family pets and they love everyone in the household especially children like I said they're extremely gentle but due to their large size you must take necessary precaution around children and always supervise your child when they're with their colleague or so how are they with other pets if you have other pets in the house no need to worry because Connie carsales tend to take those pets and take them into their path as the kind of course will seize you as part of its pack it's gonna see your other animals your cat your dog is part of its pack and it will show the same type of Guardian instincts towards your other pets that you have in the household so they are great with other animals in the house especially when raised with other animals what is their energy level like tiny courses are a medium energy level dog they definitely need daily exercise and more importantly they need daily mental stimulation they're a working breeds so they need a job to do mentally stimulating your Connie Corso is gonna drain their energy far more than physical exercise and if you can combine the two that's even better are they good for first-time dog owners unfortunately this breed is not for first-time dog owners they need a family that's on the same page with excellent leadership ability everyone in the family needs to be a leader to the dog Connie courses are extremely easy to please so in that manner they're easy to train without proper leadership in place though they're gonna feel like they need to be the leader they're gonna start making the decisions for you and is a recipe for disaster with this breed so unless you have excellent dog leadership abilities I highly do not recommend this breed for first-time owners are they good Guardians connect horses make excellent Guardians they're extremely possessive by nature of their people and their property so they're very quick to alert you to anything out of the ordinary how are they with strangers an adult time a course well doesn't really care about strangers too much now as a puppy they want to be pet by every single stranger they see they want all the attention as they age that starts to change properly socialize they shouldn't show any aggression towards strangers now they will be alert and suspect of strangers but that's not the same as showing aggression toward the stranger I hope this gives everyone a good look on what to expect from my kind of course so if you bring one into your house head over to my youtube channel Jason quarry to see more of Bruce Wayne and more information on kind of horses and Bruce Wayne and I'll see you guys soon [Music] [Music] you", "mKJlTAXByLo": "[Music] [Music] hello and thank you so much for tuning in so today I'm actually doing a video of a hunt that I had that really didn't go to where I wanted it to so I'm sitting in the woods and I hear to my left I hear some crunching I'm like oh look it's a deer bro now for those of you who have no clue of the dimmer is the front parts of deer the back parts of zebra it's a deer bruh so I'm like hey am I getting shot at a deer today some sitting there and all sudden I look it's a dog bro again the front parts a dog the back parts of zebra just watch the video and this is why people need to have their dog on a leash of course I'm sitting at my stand and a black tie hear something crunching them I was a deer coming in I know wouldn't a deer it was a dog bro yeah damn dog", "xtgRqiVek9k": "I'm Dr. Clayton Greenway with healthcareforpets.com and this is Trudy. We're going to talk about how to trim your dog's nails. The first thing I want to mention is you want to do this very slowly, think about just trying to trim one nail once and then stopping and then go back to it the next day and trim another nail. Make sure that every time you do this you praise them a lot and give them treats so that it's a pleasant experience. If you try to do too much too fast, it can scare the dog and they'll remember it so future events will be a lot more traumatic for them and difficult to perform. One thing about Trudy is that she has black nails and this can make it really difficult. When a dog has clear nails you can see the pink quick inside the nail but you don't want to cut.  Once you cut into the quick that's when the nail is going to bleed and it's going to be extremely painful. So what you want to do is you want to trim a tiny amount of the nail off at a time. You want to look at the fresh-cut cross-section of the nail and you'll see that inside the black nail it will look generally white.  As you get closer to the quick, a small black dot start to appear in the center of that white area of the nail inside that means that the quick is very close and you're going to want to stop trimming the nail at that point so when you trim the nails you're going to want to make sure that your dog is accepting of it. I don't want you to put yourself at risk and keep in mind that you don't often interact with your dog in this way and it may make them upset or they may tend to bite you when they wouldn't in other circumstances.  If your dog becomes aggressive towards you, I want you to stop, I want you to consider having someone else do the nail trims for you. When we pick up Trudy's leg, she's going to naturally want to pull it back into her body and that's why I'm holding it very close to her.  If I pull it away from her, she's going to start paying attention to it and try to pull it back and fight me. I can expose the nail better by squeezing the paw and lifting up one of the digits from underneath. Then I take my nail trimmers, I put them just at the edge of the nail and I trim just a little bit off at a time always looking at the fresh cut portion of it to look for that little black dot that tells me when to stop. If you're having a lot of difficulty with this I want you to talk to your vet about things that you can give your dog that may reduce it's anxiety or potentially sedated in order to get a nail trim performed. Keep in mind that it's really stressful, so even giving a little bit of sedation is a healthy thing to do in those circumstances. If you learn to do this you'll really be able to cut down on your vet bills and they won't have to have scary visits to get their nails done. If you're trying this for the first time you could end up cutting the quick, it would be very painful the dog will probably remember it for the rest of its life and the nail will also bleed. There are products you can buy that will make the nail stop leading quickly and coagulate that blood because when nails are cut too deep they'll tend to bleed for quite a while. Remember to start as early as possible, be as slow as possible, and always reward and praise them afterwards and you'll have good success with it future.

truck Salvage style that was a really really challenging build and I know it didn't look like it on the show but it took better part of my mine to complete it was a complete frame-up rebuild we took the back window and we actually attached it to the back of the cab and then did a custom frame on the back with hardwood bed and rusty metal on the sides it was really cool and as a fabricator it was really challenging within really rewarding at the end to see the final product and you get to drive it around you know you get to take it places where people can see and everybody on the road was

return journey through the wood the dog reappeared and did the same as before years later two convicted prisoners told the chaplain that they would have robbed and murdered the Wayfarer in the forest that night but were intimidated by the presence of the black dog Gytrash the guide rash a legendary black dog known in northern England was said to haunt lonely roads awaiting travelers appearing in

loves now being trained so I haven't trim these now for several days as you can see the Alpha edge have grown out of the in the the coral thumbnail I mean you can see that so the young see you see the white circle the nail any other nails more significant here see that white edge just have to grow out of the core of the nail so I'm gonna cut out that area the outside area and then I'm gonna cut this tip right here I'm gonna cut off this area okay I'm gonna do that and I'll show you afterwards okay here's two nails this one I haven't trimmed you can see still have the white edge that grow out like higher than the black area in the center panel and this white is trimmed you can see will be like more flat and that's basically as deep as you can go and and the bottom area here is not comfortable doing this this area I'm going to use a file a regular nail file to file it down a little bit to make it more smooth okay let's see so here the left now I still haven't trimmed yet and this is now I just trimmed on a file that lighting okay hope you can see this it's like a flight and smooth around that's basically how I trim he's now I will trim till these end till these like look like this that I'm gonna leave it alone okay I'm gonna do the rest of these nails and I'll show you afterwards you can see the different okay so here's a nails I finished trimming fowling so they normally look like this so and don't forget the dewclaws okay as a comparison that's a polyp that haven't been trained okay now I'm gonna trim these pot and I'll show you again okay here's the same paw I just trimmed on the file so that's basically what he's now gonna look like after nail trimming you can see I felt I clip the tip of these nail and the side and that will use a regular nail fell to fell down the edge okay now let's look at the back pulse is the same you can see them I just really on significand you can see the edge grow out that grow taller than the center so that's basically part you can train down a little bit especially these one wrong white circle to trim down that area and you don't want to cut too deep in the center that flag for so that will cut a quick really quick okay I'm gonna trim this one and I'll show you okay here's that I trimmed but before I fell it down as you can see I trimmed top area of the nail really hard to find the forecast okay okay think these is a best picture I can get and now I'm gonna foul it down here's the after I filed it down okay now the nail trimming and the teeth brushing has finish so here's my dog good boy um I'm gonna talk a little bit about the tools I'm using so for nail trimming I used just a regular nail keeper I got from Amazon mmm it's probably about ten fifteen dollars I bought the one called the top seller or five star ratings um I never used this um safety thing I just I don't need it so I know how deep I can Cod I think without it it's easier and I also use a nail file because a regular human now fell I choose a number is a smaller substantive number like a 80 100 or 80 80 that will be good enough for dogs nails and the basic design for um human-like acrylic nails or fake nails so this will be good enough um and then you always have this quick stop it's um if you cut a quick and start bleeding you're gonna use this it's just a tap you just tap it on the nail and it stopped bleeding it's like a yellow powder it's coming in a very big jar and I just put in a small jar and last forever is TV so done good boy okay thank you for watching bye", "hlx3i-WlKi0": "[Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] do you", "VMM8h0RzshA": "[Music] hey pups and peeps Sanji woods with dog psychology 101 today my son josh is gonna assist me and helping trim dog nails we're gonna introduce you to some concepts that maybe you haven't thought about before most people get in a hurry and they try to wrangle the dog they're trying to hit the moving nail we're gonna talk about cooperate and participate they should trust you enough to give you their little paw now hang with us and let's watch all right you guys may notice that Parker is wearing a basket muzzle so he's a nervous fearful kind of guy and he he may try to bite during his nail trim so this is for his safety now I'm a big fan of basket muzzles because as you see they don't hold his mouth closed it doesn't feel quite as unnatural so in he's not stressed out about it we weren't really hard making this a positive experience for him so it's a tool that you could certainly implement yourself hi I'm Josh woods with dog psychology 101 and I'm gonna be helping with Parker a little bit today giving some tips on nail trimming pretty important thing we did with a lot of dogs who have had bad experiences met with nail trims and when that has happened first things first we have to earn their trust in general you know it's not a great feeling it's understandable why they would be apprehensive and so most dogs are gonna know what the nail trimmers are first thing is let them smell the dough the nose as we know for a dog is the key to everything let them investigate don't try to hide it from him he's he's going to see that the nail clippers are here so what we're gonna be looking for is when he becomes nervous about something whether it's the nail trimmers coming into the environment it's touching the feet beginning to isolate a toe to trim the nail when we see him become sensitive nervous anxious or worried you stop and you slow down so let's say for instance you see how he avoids but the nails members down we try to make him feel a little better get into a better place and Parker knows what's going on he's wise to this he's not in a good state of mind before we begin he's never gonna let us trim the nail because the whole goal is for him to allow us to do it even though he doesn't enjoy it that's a big part of trust so first I would sort of lift the leg now this is a big part of it don't grab the leg don't pull the foot don't squeeze the foot those are big no nose that makes you want to retract and pull so first is getting him to let us hold his leg hold his current so here let's embrace him let's get him stabilized then we can bring the foot up normal Venice touch thing let's try to desensitize a little bit it's okay these little touches with our fingertips relax one of the common mistakes that we do is they retract the foot we want to grab it and squeeze it that's a big no-no one technique rather than grabbing like Josh mentioned is to actually put a hand or your thumb behind the elbow so that when you push it out it extends his leg this way there is no squeezing on the foot they're gonna try not to forcing one nail at a time make it a good thing there we go yeah make some love attach to this as you'll see there ah we can still disagree with him pulling his foot back so he knows that it's not something we wanted to do it's like these are the moments we stop we gather you can't continue in a panic then he'll associate the panic to getting his nail trim the next time you come to trim these nails it's gonna be worse a lot of people have questions about black nails you can't see the quick quite as readily in a black now but if you can flip this nail over there's actually a little hollow side and if you take note there's also a skinny tip here so we just want to take that tip and work our way up a little bit once we start trimming the nail a little bit Parker's nervous say Josh is doing a good job keeping them in line so once we trim it only take a little and when we're working with the dog who's having male trouble we don't need to trim all of the nails at one time we can slow things down but the black nails once we start trimming those if you can actually look at the tip of the blight now as the quick that's coming you'll see a little dot that little dot is the quick itself so once you begin to see that you want to stop it's the most important thing in my opinion is patience and not even really setting expectations about how far we're going to go that is gonna be determined by the dog make your skills if you're if this is something new for you which probably is the case is we have to leave this in a good way for him you know so put yourself in his position this this is a big part of everything that I do with the dog I try to understand their feelings where they're coming from we'll put it in human world what if we go get a manicure and they quick us do you want to get another manicure or at least from that place is it was a pleasant or was it not so Parker has obviously had some bad experiences it's been uncomfortable he's probably been forced to do it and so I can't blame them for being reactive the only way we're gonna get back to this is he has to trust me if it takes me 30 minutes just to have a session of him allowing me to touch his foot that's what we're gonna begin the nail actually clipping the nails the last thing I'm concerned about and so there have been many dogs it takes many visits just to get a flip finished we will get to the point in the future where we can trim all the nails right now it's it's earned the trust that bust step by step don't rush this is the biggest thing I can say we look we look for the future is all about doing things and the the pleasant nice way to put the dog we're gonna use our compassion here patience is key we're gonna relax Trust is earned okay everybody I'm back now wasn't that insightful it's not about the goal of getting the nails trimmed it's actually about the goal of rehabbing your dog through the nail trim learning how to gain their trust and learning how to be patient is number one so if you'd like to learn more about stuff like this please subscribe to our

how to improve the color on a black dog's coat I have a black dog and sometimes this coat is very dull and kind of dusty looking and that's because it is black dog's coats not only pick up every piece of dirt and dust around your home but if you're not feeding them the right food and brushing them and taking care of their coat the right way give you come very very dull so let's talk about food first always start with feeding your dog black coated or other a food that has a lot of good meat protein meat should be the first ingredient so avoid corn or any other grain as the first ingredient the dog will absorb more and nutritionally it will make his coat look great secondly brush your dog's coat at least once a week I try to do it a couple of times a week that's going to take out all of that dead hair dead skin and dirt out of the coat that can make it look dull always wash with a pH balanced shampoo specifically for the canine because their pH level is much different from a human's pH level so washing with the right type of shampoo and always rinsing all of that shampoo off will make their coat brighter and looking better throughout the week or throughout the month lastly in between baths you might want to think about wiping them down with a hypoallergenic wipe or using some kind of deodorizing spritzer and brushing them out or just wiping off all of that dirt and pollen and dust that can kind of build up on their coat throughout the month as well always make sure to dry your dog as much as possible because a wet dog's coat is going to pick up more dirt and at the very end make sure that black dog is wearing a bright collar or bright bandana that's just going to make his color pop even that much more i'm jen fidel founder of the pack mom and today we're talking about how improve the color on your black dog's coat thanks for watching", "9a8WR0WvVro": "david foreign here", "-A6XIe6JK6g": "hi everyone and welcome back how are you guys today you guys i'm i'm

__ ] y'all wanted me to watch this you guys suck by the way first of all i'm not gonna comment on the song because i've already commented in the song like i said i will link it above if you guys want to watch it i can't get into the meaning of the song it's just it's a lot to handle my thing is this is if you did not know if you did not know the meaning behind the song because the meaning behind the song is actually very intense it's very personal and it's something i feel like a lot of people are going through at the moment and it's very raw and i actually i love that he took this moment to speak about things that he is actually struggling with that he has struggled with and how he is doing and i actually i respect the [ __ ] out of that like i have so much respect for him for that alone it's beautiful but if you did not know if you just heard the basics of this i don't think he would connect two and two together because his stage presence it man's attention he has something about him that because this is the first time i've ever seen him on stage by himself there is something where he is like i am here you are going to look at me because i am going to make sure that you hear what i am trying to say and i absolutely love that that aside i don't know how well i handled this i think i handled it and like i'm schmidt i'm out but you guys you know what you let me know you know your thoughts and opinions you know that thing and things stuff and stuff stuff out wet yeah okay i'm gonna go bye i'ma go i love him with my entire heart there there's just a lot to handle within this and i feel like i just need like a break i need a break i need like 10 minutes to just figure out what the hell just happened and clean up the water i spilled on the floor i am gonna go yeah i'm gonna go bye i love you guys i hope you enjoyed watching this if not that's cool too um yeah bye bye i hope you guys are having a good day now day no no day night but yeah i hope you're having a good time um and i will see you later bye love you peace i have no idea anymore bye bye okay", "3uO90weCdLE": "hello youtube this is mark from mm marking money just wanted to do an update as you can see I've got some nice-looking bird in front of me what is the pause the plant at the far back there that's actually a black dog and then the one hit just in the middle here this is actually a zombie curse these are just over six weeks so you know they're coming up towards the never set of wings to finish I think but oh my god like look at the frost or not the zombie curse is just oh my god frosty look look at that that's just standing around well pleased but we sure the veg this was longer because I got the ever black dog in here and I as well as you can see it spins into about week three so you can see they're all starts have a good stretch and that's kind of a good few cold there's only I think and because the everyone this is the black dog over ear this is also same ages that a zombie curse this wasn't just over six weeks in spoon as you can see the birds are just beautiful and then but this one you could see now it's got a lot of heads and like I said hmm that's all because Joe got some nice heads as you can see it's looking really lovely this is look look for that for a birdie just dome in there so yeah I just wanted to just do this update just to say that I got the black dog here which is just over six weeks now it's six weeks Monday and then got the zombie crush here which I really like I think I'm gonna get some more seeds this not just over six weeks again six weeks Monday and then then this word this is the arrow black dog that I put in here just done three weeks ago now and you can see his having to make his brain stretch you know real nice healthy plant plenty of heads gonna rain down just need to get in there and I have a get defoliation but no apart from that the rule is he's really really really good so yeah just so do this video because I hadn't put in an epic or but as a pots I'll show you what a way as you can see can't love me like I said these words really oven Wharton I I saw live Natalie finished but yeah looking really good so pretty happy with I was going yeah hope you all enjoyed the video please like and if you want subscribe that'd be great and like I said this is market by", "NCHtXBDUrcE": "[Music] uh [Music] up yep [Music] uh know", "IvoiWexg9V0": "[Music] hey guys thanks for tuning in once again to grooming by Rudy just again guys we just want to show you another example of when dogs nails get too long you could see here in this dog here how it's twisting the toes and the nails are just you know they have nowhere to go and they're raising the digits and it's very uncomfortable for the dog so once again guys we want to get this and these nails done at least once a month to avoid this problem what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and clip these back and see if he lets us even grind them a little bit and get this dog back in shape it's okay buddy it's okay definitely not liking it guys but you know mainly because you're not used to having it done I'm gonna try to avoid getting his veins again it's a little difficult no stay stay okay Baba okay there we go it's okay it's thing I know it's tough it's okay Baba it's okay it's okay go boy I know I know you're not used to it we gotcha good boy already could just see by putting it down at least it's not I could straighten that toe out and now you know see that but again we're gonna get this even shorter okay guys we're gonna start to grind his nails I don't really know this dog very well so I don't know how he's gonna react but I got this some very low speed so I'm not gonna I don't want to startle him if it's loud but I'm trying not to lift this way too much these facts are very close to the dance to the ring so just getting that sharp edge off good boy buddy okay [Music] just trying to get these down as far as I can for them guys you know I know he's fussing a little bit but identified you get them a little shorter and get that sharp edge off he'll feel more comfortable a lot of times if you're lifting the foot that's what's bothering more than anything you could do it while its resting still get some grinds in there again you know he's fussing this is my first time with this guy so I don't want to startle them or make them feel like you know uncomfortable for the next now clipping I want to get them used to it but you could see the difference right there guys a lot better you know again avoid this by getting your dog's nails done at least once a month okay guys so the reason why we only showed you these two paws here the the right rear and the front is because we didn't want them on the table too long you know again this is kind of like his first time with us and we wanted to keep it to a minimum but we got those nails down as short as we can so hopefully you can walk a little bit better guys once again thank you so much for tuning in don't forget to Like share and subscribe like us on facebook follow us on Instagram and Twitter don't forget to check out our radio show it's called groomer humor on pet life radio we'll leave that link down below once again guys thanks for tuning in beauty [Music] [Music]", "-iRrmr5b6Gk": "rt", "wSDFegiX2T8": "let's do a close up so you guys can actually start to see the layers of the nail and understand how to clip them so you don't hurt your dog and so that you actually start to receive the quick because most pet dogs actually have overgrown nails so I'm sure that many of you will need to do this alright so what we're doing when we're cutting the nail we actually don't really want to spend time cutting the bottom that's where the most of the nerves are located and when you're trying to shorten the overall nail if you spent two-touch time on the bottom you're gonna end up making your dog's paws sore and you might even hurt them while you're clipping so first I want to be playing attention to how tiny of little pieces that I'm taking off I really like to err on the side of caution so instead of focusing on the bottom of the nail I'm actually gonna focus on the top part here in the sides which seems counterintuitive but I'm gonna link in the description below to some more information about nail growth and something called the alternative cut line and cutting the tops and the sides is really how we're gonna get that quick to recede all right so first take a look at how tiny the pieces are I'm just barely trying to shave off the little pieces and one thing you might want to aim for is for it to look like confetti that's what the trimming should look like so you're not taking off big chunks of nail which even if you're sure you're not close to the quick which is sort of hard to tell even if your dog has light-colored nails then you're still causing a lot of stress to the nail and you might still end up hurting your dog even if you're even if you are really far away from the quick so I'm gonna keep cutting along the top and I don't want you guys to keep looking at the little pieces I hope you can see look how tiny the pieces aren't and look at where I'm cutting I'm cutting along the top of the nail so if you can see there are many layers to a dog's nails so the black part that you see on the outside is the hard part and if you touch it with your finger it's really hard that's the horn that grows around the outside as you get closer and closer to what is sometimes called the jelly bean layer which is a soft layer that houses the actual quick you're gonna start to see a little chalky white outline so you can sort of see that white part there's the black part here and then inside is this whitish part so what I'm trying to get down to when I'm trying to receive the quick is the jellybeans layer so it's sort of soft and I'll show you once I get there you can touch it and it it deforms right now I'm pressing on this and it's still hard so I still have some space to go all right so I'm continuing to shave off little pieces all right so where I am right now is on the bottom edge here of the of what I'm clipping off it's soft so I'm gonna see it's just barely getting to the jellybean layer but I don't think you guys can see this but I'm actually pressing my nail in and it goes in a little bit into that layer whereas up here we're still in that hard layer so what I'm going to do I'm so close to there that I'm having a hard time even grabbing with the Clippers so I'm going to move to a file and keep on filing the top edge of the nail and the sides the file that I'm using has two sides it has a heavy-duty hundred grit and a 180 grit which is for smoothing out so I use the rougher side to actually take off layers of nail and by the way if your dog is not familiar with this you may have to start with just that and treat that and treat and some bars are pretty sensitive to the sound so you just want to work at your dog's pace I'm going to keep filing and I'm close remember as I said so I want to make sure that I'm checking periodically especially since these files can actually take off in a surprising amount all right so here you can see the alternative cut line I'm focusing more on having like a 45 degree angle from the top of the nail and I will say when we first started trimming as you can see some of these other nails we've done trims on before and you can also see the alternative cut line there so all I want you guys to see is the angles are not quite what you're used to so if you can come take a look at this other nail here - you see how I'd have taken off some of the bottom just because it was so long so we've slowly worked on having the bottom part come up as well but we're making sure that when we get on the bottom we don't really want to expose the jellybean layer or that soft part where your nail can go into on the bottom because that can actually cause soreness that's where most of the nerves are located so you're trying to get to the jellybean layer from the alternative cut line you can see that we weren't able to get much off of the sides here so that would be the next step and again you know Zuko is not done with his training so we don't get to just trim all the nails exactly as far as we want all the time you can see here on this one I started to try to get the sides a little bit more this time but I didn't get quite as much as I wanted to so anyways that is what the alternative cut line looks like and that is how you actually get the dogs clicks to recede and again your goal is that you don't hear ticking when they walk inside not talking about trotting or running because that has a different eight but when they're walking you shouldn't hear any ticking on the ground all right see you guys next time", "RV7tEqqShPI": "yes i live in your house rent free but i should be paid a therapist [Music] salary", "2jVsZb_nXRw": "[Music] we have a lot of regulars like I basically know who's coming in and I'm almost at what time but yeah we got we have tons of regulars which is it's nice it's nice relationship to build up around over the years that's probably a ver apart actually is just meeting all these you know interesting people and seeing like kids like moving here for 23 years so I've seen like babies that are you know like they're living on their own now and they have like starting families of their own it's it's weird and cool yeah so it's probably one of the best parts of this job for sure all right these are all good for a week so next Friday by 6:00 please enjoy when I mentioned we had the fire years ago the courser store down the street choices through a fundraiser for our employees Jessica they had a barbecue and raffles and stuff and it was pouring rain and hundreds of people came out they donated movie and movies to do it money and it was so help the employees out and to me that just said that you know how much we're appreciated here and it was pretty pretty awesome you also have some late charges my friend yes we're one of the longest-running businesses on this strip here people that still live here in the neighborhood when we opened that are still here I think we still really appreciate us and the new people that come to you we also have people that come all from all over town to you know get everybody's and stuff but for the people here I actually have one customer come in and say we're one of the reasons why they don't move which is pretty sweet all right well I cut you're late for you from 12 to 6 dollars no problem", "hnfs7TLHzj4": "[Music] what's driving us with a black dog it's myself my wife Kirsty our kids and Luna driving in Australia raising awareness about suicide prevention and mental health assistance dogs why are we doing this I've got 27 years within the mission services includes SES fire service and also ambulance unfortunately in that time I've seen all our horrendous incidents in July last year I had a major mental health event which is resulted in me not being able to work as part of that we decided we need to do something we need to change something so we drive around the country we're raising money for two organisations the first one is lifeline Australia which provides 24/7 crisis supports they receive a new call every 32 seconds and answer about 2,200 calls per day more than 40% of their online crisis chat comes from rural and remote locations which is why we're really focusing on those areas throughout over 80% of their funding comes from the retail stores book sales and also for fundraising activities like our own in Australia there's approximately 65,000 300 suicide attempt every year the other organization we're raising money for is mind dogs Australia not 1 dogs Australia are not for profit organization they're helping people train and accredit psychiatric assistance dogs quite often their own dogs if they meet the right standards so a mind doctor being any shape or size currently they have 608 dogs and handlers but they only have 12 volunteers as a result of that the being flooded with applications and had to close their books until September 2017 our goal is to be able to give them some more funding so they can get more people on board to help increase the numbers of thoughts is that helping people like myself what's the winners role well she saved my life she keeps an eye on me day and night if I'm having a nightmare or night terror she'll wake me from it if I'm in a situation where my anxiety is getting quite high or stress levels she understands something's going on I don't even have to give her a cue and she'll actually do what she can to take me out of that situation whether it's physically taking me out or walking me out or distracting me she allows me to try and live as much of a normal life as possible of course we can't go without thanking our awesome sponsors and if there's any more out there that are considering

link you can also find us on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram so follow us please please support where you can and if you see us in your town come and say hi thank you welcome to simply 2017 in our broadcast brain studio today a bit of a change we're not really running on the world of broadcast television for a little while we're talking about something probably a little bit more important than cameras and video recorders today what we'd like to do is introduce Paul and Kirsty neroli from driving the black dog thanks so much for coming on today guys what you're trying to do here is really bring across a hugely important message that thinking day to day life just gets forgotten as the awareness of mental health and the road to recovery is something that is I suppose almost swept under the carpet has been for so many years so it's really exciting to see I think it's really strong from you guys especially here to try and do something to make a difference so Paul tell us a little bit more about driving Black Dog and the inspiration behind it there no my backgrounds 27 years in the emergency services so fine' rescue ambulance and SES so over those years I got to see a lot of really traumatic situations in July last year it you know accommodated in me having a poor mental breakdown where I was suicidal and you know really dark and bad time and through my discussions with the psychiatrist they suggested well you know you need to go go for a holiday you know get away from it all and because I couldn't work you know I'd be driving to work and I'd feel like I was literally gonna be sick I was just really getting stressed out with it all so Christine went to work one day and I saw sitting at home and I thought you know what he said let's go for a holiday so let's talk properly at least drive around the country and I thought we're gonna do it we might as well try and help others so driving odds with the black dog was born I'm certain it's they fantastic but you've been able to suppose turn a bad time into a positive and certainly kirstine for you must have been a tough time as well to see when you love go through so much pain as opposed to it was utterly terrifying it still is the most stressful time I've ever been through watching your husband is so much pain and not being able to make it better yeah so when he sort of spoke about a road trip I was 100% behind him absolutely and what better do a road trip around Australia I suppose and go along bring the family along and exactly do your best to help others yeah and now we I think it's also really important to introduce Luna here so Luna be your your friend through this whole process and that's a bit more about Luna and I'm also the training and what's going through the whole process to bring her up to being able to help in the way she does well learners what we call a mental health assistance dog so as assistance dog service dogs she has exactly the same access rights as a dog for someone who is blind for example so there's several different obstacles you didn't your pets you've got your therapy dogs you've got your companion dogs and then there's the service dogs so lunar actually fits in the category of psychiatric service dog so part of the program that we went through was with mine dogs Australia and what they do is they'll actually evaluate your dog and see if there's a potential for that dog to become a service dog we've had learned this issue was eight weeks of age she was the family pet and through the program she showed some really good you know signs and potential so the training is quite rigorous it takes a lot of time you train the dog yourself they train you and you train the dog and then at the end you do what's called a public-access test so the public access test is basically doing a whole heap of things in the public trains buses you know seeing how she goes with them elevators lifts escalators in shopping centers how does she go if I drop the lead how does she go with that how should we kids yeah Pepa she with other dogs and food for her test they took the nice fresh piece of sliced ham on the ground and she wasn't allowed a snippet or do anything with her and she she did Gracie actually passed their test two weeks before we started the trip so but what she does is she monitors my stress my anxiety my push medic stress disorder and when things are starting get a bit much she'll actually trigger and I'm sitting down like this she'll let you come up put a head on my name I ignore that she'll actually end up sticking in a nails in and stands up so she's actually in my face and basically it's not just yeah okay you have to have to give it quite a bit of attention and at nighttime with my PTSD I have horrendous nightmares or night terrors she actually notices and sure she'd come up on the bed and wake me up initial lay beside me until I've calmed down again so and she does all that without being huge and I don't have to tell her anything we had a situation at a tent at a restaurant one day and the guy was the owner was getting very aggressive very much in my face and she actually came around and late between him and me to keep that distance yeah that's one of the things she's been trying for so if she's a super smart dog that's amazing and I know in my family I'd say that my sister right now would be looking at lunar very lovingly because she's a German Shepherd lover a lovely lovely dog so I think it's it's really fantastic that you can go and help I suppose give back to the people that have gonna be so much here with Luna so tell us a bit more about the trip you've were going all around Australia in your fantastic nursing Patrol yes yes and we're going through a range of remote communities tell us what the the idea behind that is yeah yeah we know with the big cities there's quite a lot of help from people for mental health weaning into the remote or the regional communities that's not the case either because they run the philosophy of you know don't say anything you know you've got to man up toughen up just deal with it unfortunately mental health and in particular suicide rates in remote communities and regional community these three to four times higher than what they are in them in the big city so as part of our trip it's about close to 80,000 kilometers that will do on the trip we've done about 20 so far so we still got a long way to go we started in West Australia Perth early April we came across to Victoria and we've done a fair bit of work in Victoria so from here you know we start heading around the rest and we're not just doing the lap of the map as people call it yes the single main roads we're doing a lot of small communities we've got some indigenous communities that want to catch up with us when we're going through particularly Northern Territory and northern Queensland so we're really looking forward to that we've met yeah what if you indigenous people and one of the elders gave us a whole heap of context and say hey you know go talk to these people they really need it you know there's one family and they've had three people commit suicide three males within that one family you know it's just horrendous it really is but certainly amazing to think that so many of these tragedies could be prevented by as awareness for potentially the services it could be available and I think it's fantastic that going out there and trying to help people to see that there are ways to be able to move forward and it's across all the industry even this industry you know it's a very high pressure it's you know I've got to happen now sort of thing there's a lot of stress so people in this industry have you know quite a high rate of mental health issues as well so we're not just focusing on emergency services you know yep here main video craft obviously very concerned about the industry and the mental health and well-being of them it's certainly in the film and TV industry it is very stressful you're working under extremely tight deadlines a lot of people that go and have a look and say oh we have to be on air now it's got to happen this got to do that me know in the real world when we all go and step back and say well you know the sun's gonna rise tomorrow you get so caught up in a moment that it just seems to be the be-all and end-all and I'm sure that even from the trip that you're doing here must be pretty nice to wake up in the morning knowing that you don't have to be on the 7:15 to go and get to the office by 8:30 or whatever yeah so is that helping you as well with the with the holiday with the kids and yeah I mean there's still stressful time yeah you know we've been doing a lot of work trying to organize media yep particularly television print media being really good you know we've had quite a lot of interviews the kids are you know well and truly aware of what to do when there's a reporter around now and especially getting photos and that done so you know it has been good you know there's been some great times where we've had some must times John camped on the side of the Murray been fishing you know doing some nice relaxing stuff but there's other times where you've just got to you just gonna move on you got to get going because you've got to be at a certain place well you got a certain function or whatever you know we've been schools that you know talk to even kids that have been involved in the juvenile justice system yep you know so it's been a huge range and then it's just the average person we talk to I mean we've had a lot of conversations at service stations yep you know people are they're fueling up they see all the stickers on the vehicle and yeah so what's this you know what are you doing other people recognize the reference to the Black Dog and they come over and say I know exactly what that's all about and then they just share their story so if it's not if it's not lunar that's the icebreaker it's the vehicle yeah you know and it's it's it's great you can go out and you can talk at people but it's so fantastic when they feel confident off to approach you I want to share what's a great conversation starter isn't it because you can't miss the Patrol yes and certainly lunar is just such a beautiful dog she's a very relaxed and yeah I can see how she helps moving forward there - no she's fantastic so um tell us a bit more about your website where people can donate because I think it's really important for people to get onboard certainly video craft have been really pleased and honored to be able to support driving the black dog and I know that everyone in the companies it's even internally it's raised awareness for the whole issue and I think that's benefit for all of us as well it's certainly it's probably only been more recent times that it's come out in the open and as you say the you know it's certainly a lot of maintenance well you know harden up and move on you know well have good times and bad times yeah so very important to be more aware of that so website address their website is wwe.com we have facebook Instagram and Twitter presences as well which is fun to try and manage and if people would like to donate online there's actually a link on our website takes them to a my cause page so all of the donations can be done online they get their tax receipt straight away and 100% of the donation goes to our beneficiaries so in a 50/50 split none of that money comes to us having said that we have had people actually come and give us cash donations and we're happy to take an email address and then we send in their tax receipt so it's quite flexible but yeah it can all be done online keep it simple okay and if there's anyone else that wants to sponsor us you know we're still looking for sponsors there's a proposal up online to help us help you know we've still got quite a few things that we're looking for which

to we prefer this to be lying sideways so that we can see what we're doing and we have his nail now he has black nails which a lot of people find very very difficult to trim this is our favorite type of trimmer because you can just shape the nail a little bit I'm just going to start I'm going to make tiny cuts I don't want to cut like this that's going to go ahead and make this nail bleed and the more upsetting we make this for him then every time he gets nervous so I'm going to just shave a tiny bit off of his nail at a time it takes a little longer but if it's a good experience for them it's easier in the long run now that I have this nail down so this part here and have that little black we call it a bull's-eye but it's really a black Center that's his quick that's the equivalent to the pink part in our nail so we know how badly lat first if our nail gets too short it's no different for your pet so we want to go ahead and just keep shaping like shaping that meal like that small amount at a time is key we see this black part then we stop if your pet has meals that are long the quick we'll go ahead and grow down our pink stop at the white part of our nail and it never gets any longer health care difference there quick will then continue to growth day it stops right here if I let his nails get really long all the time that quick is going to continue to grow farther down to the base of the nail so it's going to take you time and effort to get it shorter so what you would recommend if that's the scenario is shaping them like this every two weeks not waiting any longer than that so then you can get that quick to recede this one I could probably see the tiny bit more off but I'm happy with that length there see great doesn't really like his nail trim time getting much better and you can just have some time in a quiet tones they pay your fine if we use a parade like a handful confess going to make him really strung out you can Hunter why he needs to be no anxious so we dis a sneer find good boy and he does very well that way make sure we got the new cause with your dog has to pause because don't don't get worn down like the other Tommy on cue they're the Masters shortest I want to go on there so that's how we turn nails on your pet just take your time make it a good experience for them if you have a helper they can give a little tummy rub things like that and the more you show them it's going to be a good experience and you look for that little black spot the easier it's going to be every time", "FxneADjX4WI": "[Music] do [Music] do [Music]

hello and welcome to the spooky isles my name's david Saunderson and as always i'm joined by my co-host the writer our coldest and expert on everything spooky john Conoco James good evening John how are you tonight I'm very good how are you David well I'm not feeling all that well this evening you know a little bit inside but it's actually great that we've got a great rack on tour here with us this evening who could do all the talking for me Anthony Mr Lewis is a good friend of ours he's a tour guide amateur historian and what would say urban adventurous here in London he's the mad mind behind the amazing Lost Valley of London which he'll tell us about later and interesting enough he's a former tour guide partner of yours John Conoco James you both started the famous ghost tour company boo tours here in London so what we've got here is almost a spooky lennon-mccartney kind of reunion without all the animosity anyway thanks for joining us tonight Anthony oh absolutely my pleasure now tonight we've asked you to come in to talk about your favorite spooky subject black shuck and other black dogs oh yes my favorite ghost well can you actually tell us our spooky listeners those who don't know what is a black dog well a black dog is a particularly British phenomenon although although records of hellhounds seem to exist all over the world ancient Egypt around Scandinavia around Wales and Scotland but the black dogs of England are the ones that really freaked the living daylights out of me and for centuries they've been an omen of omen of death terror and destruction they roam the countryside usually lonely country roads and if you see one even for just a glimpse in the distance it's considered an omen of death and you will die within the year although recently they've become of a force of protection for many travelers as well so their legend continues to evolve so what are they are they ghosts oh they're demons what are they though technically I guess would be cryptids I always hear them mentioned and research them in books of of ghosts but they seem to be very physical hands on creatures particularly with the the most famous example black shock so they're probably categorize them as demons or revenants revenant is a good one the thing is I mean we have this very sort of mr.james very post Victorian view of what a ghost is a ghost is a non-physical creature it can it can drive us mad it can trick us into jumping off something and dying it can't kill us physically but the black dogs have much more medieval roots and so they go back to the English revenant like you find in the Bible and manuscript again weirdly discovered by mr james but they're very physical that that's their medieval roots showing that they are entirely physical a medieval revenant can look like an animal it can tear your head off and still be a spirit of a dead person they've got very Scandinavian roots in that way that's one of the reasons black Shack is so disturbing to me in a way the idea of a frightened so much is as John was saying a ghost isn't supposed to actually get in there with its teeth and claws and and you know start slaying people actively and I think that's one of the things that makes the legends so so terrifying and creepy can you actually maybe tell us about black shock because black shock is actually a character or it's not just a specific type of dog it's actually a specific individual individual monster type of thing tell us about black shark well black shock is particularly famous as the black dog which holds East Anglia particularly and Norfolk and Suffolk often seen on the coast of of Norfolk dashing between a chroma and Great Yarmouth and it's a particularly famous black Shack for an incident in [Music] 1577 were broken to a pair of churches and created absolute havoc and probably the most famous of the black dogs and stands as one of the most feared entities and British phobia they tell us a bit about that the church yeah yeah that's definitely the most famous of black shacks hauntings it was the 4th of August 1577 it was late afternoon about 2 or 3 o'clock and in the village of Bungay in Suffolk it was an almighty storm came out of nowhere the sky turned on this pitch-black hail absolutely pelted down thunder and lightning was directly over the town and the Lightning was hitting the ground and the congregation in Bunge were terrified they were huddled in the church there and the priest was was preaching Hellfire and brimstone and it was said Mary's Church Bunge and all of a sudden while the rector decided that everything was going to flood because the rainwater was filling up all the guttering so decided I don't know why I made this decision but in the middle of the storm to head out and to check all the guttering and clear everything out something there was an almighty flash of lightning huge thunderclap and there was a sickening thud and a squelch as the bell that was tolling there were two bell ringers up in the belfry suddenly stopped dead the rector skidded off the roof and landed outside with a squelch and then now the great Dorset Mary's flew open and standing there was a huge black hound black Jacques the size of a pony pretty much seven feet tall at the shoulder and raced down the aisle and began killing the parishioners and there was a the famous rhyme immortalizes it was all down the church and the midst of fire the hellish monster flew and passing onward to the choir he many people slew there were two parishioners knelt in prayer and famously when black Shack pelted down the aisle between them it with a flick of his jaws running both their necks in one instant and another parishioner was kneeling in prayer apparently got such a gripe on the back that he was shriveled like a drawn purse although he survived afterwards but by all accounts was a babbling idiot for the rest of his days the old deal just drove him mad and things didn't stop there directly after the attack on some Mary's Bunge he pelted 12 miles away to Blythe bruh with the Church of the Holy Trinity the Church of the marshes on a patch of high ground overlooking the fins and this time lipped to the roof smashed into the the west tower not the steeple clean off which crashed the roof of the church damaging the sculpted angels and the font and ran along the beam of the of the church roof terrifying the parishioners there killed more people at least two people a man and a lead and then exited by crashing out the north door into them into the swamp north of the church and when that door eventually was cleaned there was quite obviously seen three claw marks they call the The Devil's fingerprints and I've been to the Holy Trinity Church and I've seen them they're etched into the church door to this day what do they look like they're very there's three of them very thick and black itched into the into the church door so three black scorch marks in the church door and where is this again remind people where this is a life bruh lino and Suffolk East Anglia okay so that's the thins very low ground lots of marshes and bogs and mist rolls in which is well kind of what gives that area is such a spooky atmosphere and we went there specifically to see these marks well yes and to hunt down black shuck to me the story with him began would be as as many things do in my life with the US a spawn world of the unknown as a series of books by a spawn publishing it was in the libraries when I was growing up them in primary school very sought after by all the kids at school there were three of them us porn book of UFOs book of monsters and book of ghosts I can recall them yes yeah there was essential reading for every every child and that order there was sought after there were many copies of the UFO book but kids are always vying to get the book of monsters and ghosts was the Holy Grail and finally the school bought a copy and all the kids were fighting over themselves to get hold of it to take it out of the library and read it and I remember leafing through it it was all very scary I was very easily spooked as a child and the center two pages was this horrendous horrific full two-page painting of black shock literally leaping out of the two-dimensional restrictions of the book leaping out of the viewer absolutely terrifying I've got a digital copy of it I'm gonna give it to you to add to the show notes on their spooky owls will page that will accompany the the podcast so you can see it's very educational now isn't it that podcast yeah daddy notes any notes I've got some photos from a from a from a Bundy and blood for troopers or lol those so you can add them to the web page but this painting scared the bejesus out of me because leaping out of the book at you frothing at the jaws like many depictions of blackjack it had a single cyclopean I like a cyclops smack bang in the middle of its forehead many many depictions of blackjack ever have only a single eye and what made it worse was the very matter-of-fact text one of the ghosty dogs pictured here is known as black shock ruins East Anglia and as a kid you're hoping for reassurance that this kind of thing isn't real so almost being like a text book is just like saying if you go to East Anglia you'll run into this thing and for me that became the symbol of all childhood fear gave me the fear of the DAK what sparked my lifelong interest in ghosts and the supernatural you're fascinated by what you're scared by you want to kind of gain control of it and I thought you know when I finally came to England at the great and reached the grand old age of of not thirty I decided it was high time I went that the route of my childhood fear and what I think is spooky and go to the huntin grounds the black chapter to Bunge in life by the most celebrated locations where he made his attacks and learn more about it and to discover these places to myself and I discovered lots of wonderful architecture at the same time beautiful scenery and this fascinating folklore because the great thing about black shack the legend encompasses so many amazing things in English history 1066 the Battle of Hastings thomas a becket the sinking of the white ship on the coast of Normandy you can make an epic action film about this character because he encapsulates so many amazing things so from this spooky thing that captured my imagination as a kid and there's kids love frightening things it's an it piqued my interest in all things historical legend folklore all the things that make spooky Isles spooky England so fascinating for us also it's been a real fantastic trip really has been but it's just one thing I thought there if people are recognizing Anthony's voice he's actually the introduction to the spooky ours at the start at the end of these podcasts I should have said that earlier but it was just then when he said the word spooky arse I thought VI I remember that voice that's the bloke who does Ella intro and he does it very spookily as well also a professional voice-over artist so you might also put him in amperes and that sort of thing as well yes so John yeah you wrote an article for spooky Oz I think last year or the year before about yes hounds ah yeah are they the same thing as black shuck now arguably Bela they are from different areas black shuck is very much the southeast yet homes are west country and Lancashire up north and they're very slightly different in some versions of the myth will get homes they hunt the spirits of unbaptized babies over the Moors in other versions of the stories they are the ghosts of unbaptized babies who somehow metamorphose into the adherents and it's part of the big fear that medieval folk had are dying incorrectly the good with a very big deal in the medieval period dying properly shriven dying with all your affairs in order and a lot of the men here ago stories like in the violins manuscript a lot of them came down to somebody who died improperly and that alone is a reason why somebody can end up as a ghost I just want to savor the way one of the other reasons I love black shuck and a lot of other English revenants is the bizarreness factor because black shuck is a big cyclopean black hand is that we advise yes absolutely and the thing the reason I love hit because that is the tip of the weird iceberg for English girls stories in the balance money trip you have a ghost that appears as a whirlwind of straw with a glowing light in the middle and then becomes I think a two-headed Raven and then becomes a rolling bale of hay you have another type of spirit that it can appear as four men holding a sack another spirit from Yorkshire that's associated with the pylons manuscript appears as a bull but its head is just a featureless sort of Blackford lump with no external orifices and there's another ghost which is really strange because because it is the ghost to be healed that looks like a human but it's actually a different human and it's like oh yes the Bishop of so-and-so who now appears as a hunt of the hall and doesn't look anything like himself so that's one of the reasons I love the bizarreness factor of English ghosts one other thing I'd like to say about the story of Bungay and live borough is that I do a lot of research into witchcraft and writing a book about witchcraft at the moment and it is the only example of one particular facet of witchcraft that you see on the continent that you don't get here and the black ship story is this one tiny echo of that continental tradition because you have all the people crowding into the church during a storm during the day to get away from a storm and they are ringing the bells of the church and that is something you get in Germany especially and also in France and that is way church bell and we know they did in Princes remarked upon in diary accounts and chronicles they did it to drive away evil spirits and they did it sort of drive away black magic there was attacking the community and so the idea that they were all ran into the church to have the bells rung when the storm came over they already thought they were going to see a dark spirit they already believed they were under attack and I might be wrong but that's the only place I've seen any echo of that continent or tradition in Britain is with that example of them running into the church it was done during Halloween as well do you think there's a Saxon thing maybe or it may well be it may well be and they're very near the coast as possible there's a bit of continent it's what what is going what does blood shock actually mean a naive Tommy in the past Oh shucks mean it could be two things and it could be the anglo-saxon word the old English word spooker which means demon who devil or it could come from the local east anglia Palance the local dialect shucky which means shaggy or harry he goes by many other names too sometimes stryker barghest the Shug monkey body do the monkey name and start calling me shut monkey yeah part of the England he comes from but the black Shack is the East Anglia named for him either coming from scooter or shaggy or the two could become imaged over the over the centuries Oh crumbs yeah homes there they have many many different names including yellow hounds Gabriel hounds the Gabriel's they have a lot of different names in their areas as well but that's how things develop there's no one central office of folklore that sort of issues a name to each creature this this creature sounds very familiar with a with a character in in fiction that we all know yes tell us about that one the grim Sirius Black that's a wonderful piece of semiotic thickness by JK Rowling she's taken many many interpretations of the black Shack legend part of the role of the black hounds all over the world the hounds of hell is they guard the underworld you know you've got Cerberus you've got the Egyptian hellhounds that guard the Pharaohs and some people think that black truck may be at the sonification of the dog star Sirius which traditionally guarded the the tombs of pagan kings so you got serious Animas Grim's which are various revenants sometimes humans sometimes skull-faced phantoms sometimes animals that guard [ __ ] Jets and can be seen looking out of you know church towers sweeping with their eyes across the the graveyard to keep an eye on and protect all the souls there so she's taken the Black Dog legends all over the UK and she sort of synthesized them to create the character Sirius Black even down to the fact that he's not actually a harmful figure at all but a protect him and of course many modern interpretations of Black Rock and many modern instances where people have reported to see him he's taken on a more protective role heading alongside people as they traverse lonely country roads especially women and people who may be considered to be vulnerable travelers to protect them and take on a role of Guardian and can I say that is actually a great full circle movement for the myth because if you go into pre-christian North European sagas you very often have a man or woman who has the power to project themselves as this animal creature Beauty Wolves back dogs Ravens I think I mentioned this a little bit in the last podcast actually and they are a kind of shamanistic protector and so it's a lovely full circle movement of course they got demonized and turned into things like werewolves during the sort of rewriting and things in the Christian era I know it's coming all the way back around and they get to be the good guys again so I just saw it funny because I actually wasn't talking about Harry Harry Potter I was talking about a much more famous in my mind yeah the more the neverending story no we're not talking about that we're going even more famous than that we're talking Arthur Conan Doyle the hand of the Baskervilles ah yes memory yes yes you have I think so we go through all these other things and I think there's a much more famous black dog that's you know I mean and that's it's but it's all through English history that was yes differently Arthur Conan Doyle he returned from Africa in 1901 and he was suffering from enteric fever and so he was staying in Norfolk in chroma Hall and that's where he first heard the legends the local did and you went down is that the place you were down is that with the Cross or something that's chroma hollows that someone have you been there I haven't been to chrome' a whole yeah that's that's next on my black checklist no my eye I went to Bunge and Blythe Brogdon the Suffolk version of the legends that while he was at chroma Hall he was fascinated by the local folklore so he he took a lot of that inspiration to create the black shack legend because he said it to Dartmoor which was also got Minnie Minnie yeah yeah yeah very much yet pounds and so but that's the thing about particularly England um I don't know so much about them in Wales but I don't know as much about Welsh folklore as I should my studies have always been Maryville England but almost anywhere in Britain you will find black dogs somewhere they are for some reason a really intrinsic part of our psyche well they were actually here in London our babies I mean you've told my stories in the past of some Australian hub thing hmm tell us tell us about that Anthony that was an almost identical occurrence to what happened in in East Anglia and in 1577 it was a sin Peters Cornhill and again during a violent thunderstorm there was a huge crackle of a huge cracking thunder and lightning struck the steeple and materializing inside the church was a fantastically huge black hound in that case all the parishioners bolted for the door and got out because unlike many other accounts it actually materialized straight inside rather than burst through the door and they say there are four max were left inside the church almost an inch deep so you got the city very similar stories as John said they go sort of all the way in Germany all the way through here so a curious way of appearing oh yes consistent what do you think they are like having all said this believing they are you know basis of hell what do we actually think they are interestingly John Stowe mentions the two incidents in one breath in his contribution to Hollenshead Chronicle and he has this entry where he describes the Bungay employed by one and he doesn't go into the supernatural element what he says is lightning struck a church in Bungay and blight borough and he lists the damage and he lists the injuries and then he says and ten years ago my father reports that on Cornhill lightning struck a church and did something similar I think that I mean that's pretty much nailed it I mean obviously it must be lightning strikes I mean even some of the injuries that were reported to happen seem to be electrocution or burns I mean the gentleman he got shriveled up like a drawn purse has obviously been electrocuted by something both men's necks were running in an instant it describes the behavior of two people being hit by a lightning strike and jerking backwards they think it might even be bull lightning because of course some people say something you know and explain that they're gonna terrify people materializing inside a church could be the the phenomena of ball lightning which is almost like a fireball rolling down the aisle could be a consistent with the legends curiously thing that supports this theory is in the church records the parish records of the events that happened at Blythe brand Bunge don't actually mention the black dog at all they call it the hateful thing and the the black shack legend only got folded into it later that year when Reverend Abraham Fleming who's living in London at the time published a pamphlet all about it called a strange and terrible wonder he decided to use it as a warning for people he was saying it was basically an alarm bell run by the Lord in basically with audience Israeli moralistic isn't it we both separately seen the British library's copy from the time the pamphlet it's a little up Taylor it's it's very it's a dinky little thing and we both researchers of the British Library and yeah he basically comes out and the first in the preface basically saying among men it has grown and customed to have four warnings of after collapses people's built upon hills which are then set on fire when dangerous imminent and at hand alarm bells serving to the same purpose and other inventions of men preceding and provided of policy to prevent or else to prepare so basically it's basically was saying the devil on the Lord had basically conceived of this as warnings to mortal folk and so II thought that was an excellent way to keep people on their toes to make sure they they keep a moral life or otherwise things like this may happen and decided to fold in the local folklore of the black dogs all around East Anglia which were already in place by that point into those events that happened so he basically added black shack to the mix to make that story extra potent so really they also almost booked him into scared grownups as opposed to Kitty's very very much so whether we increasingly and and I both have slightly different ending of black shock related stories because you were telling me about something that was found from 1577 with you oh yes yes they basically on the 14th of May this year 2014 there were the dig ventures archaeology team they were in Suffolk and they were in the least an abbey there's a about a few miles from Bunge and they were doing work excavating the abbey and 20 inches under the ground very shallow grave they found the skeleton of a seven foot long Hound again I'll give you a seven foot long 750 s daddy that's a big dog that's a bag that's bigger than the line there's like a man yeah pretty damn big Brennan yeah definitely bred for this is the real thing this is something yeah this is not from an old book that says we found this is right there this year and get this this is the scary thing they found fragments pottery on the same layer as the bones so dating from the same time so in the dinosaur they've dated the pottery to approximately 15 and 77 so this could be the skeleton of the actual dog which which terrorize those churches would be awesome that'd be amazing however I found a few months ago another black shuck ending story I found it in a collection of Cambridgeshire folklore that was in the magazine folklore and it's the story from about 1921 I seem to remember of a landowner who owned a stretch of road that was said to be haunted by black shuck and he took over the land and he was trying to arrange for his men to go down and do a bit of marsh drainage in Cambridgeshire was a very hot topic for a long time and they were like oh no we can't do that and he was like well why and said oh well that's haunted by the shocker the black took the dog and so he heard really what does this dog looked like and they're like oh it's a big black dog missus I mean he says oh so it's a big black dog yes it's got one big red eye yes yes and it's got lightning crackling around it yes yes yes oh oh god I was wondering what that was and they're like what do you mean oh well I hit it with my car and to which they were like what oh yeah look I'm really sorry I just came out of nowhere appeared in the middle of the road I hit it full speed in my motorcar I'm afraid the poor thing didn't stand a chance and so that is his story of the death of black Chuck I never since that story has the the row of what he said well you resistant in 1921 it's been quite depressing really we've started off with this fearsome thing that was scaring little Anthony at school with his husband book so now we've basically killed them off and we've got cemetery stuff that's what you know Anthony give us a give us a black black shuck story to finish it off you must have something well well I'll give you the BB the unofficial legend but when I find most irresistible which basically rolls a lot of English folklore and myth into one irresistible package for me which is all beginning with as many things are 1066 and all that the Battle of Hastings and the establishment of William the Conqueror after he was victorious in battle he split England up amongst his left tenants and the wealthy lands of East Anglia went to one of the greatest heroes of his side which was Roger by God who started very poor in life but has now risen to some acclaim he got Norfolk and Suffolk and he was going to leave it to his good son William by God unfortunately William by God died when the white ship sank in 1120 and everything went to the other son the good-for-nothing son Hugh by God the Restless now whether Roger by God was a very good Lord of East Anglia ruling by example very fair and just amongst the anglo-saxon serfs who by God went the other way terrorizing the local population in basically ruling with an iron fist kidnapping imprisoning and slaying the elders of villages that didn't owe the line and in some cases burning villages to the ground entirely all the Anglo Saxon serfs began calling him old skuki the demon eventually he got so big for his boots he was joining every rebellion that was going he joined forces with the Crown Prince Henry Henry the young king against the actual king his father King Henry the second and King here in the second raised a vast superior force and basically defeated Hugh by God's forces at Framlingham Castle in Suffolk which was the the family seat of power in fact Hugh by God was to lament he wasn't at Bunge where his bangy castle walls are much more utilitarian fortress which that would have resisted attack far more easily but he had lost he avoided being executed for treason by agreeing to become a knight-errant and attempting a a holy pilgrimage to the Middle East and that his last we ever heard of you by God on this physical plane he they lost contact with him in Palestine presumably according to legend riddled with arrows and unfortunately he was not to ascend to heaven because our old friend thomas a becket had had him excommunicated while he was away absolutely fed up with his antics dying improperly classical English revenant there we go and ever since then at Bunge castle the young serving boy was cleaning up and shortly after the death of Hugh by God was suddenly came face to face with such a Hound of Hell as God forbid should ever be on his heels and from that moment onwards the strange demon the shock dog was seen all over Suffolk Norfolk still performing the same bloody deeds he did in life still spreading terror and distress to all that encounter it and that's where we get the the the famous myth that if you back even to clap eyes on black shock within a year you'd be dead and the implication there is the reason you'd be dead is cuz he's gonna come and get you yeah yeah very hands on and so yes that is the that is the ghost of Hugh by God apparently a revenant would you say he's the original black truck I think with a legend like that yes I'd very much like to think that is the source of religion because I think so many historic characters so many amazing amazing cinematic incidents that happen throughout history all collapse into one mythology makes it a resistible to me so yes I say that is black we're running out of time but I know John you better give me some one last thing that yes last bit of hope yes indeed story yes what is it yes black chick is out there because as recently as 1975 he was seen by an array of our RAF officer Norfolk running on the beach at night and as we exit Anthony one question there is a village that black ship dropped into the sea with lightning isn't there do you know the name of it if you don't it's okay he doesn't know keep going it served that the story goes that somewhere to be obviously probably been said about five different villages somewhere on the southeast coast of England there is a village where half of it dropped into the sea after being struck by lightning and that is the doing of black shuck so there he is in 1975 oh no that wasn't oh he was seen on the beach by a man by RAF officer okay but there we go black shot kids he won't just kill you he'll kill your whole town good stuff all right anyway we wouldn't leave it there we're getting late for time yes I'd like to thank our guests here tonight at EMI Lewis he is the head or the face of Lost Valley in London give us the dub-dub-dub Lost Valley of London calm and I've lots of adventures I've made there where you can follow

but as sometimes also betrayed as great protectors here are some accounts from England where there seems have been a prevalence of these eerie ghosts early sightings in almost every county in England there are traditional belief in spectral dog beings the earliest accounts of black dog sign is in England have been traced back to 1127 the frightening creatures reported as taking different forms but had some common characteristics they were always massive creature with shaggy coats long ears and tails and large glowing red eyes some details varied to make each dog unique such as wearing a chain around its neck being headless having a fiendish grin or even a human face in some cases the ghost dogs was large as a house what other legend described them as walking on their hind legs the dark beasts were infamous vanishing into a mist are living behind no trace of their strange visits in the various locations the black dogs bear different names but a common feature is their reputation as an evil spirit haunting spots where evil deeds have been committed or where some disaster can be expected one named British ghost dog legend describes a frightening event at the parish church in Suffolk in 1577 it began with a torrid storm erupting while parishioners attended a Sunday morning service illuminated by flashes of fire a black dog materialized in the church leaping around in craning panic in the congregation terrifying the phantom dog claimed the life of two men kneeling in prayer and lift severe burns on another man by contrast the early tale of a benevolent black dog was told by Jonny Greenwood from Swan Cliff the man reported being a cop in a bar mysterious black dog while trekking at night in the woods the oppression stayed by his side until emerged out from amongst the trees he is later two prisoners admitted that they planned to rob and dispatch Johnny that night during the journey through the woods but changed their minds after observing the presence of the last black dog following him another popular black dog story originated in Dartmoor where a notorious Squire called Cobell was known as a huntsman who had sold his soul to the devil when he passed in 1677 black hounds were said to her materialized around his burial chamber and his spirit was seeing hunting with black dogs the legend is said to have inspired Arthur Conan Doyle to write his famous tale the Hound of the Baskervilles some traditional narratives concerning black dogs were related by ethnographer Edwin Sidney Hartland in his 1890 publication of a British paranormal phenomena he states that on the Isle of Man the so called wolf dog was purported to horn peal castle where it inhabited every room but particularly the guard chamber here as soon as cans were lit it would light down in front of the fine if the soldiers who had become used to its presence aware of us malevolent nature the never interfere with it until the night one of the number who was drunk without a test if it were dog or devil his experiment rendered him instantly sober and speechless giving only another three days and expiring from a mysterious agonizing condition this story is backed up by multiple witnesses and the similar tale told of a farmer in a village near owls brain in Buckinghamshire the man had the routine of Garon every morning and night to milk his cows in a meadow which was a long walk from the village the short on his journey he often crossed the neighbors field and climbed through a gap in the hedge however one evening he found the gap blocked by it's black ferocious-looking Doug after closure and space on the dogs fiery eyes and feeling like appearance he decided to use a distant gate instead this necessary detour continued night after night at the same dog routinely occupied the gap in the hedge until one night when returning home with a friend he again found the dog there looking even bigger and fiercer than ever the unfortunate farmer tried to appear courageous to his companion removed the milk pails from a yoke around his shoulders and trembling all over shouted that the dog now you black fiend I'll try what you're made of he lifted the yoke with both hands and brought it down on the dog with all his strength the creature vanished and the man clapped senseless while surviving the incident he was said to have remained speechless and paralyzed to the end of his days ethel Rudkin ethel Rudkin is a little-known archeologist and folklore researcher who made a study of the black dog phenomena in a home country of Lincolnshire in England her interest in their spectral pooches arose from a personal experience she herself had witnessed a spectacle of a ghostly black dog in 1926 at the ruins of dunnage Abby a groundbreaking collection and investigation of black dog encountered testimonies was published in the journal folklore in 1938 Rudkin explained that her sources were always trustworthy people simply describing events they had experienced as truly taking place her comment was perhaps it is because I have seen the black dog and can therefore believe that the narrator has also seen them that I have been able to get such good firsthand stories the purpose of Rudkin study was to document the beliefs in a county regarding the phantom like black dogs while it could be argued that the witnesses brutkin indicates simply encountered an actual dog that was large in black the point of her research was that none of these people believed that to be so every single witness whose account she included in a collection was convinced the encounter the supernatural being known as a black dog regarding any doubt as that the intelligence or truthfulness of our informants rut compared criticism with this statement I would like to emphasize this point I have never yet had a black dog story from anyone who was weak either in body or mind black dog sightings have taken place across Europe including France Ireland Scotland and England as well as North America however here our summer rut gains historical accounts gleaned from a knight of Lincolnshire fish Pond Road in a small village of Welton there was a pond known as blubber fish pond and the road that passed by this pond was notorious have been haunted by a black dog sometime before 1938 when Ethel Rudkin published an account of a phenomena she was given information about certain sightings she identified perform it as simply mrs. G be the woman told her that in a younger days should meet a young man whom she later married where every evening that would stroll together by the pond and then return home in different directions mrs. G B would follow the road by Barbara fish pond to head for the village of granham on her own one night she suddenly became aware that a large black dog was trailing behind her finding his presence annoying the woman slowed down to allow the animal to catch up with her as he eerie creature came side to side with a walking woman she swiftly raised her umbrella and struck out at the black dog as hard as she could to a horror the blow passed clean through the body of the animal without ruffling her hair the black dog perseverant following the young woman walking beside her until they reached the ash tree at the end of chapels Lane here the Phantom canine vanished whether up the tree or into it she was unable to determine in 1934 an Irishman was laboring on farms during potato harvest also in the town Welton he later reported a Rudkin that he had been followed by an unnaturally large dog as he walked along the road to blight in fish pond he said that it found the experience terrifying as he had since the dog was not a natural animal it was only later that he found out that the area history been haunted by large black dog Bell whole farm around 1900 night there was a farm about a mile west of the town of Curtin in Lincolnshire called Bell hole one day month a nurse from town called mrs. s Moore would visit the family to assist with health matters on one of her visits the children of the house were chatting to her about the local black dog as it were being put to bed they asked the nurse if she was scared of meeting the creature on her way home in the dark on what she would do if she did to wish the nurse promptly responded I shall put him in the pocket she came to regret her words of bravado later once the children was settled and as she walked towards her home in curtain and she trudged along on the homeward path a bizarre occurrence unnerved her she led have reported there not only did the black dog appear but it ran circles around the terrified nurse taunting put me in your pocket put me in your pocket flying hounds in researching his compendium of the black dog phenomena Heartland had heard is our accounts are what he described as aerial hounds in secluded locations like Cornwall one tells of a Hersman who is walking home across the Moors of Cornwall one windy night when he heard the distant baying of dogs he quickly ascertained the sound as the sinister yelping of what were known locally as a devil's dandy dogs he was still three or four miles away from home and terrified man started running despite the treacherous ground young earthly howling of the hounds given by the hunters fiendish shout advanced closer so that soon that was so upon him that he could not resist turning his head to look at them the sight horrified him on the shadowy huntsman with large blazing eyes horns a tail and claws carrying a long hunting pole with a mass of dogs blacken the air for miles around him each one snorting fire and yelling with chilling savagery but now at a hide or shelter that beleaguered rustic resigned himself to suffering the full fury of these hellhounds suddenly a flash of memory gave him hope it once been told that no evil spirit which the end the power of prayer he quickly knelt and started uttering holy invocations which seemed to weaken the yelping of the hounds then distilled them the Huntsman shouted strange words which in the old language meant the boy praised and called off is there any dogs allowing the poor Hersman the hasten home as fast as his trembling body permitted [Music]"}
