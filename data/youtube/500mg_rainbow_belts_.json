{"QHxhZ1_U4ns": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show YouTube's preeminent marijuana edible review show I only say that because I think I'm the only marijuana edible review show I'm sure if there was another one it would be the preeminent one because it's hard to have a worse one but what are we talking about here today other than how bad we are we are talking about gummies that's why I've got my Nutella and spatula here so that's what this is for this is for fat this is for fat for the real review the infused creation sativa strawberry apple sour melts strawberry apple sour melts what a weird combination don't even understand what the Apple is supposed to be in that strawberry Apple sour belts 300 milligrams of THC this will very likely be my final review of infused creations they've all been bummers from the get-go and if this one isn't doesn't pick up or it doesn't change my opinion in any way that will probably be it for infused creations and we can go ahead and write them up so I've got my fat here just with the gummies I like to ensure that I eat them under optimal conditions so I take a little bit of fat beforehand and I like to do that in the form of Nutella because I'm a red-blooded human being and I like Nutella like everyone who should creamy chocolate hazelnut evening delicious now for something a lot less creamy Nutella II and delicious this all of infused creations gummies we've got a strong whiff of it just as soon as I open that package have that very recognizable gummy weed aftertaste that very bitter a very astringent yeah makes you want to rub your tongue on sandpaper type of taste and I can already smell it coming out of these so I'm not looking forward to it this is smell strong boy does it smell strong I do like sour bells traditionally but I'm pretty sure I'm not going to like these anyways let's go ahead and put it right down the hatch let's stop bitching and complaining and just go ahead and eat it well oh my god that is terrible that is so bad oh [ __ ] me oh there's no like sweetness right on the get-go it's ah it gets worse just that awful awful awful aftertaste oh [ __ ] this [ __ ] these things are terrible but I'll do it for you guys so I'm gonna finish these off and I will see you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part I don't we'll review actually in this case I'm pretty sure I haven't I'm gonna feel not high at all uh maybe the taste is the most important thing and the taste is [ __ ] sorry for such a bummer sorry to be sitting down and see you guys in two hours peace oh hi guys I'm back it has been two hours since I had the strawberry apple sour belts from infused creations and they are terrible boy are they terrible they taste terrible I'm not high at all totally stone-cold sober I feel like I wasted my money on these total total waste of money thankfully not does not cost a lot for the infused creations I believe these only cost me nine dollars which is really affordable for a 300 milligram edible the only problem is I don't think there are 300 milligrams of THC in there because I am NOT high at all not even as I said I yeah yeah nothing to say about it nothing nothing kind to say about it if you see it at a dispensary near you pass totally avoid it actually go and tell your bud tender they should not be stocking these because it's just an insult to their customers sorry to get so real with you guys and sorry to get so real with you infused creations I wish I liked your products more I just think that they are garbage thank you so much for watching weeds guys I'm sorry it's been a bummer over of you but hopefully next time we'll find something a little bit better thank you so much

yeah [Music] so you can't take the Congress here there is a distinct flavor of cannabis in that we are [Music] 400 milligrams there guys how much can you guys take to stick it in the comment how much it's going to take you guys to really feel their backs [Music] mm-hmm best for second as the 721 so they got a long a lot of date or love so much sugar in the morning man mmm-hmm I feel like feeling like I'm rushing off the sugar more than here people I'm getting a [ __ ] a bit of a sugar rush [ __ ] going on here my god the things I do to experiment knowing the things I do for this channel then you guys like that boy [Music] someone that guys when I meet my sweet hope you having a good day you been lucky enough to try any of this or anything like that stick in the comments again really into a interested to know what other people's experiences on with them - I mean I'm nailing with vegetables now obviously I do need a slightly higher dosage in mouth but I know also to take a little bit too much whew you can go the other way so you have got be careful [Music] sugaring the more advanced hearsay yeah too much so yeah to explain from last last night's live Bob snake we've got Lana here and we've got ninja here a little robbing in the room basically so my son's in Greece so just to move around a bit of a family night where a few drinks got on the live last night but that's why they're here in this review obviously off screen but yeah they're in the studio like they're in studio oh I mean I can't really normally eat that makes through that then one go but again it's an experiment do like sweets but I just have a couple normalling yeah and then I give it to the girls but not the sweets last one here oh if we should look at that one it's ridiculous to my sugar I need the pack we're gonna have to have as well what can I say guys Silurian sweets at bloody hour past 10:00 in the morning 114 [ __ ] years old but it's for a good cause Bottoms Up boy bottoms up let's see how interesting this get Sam lots of sugar and now secrets of use got every last bit [ __ ] right mmm well gotta say they went that pretty easy although I do feel like I'm having a real mud sugar rush right now won't run smoothly my sugar on them it seems to be more sugar on them but whether that's where the THC is whether it's infuse sugar or if you sweets I don't know I don't know how to make so some people will accuse the sweets as well as the sugar and some people would just put sugar on it so I don't know I don't know animate I will do once I come up on that because I do really really feel it then it's probably all the way through it I would say yeah as I say I need a dose I need a dose so you have four milligrams Bob's up got sugar all by my side by that guy's normal you see smoking videos to me but you've seen any in video me but I'll say it's a good good cause but suppose if you don't need a lot and you had a pack of those and they're like 50 milligrams a sweet you could probably carry them about stab a couple of sweets at a time and just sort of go along your day we as a nice do it mean put in a hundred milligrams into your body every couple of hours or something like that just gives you that little bit of pain relief and stuff like that I bet so good from that point of view that their portions you don't mean I like the fact they are portion in a way so you can do that I'm still I'm mad I just eat all of them all it won't go basically right long time guys so still on the black cheese but I'm still loving life guys 1190 so please join me peace wonder have a bomb and we'll all get along it's one of those I'll be back in roughly about an hour's time and I'll stick the camera on and I'll do another 10 15 minutes with a couple of thongs of snake oh my god I might not be able to smoke anything I don't really know that but we'll see from there yeah so cheers noise [Music] very tasty I did like them I do like Peter sweet son Peter sweets is the one that'll wake you up in the morning yes yes so guys mmm hope you have a good day today if you're watching this video and then you happen to watch the other one like that and yeah I just want

you really really soon peace would love guys see you in an hour whoop-whoop", "HdjIuomGkmk": "I already try to tell him that I'm sick I'm the pathogen my six teens leaving stiff like a mannequin hold me down in age town they say I'm throat like a javelin I've been smoking so much Billy that I'm feeling like Madison they like oh Mack man wait you've been that again I'm like time traveling and rapping and battle them roll the bun up at the bat again what up you guys welcome the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny man we're back for another stray interview today we are checking out something pretty special this is a strain that we've never had on the show before this is called rainbow belts this one is from archives TV yeah this right here guys this is a skittles cross oh it's the skittles clone crossed with the moonbow 75 and I got to say this is it definitely is a more creamy I would say how do you even explain this it definitely smells like skittles you have that intense fruitiness and skill a good skittles to me has always been like a it's hard to pinpoint exactly which fruit it would be but it's a very fruity tropical smell that's always very refreshing to me I'm definitely getting that with this one that it's one of the most I don't know another word to describe it other than refreshing one of the most refreshing terpene profiles out there as far as I'm concerned and this this one is no exception yeah definitely you know what the word is for it men dank this right here is dank you get a almost a totally different aroma when you crack the bud in half and you just get that fresh that fresh smell of it it's like it's got that skittles front end but the back end is like that just dink like skunk you know I'm saying which I feel like a lot of herb is almost missing these days it's kind of just bred for that fruitiness this has that dank trapped inside which I really like definitely pretty funky as far as like the brezin goes on it it's not the stickiest definitely getting more and more of a pungent smell as I kind of rip into this weed right here you already roll up the joint you broke that down I did and honestly by breaking it down I thought it had a decent stick factor I think it will pass the state test right here it's sticking to my finger so far it does fall off eventually so it could be a little stickier I do agree with you but it does have some stick to it yeah I don't even necessarily think that's a bad thing you know I'm saying I think this is what resonant dryly yes some some resin just naturally has a little bit more of a stick to it like mo but it's always gonna be in deke yeah as far as like more of a driver right yeah super dry you're not gonna find me in there is Chuck I've had sticky Bobo but it's just morbid it's not as sticky as a wet resident might be you know it's more dry there's multiple distinct different versions and you can tell by the nature of the resin rather you get it kind of where it lies were you smoking our drug Darrell I got this nice old school double double bug here nice heavy little piece this is like this was the ultimate piece to have from age like 15 to 20 to me yeah and dude that's Trivium that glass was all about like you got a great joke to it then high school was all about the choke just like you said and you know it was kind of about the heart work and then you know right about when I turned like 19 I'd say or so kind of around the same time we started this channel it just all of a sudden turned a scientific how many stack how high it's tags how many bubbles there are in the chamber and it's like I kind of like you know this this glass was almost bred for flavor where the other stuff is like just for diffusing tell you what this thing purrs man yeah you like it definitely like you're like you're saying there was a distinct switchover from the heady more artsy stuff more like the scientific an emphasis on the scientific and the function of the piece but more so than just the aesthetic of it oh this one actually kind of has the best of both worlds because it does have a nice hole over to it man I got to say get back to the weed guys this stuff has an amazing flavor I'm definitely getting that you know fruity skittles taste for sure I'm guessing that's why it's called rainbow belts hmm but there's also a creamy skunky back into it like I said in the smell is definitely delivering through in the flavor for me it's smooth its expansive you can feel it but it's still very smooth especially out of it you should try this one why don't we do the old switcheroo old switcheroo that thing is it's quite the ride oh you left me a little half green earth right now you tell me that etiquette remember that corner that [ __ ] you got a corner your bowls guy professional man it's got all of your joints because they never cease to surprise they're always shaped different that's pregnant this one's like you pregnant but kind of in the wrong spot it's like that low pregnant belly you know it's like the Phils gonna get chunky just right before his get skinny ass let me put it that way Wow this does a night choke to it man very expensive guys this stuff flavor comes through more on the joint oh yeah yeah this was a good a good rivet that tastes amazing so for some reason some strains you know they taste better depending on what you're smoking it through or it could just be the fact that I hit that joint first and then smoked you know a cornered bowl that could have something to do with it too regardless let's get into rating this stuff what do you say for me the smells the number one thing that stands out first and foremost I probably have to give that the highest rating this is this is a flavor this is a terpene profile that I really like in general right you know that I definitely like a lot more yeah you know fuelie gassy skunky funky strains but when I want something like a little bit sweeter a little bit fruity or a little bit more okay I keep going back to the word refreshing one thing this one is for me it's just very refreshing flavor correct that I enjoy any time of the day it's like yeah you just pop the top on the jar and it's just refreshing that's a very good way to put it it's hard to describe but it's very refreshing and like you said the smell to me is one of the most important things right and that's what's coming through the most in this string so that's definitely a positive I would have to give this smell yeah I'm gonna give it like a 9.5 on the smell just cuz I [ __ ] with this term and I think it's really when you crack it open it gives you a whole different profile so I like that yeah I would agree with that 9.5 seems pretty solid for me these particular buds right here a little bit on the smaller side this is the last of what there was of this yeah I normally I probably wouldn't even have reviewed something because I'm sure with the rest of this they were you know some bigger nuts are maybe a little bit more camera friendly as far as you know the entire crop of this goes but they're everyone's tomorrow there's something that just has everything else going for it yeah you know we have all this weed because we're not necessarily this is gonna be the best one but this is one jar open right away could smell it and I was like yeah we got to do this let's do this not try that just goes to show that looks is not everything with weed especially it's like you know it could you know not to say this this doesn't look bad you know I'm saying what's your right looks are not the much exactly buddies I guess maybe depending on your personal preference looking for something different as far as like what you weigh as the most important factors when it comes to the quality of your weed whether it's the buzz whether it's the flavour whether it's the cleanliness whatever it is like for me it's usually taste and flavor taste and flavor man yeah this stuff a few actual facts we have this stuff also does grow pretty good it's eight weeks you can push it to nine if you want a little bit chunkier but it can be finished at 8 it's kind of leafy and it's a medium yield but you know it's better than being you know they're these were popcorn buzz but like Shane said is that it was like the bottom of the badge so to speak so you know I'm guessing there was bigger knockers in their flavor on this one is really really nice though yeah it's got me a racy high for sure so I would say you know it's I don't know what the exact you know 60/40 70/30 is but it definitely seems a little silly to me seems like a nice balanced side of me yeah I can enjoy this one like I said any time of day that's the thing everything is a balance these days but there's no there's nothing that's like a 90% sativa or 90% indica these days it's all hyper dry enjoyed this one in the joint and the bubbler I really really like the way that hits I haven't hit yeah a really nice double bub like that it's just something that has kind of that old-school feel it has crazy weight to it you know I'm not used to a peace feeling that anything that's you know been made in the last 10 years it's just you don't see stuff that's that big it's got some weight for sure definitely cool piece I'm gonna take one more hit here what are we on I'm just gonna run through my rating right here yeah we got flavor and smell I'm given 9 across the board okay looks I'm gonna go 7 ok hi I'm gonna do another 9 so what probably a 8 8 point 7 5 something like that 8 point 7 5 that's a fair rating yeah I'm gonna go nine point five on the smell looks I'm gonna give like a 7 point 5 just due to you know the size of the buds and you know like I said looks aren't always everything but we have to we have to rate him and right so looks I'm given 7.5 the high definitely like a 9.5 I'm [ __ ] with the high it's definitely got me lit up so overall no I'm gonna give it you know 8.5 you ever notice there's like times where we're smoking something and then I'm like about to pass it to you during a video and then you get something else going so that I'm just hearing like well I'm gonna keep it Florina I fit the joint seven times you're not over here Bogart well I've got the ball I saw you packed a bowl you're gonna hit the five you know I'm perfectly happy sitting over here with this joint - that's just my ATD at work man this strain you know the high is a creeper I'm not gonna lie I mean I'm getting higher I think by the second hey what do you think when you get the Scooby Snack and it's good I like that yeah I like that movie snack smart great good all those screws nice yeah I'm lit up like a parking lot ladies and gentlemen and we hope you are to go down there in the comments but you guys are smoking on today we know this video is a train wreck we're rusty especially this guy over here Jesus hey guys this was the rainbow bells and as you can see it's got us lit up so I think we're gonna kind of just abruptly make our exit here on being later guys he's Shane let me back for another one of these real soon yeah pretty soon Oh keep watching whoa until next time you wear the CCC fine goodbye sayonara those kinda fresh man butterball and only sophomores dominating every column in the box score yeah I got a lot I'm I need a lot more trying to make it to the top like the sock drawer I'm getting stamped like I'm over at the notary and she get the ticket chick ain't never getting over me trappers deep", "bssGLDvoBT8": "[Music] in two weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary I've got my trusty spatula and my trusty thing in Nutella why do I have these you might be asking if you have not tuned into one of these before it means I am reviewing gummies and the reason I have this Nutella is so that I can have a little bit of fact before I eat these gummies I find that having a little bit of fat in your system before consuming gummies enhances the high of that gumming so let's just take a little lick of Nutella here the best part about any edible review because who doesn't love just some freaking Nutella all right that should be that should do it for my fats now what kind of gummy are we reviewing we are reviewing lol edibles candy I have actually had a couple people asked me to review this I reviewed one lol edible product in the past that I did not like very much the Elwha edibles flamin hot cheetos this here is a candy it is blueberries our belts Meghnath be gorilla glue glue hybrid so you can see on the back they've got a plea to add them on social media they've got a missing lot ID batch number and best before date not on there so we don't know if we're gonna be doing okay says do not mix with alcohol first time I've ever seen that I don't exactly know why you shouldn't mix the two other than you don't like getting crunked but uh who cares I am really hoping this lol edibles redeems not only lol edibles which he's a really dumb name I mean it's just a colossal II stupid name I'm hoping it not only redeems them but also gummies in general if you've never really seen weeks before I have never been a huge fan of gummies or candies I finally get you less high than the confectionery edibles but maybe this will be the one that turns it around we shall see alright so let's open this up here these blueberries sour ropes alright that is a strong weed odor very strong you will smell that from a distance away as I think so be careful opening this somewhere in a closed area where you don't want people smoking weed because that has a very strong weed odor as do these ropes themselves these look a lot like the Buddhist hours which I've had in the past and reviewed hmm there's a considerable weed taste to them not overwhelming the sourness definitely helps not as sour as the Buddhist hours but still pretty sour with a stronger weed flavor so hopefully that means they're more potent than the the Voodoo sours Oh sure if I mention this this is a 300 milligram animal should should be pretty potent but then again gummies your mileage right back again fairly strong we taste but the sourness really helps them overcoming with it all right guys so I'm gonna finish these here off-camera I'm not gonna bore you to death eating you all these things here in front of you and I will be back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because as always that is the most important part of any edible review all right guys please please please wish me luck let's hope these are better than our gummies in the past and ll WA edibles in the past and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know the results thank you so much for watching weights we'll see you soon peace guys I am happy to report that while not perfect and while not my first choice in any of the categories lol edibles the candy blue ropes blue berry ropes blue gummi ropes are are a nice little revelation they are not the most powerful 300 milligram edible I've ever had they're not the most tasty gummy I've ever had but I would say they are probably my new favorite gummy I am I do feel quite high not as high as I would be on a 300 mm gram confectionery edible like say akarova for example but that's a comparing you know something with like the best of the best I guess it's substantially better than their flamin hot cheeto knockoff that I had a while ago so you know it might be a combination of lowered expectations I was also a little tired going to this review so that might also be contributing to like my feelings of being high but overall I'm I'm I'm pleasantly surprised I know I used that phrase a lot but this was a welcome surprise I I had two strikes going against it one being lol edibles which I had a bad experience with and being a gummy which I've mostly found to be disappointing and I found it to be okay so that's you know that's good that's good I would not probably buy this again but if you are a fan of gummy edibles or if you really like sour gummies this is certainly better than the Voodoo candies I've had which are 375 milligram anibal's you might want to go and pick this up but for me it's it's a nice little surprise so thank you so much for watching weeks guys that's my dog walking in and we will check you out on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "X4O60iQXJho": "[Music] 500 milligram lead cereal bars for 12 bucks 300 milligrams of bags of chips for 10 400 milligram breakfast cereals we breakfast cereals for $11 and not only that but all the products are pretty tasty too this is just a small sampling of the great value you can expect from lol edibles and nearly ubiquitous edible manufacturer here in Southern California sounds too good to be true right well that's because it is welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana edible review show where we do our damndest to help you make sense of your dispensary this is a show where we try to save you from throwing away your hard-earned money on dud ass edibles and speaking of gun ass edibles today we're going to take a deeper look at LOL edibles where LOL presumably stands for lies on lies we have reviewed a variety of LOL products on wheats and so far have found them to be all greatly exaggerating their potency LOL edibles conveniently does not have an independent tasting testing laboratory rate their product or if they do they do not display it anywhere on their products packaging or on its the website without an independent testing body there are seemingly free to make up whatever dosage they want to put on their packaging and while I certainly cannot prove at this time they are exaggerating their potency my extensive experience with high potency edibles leads me to believe that they are full of [ __ ] so one of the cardinal rules of edibles is you get what you pay for with a few exceptions and we pay $10 for an edible that claims to have 400 milligrams of THC unless you see that independent laboratory verifying those results I would be pretty skeptical of that claim and lol edibles is the king of these shitty shenanigans an another tip-off that they may be less than honest is the taste of their products they usually print is pretty great but a 500 milligram edible should taste at least a little terrible these don't why well most likely because they're lying about how much THC is actually in the product let's compare them to say a 500 milligram kuroh an\u00edbal the kirova product will likely cost and double the lol edible or more and it will taste far Wars and while this might sound weird to say that's very much a good thing two hours after eating an lol a 500 milligram lol edible I'm stone-cold sober like a lifetime lifetime teetotaler but two hours after a 500 milligram Korova edible and I'm [ __ ] over the moon and probably under my covers passed out asleep so let's go back and talk about their website again it's [ __ ] laughable and that's four tabs products about contact and order there order tab seems to it seemed seems to be in good working condition which makes sense because I see this [ __ ] everywhere everything else on their website though god damn what a [ __ ] show the products tab only Keynes contains a small sliver of their products and the pictures look like they were taken on a crusty iphone 3gs by some bored seven-year-old the contact tab of course doesn't do a goddamn thing it's a completely dead link no way to contact them on their contact me tab my guess never worked they don't really want you to contact them they know you're pissed at them why don't they want to hear from you and actually if you really really really do want to get ahold of them just look at the bottom of their page and there's a link to their email and Instagram so you can contact them there psyche those are dead links too they just want you to think that they're able to be contacted but they don't really want you to know they're your feedback because they know they [ __ ] you they know that they're lying to you and they know that you're pissed they don't want to hear from you and finally let's talk about that about page that shows up on their website here's what it says on I quote the medical cannabis industry needed a well respected brand of edibles that patients can rely on for quality and reliability while tasting great lol edibles aims to take the industry by storm by providing great customer service and amazing products you can find LOL edibles throughout the Los Angeles Orange County and San Diego regions at fine reputable medical dispensaries ask your dispensary for LOL edibles today what a load of [ __ ] horseshit let's take that sentence-by-sentence here so I agree that the medical cannabis industry needs a well respected brand but lol edibles sure as [ __ ] ain't it they have the audacity to say that patients can rely on their quality and reliability they also brag about their customer service you know the one you can't actually reach out to or get in contact with them in any way shape or form so guys ask your dispensary the opposite ask them to stop selling these products tell them they are inadvertently ripping off their customers or maybe intentionally ripping off their customers I don't know the only true thing about that sentence or excuse me about that about page is that you can find them throughout LA and Orange counties as unfortunate as that is so I've tried the majority of the Ella Buhl's products but not all I will confess I've never tried their boob cubes or G bars but you know what at this point I never will and I don't care if they're actually good these guys have taken enough money from the pocket of consumers wheats will never review any of their products again their name is lol edibles but the only one are laughs the only ones laughing are them and they're laughing all the way to the bank let me just be totally here to click totally totally clear here to wrap up do not buy any lol edibles products do not let your friends buy their [ __ ] tell your dispensary not to carry this [ __ ] garbage leave them a negative review on weed maps and let's all work together to put these scumbags out of business thanks guys so much for watching

__ ] for you guys this time though we got some sour patch dummies right here 500 milligrams straight to the dome you know we're doing them so it's like I believe it's like 10:30 in the morning so I'm gonna be in candy in the morning but which I don't like but I feel like this is gonna be a really good high so I wanna like have it last the majority of the day instead of like taking it like later in the afternoon then falling asleep like halfway through the high or some [ __ ] I don't know got these for $25 from the not from like directly from a dispensary but from a friend of mine so yeah there's a pretty good price I think if you were to go to like a dispensary or something they usually charge $10 per hundred milligrams so kind of a good deal but yeah I'll show you these guys again know if you can see right down there 500 milligrams yeah 500 huh so yeah let's dig in so that's pretty cool just like I don't know little sour patch kids they don't look quite the same the sugar is kind of weird it looks wet and another thing it says on the back here five servings per container serving size one piece but there's like just way more than five pieces in that I don't know if you guys can see but we're taking doesn't taste like weed at all it's a lot better than that nerd rope I had that [ __ ] was like I don't think I like nerds I don't know but I did eat like a banana like I think an hour or 45 minutes ago just to sort of like activate my metabolite I don't know but oh yeah and something else I forgot like I figured like people would just figure did I do it that way but like I keep like I got a lot of comments on the last one I did like the nerd rope the nerd rope 400 milligram edible I think it was there were a lot of people that like just thought that video was like one video or like one time I think like I just got a bunch of like comments that were like you know edibles take longer than 10 minutes to hit and I was like well you really think I've like a weed Tube channel and I don't know the edibles don't hit immediately after you eat them so I mean I don't know I mean but just this isn't gonna be the whole video like I'm gonna check back in like an hour two hours whenever I start like really feeling high and that's gonna be me then later so alright cleared the whole bag we're out of these shits so I'm gonna check in and like last like an hour maybe two hours maybe three hours however long this takes to take effect yeah I'm gonna take one more head of this [Music] little baby hit but yeah I'll check back in with you guys about two hours or so so peace alright so check him back in guys it is now 2:30 so it's been about three or four hours and I am [ __ ] high I'm so high like I just feel like good and like cozy like I don't know in movies right now I'm on yes man with Jim Carrey shit's hilarious but yeah I just been chilling and I had two bowls of cereal but ya know how feelings [ __ ] good this is like holy [ __ ] this light that I have for the lighting like he's really [ __ ] bright yeah I would definitely recommend these who these things are [ __ ] dope they smacked me in the face cuz holy [ __ ] I'm I like him actually like I don't know I feel pretty good about him at least right now edible you know just kind of chill cuz yesterday I got like I drank so much like an I passed out I'm so tired and I threw up it was just like a horrible day so this just yeah it's a lot nicer everything like I don't know everything I look at like specifically focus on like looks very like clear and like clean but then everything else behind it is it like such an intense like a blur well yeah I'm just really chilling you know like this I like I said this is definitely a [ __ ] fire edible I [ __ ] with this i 100% recommend it but I'm other than that I have no idea what to talk about I kind of just want to know getting my [ __ ] back get in my bed and watch this movie so yeah I'll take one last rep I haven't been smoking too much we're hiding actually I had a couple reps of this like I think three hours in or so not too long ago he's dying but I did that because I was like kind of feeling the body high a little bit but I was just like nervous that it wasn't gonna be intense enough for whatever reason sometimes he sings some like a [ __ ] hit or miss but yeah so I smoked and then I like got really high and yeah I think I'm like getting maybe close to like the full effect I don't know how long this will last but I think usually the potent ones are the more potent the longer it lasts so maybe it's still building up but either way I'm just trying to chill out so I hope you guys are smoking I hope you guys enjoyed the video [ __ ] sour patch dummies stay high stay lifted stay quarantine stay clean and peace everybody", "hhTPYdjGxP0": "oh my god you guys all wanna be in my video hey guys welcome back to another video if you're new here I am Judith and today I do have an audience hello yeah but anyways today I am going to be eating or trying to eat a 500 milligram edible that I did find at a lab that I recently went to it was the first time that I had gone there and I just had to pick these up for you guys because I've never seen them ever in my life and once I figured out that these existed I saw a video on YouTube and there was comments saying that they really didn't hear so I'm not sure if I should eat the whole thing or eat a hundred milligrams of it because the other time if you guys haven't seen my if you guys haven't seen my last video I did eat a moon edible 100 milligrams and that edible like totally hit you guys I Loki freaked out so yeah I know that 100 milligrams will do me justice when it comes to properly hitting me right but yeah I had to pick this up for you guys 500 milligrams you guys enough to make me feel like I'm dying I'm not even kidding but I don't think I am gonna eat the whole thing or the whole string but I am gonna offer some people some of the edible its if you want it you want it and if you don't then you don't know pressure let me go ahead and set this camera up for you guys I am going to open and eat this in front of you guys you guys already know the deal so yeah if you guys haven't checked out my last edible video go ahead and check that out and let's do this okay I am literally on my knees for you guys but let's do this okay so this is the edible again you guys look at this cute new packaging I've never seen this type of edible ever I just had to pick it up for you guys I have to I have to this one unfortunately is not really like childproof it does have that starting cut there so it can easily be open unlike the other edibles I've said that it's a great idea not to suggest an opening just because young adults and kids can be around as for me I do have a baby around so you know not good for that but other than that it is cute I love it yeah they're medicated nerds 500 milligrams that's just tripping me out like I don't really believe it but I don't know I mean it just say it on the packaging so it says total dosage is 500 milligrams of THC and the rope has eight servings so let's see I don't know I mean that's you so it's saying one-eighth of the rope is 50 milligrams so we can calculate that by cutting it in half and then cutting it in half again and then cutting it in half again so that's pretty much a small ass piece like literally this is 50 milligrams and then another 50 and like it's just I don't know it's pretty crazy to me it just say that it's 60 minute activation time right there so I guess it's gonna take about an hour just like the other edible that I did consume for you guys so it does have this California warning sign that everyone always looks for on packaging but yeah I mean I wouldn't honestly you guys I wouldn't really trust this because I did buy it and an underground type of lab I've never even heard of this lab I was invited I wasn't even gonna buy anything so these are kind of like products that I'm iffy about so I don't know I guess you have to do your research I didn't do much research but I did see a video online yeah that was it that was pretty much it if you guys do want to have more research on this go ahead and look up videos because I'm pretty sure these are getting more known out there but yeah enough talking I'm just super talking talking maybe because I'm so nervous I don't know but let me go get some scissors actually no it has the tear there um and then let's do this so let me do a quick thumbnail and then we'll get back to it it is so hot in here you guys I'm really trying to just do this so let's do it okay yeah ready or not here we go so it says teryn share which I do plan on doing I am going as my uncle probably if he wants to try some hey baby baby okay I'm doing a video let's do it so I'm gonna open it sorry my babies in the background you guys okay look at this you guys what the heck so I had this in the refrigerator and my mom was just like freaking out telling everyone this is not a candy that this is marijuana and Dada Dada and I mean yeah precautions you guys so I'm gonna have 1/8 of the rope okay so 1/8 of the rope that's what it looks like you guys and it does say on the packaging it is 15 milligrams so here goes nothing not a soul bomb maybe you wanna try some it's so bomb you guys this is dangerous oh my gosh you guys okay two eights of the rope so this is gonna be a total of 100 milligrams why is that so bhama if you guys hear little parts as my sister's baby they just want to be cheese massage they want to be here and watch me the film for you guys these are so so bomb he says that it has a super potent formula okay I think I should keep it like that cuz I don't want to freak out you guys but okay I'll have a little more so I can have half of it which is gonna be 250 here's another one so it should be about 250 milligrams if not maybe a little less a little more nice learn can't film here you guys it is so hot in here mom like I ate a little less or a little more of 250 milligrams you guys I'm gonna feel like I'm dying but I'm yeah let me go see if anybody else wants to have a little piece of it maybe just 50 milligrams or a little more I don't mind sharing this it's whatever I did post this on snap so if you do follow me on snap you know that I did post this and I asked you guys if you guys have ever tried these and some of you guys said that they smack which is why I'm kind of scared because I don't want them to smack me so hard but some of you guys said that they don't so I guess it's just our personal experience and yeah I hope that they don't super smack but if they do a Plus let's go see who else wants to try some of these so we are gonna go outside and I am so hot here because I closed all the windows and doors so that no noise could come in but yeah your girls ready to go outside and just breathe but I will be checking up when this [ __ ] starts to hit and let you guys know what I feel so yeah let's go outside [Music] do you want to chase up it's a 500 milligram nerd okay you guys my uncle is down so go ahead and open it and then 1/8 of the rope is gonna be 50 milligrams so right there it does okay getting eighth you know what anything I know how an ape looks and we know candy no a little more a little more this would be good in them yeah I mean if there's a 500 milligram rope come with me yeah cheers Cheers you have to let us know how you feel okay I am back and I am definitely feeling this edible more of like a body high I feel yeah like maybe more of a body higher than anything else I'm like slowly freaking out like I can just feel it creeping up right now we are watching a movie so yeah I can definitely feel it while I'm watching the movie and yeah I'm pretty good right now but you guys I can definitely feel it just like it's gonna hit me like I know it's gonna hit me super hard and I just I hope that I don't freak out but yeah this is an update this is probably almost an hour after I ate the edible so keep in mind I ate about 250 milligrams this is about an hour later which yeah like the packaging said that it would hit me 16 minutes later and it's about that and I can definitely feel it creeping up right now so yeah this isn't even this isn't even the full-blown like faded moment but I will be back for that I hope that I am not freaking out or anything but yeah my mom is making carnitas and I just cut onion and cilantro and yeah I helped her in the kitchen and I'm gonna show you guys what we're eating because it just looks so bomb you guys that goes everyday bomb like super bomb and they make the best that Anita's so shout out to them but anyways let me get back to you guys and then if anything when I start to really feel it I will also ask how my uncle is feeling because he did take about 50 milligrams so he isn't really gonna feel as much but he'll definitely be feeling something if this rope is potent like it's saying it is but yeah I'll be back I already ate a taco and it was so so bomb but this is what they look like ooh ooh they look so bomb the airplane the baby I totally forgot to record I am still a little faded I honestly thought I was gonna hit harder but it didn't the day is still going the days are going so I'll be back to let you guys know the update so I thought the Edible was going to hit a little harder after the last video that I did make but no incident I was probably peaking right there and it didn't go any further than that but um yeah I was expecting it to hit a little harder just because I did consume a 250 milligrams and it just wasn't that heart of a high or a faded moment but yeah I mean would I buy them again I probably wouldn't maybe for the flavor and the taste because it tastes so bomb but for it to like actually hit and make me feel super faded mmm I don't know I'm gonna have to think about that one but yeah it was pretty good I enjoyed it I still have a little bit left and yeah I'm pretty sure it did hit my feel not as much but yeah he's knocked out after a while I thought it was gonna hit a little harder but it didn't so that's kind of a shame because other edibles that I have tried they've hit pretty hard so yeah when I buy this again sorry I'm in the kitchen and everyone's eating and I just decided the wrong time let you guys know the update but yeah it didn't hit that hard would I buy it again maybe not maybe for the flavor and taste but for it to hit me hard no I'll probably do a moon because with a moon edible eye it got me so good with just one hundred milligrams I did check up on my uncle he is totally asleep so yeah I guess I'm gonna ask him later how he felt after the edible but yeah it was a good run I did enjoy the edible it was really fun eating it I was pretty excited and yeah I've never seen an edible like that and I'm glad that I tried it for you guys like a rating out of 10 probably like I don't know a 7 just because it peaked and then that was it like I didn't really feel like super faded or anything maybe I was more of a body high but yeah other than that it was good I hope they get like the video I'm gonna show you guys a bit of what my sister is making and then that's the end of the video or maybe I'll include a little more because we are gonna drink later so other than that thank you guys

okay Chris any moment the police before oh yeah a couple times a couple of times you got arrested yeah yeah I mean it's been a minute yeah it's been a while no probations are not know that no okay do you have a license for marijuana yes I do yeah okay I just I have smell I have there's two memberships for dispensaries but I do have my like see the the dates on this January 21st 2016 so that's the actual government-issued this is just my I can do card but the this is you know the expired license actually suppose in the next day or two you're supposed to be by the end of the month this is like my government Medical Marijuana or like thing but rate it expired March 29th 2013 fire but this is but this is this is actually still valid because it's going to court okay so the court dates like the end of this month likes you know it's a big to class action lawsuit this in that hurry for this right so this is actually still valid but I mean you can go by three joints also well under this expands oh yeah okay actually on the love to carry 150 grams at any time but I'm by prescriptions for six grams a day but this actually I'm actually it's like it's a ridiculous amount like with the actual licenses for 3500 grams or something but you know for storage purposes like it's ridiculous amount but I don't know anywhere near allowed to grow 30 plants but I haven't because you know it's all up

who yes whose fair enough whatever then it's not then do you have to buy it from these oh yeah like that's what I have been doing right is like a there's a place in Toronto or whatever so that's that's what this card is but this you know the government you buy from the government and they mail it to you so it's like you know and it's a lot more expensive than if you go to a dispensary like

stronger i'm back you guys i hope you missed me i'm finally moved into the new home i'm so excited to be here expect to see videos from me regularly again now that i've moved in i have no excuse if you're not already subscribed make sure you subscribe right now so you can see all my new videos in your sub box but today isn't going to be my typical smoking video i'm going to do something a little different i have 500 milligrams of rso capsules in here there are 10 capsules and they're 50 milligrams each actually looking at this many pills is pretty intimidating i'm not gonna lie i'm pretty much just going to film the aftermath of this so i hope you guys enjoy that this is a little bit of a different video for me but i think this is going to be a lot of fun got a nice tough glass of water to wash these down here's number one here's number two here's number three number four this is the point in our return at this point i'm getting [ __ ] lit number five all right halfway there number six i'm so scared my body like didn't want to swallow that one it was like dude don't do it i'm gonna start a timer right now before i forget so we can tell how long it takes for this to actually kick in i've never actually consumed rso before so i have no idea and i'm stone sober right now so it's gonna hit me like a brick wall all right number seven number eight number nine and last but not least number ten the point of no return wish me luck you guys this is gonna be a long day well it has been an entire minute and i'm not high at all yet i can confirm that honestly i'm a little nervous i've read online that rso can take up to 15 hours to kick in i don't think it's gonna take me that long but that's some of my brief googling told me and before this kicks in i'll explain to you what rso is for those of you who don't know it stands for rick simpson oil it's a cannabis extract but it's not meant to be dabbed like most cannabis extracts let me reiterate please do not dab this it tastes like [ __ ] it is not a fun experience it's much better to be consumed orally like through a pill or through some food it really doesn't have a nice consistency to it or taste so honestly the pill form that i just did is the best way to consume it so you don't have any of that weird flavor rso offers a lot of medical benefits when you're doing what i'm doing not really but it actually does especially for people who can't smoke but as i said this was a super [ __ ] high dose so i'm really curious about what's gonna happen to me i'm really not a huge edible guy like i said even when i've done 150 and 250 milligrams i really just don't enjoy the high i get so i'm really curious what this 500 milligram high is going to be like all right guys we just passed the 45 minute mark and i'm still not high i feel like this is gonna take as long as an edible to kick in so within the next 45 minutes i'm expecting to feel pretty rocked i was just going through my snapchats and somebody messaged me though and said that it took four hours for theirs to kick in so i'm really hoping i don't have to sit here for four hours waiting for this to kick in straight up it has been over an hour and a half and i'm really not that high like i might feel a little something but i honestly think it's all in my own head ultimately i don't think i'm high yet i hope this isn't a fail because i'm gonna be really pissed if this bottle just does nothing to me there's the stats for you as you can see 500 milligrams pack of 10 thc terpenes all that all right let's kick it oh my god i feel like edibles here you're talking [ __ ] bro it's starting to kick in i can like start to feel it in my chest and in my head a little bit it hasn't hit me like a brick yet i just thought this is gonna hit me way harder it's definitely a gradual high i'm actually feeling now it straight up took two hours and 13 minutes for me to feel anything but i'm feeling pretty hopeful right now finally my eyes are getting pretty heavy my whole body's getting that like slow feeling that you get on edibles so i have a feeling it's about to kick in all right well i'm bored i'm gonna go play with my dog or something paper paper high piper you're a dog dog oh my god you're a dog oh my god come here i'm so high oh my god oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] i'm piper sit high five oh i'm too high yeah shake my hand good job piper you guys want to see something kind of funny my dog is an overbite i honestly feel like i'm just melting at this point like oh my god these edibles kicked in pretty strong my entire body just feels heavy i'm gonna try to catch a quick dub on fall guys let's see how this goes bruh i've never felt like i've been running this low in this game i think like time's been slower for me no bruh bruh right i got this i can do this i can do this i can do this oh yes i'm going to qualify let's [ __ ] go bro i'm in like the top three right now [ __ ] okay that [ __ ] me [ __ ] let's do it let's do it let's do it yeah [ __ ] i was gonna be the next one all right [ __ ] this game i need to just like listen to music it's kind of like vibe and [ __ ] [Music] [Applause] i need more water i'm so [ __ ] thirsty if you have the option to get crushed ice and you don't just don't text me back anymore because we're not friends that makes a [ __ ] mess all right let's hydrate before we die drink oh my god that was like the kiss of life all right as you can see we are approaching the four hour point and as you can see my eyes are very heavy i'm not gonna lie man i'm getting higher and higher and higher which is cool i guess but do you really want to pop some rso caps and have to be like still getting higher in four hours like maybe at like certain situations but ultimately dabbing and smoking weed are still my preferred ways to consume cannabis but yeah these aren't so cascade hidden i don't know what it is but i have like a little double vision right now i'm like super foggy it's a different type of high for sure it's definitely more like a foggier body high than like a typical dab high or a typical weed high which more focuses on like the head i feel like this is mainly the body and then like the head is secondary like the head high is there but the body height is so intense that you don't even really notice the head high almost but i think i need a nap like that's not out of their own possibility for me today i'm so [ __ ] high i was really worried like i was talking a lot of [ __ ] on these for a minute there like it was two and a half hours before i really felt anything and it's been another hour and a half and i'm so much higher than i was then so i'm curious when this is gonna like cap so it's gonna be a long day you guys i hope you're down for the ride i'm sorry if this video isn't interesting i know i'm typically smoking and [ __ ] more but i'm just riding this high out dude like this is [ __ ] nuts i low-key just want to keep smoking on top of this to see what happens kind of see if it evens out the head high with the body height a little bit but i don't know if that's the wisest idea but i'm not here to make wise decisions that's nice it's [ __ ] nice i just stabbed on some white widow from calypso big fan of their concentrates they're a little bit on the more expensive side but the terpene profile is just unreal that dab actually made me feel a little bit better i feel like the body height was just too intense now that i got a nice little head high there too i'm like all right all right i'm back in this how long has it been oh how about that 420 blazing four and a half hours in and i'm still feeling very [ __ ] good the cotton mouth is just not going away no matter how much water i drink it just will not stop she's gotta pee and then we're gonna make some wings in the airfryer popcorn turns to food porn the other side hope you are liking this [ __ ] high as [ __ ] home style vlog because this is what you're getting hope you missed me now we are going to turn the air dude do you hear me i'm so [ __ ] big we're gonna turn the airfryer on um boom if you smoke weed and do not have an air fryer i really hope that you can take one thing out of this video and go buy one because it will truly save your life especially when you're high and you want some fire food now we're just gonna drop them in and oh yeah those are done all right food porn is in full effect you guys i'm so [ __ ] high let's determine how one of these is that looks fire oh yeah i think these need some buffalo sauce all right my high i should not have used hot sauce because my dumbass spilled it all over my shirt but i found one that's pretty much the same color to keep the aesthetic piper's pissed off she didn't get any chicken wings saved a couple for later but i honestly think i hit the peak of this high you guys it's really not as bad as i thought it was gonna be for some reason i just thought it was gonna be super intense i've had a lot of 100 to 200 milligram doses before but this is the first time i ever had a 500 milligram dose and for some reason i just figured it was gonna be like two or three times the intensity but i honestly don't think it is i think there's like a peak high you get when you smoke and probably even with edibles and probably just with how much i consume cannabis right now my tolerance is so high that this just wasn't too intense for me like i definitely couldn't drive or anything and i definitely wouldn't recommend anyone try consuming this much you should definitely ask your doctor before consuming any amount of thc don't ask me and don't go off my uh experience probably should have said that earlier in the video but yeah i'm really just [ __ ] tired at this point i'm high as [ __ ] i feel like i've had like all the phases of the edible at this point i feel like i had the giggles i feel like i had the like just chill high part i feel like i had the munchies and now i'm just at the like chill slumped part of the edible like i'm exhausted that's really all i have to say right now i'm gonna have a good night's sleep i'm pretty sure i just confirmed you can't overdose on weed we've been doing this just under six hours and ten minutes it'll be six hours but you know the high only kicked in three and a half hours ago if i did my math right but still being high as [ __ ] three and a half hours later that's not too bad i still don't think that this is the way i would like to consume most of the time like i feel like this is really just for people that can't smoke or like really just don't want to for whatever reason but like this just isn't as fun for me because i hate waiting for the high i like it to just come pretty much instantly it probably will come out quicker if you have a low tolerance but that's not the situation for me you know you really just don't know what how you're gonna get and i'd rather like find out right away when i rip a bong if it like got me high or not then like find out four hours later if you got high or not you know i'm just kind of rambling at this point you guys but that's the video click like if you enjoyed thank you so much for watching i really appreciate it make sure you subscribe i got a lot more videos on the way in my lovely new house with my adorable little pup leave a comment let me know what's the biggest edible you've ever had i'd like to know but it's time i take a nap thank you guys so much for watching i'm glad to be back on youtube i've missed you guys many more videos to come just you wait but my name is jeff peace", "0S9U37dTubc": "hey everyone so if you know anything about DC or just you know the cannabis life there you know that Sunny Patch was popular for a while and so things started to get a little weird my really really reliable pop-up shop lady stopped carrying these because she said they stopped putting actual cannabis inside of these edibles and you know at first when I would get these from this woman they provided the best experience a very powerful you know it was a very powerful high and the best part is like you know you didn't have to smoke weed because you could just pick these really yummy sour candies but when I made my first videos on stony patch a lot of people were telling me oh no this stuff isn't real this stuff is you know hogwash this stuff is fake and I was like I don't know what you're talking about the first several times that I got sunny patch packages it was like the best thing I've ever experienced and oh just a heads up cannabis is completely legal in Washington DC DC if you know anything about DC you know that there are no legal issues with consuming consuming cannabis okay alright so with that said now that we know so knee patch is unreliable altogether there is no centralized provider for stony patch I just want to talk about some alternatives so I know a lot of people are not in the DC area but if you're in a DC area and you want kind of reliable edibles then you know what I think a good alternative would be this this is Capital confections - came in here yeah yeah - came inside and the gummies are in the shape of puzzle pieces and I'll just take these out these are really good as well so it looks like this gummy and the gummy is sugarcoating oh it's hard okay so it smells sour and really kind of a sieve and the directions on the back I'm gonna read them for you they say nibble half of one gummy and wait one hour before consuming more I think that's a good idea cuz this is this also tends to be really strong I don't know if these particular gummies these gummy edibles are as strong as the first time I tried the good stony patch ones but a lot of people here on my channel had been telling me that when they try a sunny patch nothing happens it's fake like just nothing is happening so with that said in the fact that the supplier lady stopped carrying these all together I think it's safe to say that for a lot of people who Sony patch was like a scam but I promise for me the first time I tried sunny patch it was not a scam and the reason why I'm like making this video is because I finally got confirmation from the lady that introduced me to this edible that yeah this is a no-go now okay so this is why I am suggesting maybe if you are in DC try this and hopefully you'll get a better experience with this one okay so if you have any more questions you can let me know um [Music] these tastes really good and I like them and yeah they'll do but I really did like the stony fresh ones as well and I'm sad that they're kind of fake so yeah see you guys later bye [Music]", "YFKNLym1r3w": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it's your boy goblin and today we're coming in with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you guys

three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14. there's 14 little um um 14 little [ __ ] wow heads or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call them um they don't look like the [ __ ] regular warheads um every other [ __ ] review that i've been trying like the [ __ ] sour patch ones the watermelon ones really look like the [ __ ] regular candy um this one doesn't look like the regular warheads but or what the [ __ ] do the regular warheads look like anyways actually doesn't matter but i'm just trying to give you guys as much detail as i [ __ ] can um it doesn't say how much [ __ ] thc is per little little um little gummy or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it but it says the packet says it's 500 um 500 milligrams so we're just gonna [ __ ] take these shits and see what's up i mean all of them all fourteen is it fourteen i don't know i'm probably sleeping one two three four five six oh [ __ ] i [ __ ] again one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve three four yeah fourteen um but yeah they're regular as [ __ ] jelly beans or they taste like regular jelly beans i don't taste any weed i was just one of them they're not that sour i was over scared as well i think i was young i was gonna be on camera soured out and [ __ ] looking like my guy right here and [ __ ] um but damn [ __ ] jelly bean flavors are these either like the best jelly beans shits are fire i got me doing my happy dancing [ __ ] i get so i get so excited every time like i'm [ __ ] eating candy and [ __ ] or even when i'm [ __ ] eating too and i'm enjoying that [ __ ] i started dancing them like yesterday i was at ihop [ __ ] in my ass i'll just eating and [ __ ] all that happy um [Music] you know what they taste like or this one or basically all them they taste like those one [ __ ] long sour ropes with like different colors and [ __ ] like blue it's not like different ropes that are different colors but they're like a [ __ ] rainbow i don't know what the [ __ ] they're called but it tastes like that little sour ropes one two three four five six seven eight i just ate half of these [ __ ] it's still earliest oh no it's early we'll take a shower right now um hopefully you should snack we're gonna see if they make me feel different um or if they don't i'ma just be honest i have no [ __ ] hate against any company if it doesn't smack then it just didn't smack this it's not saying that they don't have any anything that [ __ ] smacks but i'm gonna just let you guys know if it just didn't hit me or or what's up i'm not gonna lie to you guys either all right we got two left that's all of them i enjoyed myself eating them for five the taste i gotta give it a 10 out of ten honestly i give some [ __ ] ratings on here i can say i'm not attending [ __ ] but my [ __ ] opinion doesn't [ __ ] matter speak from your own experiences and just try them honestly what i'm trying to do is like see if like if you guys seen these in a local dispensary if you guys are thinking of trying them but you guys wanted to see someone's review first that's all i'm trying to do you know um i'm not telling you to try them i'm not telling you to go out and buy them right now i just want to give you guys more insight on these [ __ ] or if you guys ever like haven't heard of them and then you see this video and then you guys [ __ ] find out about them or find them and you're like oh [ __ ] they actually [ __ ] smack i want to try um that's all i wanted to do or um get out of this video my [ __ ] ratings don't mean [ __ ] everyone has their own [ __ ] ratings um but it's currently uh like 10 10 40 now or 10 yeah i think it's 10 40 because when i started recording it was like 10 35 and it's been like eight minutes so it's like 10 40 um i'll pick up the camera like around 11 50 or some [ __ ] or an hour from now and just let you guys know how i [ __ ] feel so hour by hour i'm going to be updating you guys um i don't know if it doesn't smack within like usually i get smacked within like the first hour two hours um but who knows the [ __ ] sour patch edibles took like four hours before they actually [ __ ] hit me and [ __ ] um so we're just gonna go with the flow and see what's up see if these are actually 500 milligrams or what's up but all right guys i'll pick up the camera later alright guys i currently just got out of the shower um you guys can see um dude i got a comment one time someone said that my [ __ ] perm looks goofy um it's not a perm i have natural curly hair it's just that sometimes it should just be looking goofy as [ __ ] because i have some thick ass [ __ ] girls and my hair just gets dried out sometimes um but i know i don't know i just wanted to mention that [ __ ] someone said i got a permanent [ __ ] it's not perm natural [ __ ] curls um but anyways it's currently like [ __ ] 12 [ __ ] 12 30 i think um i didn't pick it up within the first hour um but i'm just here to [ __ ] let you guys know i i don't know if i [ __ ] feel something or not um i want to wait a little bit more longer give it another hour or so but as of right now i just feel relaxed and i don't know it's just [ __ ] weird i'm not gonna say i'm smack smack but i'm also gonna say like i don't feel a little something it's not drastic but i can't say that i don't feel relaxed and i feel like i'm just chilling you know like i'm just vibing and [ __ ] um like if i had to rate it it's probably like a six six point five right now where i'm at i don't know um i'm feeling something chilling [ __ ] vibing um but i'm just give it another hour or so and see what the [ __ ] happens cuz right now uh i'm not feeling [ __ ] but yeah man we're just gonna [ __ ] let it run and i'll pick up the camera within another hour or so and see what's up i still haven't ate anything so we'll see all right guys as you guys can see i just made um my tea i got a maca and ashwagandha tea mixed with some with two tablespoons of honey um just to get that vitality up and that energy up um but that's just gonna be pretty much it it's currently 115 um 120 or some [ __ ] or some one something um but i i'm gonna rate those edibles on my personal scale 6.5 doesn't mean you shouldn't [ __ ] try them um but honestly i'm not gonna say that i didn't feel anything because i do feel like some haziness in my eyes and usually that's [ __ ] an indicator one like one of the indicators for me that i'm [ __ ] like high and [ __ ] but like i feel hazy in my eyes my eyes feel like low-key kind of [ __ ] heavy but nothing major you know i'm [ __ ] chilling i'm rocking um i would suggest some more if you have a a lower tolerance um and then and if you have a lower tolerance and it may [ __ ] hit you a lot more harder um but it wasn't nothing crazy for me it was just i was just chilling um but it's cool trying out these different [ __ ] like candy um replicated edibles or whatever how however you would wear that um it's just cool to try out like [ __ ] like a wonka bar [ __ ] sour patch [ __ ] flavored ones warheads it's [ __ ] crazy uh mixed with weed that's crazy as [ __ ] that's just dope um but yeah just because i give it a 6.5 doesn't mean you shouldn't try it if you have a lower tolerance or an a [ __ ] tolerance then go for it give them a try they're [ __ ] the taste of them is fired um i'm pretty sure it will [ __ ] smack if i like gave it to my sisters or some [ __ ] um but yeah i'ma just go ahead and end the video here man um if you guys enjoyed this video hit that subscribe button also hit that bell notification she doesn't get notified

overview I am at the auditorium or whatever right here in Los Angeles and I'm better Munch out on these stony patches that I just got a dispensary let's see how these are they look like sour patches I better take the whole 350 milligrams the whole thing I'm about to take the whole thing while I'm out here cuz I got like an hour parking and I'm not trying to really wait I've been waiting to eat them at the house but we've been out all day so I'm even here look the different colors they're little squares they're not the little sour patch figures and I got about like 10 of them so they smell like candy I do smell a little bit different in between they don't taste different that all tastes the same no matter what color they were um first time I ever see these they look like the exotic cards for some reason but they're edible got a matter dispensary for $15 so why not I will be coming back they get an hour to to see what the fix were and let you know they were worth the $15 or not so for now just stay tuned and Cheers and stay hi hi guys I'm back as I breathing for 23 hours later after taking 350 milligram edible I did not feel anything guys I went to the observatory in LA and I was up there for like 2 3 hours and they did not even kick in I had my moon rock art and I think after like 2 hours that I waited to see if they kicked in I just started hitting on the moon rock art and I got me it got me high as hell but these they didn't do anything for 15 bucks I bought these at a dispensary in Compton and yeah these are not worth it at all guys definitely 15 bucks down the drain but you know you pay for what you get or you get you get what you pay for and these two out of 10 don't even try ever if you come to LA so let me know if you want me to do more edibles don't forget to Like and subscribe comment down below and stay tuned and stay high [Music]", "ORCdvawQ69w": "but now I hope everyone is having a good ass day today I plan to it's a shitty [ __ ] Monday and we're gonna start things off right it's about 950 in the morning and I got one of these to get me through the day this is a medicated nerds rope seriously strawberry 400 milligrams of THC this is going to be wild yo it says I like I don't show you guys the whole thing just like sharing hair I get from Cali it says da right there I'm in Maine so other side of the country I shoulda thought about the fact I have braces it doesn't feel like I should be eating it and like 10:00 in the morning but you get strong but no this is obviously gonna take a while so I'm just gonna eat this real quick for you guys and check back in later at some point I'm dropping little nerd [ __ ] everywhere [ __ ] sweet I like don't eat candy but actually not enjoying this I really don't like this it's like the Nerds of the sour pirate but I don't even think that that has any THC in it it's probably all on the gummy so [ __ ] not pleasant to eat I'm sorry [ __ ] it's so [ __ ] sugary like halfway there it's all in my teeth gonna be tasting this [ __ ] for like an hour bought some blackberry Kush mostly endicott [ __ ] within because if you guys ever wondering if I have like a strain preference I mean I guess it's based on whatever I want to do like if I had like a whole day planned out where I wanted to get stoned but I had to go do things I'd pick a sativa but what the [ __ ] but most of the time I smoked to relax so I do enjoy like in the car better more often doesn't taste like weed at all that's not what I mean when I say it tastes bad it's just so [ __ ] sweet it's like early [ __ ] I took a shot of whiskey like it was like a little bit of whiskey and like a glass of my my throat's been like getting sore if you ever like feel like your throats getting sore and you take like a shot of alcohol or something for like an hour I'll just start to feel better but so I have that like sitting in my stomach a little bit and it's [ __ ] tangent well I'm sorry I from choosing if I'm chewing my mouth or talking on my mouth shooting with my mouth open I might already be stoned I don't even know fully last little bite here the video and see how this 400 milligram edible hits me etc ear actually I miss that but I guess it's supposed to work in 60 minutes I don't think that's a hundred percent if that's not represent accurate everybody obviously everyone's metabolism is [ __ ] different through it you'll make it hopefully I'm making it I'll check that few guys in a little bit all right so checking back in with y'all it's about two hours later I'm pretty stoned but like I don't know definitely not a stone as I like thought it would be so I'm just smoking now but I don't know I'm just I'm definitely kind of time just like feeling a little more tired but it's nothing like it's nothing like too crazy rolled up a little Jay got the absinthe flavored papers but he'll be here left this the main live cards as I've showed this pen yet but it's got like a little different voltage options of warm that up this cart is some blackberry Kush hybrid mostly indica so yeah I think I told you guys fun at the end of coz oh yeah let's give it a rip should I turn it down a little bit right there to about like 2.75 and then we'll take a blinker and hey I hate it like it's so awkward because like the cart [ __ ] never like screws on to like match up with the button so like five buttons right in front the [ __ ] mouthpiece is like awkward Cheers now I'm pretty big but I want to try some [ __ ] like I want to have either like a few 500 milligram edible doses all at once I'm just see what that's like because I really want to see if y'all got if you all remember my own the first time I ever took edibles story - it was crazy we don't really know what the dosing was but there's a slight chance there might have also been acid in it which if you eat that with edibles just makes it like way more I'm trying to think of the word like it just enhances the effects of like both highs I think and but yeah I know I want to see if that was like if that was the case or if that feeling is like 1500 milligrams worth of edibles because if it is I'm trying to [ __ ] get there - yeah that was such it was a good day but it was like a terrible day at the same time cuz like I wasn't expecting it is there I don't know there were times I was like worried there's a long [ __ ] story you guys should go back and watch that video if you haven't thought was a [ __ ] it was a banger oh [ __ ] well battery's just about dead anyways plug this [ __ ] and I know I think you know this this is like a pretty decent edible for me I just I need to take more but now mm-hmm I hope you guys enjoy the video I'm definitely gonna be takin I'll do a video of me taking a shitload more edibles um have like a big-ass me I'll have like a bunch of different [ __ ] to eat drinks it's actually a dope idea anything but no drop a like if you guys enjoyed the video comment and favorite way to smoke away smoking from state country whatever but yeah stay lifted everybody have a good a stay in peace y'all", "GlNRlD6udeA": "the heist but he's back he's back after an hour yes yes guys he's back he's back are you doing are you doing so roughly an hour late it's being literally about an hour and three minutes day but feel the effects I feel the effects very very nicely actually it feels lovely it's not overpowering or anything like that I really really enjoy it it's nice I don't think the 300 milligram sweets were quite enough for me I have quite a high tolerance to cannabis as you guys know you've seen more smoke but yeah you really really feel a nice effect from this like I said it's not overpowering I don't want to sort of - don't mean I'm not gonna sort of an uncomfortable position or place or anything like that I just feel really nice I feel good I feel like I put some games on I feel like I've got I'd be fighting for a walk I could be absolutely active scrappy-dappy-doo being stop it nor pussycat but yeah I feel I feel really good I feel really really nice on her I don't feel salt down all over or anything like that lovely I'm not see it's only it's only just being just over an hour and it does say quite clearly on the packet may take up two hours so delay by up to two hours okay so I'm probably not in the full of the effects as of yet anyway so it's probably a little bit more time I would say I think I'm just on a gradual buildup in a minute but I would say that after about half an hour I started to feel something which like so I didn't on the other packet of sweets at all I didn't it took like the full hour before I started getting the effects of it so it works a lot quicker but I'd probably put that down to me doing it first thing in the morning I'm not having anything to eat as of yet so so for me personally if I do have any of these sweets again I'm going to try my best to probably take them first thing privy inside you and I mean unless I've got loads of em and then I'll just wash them like anything but yeah if you just use them as medicine then yeah I think first thing in the morning for me works the and I'll be interested to see actually how long it lasts as well so be out feeling nice and feeling nice and I'm nice and relaxed nice and mellow nicely stoned in my body yeah just like not overpowering my vision feels a little bit like it's going a little bad times when I move my head's so definite strength to it but I personally think that I could eat a couple of packets of those no problem and it would be OK for me to do that I would recommend you guys do that obviously if you don't smoke a lot just you know mean they'd split up into 50 milligram pieces so it's really really good to go shoo just because I've taking a whole pot don't go do that please you know me know your body know your limits but for me it not problem been smoking quite a lot of years to be fair my tolerance is up there so but I think of ninja had taken for example that packet of sweets I think she'd be really really feeling it bang so a tolerance a little bit lower than mine Oh see I am the main smoker cheers guys so still on the black cheese loving it though does it make me feel like I want to stop smoking which is which is good although sometimes about as it was it's like I can't touch the smoke for hours but now I feel a right of your eye not a particularly high dosage for me but gets really good guys [Music] you're quite chatty as well I'm always chatting you know that my job really over chat in a minute nice pecked on me I've had a bomb since the last bomb over so again it's been an hour since all that bomb definitely like to try some more of these better bores I [Music] definitely like to probably get to a position where I can maybe have a couple of packs of em and see what they feel like but left me for me I've still got half of my speaker left which is just oh no I think I only have one mil of it or whatever it is but there's about half of it left night so starving hungry I'm gonna make a famous Ryan fecal pizza okay I will save a little drop of it just for the for the fecal hot chocolate cause I didn't want to do a thick hot chocolate as well but I'm gonna do yeah I'm gonna do a pizza with some Pico on it which is what like so Ryan eats it and he recommends it and I thought well do you know what that sounds really good last time I got it all over my teeth I've tried it in there's other ways you can do it as well but I think that defeats the way I really really really like the idea of that so I will try that I will try that definitely so I've seen a few people do the Pico pizza so yeah it's made me think hmm lot lot easier way to go down and a lot sort of safer in your body because you're digesting it with food at the same time lovely a little bomb well I'm a rocket oh dear cheers guys Cheers yeah I feel it [ __ ] lovely I feeling lovely nice they like say it might affect you differently if you take a packet about if you're like a one joint add a person and you know you you're not make particularly a heavy heavy smoker maybe you're not a smoker at all maybe that's the reason why you'll you know you're taking metaphors is because you don't like smoking so I would just say start with a low dosage and then just just build yourself up after an hour you'll get to feel whether you're comfortable or not and then obviously you can you can take another dose and so yeah don't do a packet in one go please please guys one love I'm fashioning I've been trained for this [Music] lovely Peter [ __ ] noise noise a cocktail - Peter [ __ ] lovely [Music] become picture here we come you'll be on the live stream do their life garibai straight after this pretty much as soon as the pizza sketch [Music] Wow what can you say to that cheers guys cups tea on the go you know how we roll in the am one huh let me feel really good I mean ready if I was gonna rip you know give him a proper sort of a review is sort of mark then I mean Oxley the pack her packaging tell accent the sweets himself really really really nice I like the fact that you can dose by having the eight sweets which are basically fifty milligrams of peace they sell I think that's brilliant really really nice really really nice of fat not quite strong enough for me but for some people that might be really really strong so yeah probably set by an eight out of ten on though so a ten on sweets by would like soy two packets will certainly see what the sweets and the feet can do together with the black cheese you will see what sort of stately and getting me into today though shall they so yeah peaceful nerve thank you very much for watching this video and I will be back very very soon because I'm gonna be doing a live stream in the next 20 minutes so peace will learn seriously noise just ate some more meta balls and got stoned yes yes hey attend for the chuckles one love one love [Music]", "QihVHvReBB4": "hello and welcome to a brand new segment we would like to call what did i order off the internet on this week's episode we will answer that question and many more so stay tuned and find out what did we order from the internet hi and welcome back to what did i order from the internet i'm your host nicole and today we're gonna find out what's in this package and what did i order from the internet in today's world we have so little time to leave our house we're all so busy all just just living our lives doing things so we rely on the internet to just send us packages and sometimes we get a little order happy and we order more things than we can remember and then things show up in unmarked packages like this and we're like what did i order from the internet this week i don't know let's find out i bet you didn't see this one coming it's candy we ordered candy from the internet now this isn't just any candy let me get this uh out of the way these are sour strips now i've never had these before but according to the internet this is supposed to be actual sour candy that's what it says right on the back actual sour candy well i would hope so sour strips though according to the internet they were founded by this guy who really loved sour candy but like couldn't find sour candy that was like sour enough so he made his own candy his name's like max we'll uh we'll put it in the video notes anyway max created sour strips and while we don't sell sour strips in our store we do sell sour belts in our store so i thought well let's compare them because they look very identical a little suspect if you ask me so that right there with all of its rainbow glory kind of looks a lot like what we sell my question is max did you actually make these or did you just order these and put your name on it i have questions internet i have questions okay they look identical i guess the only way to really find out if this max guy made his own candy is to try them but before we do go ahead subscribe to our channel we're dropping new videos every friday this is the first time that we have done a video about brand new sour candy with so many flavors to choose from like this video because i mean did you see that intro you were hooked from the very beginning and now you are curious and you also have questions about this candy we'll be right back to cut into one of these probably the rainbow and uh we'll do a little flavor comparison we'll be right back sweet thing sweet stickers get yours today and stick them on everything stick them on your water bottle stick them on your dog stick them on a dumpster yeah why not stick them on your business stick them on your friend's business stick them on a cop car maybe not stick them on a brand new parking lot i don't care where you stick them just stick them just kidding we absolutely care where you stick them don't stick them on things you don't know don't stick them on cop cars don't stick them anywhere they can potentially get you arrested we will not bail you out make your life sweet and get your sweet thing sweet stickers a day welcome back to this week's episode of what did i order on the internet this week we're talking about sour strips and we're just about ready to cut into this so colorful package of rainbow sour strips now this is made by the actual candy company or i should say it's sold by the actual candy company because on the back you can find some very interesting information about anything when you look at all the information that's printed on packaging so these sour strips that claim to be made by some guy named max on the internet who's got this sad story about how he could never find the perfect sour candy so he made his own i'm sure he did i'm a skeptic for good reason because on the back here it says packaged for actual candy llc made in the netherlands hmm the actual candy company their address is in texas but this candy is made in the netherlands now why is that important cause these sour belts that we sell in our candy store right here in missouri these little gems according to their packaging information also made in the netherlands now what are the odds that there are two different companies in the netherlands the netherlands is not that big so what are the odds that there are two candy companies cranking out the same sour belt or sour strip products i'm gonna say that there are not two different companies and i'm gonna guess that these may have at one time been like brothers and sisters and then they were just separated because they were shipped to different packaging companies but that's just my best guess the only real way to decide is to cut this open and to give them a try a lot of candy companies they will manufacture their products and then sometimes they will ship it out to other companies and then those other companies package it and they put their name on it and they're like yeah look at with me we made a but not really so i just have a feeling that that might have happened because they just look very similar exactly the same there blue and yellow and red and green now these are the sour strips okay very sugary now on the back it says rainbow isn't a flavor but who cares get ready for a colorful flavor party in your mouth i feel like there's a disco ball of just rainbow colors exploding in my mouth right now they are pretty delicious i don't know what flavor rainbow is it's a lot of flavors even the ingredients gives me zero clues as to what that flavor might be because the ingredients are really just like sugar more sugar more sugar and a lot more sugar oh and dye there's a lot of dye good old red 40 blue one a lot of that stuff but there's nothing that says any sort of flavor and even on the front rainbow it's just artificially flavored candy so artificially flavored like what we don't know but they are tasty serving size is very small only four of those do not do not overload yourself okay for the real test yep getting a lot of the uh a lot of the same like disco rainbow party vibes happening in my mouth with this flavor so i can't say for certain that they are exactly the same product they're really really close and the fact that they are both made in the netherlands raises so many flags for me all the flags i just i have so many questions so many questions i don't know if i should contact this company and be like hey did you actually make those maybe i'll just do like a scientific study science you know what i like about science there's no better time to conduct a science experiment than right now so let's just get down to it okay side by side comparison of what's in both of these products and go sugar yep glucose fructose syrup yup wheat flour yep malic acid yeah dextrose oh yeah palm oil citric acid yeah that's there artificial flavoring oh you betcha artificial colors you mean like fdmc red 40 and fdnc blue one oh yeah we've got those turmeric olio resin for color ascorbic acid oh yeah we've got that and uh this last word that i'm not even going to try to pronounce oh yeah that's in there and oh look they both have an allergen info warning statement that they might contain wheat that seems just a little coincidental i think not you have it right there my scientific study side-by-side comparison of all the ingredients these aren't the same products then i don't know internet you can order them you can give them a shot or you could just come here and you can buy the sour strips that we have and then you can be like yeah i've i've totally had sour strips but they were sour belts and i got them from the world's okaiest candy store in missouri not texas i know texas claims to do everything bigger and better but you know what texas missouri is doing all right too that's the rainbow these other ones here of these pink lemonade these also intrigue me i'm thinking maybe we do another video and compare it to like a good glass of like pink lemonade if you have any other ideas you can leave it in the comments there's strawberry there's blue raspberry there's mango there's green apples there's a lot we are not done with sour strips we are going to dive into these more actual candy yeah it is candy but i don't know if you made it i don't know if it's actually your candy and we didn't make these but i do know where they came from and they came from the same place that these others did all of these they all say made in the netherlands so i have questions that be end you can be like what happens if you eat five sour belts what happens this is what happens if you eat five sour belts tune in next week to see what happens when you eat six sour belts", "UgDQ0zsfvVY": "what's up guys thank you guys so much for the feedback on that video it was number one

in Florida hospitalized after eating marijuana infused candy apparently a student inadvertently brought the THC candy to school mistaking the product for a popular sour candy our chief health editor dr. partha nany joins us now with more on what happened and how those kids are doing now doc thanks Alan well first of all the students injuries were not life-threatening the kids were between ages 10 and 12 and were sent to the ER because they were having stomach pains but this is still a warning for parents who have edible marijuana products in their home if the packaging and the candy or treat inside resembles any products that kids are familiar with then they're more likely to see it as normal food and be tempted to eat it unfortunately these types of accidental poisonings are on the rise so dr. nany why does food prompt more overdose incidents well Glenda edibles often have several times the recommended dose of THC now t-h-e is this psychoactive ingredient in marijuana yet the edibles take a longer time to kick it me that you won't feel the effects right away so oftentimes people end up eating even more of the drug as for kids they can experience severe effects like trouble breathing loss of coordination altered perceptions panic paranoia and heart problems all bad things all bad things for sure doc so when kids overdose what are the long-term effects super important question Alan and honestly I don't have a good answer for you because acute marijuana exposure on children has not been systematically studied so there's no research or science findings regarding the full effects so it's super important that anyone who has kids in their homes keep edibles and all types of marijuana products out of reach and out of sight they should also be kept in child resistant packaging that also contains the the way so that it seals it conceals the contents rather so it can't be seen and please don't consumes the edibles in in front of the kids because we need to keep them safe we do dr. Nandi that's great advice thank you for joining us and if you a question or health concern for the good doctor email him dr. Nandi at ask dr. Nandi dot-com or send it to us on Facebook or Twitter we'll get it right to him", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "PfYE4KY2DxQ": "it's rolling up until morning is certified pothead you may notice a I'm not smoking right now I do got some super flame for you and you put it on spin move never gonna be doing a review of some dank gummies so without further ado let's jump to the close-up [Music] [Music] [Music] hi Burke owes me some other bird emojis flapping in the comments section as we take a look at the base edifice never look at these dang gummies these are peach rings now I'm already about to in um I wasn't smoking if you know video so I can tell you how they make the reef you just go ahead pop this third one it you know explain to you how to take all right Burke up these have a very decent peach scent oil you don't really get a cannabis scent coming out of them you know it's a very good peach and kind of sugar scent place papi can try to break down how to taste actually it [Music] coating very sugary when you start to break it open very nice peach flavors come - and it's actually a pretty good Pete very good peach representation like it almost tastes like biting into an extra peach [Music] not really picking up too much of the cannabis at first but starting to come through is still behind the peach flavor a lot but figured up on the very end of the taste as far as what I'm feeling right now three of these are 15 milligrams this is the third one out hat so same won't break that break down the third mini twenties they're almost 30 milligrams I've already a and it's a nice feeling nice body high relaxing everything on and you spiny gummies but I will say they do them a try you don't want to go just eating a whole bunch of them because it takes a while creme to uh jump in nice you start to feel the effects so you can easily overdo it but they'll be afraid these at will be real good I'm I definitely recommended that to Lamar come out there [ __ ] cuz [ __ ] bring buddy trumpeted but daddy what a comedown [Music]", "gFSm3tGZQgA": "hello iris Oh SOS here and today we've got some cannabis infused chuckles and some stoner patch dummies that have already opened people because more missus does my brain in and once not texturing but that's not over here nor there so let's have a look and so it's time to patch dummies I've opened up the red one and we've had a nice little looking side of it the textures absolutely bang bang swangs Wang you can taste the weed edits injuria but there's a real real strong taste of sweet sugary and then a kick of where these are very very nice one for you one for me I must admit these are very very nice next ones chuckled infuse gummy worms my mouth is watering to know that the oil want it though would you reckon they're just injected it or what or make them sour patch Tommy's oh wow I just finished to them mouth watering whoa let's have a look at these worms are saying then very tough taste better than the stone the patch dummies oh they're the winners involved at the choice at least two or go for chuckles the taste is more souvent and less explosive but if you do like your tangy bangbang and go for the sour patch Tommy's pleased our people I hope you enjoyed", "iD0D8AJl4tg": "i haven't filmed one of these yet so i just wanted to say that if you are not 18 or up please don't watch this video okay i'm gonna go hey what's up this is caoh and i'm miles and today as you can see from the title we're gonna be doing some edibles um just waiting on something to malfunction whether it be the lighting or something i don't know something always happens and i haven't actually sat and filmed in a minute because i've just been editing old stuff as i'm sure you guys know i just wanted to switch it up and sit and film i'm a little scared uh because it is going to be um 500 milligrams and i wanted to start off with at like uh 100 or so because i've already done edibles and everything but it's 500 sounds pretty scary to me um so we're gonna see how this goes i'm terrified low-key [Music] just a little bit i'm scared um even my girlfriend was like uh just please don't get sick it's just she flat out was like just whatever you do don't get sick and like and i have a story about it a time in which i did get sick from edibles but i'm gonna film a whole video on that debacle one day probably around the time when i'm at um the same amount of milligrams that i took that got me sick which was a thousand milligram situation so we're gonna lead up to that but for now right now i'm starting off at 500 milligrams um and i'm going to most likely be on 500 and 600 milligrams for a few of these um because like i said i do want to make it kind of a series but originally my thought was i wanted to start at 100 and build my way up and make a video for 100 150 blah blah blah um and then i also had an idea where i was going to do um like a mukbang situation and do a bunch of different ones i still want to do that um but i think um since i'm already starting off at 500 milligrams with this particular brand they have a bunch of different types of candies that i want to try that are also 500 600 milligrams so i'm probably gonna do this one and then just try them all and do a different video for each one that i try um but i'm starting out with the airheads extremes and the thing about it is i don't know if um do a little thumbnail i don't know if um this is made by the actual company like the airheads brand because nothing on it says any sort of um like fake candy name like um i'm trying to think of a brand but i can't think of one off the top of my head but like a lot of times with edibles usually when it's a candy it's like an off-brand kind of candy name and this one for some reason um it's just the straight-up brand so it makes me think that it is like made by the company and maybe the company just made you know edibles for adults um but i don't know that kind of seems a little weird that they would they would do that and not make it like a statement so i don't know if these are like illegal or like not illegal but like utility they're actually made by the company or not but either way i'm going to tap in and see if they are um if they look like the real candy because i did try a different one i can't remember what it which one it was unfortunately that's why i'm just gonna restart um because i don't even want to use the footage from that one um just can't remember what which one it was and i don't even think that we we got a lot of uh footage um but i i really want to remember i feel like i think i got i think i had gushers um and it did taste exactly like the candy um if i can find what whichever one i i did do i'll put in the clips from the one that i did to try because it's just a quick um because i just have a little bit of footage from it but i'm going to retry that one as well but that one did definitely taste like the candy so i have a feeling that this one will taste like the candy as well but um it's only one way to find out so i'm gonna get to opening it i'm pretty sure that yep when you open it there's a and then um just real quick i'm gonna show you the sides and what did all this says so it's a super potent formula which is scary 60 minutes activation which is really what we're testing the most i really want to know if it's going to activate in 60 minutes i feel like last time i tried it 60 minutes later i didn't feel a difference so um i'm really gonna time it and see so and then it says thc infused um i can't see but i'm sorry um this is thc infused air heads and then um yeah just a 500 milligrams per can and yeah let's get it open so [Music] and it looks like they do look just like the candy this is actually one of my favorite candies um so pretty excited to have it in the edible form see if it tastes the exact same so here is the first one which actually i'm gonna count how many there are so i got nine i was hoping that it would give me an even number but yeah so here's one and already it does not taste like um the candy there's not it's not bad just you can taste the wheat taste and i'm not a big fan of um when you taste the wheat taste and food stuff i like the taste of weed when i'm smoking and you can taste the flour um but i don't like the taste of weed and edibles or anything like that so that part's not too fun um well that was one and now here's two there's nine all together 500 milligrams all together it's hard to do i'm gonna fix the camera angle i don't like that i'm not where i'm supposed to be excuse me all right sorry we're back i just wanted to fix the way i was sitting at my heart said my face too much i couldn't see that's three other bit my thumb and that did not feel good it not hurts what the vibe so that's fun definitely a fun time for me definitely hurts i may need a moment i'll be back okay sorry so i did bite my tongue pretty bad but it was like literally in the very back on like my back two teeth get stung but i'm cool we're back for number four i believe yeah before there's five left after this oh i forgot to say the time if i just look and it's 9 22. so 10 20 i'll let you guys know how i feel i don't know if you guys could have just seen that i put a whole big chunk of spirit flew out of my mouth so you gonna talk with your mouth which is really hard when you're filming a video while you're eating and this is the fifth one i right this one one piece of hair there's just one one is to do it don't there whoa that's a challenge for real i don't have any water or anything with me i assure you i'm gonna go drink and eat some more food after this because 500 milligrams on a almost empty stomach is not an idiot and i'm not crazy um here's number six and i have to film the video right after and but i was so sleepy and i was like dude if you film this you're just gonna like knock out so like i just laid back on the couch and and i was like i'm gonna i'm just gonna lay here for like 30 seconds and then literally i passed out and it's funny because normally when i get home from work i'm super wide awake but today the day when i decided i was going to film i was so exhausted i couldn't keep my eyes open and normally i literally i can't go to sleep like i'm exhausted but i can't go to sleep because i'm because i need to smoke and stuff first and literally i didn't even need to smoke like i was like wow you're really that tired of course all right now we have three left two and watch down to the last one man they're definitely not they kind of have the same taste i feel like they are made like similarly oh that was kind of hard to say um but um if you look i don't know if you know what like the other ones are but the regular um air extremes are like super thin in comparison to these ones it's very hard for me to talk but like the stuff that's sticking to my teeth so i'm sorry all right that was nine of them so therefore i have now finished 500 milligrams so um i'll see you guys in about 60 minutes next time you see me i will not probably be in the same place because i'm gonna have to find a way to keep myself entertained for the next hour and not go to sleep which means i'm probably gonna have to go outside so see you in a second um so far i hope you were entertained um thanks for watching i don't know if i already said that um also i don't know how your day's doing but i hope you're having a good day and um don't forget that it's always a good day to get high i will see you in a second peace lastly i just wanted to add that the hardest part of this is going to be remembering that i took the edible for the next 60 minutes because i'm gonna forget that's that's how it goes i forget and then all of a sudden i'm gonna be like wait i don't feel this way and normally when we take edibles we end up like smoking right after or whatever so you can't even really tell if it's like the effects from the edibles or like because you're high from smoking and stuff uh but my girl's not gonna be home for a minute so i'm not gonna be smoking for a minute so um i'm only going to fill this i don't know it's good for you so what i feel like i already mentioned it but i'm upscaped um but it's too late turn back now it's in my body so if it doesn't go well it doesn't go well but i'm hoping that things aren't going to and badly there's only one way to find out though so peace so update it's now 12 13 and i'm not like smacked or anything we smoked a couple bowls right now and i felt more high from that that i was feeling so i don't know i'll keep you posted i guess um i'm gonna go probably smoke another bowl though i just wanted to go for a walk and see if maybe i would feel a little more late you know sometimes you gotta go outside but yeah you know the drill i can't do the piece because where i'm standing but i'll see you in a second all right so now i'm back home again and um definitely spacey yeah so so i want to do some sort of like test type thing where i have like different categories and i judge based on that with each nipple um so i could really test it you know based on like taste how high i get different things but i still have to figure all that out this is just like the first practice of like what i want to do with the videos so we'll see how it goes but definitely gonna make another video like this um i'm gonna try to figure out exactly how i want to do it um i want oh man i'm getting really sleepy that's for sure um i'm sorry i'm definitely getting really sleepy um and like it's hard for me to focus on what i'm saying so i'm gonna get ready to go um i feel like the video's probably been long enough i want i want you guys to get a bit of the aftermath it's just kind of hard because i also don't want to sit here and look stupid the whole time um and not keep be able to keep talking and stuff and like focus on what i'm saying but obviously i'm high so like it's kind of slowly getting all over the place but moral of the stories there's gonna be another one of these videos i'm gonna take a bong grip right quick and then i'm gonna say sayonara so one second all right now we're ready to smoke a little bit um just wanted to say before i do that um thanks for watching i'm pretty sure i already said that but just in case i didn't thank you i appreciate it if you want to find me anywhere else all that stuff is in the description and um i don't think i'm going to put any music in this one but still follow the music in the description because i'm still going to put my my friends stuff in there this is my brain trying to do the thing called thinking all right we're gonna get it which at this point probably is not the best option but i'm about to go to sleep anyways so i know like what a waste right to do all this just to go to sleep that's another thing i want to make another video where i do this again but like don't go to sleep after hopefully the next time hopefully the next time i do a video where um i take edibles i will uh stay up afterwards but like with the way my schedule is right now every day that i don't have work um i will have just got off of work so like if i don't work that night which is a good night for me to take an edible um i still worked that morning so like i'm still exhausted so i'm gonna need to go to sleep and if i were to take it like right after i went to sleep like i'm it's gonna mess up my whole like either way there's not like a good time for me to like be smacked basically so i'm just gonna go with it and like we're gonna do do what we got for now but obviously uh at some point or another i'm gonna take an edible and hopefully it'll be before the thousand milligram medical and i will not have to go to sleep after hopefully i'll be able to take one and then go somewhere fun obviously can't really go places right now so that's the other factor but hopefully i'll be able to go somewhere cool and chill after but you know what again rambling sorry y'all to be fair though like you kind of clicked on a video that was like gonna have me talking so i guess you kind of knew what you were signing up yep [Music] again still need to clean my body and um my dab stuff still waiting on it to get really bad so i can do a video on it so if you ever want to see that make sure you're subscribed hey i finally said some real youtube [ __ ] i was gonna say bye but i didn't play the pool i can't i can't play no games peace i don't know if i like my hat in the front i mean in the back i like my hat honestly this is the truth this is how i really would like to wear my head at all times this is why i wear hats since i was a youth this is all i've wanted peace i need this to be like my uh my thumbnail and like my icon on everything i'm ooh my id photo i want to put this on my license just when i get my license for the first time i'll just get it yes okay i'm gonna go i don't know why this makes me so happy okay goodbye", "y-UlV_CJ-NA": "i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less is more so we're 30 minutes in i'm just going to check back in an hour i've literally just been on i was let's say facetime but i'm in i'm team android right now so um yeah on video chat right now so um i've just been checking in but we'll see in 30 more minutes so at 2 35 we'll see if i feel anything um and then again at what's after 2 35 305 we'll check again um but yeah so i'm just going to keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little bit of a second like everything nothing's funny nothing's funny okay anyway what i was saying is i said i was getting checked back in at 2 35 it's 2 42 and i just can't stop laughing because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um since that happened it's just been like everything's funny i don't know how to describe it other than like get so lovey it's so weird because like i think i might be high but i can't i keep saying that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "NQuYFNRzhwA": "Welcome back to my channel TheCandyGuy where i talk about treats for the sweet tooth Today I'm going to talk about sour belts the sour belts that we carry here at the store are part of a larger group of sour candy called Sour Power and the Sour Power candy line has been in  production since 1985 Sour Power makes belts, straws, and other candies but here at the Penny Candy Store all we carry is the Sour Power Quattro and the Sour Power Pink Lemonade and these are the belt Sour Power candy is produced in the Netherlands and the US company Dorval Trading Company distributes it here in the US so thank you for that Dorval so the sour belt is a soft kind of gummy, licorice candy that is just covered in powdered sugar and.. and sour as well it's just the combination of the sweet and the sour is just a really good combination that you're not overpowered by sour taste but you're also...but you're you're getting that kick here and there but you're also getting a really good flavor of fruit flavors I really don't know what the Quattro flavors are, mixture, though anyways, let me take a bite these things are so good and here's the pink lemonade one same consistency just different flavor this one has a flavor, pink lemonade Quattro I'm still not sure what flavors those are Oh oh that one had a lot of sour right there I've had these belts a lot and for some reason that belt was one of the sourest, sourest, ones I've had. WOW! we sell the sour belts in little bags like this they sell like crazy and also in the candy canister I showed you earlier and they're our number one sour candy that we sell here at the Penny Candy Store and they're probably really high on the list of our most popular candy in the candy store but they come in bags like this three of them to a box and at the end when we're at the end of the thing there's always a bunch of sugar, powdered sugar and sour flavoring at the end and I always want to take a spoonful but I'm like that's crazy but I'm going to suffer for you guys I don't know why don't know why I'm doing this but anyways I'm not getting that much. I'm not that crazy but here's a spoonful well I learned something I always want to have a spoonful of those, the... granules that fall off the belt I found out that's where all the sugar is that means the belts themselves are where the sour flavor is stored good to know I like built up the hype in my head that I was gonna get this sour intensity and it was a big let down. Oh well. Thank you for watching this week's video of TheCandyGuy Links for the Penny Candy Store and myself will be in the description of this video I post videos every Friday so i see you all next Friday Have a sweet day.

infused with THC the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana now the candy was unknowingly handed out to more than 60 families at a food bank at the First Baptist Church in Roy this morning the church partners with the Utah Food Bank Fox 13 Sydney Glenn is in Roy tonight Sydney what are police saying about this well let's ask them ourselves right now I am live with sergeant Gwen and they are responding right the second you can see all of the officers behind me talk to me about the latest several children accidentally ingested this candy today yes a little after 3 o'clock this afternoon we were notified that a five year old girl was in the hospital for a THC overdose and we learned that the candy she ingested was provided to them through a Food Bank donation center here in Roy and so what you're seeing now was our officers are actively reaching out I believe it's 72 different families to make contact with them to ensure that we can recover as much as we can make sure those children who have ingested are seeking medical attention so you said to me earlier five children and told so far you have confirmed have ingested there's two of them in the hospital how successful have you been in reaching out to those families so we're looking at reaching out to 72 families and I think so far we've contacted I believe it's 44 families and we haven't been notified of any new victims probably within the last couple of hours let's talk about this huge response that you have right now for something that has never happened here before it's never happened here before and I can say probably for the first time in my career here we've actually called out half the department for an incident such as this you know and it's just a mistake and this is what it turns into you guys learned so far well we've learned so far that we need to be able to respond to these with haste to make sure that no other children are injured or two maybe notify those who aren't aware of what's in their donation that they need to be looking through them probably more carefully to ensure that this doesn't continue and we unfortunately have a bunch of volunteers who are trying to do a good thing and unfortunately this is what a yeah such an unfortunate situation I also spoke with the Utah Food Bank earlier today the CEO says she's just absolutely horrified about what happened the president and CEO of the Utah Food Bank said they were absolutely horrified that this product went out she went on to say she can easily see how volunteers would not have known what to look for a spokesperson for the agency said the THC candy donation came through a bulk commercial donation the CEO of the Utah Food Bank expressed her apologies and said they are changing their procedures to make sure this never happens again so if you are one of those people that did get that THC infused nerds rope you're asked to call the Roy City Police Department if your child has ingested that you should call the Utah poison control we have all those phone numbers for you on our website Fox 13 now calm for now live at the Roy City Police Department Sydney Glenn Fox 13 News Utah", "a3tV5SumzXI": "hey everyone it's james from fun foods and today i'm gonna show you how to make these homemade sour straws now this was suggested by one of my followers on tick tock matthew thank you so much for the suggestion keep watching and i'll show you step by step how to make these the first thing we're gonna do is boil some water now make sure you boil more than one cup of water because the recipe calls for one cup of boiling water and when you boil water some of it's going to evaporate so make sure you use more how much you use totally up to you so let's boil some water while waiting for our water to boil we're going to prepare our gelatin now i'm going to use two packages of unflavored gelatin just pour that into a bowl here and 1 4 cup of water this can be just room temperature water cold water really doesn't matter give that a slight mix through and we'll wait for that gelatin to bloom once your unflavored gelatin has bloomed what we're going to do now is add in some strawberry banana jello you can use any flavor you want that's the one i'm starting with and i'm using six ounces of this by the way the unflavored gelatin was half an ounce so our water has come to a boil now we're going to take one cup of that water carefully boiling hot water and add it mix this up until all that jello and unflavored gelatin has dissolved so after all the gelatin has dissolved next we're going to add in some citric acid this is going to give it that sour taste i got this on amazon i'll put a link in the description below now of course you probably don't need this much citric acid unless you plan on making a lot of recipes but i'll put the link down there anyway we're going to add two tablespoons of the citric acid to this mix it in now we want to let this sit until it comes to about room temperature it could be a little hot but we're going to be pouring it into plastic straws and if it's too hot it'll melt the straws next i have a glass here that is both thin and tall and the reason why is we want the liquid when it fills it up to go high as possible so if you have a wide glass you would have to get a lot more liquid we're going to end up putting some straws in just like this but we're not going to put the straws in yet i have seen people do that put the straws in first and try to fill the straws you don't need to do that when it comes to liquid because we can just pour the liquid in the glass like this fill it up really good and before we put in our plastic straws we want it to cool down a bit if we put it in there right now while the water is really really hot these plastic straws are going to melt and that's not good so let it come to room temperature or at least cool down a little bit once it's cooled down just take a handful of straws and push it all the way down just like so and that's going to fill the straws with the liquid and we're just going to let them firm up now before we pull our sour straws out of the refrigerator what we're going to do is i have a baking sheet here and in this baking sheet i'm going to put about a half a cup of powdered sugar just kind of spread it out and also about a half a cup of cornstarch and just mix this pretty good right here now just take this put this aside for a moment and bring out our sour straws now you can see it's on here pretty good i can't really just pull it out so i'm just going to take a knife and go straight down kind of loosen it up a little bit you can also run it under warm water that'll help loosen it up but because my glass is a little odd shape if your glass was even straight all the way through like that that would be fine but my glass it's not gonna come out that way anyway just be careful not to cut yourself and now running underneath some warm water for just about 10 or 15 seconds so this has proven to be quite difficult to get out it might work out better if you have like a disposable cup that you can just cut down the sides and get it out nice and easily so just something to think about all right it's getting somewhere let's see oh finally it did take a lot of work but we got them out now just run them underneath the water again and clean up the outsides of each one and now take these one by one i'm going to just clean it off with a paper towel just as we go and you just want to take your finger your thumb and kind of push these right on out onto that uh cornstarch and powdered sugar mixture after i completed them they're all done uh they were too soft so i let them sit out for a couple days and they did stiffen up a bit but i really not happy with the texture of the way they look or they feel so we're gonna start all over from scratch and just do it a little bit of a different way this time we're gonna use nine ounces of jello whichever nine ounces you want i have a six ounce package here and a three ounce uh so just take those put it into a pot then we have some unflavored gelatin this is going to help make it a little stiffer and i'm going to use five packages of this each one of these packages are 0.25 ounces so it's 1.25 ounces of unflavored gelatin then we're going to use our citric acid and we're going to use one tablespoon of citric acid give this a mix now we're going to add two thirds cups of water this is less water than it would take to make an actual jello package give it a little mix here and wait about five minutes for that gelatin to bloom so after five minutes your gelatin should have thickened up a bit like this bring this over stove we're gonna heat this up until it's back to a liquid state just heat this up until that gelatin has dissolved and when it's back to a liquid state now we can turn off our heat all right so after that's done before we move on to the next step i want to let it cool a little bit because i'm going to be using a plastic cup this time and of course plastic straws and if it's too hot it will melt the plastic cup and the plastic straws but don't let it sit out too long because we don't want it to thicken up now we're going to pour our liquid into our plastic cup here and that's good about 3 4 of the way up now we're going to put our straws in there i put rubber bands around here just to hold them together so it's not necessary but it makes me happy now put your straws in i'm gonna put this in the refrigerator just to speed the process up you can leave it out if you want but we'll make it quicker when your gelatin hardens nicely what we're going to do is run it over some warm water just to loosen it up and separate the straws just like before they're rather difficult to get out so i'm going to use a knife and cut around them i do like the firmness of this batch so that's good hopefully it's not going to be too firm to get out of the straws and this is why i use plastic just open it up like this and when it's out of the mold we're going to run it over some more water again and try to melt away this exterior now we're going to separate straws one by one now we're going to push them out into our cornstarch and powdered sugar mixture and hopefully they'll come out nicely we'll see so just take your thumb and push it out oh this is gonna be tough we may have to loosen it up with some warm water each one individually okay it's coming out all right and just coat it for the exterior coating we're going to mix 1 third cup of sugar and one tablespoon of citric acid now take a cold and damp paper towel that i wet it that rung out so you don't want it to be soaking wet you just want it to be completely wet and then wring it out real tight uh put that on a plate take our sour straws wipe off the excess non-stickiness and place on our damp paper towels take another cold damp rag and we're going to press on top of the ones there now one by one we're going to dip these into the sour solution there we go now it's time for the taste test i'm going to dig into one of the sour straws and see if it really tastes like a sour straw this is very soury and very good well thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed watching me make these homemade sour straws it was a lot of fun making these and thanks again to matthew who suggested this on tick tock if you

one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "ViokzN1PKHI": "you know so glass today I decided to do a video on some edibles that I cut from a delivery service here in town so this is stony patch it's a you know as you can obviously tell if you know if you've had sour patch kids the candies it's a fake version of sour patch kids so it's a sour sweet then stoned usually the real one is sour sweet then gone no I don't [ __ ] know sorry sweet don't let I don't [ __ ] know every but yeah and these are 350 milligrams as you can see I cop these for 20 bucks each those forty bucks for both of these I got these delivered pretty quick too in like 20 minutes so this is the first time I'm actually trying it and see you can see and yeah kind of smells like tree but I really don't taste it first so I'm not sure on me I don't do the math on how many milligrams of each edible blood smear try one hmm oh it tastes exactly like carpaccio and as umezaki heard that I've seen in other videos that either actually met little blocks mmm he's exactly like starter packages so but I'd like a little something off in the flavoring like tree I'm gonna taste good obviously I just can't believe this down to 250 milligrams and this whole time pseudo I hate this whole [ __ ] name look like sour patch kids are like dope like soaked hmm can we go see uh we'd like that going up he's really gonna give you smack last one and they look like the shape like the real thing I don't know more what you guys know how this [ __ ] is pause the video after this thank you", "oqTOlrF-lgQ": "what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video we're going to be making infused flamin hot cheetos now only RV is going to be absolutely amazing they are also the easiest recipe you're ever going to come across on this channel and it only requires two ingredients what you're gonna need some flaming hot cheetos tincture or infused butter or oil the first step is to spread out the cheetos on a baking tray if you're using tincture like I am you'll pour it into a little spray bottle I like this bottle because it does a really nice fine mist if you're using oil or butter you'll need to make sure it's warm enough to be liquidy and use one of these oil mister bottles like this I'll post a link for each of these items in the description box below now all you have to do is spray your Cheetos with the tincture or the oil if you're using the tincture you can just leave them out to air dry and they should be good after a half an hour to make them even stronger I'm gonna flip them all over and spray them again you can repeat this process and spray them as much as you like to get the desired strength just make sure not to use too much so they don't get too soggy if you're using oil or butter you'll need to put them into the oven for five minutes at 200 degrees I left my note to dry for about a half an hour and they're ready to put into bags now they've dried out they're ready to eat today obviously tastes amazing thank you guys so much for watching I hope you guys try this out if you enjoyed this video please give us a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe have a wonderful day [Music]", "L2EvOegVsN8": "hey guys welcome back today I'll be showing you how to make peach ring gummies I am including a recipe in this video but you can use any recipe you like you could even buy orange and yellow pre-made store-bought gummies and just melt those down and that will work just as well and this video is going to include some troubleshooting because I had quite a bit of issues making these I had to remould them multiple times I'm gonna show you guys how they started which was like this but eventually I got to them to come out like this here's what you're going to need 1/3 of a cup of water three and a half tablespoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below 1 teaspoon citric acid 1/2 teaspoons of peach flavoring oil 1 tablespoon of Tincher 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 a tablespoon lecithin white food coloring and yellow and orange food coloring the first step is to bloom your gelatin so just pour your gelatin over your dish of water as well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe also let me know do you guys prefer shorter videos that I don't include any troubleshooting or errors or you prefer videos like this where I kind of talk about things that can go wrong and how you can fix them let me know in the comments below", "JdISM7UWDaQ": "[Music] the matter one edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are not taking my advice and we are looking at a gummy edit pure for the first time we're looking at up here I've actually had people tell me that ed up yours is their favorite gummy and that is a gummy that is actually potent I guess be watch weights before you've seen in my other gummy reviews you know I find them a pretty lackluster to be honest I never really thought one to be as potent as advertised so I come to Ed appear with as cautiously optimistic as one can be excited but not overly you know I've got some reservations so this is a two hundred and fifty milligrams edible the watermelon belts from Ed appear it cost me I believe about about twenty dollars so it's an expensive edible expensive gummy edibles so hopefully that means it will be more potent as I said never had a head up here before I had had several different gummy brands so this is the first time they had a bunch of different gummies they're from Ed uh pure I picked up a bunch to do some reviews so look forward to those in the future and if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our abuse work is I'm gonna down this product here this time I think I'm gonna just gonna eat the whole thing in front of you guys cuz it's only five belts and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review how you feel not so much how it tastes so without further ado let's open this bad boy up and give it a taste and it looks like okay packaging is easy to open which is always nice so here we are here here's the little rainbow belt or the excuse me watermelon belt there are five of them in here each with 50 milligrams of THC or so they are as advertised here we go mmm that is rough those do not taste good there's a heavy we tasted that and guys if you will excuse me I forgot ahead of time as with all my gummy reviews I like to have a little bit of fat before I eat the gummies because I believe the fat is a good vessel for the for the THC to sort of be impacted in your bloodstream in your liver and so forth so uh if you excuse me for just a moment I'm gonna go grab some fat and I'll be right back I'm back with a spatula and some Nutella let's get some fat in me before I even need more of these gross OHS mmm now that is a good taste who doesn't like Nutella just gotta get a little bit more of me all right that's ingesting so you guys can see I will be ingesting these rainbow belts use me watermelon belts under optimal conditions now let's go ahead and eat a couple more here those are terrible Wow Wow it is like eating liquefied weed oh boy man that means they have potent okay guys well I am going to finish the last three of these here and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how these are feeling because that is the most important part of any edible review not the way it tastes but the way it makes you feel so guys with that I will see you in two hours peace guys it has been two hours since I had the head of pure watermelon belts and I'm not sure that they're going to change my opinion on candies or gummies but they are more potent than the infused creations or voodoo sours that I've had and reviewed in the past so that I definitely feel something so that is certainly an improvement over those it's still just not as potent as other 250 milligram a tea bowls that I've had just doesn't compare to tons of like brownies cookies whatever sort of in the confectionary genre but I do want to give better pure credit for being the most potent candy that I've had so far even if it's not as potent as it would be in similar milligram form and like a confectionery product and they taste it awful they tasted straight-up disgusting just just like weed I mean weed in a gummy form it was just really gross but again so if you really like gummies or candies go with the ED appear over infused creations or voodoo sours because these are definitely stronger for sure but for me I think I'm gonna stick with confectionaries however I do have a or at appear to review so we'll be sure to get those reviews out to you as well and let you know if those products are more potent than the watermelon belts until then guys thank you so much for watching wheat and we will check you out on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "a61vjUPxcFc": "hello senior stunt fans is the real senior stunner back at you today we're gonna be discussing powerful edibles this is non liquid mostly chocolate but let's talk about starting at the top with my WoW brownie remember edibles are to be used very carefully this in particular is some of the strongest edibles I've come in contact with the WoW brownie 500 milligrams bottom line even though it's not that big one bite and you got to put it down and wait an hour and a half two hours because I found it to be almost too strong so be careful with while brownies they're very strong mostly a sativa / hybrid on the upside there Delta which is a more traditional Delta nyan edibles this is a classic 250 milligram milk chocolate that for people it's scored into nine different pieces for people who just want to have it casually this one is much more intense for the experience usually this would be something even a beginner could eat into over here let's move on down to our pj butters assortment we have two today that we're gonna look at on the right is a traditional Belgian milk chocolate double dose with 300 milligrams that means you can take it to a movie or a concert pop it in your pocket it's real small look how small it is and it's very discreet here it is in Belgian chocolate with cappuccino flavor also PJ butter 300 milligram Sheriff with a friend please I bought this because I thought it was gonna be really exciting I'm looking forward to it this is a hive I've talked ilat Belgian chocolate flavor came a lot of different flavours what they do with this 400 milligram puppy is they score it they score at a number I think they score at 20 different pieces he bought you cut out a little piece for yourself and / - so you're in 40 milligrams apiece take two of those and you'll be very very happy let's move over to bang this is medical cannabis pretzel chocolate and this is one for one person that says double strength but for me 120 milligrams really is gonna be for me now I want to take this and go into detail the Wow 250 bar is made by the same people that make the Wow brownies and you have to be very very careful some reason I don't know what they're using on inside of their edibles because it doesn't tell me if it's distill it or cannabis oil for weed it's incredibly strong their brand let's move to something that I've experienced with I've tried the G bar before the 500 milligram buy lol edibles very tasty this is done really nicely it's a pretty package but it's also a very tasty bar because of that I purchased some 1000 milligram bars they're the same size but more potent so yesterday I attempted to take a piece of one of these were the day before oh my goodness I had a piece of one of these and I had a bite of the brownie no drink during the day and oh my god so I think what has to be said about edibles especially edibles with this type of power because these are really powerful animals is you need to go very slow and in small small pieces you're not like me don't think you are with edibles most people I've been doing edibles for a very long time if you have and you understand what I'm saying they can overwhelm you very quickly so you don't want to turn book could be a great experience and have it be a pain in the ass because you don't feel good so remember go slow but go bold or go home right this is a fine assortment of edible high potency edibles I wanted to take a look at from the real senior stoner everybody have a great day thanks taking a look", "nUlkBjwEBsc": "yo what is up guys that playing togar back here again welcome to another video man we're back filming back on my phone instead of the iPad my iPad is kind of [ __ ] out right now so it's whatever I can stick with the phone I like it a little bit better anyway west of the hassle so today's video guys I got a edible review my favorite edible it's the flavor X watermelon sour belt well they're not called sour belt but it's just built this is the packaging I would show you that apples inside and everything but I kind of ate it all and I'm just going to give you my experience and my review and should you get it get should you even you know try it out but before we start off the video man I do have a bowl loaded so I got some alien OGE loaded up we're gonna be using my big bong cuz the bubblers dirty and plus I keep knocking it over [ __ ] annoying but this is the only no G already took a bat rip and I put some fresh stuff on top but hopefully you guys are gonna be smoking along with me I was going to get hit on my babe but not today man so anyhow guys hopefully you're having a good day and yeah let's get this video started with uh take this first hit and hopefully you guys are smoking along with me if so let me know what you're smoking on cuz I'm always curious to know what you guys are smoking on um while watching the video and let's get dis sesh started man so Cheers so yeah guys so today we're gonna be reviewing the flavor X watermelon belt this is a 250 milligram package it contains with 10 belts each belt is 25 milligrams each and to tell you the truth it had really good taste really sweet it was a bit sour at times but one of the better gummies that I've tried and the California cannabis market like there but yeah man [ __ ] almost aired out here for a second but flavor axe is a San Diego company and I do live in San Diego so it's pretty cool hometown company at least that's what I was told Dendi the research but I know they do have a production factory down um down in San Diego though so you know I don't I don't know if they started up in San Diego that they do you have a factory here um and yeah guys like honestly best best tasting gummies didn't taste like cannabis at all like super sweet but it tastes exactly like watermelons didn't taste anything else I didn't get any weed back taste to it or anything like that um I I had to like the downfall though but like the downfall to it I had to eat a half a bag to really feel something but my tolerance is pretty high cuz I do smoke every day and I do eat edibles on more than a couple of times a week so I do have a pretty high tolerance so um if you're like a rookie like looking in on this like don't eat have the don't be a [ __ ] [ __ ] you know cuz you'll be [ __ ] throwing up and you're gonna be regretting it and you wouldn't like edibles at all like you want in try it and try one again after experiencing a edible overdose it's really shitty it's happened to my mom a couple of times funny enough but uh but yeah I don't don't be that a don't be that a smart guy that chased you uh eat half the bag or the whole bag and just think oh don't feel anything okay do not do not be a [ __ ] like that man that's all I got to say but yeah man like I really do recommend this product this is like a really shorter like video I guess not really but yeah like I read into everything like this time around I read the packaging there they are lab tested and they do follow the new guidelines for the edibles if you're an outsider that's not in California if you don't know what I'm talking about back last month June not July 10th or July 1st they passed a new law which is like the new phase going into the recreational and medical market for the cannabis market here in California everything has to be free packaged everything has to be lab tested and yeah there it's much stricter like compared to like Oregon like I see origin like they so have like they're so using the pill bottles now it's in fanciest jars and they give you in the legal dispensaries anyhow they give you a smelly proof bag and everything and it's child locked it's to prevent kids from it's to prevent [ __ ] the kids getting into the [ __ ] my cat [ __ ] tried to pop in the video popped in the video again so sorry about that but a dude come on this she's a dick anyhow yeah so it's really different here I've been kind of looking into like other states and stuff not really finding anything but just like comparing but it really does seem like California's a lot stricter with the whole marijuana thing compared to everywhere where else but yeah man honestly I'm gonna have to give the edibles a 5 out of 5 I'm sorry for kind of rambling on about the whole California cannabis market but I just to give you guys insight of like what's different and hopefully you guys learned something new about it if you're you were interested in knowing how the market was here but five out of five I would get them again and it was only 20 bucks - I did not mention that I only paid twenty [ __ ] bucks for this and hell yeah I would pay for it again cuz it's cheap I don't mind paying twenty bucks or something that gets me [ __ ] up like I'm pretty sure if I take like a month off like tolerance break man and and I eat least like I'm pretty sure like a half half a belt would get me pretty ripped but I do have a high tolerance and I don't know when the next time I'm going to be taking a tolerance break to be honest but but yeah guys I'm going to take one more rip and be out of the way the next video is going to be string review of alien og I might have that out later today or probably tomorrow which is I'm recording

your stoned is apparently made to look like the Los Angeles Lakers packaging I don't know if this is a kind of special promotion as I know edibles are illegal in California at least dukkha from a California dispensary right thing I live in Texas obviously this is not legal here I had a jump t-bucket hoops Duke Wireless paid way over the costs you guys would have paid in California I believe the selling price for this legally is about $15 whereas I had to pay 50 that's a serious inflation but I guess it is what it is some edibles education just start low go slow Stryper one serving start with a low dose or single serving product until you know how edibles will affect you wait edibles can take up to two hours or longer to take effect don't mix edibles should not be mixed with alcohol or controlled substances which is why I did not take these last night I would probably still be knocked out and you must keep these out of reach of children nobody wants your toddler running around high they are already annoying as it is imagine them high it's not to be fun for anybody not even the toddler the next item I acquired is the Nerds medicated rope super potent formula this [ __ ] has 400 milligrams of THC inside this entire row it says that 1/8 of it is 50 milligrams so like that much right there is 50 milligrams they thoughtful portions one a three rope 50 milligrams the

actually really had Jack here because people just talk out their [ __ ] that's odd Oh we'll go push it's [ __ ] mid grades because they're lying pieces of [ __ ] but this this is legit look at it his rolled side of a raw filter tip it was then dipped in clear and then dipped in Keef so here's everything I got in a legal state this would have cost you $60 inflation here so high I paid $180 sure

some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "0IIHUYmS4pA": "[Music] we both do the wavy drop lean to the left do the wave eBook wavy book do the wavy drop means the left do the wavy book on camera but it's toxic me people but we've learned today you'll see a video in a minute orbit will lit up and everything proper video and you'll see the guys that we're getting it off basically so it's pretty right I'm just little knackered at the moment because I thought I forgot about doing this as always like busy doing other stuff and basically no we're just doing this is like I'm feeling it follow us free so we've just back with another review top 12 elite pass through oh yeah might as well get it done it was meant to come out today so come out tomorrow well yeah well it is tomorrow now in it so yeah tomorrow so it will be technically today in like technical terms so we've got selector bores and there's two point tip of wax in each one of these so basically these are pretty strong we were speaking about it but we speak I speak so much on messages so I can't really remember what we've done of how my brain just goes on but basically what we're going to do is munch these and let you know the flavor the smell and the buzz and the taste well that's the flavour and basically appearance is well the parents so their parents are these they're wonderful texture they're squidgy for they're not sticky the insights promised to keep that a proper don't see about proper Chinese literally properties and there's not much for all that leaks out on your fingers there's not only you do get a lot of oil comes back out but yeah these should be right so let's try these that's a kick up resin that's nice this one some Apple you can really taste the resin taste that's the after note but linger in and back of the throat the resin definitely get a sour apple get a brilliant strong Apple and the sourness goes in with the resin so it's pretty nice you can taste the resin a lot in this that's what I do you find with gummies well jellies these jellies what we call them gummy personalty the soxhlet don't know if anyone else call some gummies these one here parrots on the inside it's like a darker color and the sender then the outside because there's looks like a powdered sugar or something on the outside something to stop it being so oily and sticky that's both of them down the hatch overall appearance and flavor appearance is wonderful that little noise is looking jelly sweets I've seen in a long time I've had a few that just don't move do you ever think on the tunnel like if I buy it myself and I don't think is good enough it won't go on eternal but if someone like its kind enough to help me out with something I'm going to the review but truthfully tell the truth and it can't just say oh yeah it's amazing what a way for you know gotta tell the truth gotta know a truthful review okay no I mean why is it gonna be a ship in view at the end of the day if you carry on doing the same thing and just go in yes what wonderful was wonderful people's going to buy ship products and people's not going to know about it even the people are not getting rid of it you know that's the way it's gotta be you gotta do stuff properly what I had done a video in ages because something happened I will explain on another video as you could probably see I've got a scar on my head yeah it's not the most nicest thing that happened but we're still carrying on with the YouTube we're still doing stuff and like I said before we're a warrior or a warrior like a proper soldier huh and that's the way it goes me no stopping me the only way I'm going underneath or cremated I don't [ __ ] know what anyone decides after I'm gone that's their decision not mine you know unless I'm [ __ ] making myself but yeah that's another video total different video it it is quite upsetting there will be a lot of graphic pictures and stuff so if you're not home if you got a weak stomach and [ __ ] up and you don't like gory stuff don't look I don't watch the video don't check it out but we just would run belong a little bit just to make the video up as you always do because edible videos they don't really go the longest as the reviews but yeah appearance it gets a 10 out of 10 definitely a 10 out of 10 appearance the flavor I reckon there could be more apple flavoring a little bit more up of flavoring so not too much so I would say for flavor it gets eight 8/2 flavor because the resin overpowers the Apple so much you can't really taste the Apple there is a strong apple taste in between once it starts warming up but it's not that strong because the resin off takes it straight away so it's hard to explain but if you know if I and you tried them then you know that it takes over a little tap it just might be different types of resin has different like flavors don't think so if it's not got flavor in it you to the flavor out and it's just the resin there it's going to be stronger resin content and other plants so it's just all down to preference you know but I give it a 8 for flavor the smell on it it's amazing it's like a really like a pearly smile you've got a sweet sugary smile as well and you couldn't really smell the resin in it at all so no one would really know this but kind of is enough by the smoke as soon as he bit into it it was Noble so it's one of them ones but yeah it's a really nice thing for the smell I can't remember why I said if I said something before but for the smile I would say it gets a 9.5 because only because only because basically like I said with the Apple it'd be nicer to smile more Apple same as the taste nicer to taste more Apple but other than that it's literally a really nice smile taste and appearance in one yeah what we're gonna do is come back in about an hour's time maybe probably just just over our because we've had food it's really but had Artie you never think but it probably digested right now I don't know it's really slowly still digesting so we'll give it about hour and a half to two hours and we'll be back with you guys letting you guys know the buzz how we're feeling and everything like ins and outs of exactly how I feel anyways hope you enjoyed all of the latest videos we haven't got much strain reviews das been coming up now we're just getting back all into everything again we was just like trying to spend a bit of time at the family and try to just do different things and focus myself and it didn't work and well it did so and then I got [ __ ] over by some body you know but yeah basically there's gonna be a lot more reviews coming up now I'm focusing on my youtube focus on me and just shocking it when I Soph so yeah anyways see you guys in about two hours and related to know the bus and how it all goes peace guys say these guys went back and basically left it just a little bit over two hours feeling nice and mellow hi we are in Dublin and Kristen's Pistons we've got lower the different refuse and stuff like that another make you know was in some way tolerance levels are going to be very high at the moment so it's a big a difference if you are a beginner and you've got high tolerance you know but I am feeling quite high time for a beginner you'd be what to help you would be sleeping I nearly and nearly for what lying down I didn't when I stayed awake so that's why it's a little bit labor as you can see the eyes are puffy but my eyes they went [ __ ] they went red for a stage and I hardly get red are so that's when you know this is good material it's strong for me and if you're strong for me it's going to be strong for someone not don't use on every day I use it every day and I mean a lot of cannabis products just to calm down the anxiety etc if you wonder why the headphones on basically I'm playing xbox of normal but the Xbox controller Bobby got me Xbox on a ps4 I used to like this - but ps3 and ps4 [ __ ] up that's death but yeah I'm feeling quite nice and mellow and it's a steady where our first it it started creeping peaked off and now is slowly dropping back down so is it's nice there's no nice feeling but yeah why will recommend is trying some of the jelly sweets definitely you send the sticker anyway I made sure up a lot in the name was on the top of the sticker so you guys see all of that anyway but yeah thanks to the extractor person that gave me this and the person has got all the edibles I try Maroubra I love a size medium this is so they could just lit up but main things is the buzz I would rate it out of 10 personally me I would say Oh a 9.5 again is not 100% at the point that I would like but this is pretty good you know so it gets you on the shoulders it makes you feel a bit like what we had it as I would class you know when you've got different alcohol beverages and you've got different stages when you getting drunk basically this is more of a tipsy instead of being totally pissed or smashed like your face you know it's on the verge of getting to the point of near enough there but a tipsy feeling in stoned version this is a stoned tipsy feeling as I can explain it that's what I like it's bringing it a lack of comfort I like putting it to the equivalent is alcohol because at the end of the day it should be really alcohol kills more people and this doesn't so if it makes people more happy in life why not have it on the shelves and legalize it or decriminalize it will do whatever whatever just have it so we're not getting done for this this plan it's just a plan and loads of people at the moment we're getting done with very stupid remotes so come on please just wake up no one in the government at the moment or really understand it certain people are but these are like saying certain things and then we've kind of dodged them like basically yes or I've seen certain things but doing others is a different situation but this is a really nice edible really nice taste really nice smell appearance and was as you can see if I can hardly speak currently talk so and if you can't really hear me the best is because I'm doing in a different place as you can see so it's in my chest like in the center of my room so I can do the communiques I tried to a few things I need to

from those lol edibles companies 300 milligrams I thought this was cool it actually says the strain so ya know to pop these open and check them out I notice there's some stuff here that isn't filled out but I almost think this packaging is in preparation for next year when it when cannabis is actually legal so anyways we'll check him out that's a new strain for me I've never heard of that Pablo Escobar ROG so yeah we'll open these up and take a look okay so the first thing I noticed immediately after opening this is the smell he's just incredibly strong really smelled like weed it's not gummy it's like one one big whoa I thought it was one big piece okay so it's a bunch of little pieces my mom like they're really sweet with a little bit sour on them I don't even taste the herb just working to really smell it it's crazy that's what they look like and I will eat these and get back with you in an hour or so [Music] yeah died within an hour so once the party started and didn't let you know how they are someone be there okay so it's only been about 20 minutes in but so like I said I'll check back in with you here in an hour I just wanted to say that I can feel at least the start of those kicking in 2025 minutes after eating and that's pretty quick longer them than other people so we'll see goes on these I'm used to taking like 250 milligrams like taken for her dose and those said 300 so should be pretty close to what I'm used to stick let me get that in through the end a minute there's been a few okay so it's been a little more than an hour I was waiting to see if it was kicking and any more than I did so it seems like I don't know if just the strain doesn't do it for me or if the milligrams are incorrect or off I don't know but I felt a little bit of an effect at the beginning of eating those and and then nothing after that so I don't think I would buy those yeah cuz I've tried another animal at like 250 milligrams they work for me for may have something to do with the gummy the gummy stuff maybe maybe there's those double digest as well for me or it affect me as well but it seems like the baked goods that have butter and then really affect me whereas these gummy things with just the extract I don't really feel it where I don't metabolize so anyways just one of the way I know my take on those those sour gummies that had the Escobar og from lol lol animals wasn't wasn't one I would buy again but that's okay it was a freebie so it's good to learn now I rather than actually paying for one you don't like there you go thanks for watching hope you liked it", "yK4OR0yt0rg": "what's up everybody my name is Sarah P and welcome back to the haze today I'm coming at you with another edible review today we're gonna be doing the spicy chamoy sweeter high gummy is now sweeter hi is a company I believe based in California they do a lot of different products I think they do like vaporizers edibles so on and so on on their website I couldn't find too much information on them specifically but they say they specialize in high quality lead which I think all these companies do anyway at this point these guys are the 300 milligrams on the packaging and it does not tell you which how much milligrams is in each candy strip which is the hard part but on the back to tell you the nutrition it has lots of sugar so if that's something that concerns you be aware of that but they are very very delicious let's just go into opening them they have one of these on them not one of those child safety loved ones again they don't tell you how much milligrams they're in each strip but here is one of the strips now I personally don't like sour candies I don't have a high tolerance for sours but if you do you will absolutely love them they're very similar sour points you like sour patch kids those aren't these are for you I'm sure these are gonna be good the spiciness too is also not overwhelming and if you're not really into spice this won't really hurt you it's gonna be like comparable to like those little sweet Mexican candies with the spice around it those those are the most similar to these other than the sour being like obviously really overwhelming for me this flavor on these guys are really really good I haven't tried the other flavors but the spicy and the sweet the combination is super super nice the high so for me from those guys you do get high I wanted to say that it feels like 300 milligrams I ate an entire pack of these in one day and it felt like probably like a hundred and fifty so I don't know who does their testing but yeah it's definitely if you're looking for 300 milligrams this will be a little bit of a fall short but if you're looking for 150 labeled 300 this is for you it was not overwhelming high either I didn't get those little butterflies feelings in my tummy I just started a little giggly I'm always feeling the loose and then I fell asleep which is a thing I gotta say about edibles they will make you knock out I fell asleep like 7 p.m. and woke up at 11 so if you want to sleep these are a great sleep aid honestly um I don't know why they didn't get me super high and just made me sleepy usually both come together but I don't know maybe way to hit me or maybe it was what I was doing that day but yes these will make you sleep won't make you get extremely high won't make you get paranoid will make you get in your head but if you're looking sleep these guys are a great option also for smell wise in my last standing a video a lot of people are wondering about the smell I get no THC flavor no THC smell but if you're looking for something and that can be really hot on the low somebody can take in public something that you're afraid someone might smell it in your backpack person like that you won't get this with this this you don't smell any THC no oil nothing even in the flavor you couldn't you couldn't tell the difference between this and a regular candy to be honest so yeah if I was you and I saw these guys at the dispensary it's 300 milligrams I got these for 15 bucks I would get because oh I I'll be honest a lot of these kind of packaging a lot of these kind of candies I don't pick up when I see they don't seem to hit very well for me they always seem to be disappointing but these guys were actually something I have now revisited this is the second time I bought it and I didn't I don't regret it I think they're they're they're fun so if you want something a little bit different you're tired of cushy punches you're tired of lemonade's you're tired of the whole shebang you guys see the speeder hire any other gummies I'm sure they're all the same I would pick it up so again my name is Sara P thank you so much for watching the haze please follow us

you guys today listen in the pursuit of life sometimes we run into bumps along the road the bumps vary in size and severity sometimes it's a little tiny pebble in the road and sometimes it's a giant [ __ ] boulder like for instance if you were hiking and you got hit by a giant [ __ ] boulder we're doing our best alright and sometimes things don't work out the way we would we would prefer today is one of those little interesting conundrums that we run into every now and then in our lives and it happened to me I ran into a bit of an issue so sit back relax and let's talk about how I once accidentally drugged myself with the largest edible I've ever eaten last February for all the coronavirus garbage happened I traveled to Los Angeles for spring break and one of the things that I had to do was I had to sign a [ __ ] ton of posters for u2's there was probably more than three thousand posters that I had to sign and the posters were being kept at the house at The Misfits YouTube group were staying at in LA Carson was there Schlacht was there Cooper's there we were all just trying to like sign all of these posters as fast as we could because there's so many of them and it was take us it was taking us literally hours to do at this point there was maybe about five or six people in the house at this time and that's because at that point the whole main misfits crew had gone out to dinner somewhere I don't know if you know this about the misfits in general but they smoked a lot of weed every trip they do they probably spent a couple thousand dollars on weed okay they smoked the mary-jane they do the weed in order to make the process of signing these posters go a little bit smoother I had smoked like half a joint of weed so I was already decently high because I hadn't smoked in a while either sign in a way crossing my eyes Dodd might ease however my personal reaction to weed is that I get the munchies I get the munchies pretty hard I smoked a little bit of the mare Lona and then I say oh I'm gonna eat an entire sleeve of club crackers with no cheese because gluttony I originally planned to go to dinner with my girlfriend and her father so I was trying to wean off of the hi and just kind of sign the posters and wait until it kind of wore off and then I would go and do that one of the things that they had at this house was they had a giant counter in which a bunch of snacks were all laid out there was chips there was more chips there was I think pizza I don't [ __ ] remember as I look across this horizon of bountiful snacks I see a nerds rope and my monkey brain is like oh and I'm thinking to myself man I remember nerds rope I haven't had nerds rope and [ __ ] forever dude I'm thinking back to my childhood where we would go to a campground in Maine and I would wattle on down to the snack shack and grab myself a nerds rub and before eating it considering its potential applications as nunchucks or trying to tie a knot with it but then realizing I'm a kid I don't know how to tie knots and my prefrontal lobe won't even be done cooking for another 20 years so what's even the point give me a slush puppy give me a Game Boy SP let's [ __ ] it up but lord have mercy did I learn in this moment I no longer was a child but a man a man who experiences consequence in the worst way possible so I'm signing more posters you know I'm cruisin I'm having a great time all right nerds rope tastes a bit strange but that could also be my perception that I have of being already high and it's kind of you've ever been high before it kind of messes with your perception of taste a little bit it was like drinking a diet coke versus a normal coke where there's like you know there's something there there's something there but I don't fully process why it tastes different so I finished the Nerds rope and then I go to have another nerds rope because I'm high and have the munchies as I'm biting into the next nerds rope one of the misfits guys says Ted don't eat those those are edibles hmm sorry I said I'm back I must uh I must have heard you wrong um scusi yeah Ted that's inedible so I say no [ __ ] way how much was it he says I think I think it might be like 60 milligrams what 60 milligrams to give you context the largest edible I'd had up until this point in my life was 20 milligrams so of course I asked are you sure one of the guys walks over to the counter and picks up the package of the Nerds rope and with the most you are [ __ ] face I've ever seen in a person he says it's actually 400 milligrams now remember I've already freaked out when I heard that it was a 50 milligram edible and I've just been told that it is actually eight times that amount so you may be asking yourself Ted how the [ __ ] did you not know that that was inedible and that's a good question let's start with the packaging that's the packaging it uses the same packaging as the actual branded Nerds rope it's got a thing that says Terran share as if it's just a normal candy in hindsight that's very much so implying for a good reason that you really should be sharing it and not eating it entirely on your own if you're not really paying attention and it's been like eight years since you had a nerds rope this is pretty easy to mistake for a nerds rope in addition to that there was a very specific and deceptive way that everything was laid out as snacks in the misfits house and I'll just let swagger CIL's explain that for me there was a very reasonable way like we set it up because the Nerds rope was inedible it's a 400 milligram edible and he didn't read the packaging but we have on that bench it's a big-ass bench it's snacks and food chips Pringles gummy bears all that [ __ ] munchies and then there's weed food which is edibles in between that and the weed which makes sense like a spectrum dangerous that's the thing is that it would make more sense to kind of put the weed food away so that you don't confuse confuse you've ever been in a car crash even if it's not your fault there's a certain feeling after it immediately happens it's this mind racing feeling when you have absolutely no idea what to do but you also know that something has to be done or you're [ __ ] aka panic so at this point I begin to freak for three reasons first of all I didn't know if I was personally prepared mentally to get as high as I was about to get second of all I had made plans for dinner with my girlfriend and her father that night and I definitely won't be making it and I'm pretty sure she's gonna be a little bit pissed and the third reason I hadn't smoked weed in two months which meant that my tolerance was rock-bottom I like to explain this with what I like to call the skyscraper analogy right here we have the tolerant skyscraper which represents my tolerance to marijuana let's just say that whenever I smoke weed I started the ground floor in the lobby if my taunts were higher then maybe I'd go a couple stories up to the mid-level apartments that's where all the stoner kids from high school hang out and they're all pretty high up there but it's nothing really to be worried about you're probably couch locked but you'll be fine with my tolerance at zero though I knew in my heart and my soul that I was going all the way up to cheech and Chong's [ __ ] penthouse as an unwilling and unexpected guest for an undetermined amount of time as things stand right now I don't even live in the building I'm from out of town and I sometimes commute into the city oh it's a Friday night oh we should go we should go get drinks in the city that's the that's what I'm operating on I know that I'm on a timer most edibles take about 45 minutes to an hour before they kick in but I know that I've taken this edible about 10 to 15 minutes prior which means math I've got about 45 minutes before this edible hits me and I died although other things can affect this such as being on an empty stomach which I was my first thought was that I need to make myself throw up because if I can get rid of as much of this edible as possible I could potentially mitigate the level of inebriation that I was about to experience so I stumble over to the bathroom and I start to gag and I'm trying to make myself throw up but I've never made myself throw up before I don't know how to do it so the next step is that I got Carson on his phone looking up how to's on wikiHow on how to make myself throw up and then Cooper's in the kitchen and he's making cups of saltwater for me to chug because apparently if you chug saltwater it helps with the throwing up process I'm not sure how true that was it just ended up with me just throwing up a bunch of pinkish salt water so I can't speak for its effectiveness but there you go and I'm pretty sure since the Nerds rope was sort of a candy sugar based food it was really easy for my stomach to digest it really fast so I'm pretty sure if I hadn't thrown it up within maybe five minutes there really wasn't that much that I could do from there so by the time I was done throwing up some food that we had ordered earlier arrived and Cooper basically advised me that the best thing that I could really do for myself would be to just fill my now completely empty stomach from this point on all I could really do was buckle up strap in and get ready for the [ __ ] high of a lifetime god bless my soul [Music] so I'm gonna give you guys a walkthrough of what this high was like it wasn't fun I also have some video footage that Cooper took so link to his channel in the in the description once I kind of came to terms with the fact that I was gonna have to ride out this high no matter what I decided to give myself a home base just somewhere where I could ground myself and not really need to worry about moving around or anything I found myself a nice armchair and I sat myself down there and prepared for the ride of a lifetime the first thing that happening was a classic weed symptom which is cottonmouth which is when your mouth gets really really dry so I was pretty much just constantly drinking water I remember starting to get colder and The Misfits they had a room where they just had a bunch of extra merch laid out where they could just give that to friends and stuff while they were in LA and I kind of just walked in there and just threw on one of the sweatshirts and then just went back to my home base and sat down and I was wondering for myself if that cold symptom that I was experiencing was real I did research on the symptoms that I was experiencing and this was something that actually happens informally it's referred to as weed chills the THC literally lowered my internal body temperature so I actually was getting cold another thing that happened and I think this also might have been a symptom of being cold but I started getting shaky and it's really funny the way that I described that when I was high and I actually have video footage of that right here welcome back it's gotten worse friends we are it's been about 45 minutes since last and bad okay I think you need another stick of butter I feel like my entire body feels like rubber bands pretty much after that point was when things started to get um they started to get bad the shaking was also the reason why in the video you can see me clasping my hands together because I was literally like shaking so much that I had to hold my hands together really tightly and keep my body really tight and close so I could be in like a comfortable state and then I get into what is called the painful zone or the first level of weed hell pretty much any position that I was sitting in felt painful don't do too much weed I was in the pain hotel and I was its only guest any surface that I touched whether it be the arms of my chair putting my hands on my knees anything like that just felt bad and what I think I would attribute that to is just being so high my sense of touch was just so elevated that my brain was just overloaded or something most of the time I was just trying to like breathe deeply and kind of maintain my composure but whenever Cooper would turn the camera on me and he would start recording I would sort of like try to elevate my attitude and try to seem as cheery as possible because I didn't really want to seem like an idiot hi stoner on camera you know at a certain point I had to move my home base because it was too disorienting to be sitting straight up I had to go and get [ __ ] horizontal baby I pretty much had to make a mental agreement with myself just to survive is it just pure pain now that's what you hate to hear it was during this time of unbearable dizziness that my good friend Schleck decided to use a [ __ ] handheld massager on me I'm just getting the lactic acid fun I just want to get the juices I just want to get the juices flowing if you please organism do you see my attitude there I wonder why I wouldn't like that a rapidly moving massager if you want a lesson on what not to do to someone when they're high that really takes the cake eventually the fateful moment happens I had a weed barf I honestly think it was really just because of how dizzy I was getting from being high and luckily for me I had a whole sandwich about an hour ago I literally had to run across the entire room and just run into the bathroom and throw up after I threw up though that's pretty much where the high took the downturn now it was cleansing I had it was a cleansing barf yeah it was uh it was detoxifying I went to go eat some skittles but without even knowing I was on camera I went around to people and not trusting my own ability to determine this I asked them if the skittles were edibles or not I ate the Edible at about 6:30 p.m. that day and I stayed awake all the way until about 4:00 a.m. that night I woke up at about 9:00 a.m. and I was still very high but I was definitely a manageable amount of hi what struck me though was I was high for the entire next day I went to bed that night hi so in total after eating a 400 milligram edible I was high for about you know 26 hours if there's one thing you guys shouldn't take away from this is like any anti weed sentiment from this video I think weed is a perfectly healthy drug to use recreationally but we'd like everything else follows the rule that too much of anything is definitely a bad thing obviously only consume weed in a state in which it's legal and if you're of age I hope you guys enjoyed this video let me know if you want more stories from my life I don't really know how many stories I have to tell this is like the second one I've ever told on this channel but I hope you learned a thing or two and if there's one thing you should take away from this it's this weed is for sinners and I'm going to help [Music] ped accidentally took 400 milligrams of edible", "UcQnm95hO0o": "[Music] hello what's up today I'm going to be doing an edible haul because I just stopped up like crazy but first a DAB or three probably three [Music] this is actually one of my favorite strains it's called the green crack the flower is super good it's a set to you but I think right now it's a whack so you can't see it sorry [Music] [Music] I think I'm gonna do one more because those last few hits sucked okay now I'm ready I just look like that meme have y'all seen yet the cat where they said that's how little kids cough because that's me that's how I cough anyways onto the hall so this is our little goodie bag actually this is a really big goodie bag and then we're actually gonna start on this cuz this didn't fit in the bag it's called give me some mores it is a marshmallow a chocolate-covered marshmallow with graham crackers on it it's by hon ooh there's ten pieces ten milligrams each so 100 milligrams total those are hopefully gonna be good I'm not a big fan of chocolate really or at least THC chocolate just because I feel like with like brownies cookies and chocolate you can taste the weight a lot more and when I eat an edible like of course I want weed in it like THC but I don't want to taste it I want to just be like I'm eating a snack I think that's the point of an edible or maybe not I don't know that's not the point of it but they're better to me when I really just taste like a regular food but then [Music] it's you hard anyways I wanted to try belts for so long I don't eat candy generally but I really love those sour airheads the belts are the strip's whatever the extremes I think is what it's called are having out of it forever but those are my favorite candies and I found these I don't want their sour but these are mango belts there's ten pieces two milligrams each oh they are sour sour ribbon candy and then I got the rainbow belts which hopefully are similar to the extremes lemon strawberry and Apple and these are by Flav I've never had this brand so I'm gonna have to look them up but excited and then I don't know if I mentioned the chips that I got from blue roots cannabis but they were nacho cheese and they were so good they taste a lime Doritos they were better than Doritos and I got him again they had four different flavors BBQ sour cream and onion ranch and nacho cheese and all four they were a 30% off they were only like four dollars I got yeah I got to barbecue these are a potato chip let me read what it says potato chips infused with barbecue seasoning sauce and a Southwestern mix of herbs and spices the nacho cheese ones tortilla chips seasoned with cheddar cheese and a zesty blend of Latin spices and herbs the reason I say that they're better than Doritos is because they have these little spices I don't know exactly because it just says Latin spices maybe it says yes chili pepper paprika and cayenne pepper is probably what makes them taste better like I said in my video about me I like spicy food so maybe that's why I like these more than regular Doritos these are the ranch these are don't eat chips seasoned with a blend of ranch seasoning paprika salt garlic and onion delish I bet these are like Ranch Doritos cuz they look just like it then the last ones are sour cream and onion potato chips with the dollop of sour cream and dusted with savory onion and garlic seasoning these all look pretty good the nacho ones like I said 10 out of 10 I keep talking about them but I can eat those as a regular snack and not know that they have lead in them [Music] they have a little kick whole bag is 10 milligrams so it's sort of a lower dosage because you got to eat like all the chips but they're good then the last atta boy I have in the sugar packets these are by hot sugar which is a fat Panda company fat Panda is pretty known over here they have like edibles flour all of that there are 10 packets 10 milligrams each the guy at the pawnshop said you can put it on peanut butter and jelly and your coffee and your juice really like anything so I'm excited to try these I don't know what I'm gonna use them with but I guess you'll see the retie about all of those edibles is because me and my husband are going to Cape Flattery which is the most northwestern part of the continental USA so that's exciting we have to take a ferry and everything it's going to take us about four or five hours to get there so as you can tell by the title of this video I am going to eat twenty ten milligram edibles I have ten packets of the sugar which I'm going to put in and then I'm going to taste test the other ten edibles that I got in that hole [Music] [Music] I actually just realized I forgot how [Music] [Music] they live [Music] [Music] [Laughter] crack cocaine [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to collect you [Music] [Music] really excited to try these [Music] [Music] [Music] as I said before I took 20 edibles ten where the THC sugar packets to chips for of the rainbow sour belts two of the mango belts and two of the chocolate marshmallow things my honest opinion on them was that they were really good none of them really tasted like weed so that's a big thumbs up on them on all those brands both of the chips were really good because like I said before I would eat those just as normal snacks definitely recommend those as a lower dosage of edibles to start out with the sour bills were good the main goal lines in the video you probably saw me make a really funny face it has a weird aftertaste but the mango ones do taste like Mexican candy so that's good it might have just been the taste I was in my mouth at the moment but I don't know it was really bad the rainbow ones were good they tasted just like the extremes the chocolate-covered marshmallows were super chocolaty I had to wash my mouth out with a lemonade really good because it was a lot of chocolate which I personally don't like that much but it was pretty good the THC packets I really couldn't taste them I just felt like I was drinking a regular old toasted white chocolate mocha as far as like what I was doing we were in the car for almost five hours so I just played on my phone I played a fun run I talked to my husband I was really sleepy then once we got to Cape Flattery we did the trail which was about two or three miles I really don't remember but it was fine the view was really really pretty [Music]", "MFaPHr_4qy4": "[Music] I'm picky I'm off

bakers so today i'm going to be showing you guys how to make your own diy infused nerd ropes so if you haven't already follow me on instagram at daverny freeman i will be doing some giveaways so you want to follow me on instagram that's where i announce all of my giveaways and if you want to be a young young young young guy go ahead and hit that subscribe button and the notification bell so let's jump into the video so this is everything you're going to need you're going to need some heavy duty aluminum foil it doesn't really have to be that heavy duty you can go get the 99 cent one whatever fits your grip baby so i'm gonna use some aluminum foil and with my aluminum foil i'm just gonna place them on a flat uh surface and you you will be putting this inside the refrigerator so boom pow now what i'm going to do is i like to create my own little mold i don't know if you guys want to go on amazon to see if they have these molds but i know a lot of people were saying they could not find any nerve rope mold so you really have to do them by hand so this is what i'm doing now i'm just making my own little molds which is just popping the aluminum foil up a little bit so it can have this barrier in between the two i'm doing that on each side so that's what i'll be doing right now [Music] and you guys do want to be careful when you're making your little liners because this is aluminum foil and it's easy to kind of tear through them [Music] so you guys i prefer to reuse these package this the packaging that comes with it so i ain't i'm not gonna buy normal packaging y'all don't play with me we're just gonna reuse these packaging what you do is you take where it's sealed all at either end of the rope and you kind of open it up like you will a bag of chips it's very easy to tear so you do want to take your time to open up the seal and once you open it up there should be a like a little cardboard against against the seal and you put your fingers in between the cardboard and the foil and you gently slide your fingers down in order to tear the packaging apart so that's what i do i do that then i set it aside and i take some nerds now this i do this all the time so i have additional nerve ropes and nerves in there and i like to take the nerves off of the rope which is very easy um so i don't have to buy a thousand boxes of nerve ropes yeah i mean i'm nerves when i could just use this now that you have separated your gummies from the nerves you're going to place them in a heat safe microwave safe bowl and place them in a small one i do recommend doing small batches at a time because if you do so many it's going to be kind of hard to control it so now you want to take your infused coconut oil i like to use liquid coconut oil instead of the coconut oil that goes back to solid and you want to use your tincture i'm using my eva clear tincture that i already infused with your cbd and they're going additional box of nurse just in case i need them but i don't feel like i will it's just whatever floats my boat and you also want to get yourself some type of piping bag or you can get a a condiment um container i think a ziploc bag is cheaper well not really cheaper but it's it works for me and i do reuse these so it's not like i throw them away because i know i hate plastic now i'm taking my coconut oil and i'm just coating this ziploc bag with the coconut oil if you do not want to use your infused coconut oil you can definitely use pam to coat this bat this ziploc bag but i'm saying if you're going to infuse something why not have everything be infused you get what i'm saying you're going to share but yeah so i'm going to do that and i'm also gonna do the same thing to my aluminum layers that i made my little molds because if you do not it will stick i don't care what anyone says in my i've been making these for forever in a day and they will stick if you put them in the freezer you put them in the refrigerator you will have pieces of aluminum stuck to your gummy now you looking at like a food like you're in third grade with goat with with aluminum foil in your mouth like it goes so yeah that's what you want to do just make sure everything is evenly coated then move on to the next step [Music] all right you guys so to my two rope gummies and six additional gummy bears i add half a tablespoon of infused coconut oil just to give you guys some type of starting point but this is definitely a trial and error type of situation so as you guys i have my tincture right here and i'm going to use five milliliters which is a teaspoon of t-shirt and i'm placing it to the side in a condiment disposable condiment container because i wanted to be you know on hand and you guys also saw that i had my liquid lecithin next to me just in case i'm going to need that as well so you want to take your rubber spatula or you can use anything that you're going to throw away i like to use this silicone rubber spatula because i could just wash it off and reuse it now i'm making sure that everything is evenly coated and i'm going to put this in a microwave for 10 seconds and it's going to look like this now i'm just stirring this around to make sure that my oil and gummies are combining together i microwave it again bring it back out stir it around and as you guys can see a little bit you see how they're the gummies in the oil is not coming together so what i'm doing is just trying to stir it a little faster and a little harder just putting a little bit of elbow grease into it to see if it's going to combine together and once it does as much as i would like for it to at this point i'm going to add my tincture to this i only add a half of the teaspoon into this at this time because you can always add more you really can't take it away so that's why it's super important to do this in small batches so you won't gotta worry about anything but as you guys can see the oil really did combine well with this so now i'm going to go ahead and add that t-shirt and do the same steps stir it around kind of be careful because it will splat it out okay y'all see what i'm saying i told y'all it'll splat out and that's nothing but my tincture splatting out honey that's why i'm like uh um let me let me try to put you back on in there girl then i'm stirring it around again just just to make sure that it is fully incorporated because if you do not do this you will have it will be set like oil and vinegar separate yeah this that's exactly what this will be baby your gummies will be to the right and your tincture will be to the left so you want to definitely make sure that it's fully incorporated microwave it again then you're going to place it in your ziploc bag or your piping bag remember this ziploc bag is already all uh down so i'm trying to give you guys a good angle but this is hot girl i'm like oh i'm about to stop the camera this is hot so you want to go ahead and pour that into there i use i try to use my rubber spatula to get the rest of it out but do what you can because it will kind of become you know it'll cool down a little fast so you will be working very quickly boo boo so once you get that together you're going to just whatever side you're going to cut it out you're going to cut it away from your workspace okay i cut it on the ground so you're going to cut it away from your workspace line a little bit of nerves just a little bit unless you want it real thick to the bottom of this pan and we're going to pipe on our gummies [Music] [Music] so you guys i am starting off with a thin layer i like to use at least when it when i like to make beans nerd robes i'm showing you guys how to make one and a half so with the measurements and things that i will put in the description box to my preference it makes one long nerd rope and kind of like um a quarter of one as well so what i'm doing now is i'm just going ahead and piping out my gummies and once i get done piping out the gummies i'm gonna take some additional nerd rope and sprinkle them on top of the gummies so they can have gummies on both sides i um really do this as a preference when it comes to how many nerds i'm actually putting on the rope so like i said this is really trial and error for some people you guys gonna have to figure out what what you like and what works best for you [Music] so all of those nerd roasts that you put on the side or if you're using a new box you're just going to go ahead and sprinkle as many nerves on this as you want to help you out you kind of want to make sure that all of the gummy is covered and go to your next step [Music] so [Music] all right so now you want to just go ahead and put your nerd roads in the refrigerator for several hours and once they harden up you're going to come back to them [Music] all right so now that it's been several hours i'm going to get my packaging my flat irons i don't use them on my head but i should use them for this okay and i get my nerd rose as you guys can see that it was covered up so you don't have to worry about anything getting on them [Music] now this is why it's super important to spray down that aluminum foil you guys see how easy they're coming out of here i'm definitely being gentle because i don't feel like anything cracking breaking or anything like that or in between boo-boos so you see how easy they're coming out but i'm just plopping them out ever so gently and now once i plop them out i'm going to put them on the cardboard that every nerd rope come with and i'm just going to place it on there and we're going to go ahead and package them so that's just what i like to do [Music] so now what we're going to do is i put them on my cardboard liners i'm going to flip them over so that the cardboard is facing up and i'm going to get the two ends of oh sorry you guys then we're going to get the two ends of the aluminum foil kind of put them together where where nestle had the glue already there so i'm just going to line them up as even as i can and we're going to heat seal them with our flat irons with my flat iron they go from like a one to a five and i believe i have them on a a two maybe a three i just want them to get hot enough so when my hand touch it my hand is not burning and i can kind of just like close it all together so heat sealing something together is really really easy you guys and that's just pretty much it you just heat seal them together and you will be all done with your diy infused nerve bros thank you guys so much for watching this video if you guys want to see any other type of infusion definitely put a comment down below and i really do appreciate you for watching this video i it means a so much so here go the little small ones that i did as well now this one i'm going to just do the same thing that i did with the longer one i'm just going to cut the nerd box so it fits this size you know what i'm saying so or you could just put them in your odorless airtight containers but you guys see how i have the little miniature one right there in front and that's pretty much all you do sorry for the noise you guys brandi and devin are outside playing tug of war with a stick yeah yeah yeah talk to you guys on my net video", "8KG4oDEZXbM": "[Applause] [Music] [Music] hi welcome back to my channel or if you are new here today my name is Melissa mystique and welcome to the medical Bay Baja so today I'm gonna carry with you guys my tips and what supplement I have been using to help make me my most beautiful self so if in the past couple months it has been my goal to raise the levels of collagen and hyaluronic acid within my skin I can't believe how quickly I have been able to do this the body is absolutely miraculous and how quickly it can heal itself it's actually really crazy how quickly the body can repair itself when it's actually being supplied with the nutritional levels it needs I can't actually display to you guys the actual percentage my collagen levels has raised - I know for myself I can actually see a huge difference about 6 months ago my laugh lines were pretty prominent and now as time is going on and I'm fueling my body with the nutrition needs to help produce more collagen and hyaluronic acid and all the things to keep my skin beautiful now about 6 months later they're actually starting to go away and I haven't done fillers at all I have not done fillers I've noticed that when I look in the mirror my teeth are more supple and full looking and because of that I just overall look more healthy and I feel more healthy I have literally just done this with supplements that I know are good for beauty and the fact that I'm starting to look like how I did when I was 14 when I'm 25 is absolutely mind-blowing and I've done it within 6 months I've been on this path to recovery for about 2 years now recovering from being anorexic but my beauty was still kind of struggling a little bit because I still wasn't getting the nourishment and nutrients I needed I was no longer an array SiC but I wasn't getting optimal levels of vitamins and minerals so that is how these supplements have helped me so as part of my beauty resume I take various supplements at nighttime right before I go to bed because while you're sleeping that is the time when your body repairs itself the most so why not supply it with all the nutrients it needs and more while you are sleeping while it is in repair mode because then it has everything it needs so we can repair so much while you're sleeping so let's get on to show you what these supplements are so when it comes to beauty of vitamin that plays a crucial role is that of vitamin A vitamin A is amazing for rejuvenation of cells and promoting cell turnover I think about two or three of these before bed and I've noticed ever since implementing vitamin A into my life I noticed that my skin looks so much smoother I actually don't break out as much either and actually this is the most exciting part is that the pores on my face are starting to minimize and this is all due to the fact that vitamin A speeds up cellular turnover when you are a child your cellular turnover rate is 14 days but as you age and grow older that time period actually lengthens and by the time you actually hit your 20s your cellular turnover rate has expanded to actually being 28 days instead of the 14th days it was when you were a child this is why children have that perfect porcelain skin and that is because the rate of their cellular turnover is quicker than that of an adult and actually the more you grow older the slower and slower the cellular turnover rate is but if you supply yourselves with vitamin A this will promote them to turn over faster instead of trying to put on astringent to make our pores smaller I think we should begin as a society to implement more vitamin a and I think if we do there's a lot more people will be more satisfied with their results that's the first one I use and the next one I use is a well known Beauty nutrient this one is biotin though biotin is actually vitamin b7 if you guys didn't know so it's actually a part of the entire B complex so the biotin amount that I have is ten thousand micrograms the thing about biotin is that you probably want to start with a smaller amount at first and then work your way up if your body does not like high levels of biotin it will excrete it through your pores it will make you break out however if you work your way up to it and you are able to distinguish that you don't break L from biotin then go ahead go to ten thousand but I have been using biotin for a long long time and I know what I am fully capable of being able to ingest I use ten thousand and I take one of these at night biotin is great for strengthening hair growing hair strengthening and growing nails it's also really good for helping skin become stronger so this next one is vitamin Steve if you guys haven't seen my vitamin C challenge I will link it below if you're interested in watching it then help yourself in that challenge I actually took 25 hundred milligrams a day vitamin C to see if it would help raise the levels of my collagen and that is because without vitamin C your body actually cannot produce collagen without vitamin C you're not gonna have the beautiful skin you're wanting the thing about vitamin C is that you can't overdo it so if you are really wanting result especially regarding your beauty pop some of these bad boys and you will see differences in a month I have been taking vitamin C now for I think three months and I have noticed my skin completely changed I have noticed that my collagen levels have been raising every single day and it's all ever since I started taking vitamin C every day and taking quite a bit of it every single day after my challenge I will always swear by vitamin C because it is a miracle worker when it comes to producing more collagen in your skin so if you're wanting to get a little collagen boost without getting any fillers take the more affordable route and go get some vitamin C I promise you will not regret it okay so this next one I'm going to tell you most people typically don't use this for beauty this is something that I came up with on my own I don't really know how much it's actually been contributing to my beauty honestly I just I just decided to do an experiment just like my vitamin C challenge this is the herb marshmallow root and the reason why I thought I would begin to take this is because natural hyaluronic acid can be derived from this I put two and two together like oh if hyaluronic acid can be derived from this in my thoughts it can supply hyaluronic acid in the body I don't know if that's actually true or not but the way my brain works and what I know about Beauty what I know about the components of skin it just it seems like oh this might be a good idea to get more hyaluronic acid in your body without actually just putting hyaluronic acid in your body if you don't know hyaluronic acid it can be pretty pricey whereas this guy is $15 I think the bottle at my work for hyaluronic acid for like pills of hyaluronic acid is like $40 without hyaluronic acid there's no point in having collagen because your collagen sits in the hyaluronic acid so hyaluronic acid is very important when it comes to skin health you can have so much collagen in your skin but if you don't have the hyaluronic acid to hold it in place it's not gonna look as smooth and supple as you - so this is the organic plant collagen builder from garden of life if you're like me and you're a vegetarian you cannot take collagen supplements to be honest I don't really know if collagen supplements actually work that's my personal opinion maybe they do maybe they don't if you are a vegetarian then you're able to use this one so in each pill it actually has various vitamins which will help you produce more collagen in your skin and it's derived from food so it's derived from like fruits and vegetables and herbs in my opinion I find it more beneficial to actually give your body the nutrients it needs to produce more collagen rather than just supplying the collagen from an unknown source so I'm just gonna read off with a box that it came in it says beautiful hair skin and nails helps maintain collagen elastin and keratin formation three proteins responsible for promoting healthy hair skin and nails so another Beauty supplement I take is actually this plant-based collagen booster so this is the plant-based collagen booster from the brand Organic a-- and it's actually a drink so what you do is like digging with a teaspoon and then you pour it in some water and then you drink it what I'll do with this is that I put it in a drink that I drink every morning well I try to drink it every morning sometimes I forget or I'm too rushed but when I do drink it I put this in it and then I put some lemons in it and then I put some apple cider vinegar in it and I call this like my optimal health drink so the lemons are to detox the apple cider vinegar is also to detox and then it's also to raise my stomach acid levels in my stomach and then this is for to produce more collagen in my body so this is what the actual finished product of my drink looks like when it's all done on its own the powder actually doesn't taste that bad you can barely taste it it's just kind of like light sweetened taste and because I am actually drinking it from a drink stead of taking it as a pill the nutrients from my drink will actually go immediately into my bloodstream so this last one that is called cell restore by belt my intention behind using this supplement is to combat oxidative stress in cells oxidative stress happens within a cell when a free radical which is an unstable atom steals a hydrogen ion from healthy atoms become unstable without their hydrogen ions this turns them into free radicals but if antioxidant is able to be stable by itself even when a hydrogen ion is taken and then the antioxidant is also stable and when you continuously supply your body with antioxidants this will continuously restabilized many free radicals within your body within this there are actually quite a few antioxidant ingredients so the reason why is it beneficial to supplement your body with antioxidants is because free radicals always want to steal hydrogen ions so this is great for that reason because it supplies your body with many antioxidants so your free radicals restabilized and then your cells are restored to their healthy nature and are no longer in oxidative stress if you liked this video please give me a thumbs up I would really appreciate it and if you are not yet a baby alpaca what are

"hello Joseph Rogers here with the kids a podcast and we are going to try the Seattle's private reserve base slapper I don't know never heard of it so I figured I'd pick it up looks pretty good obviously the packaging is pretty awesome-looking experience the difference and Seattle Private Reserve calm so check them out this face slapper is 28 total percent cannabis 26 THC so we're gonna go ahead and break her open give her a nice little review see what we got smells good oh yeah that smells really good it's nice nice crunchy texture to it as you can see looks real nice smells real nice I could tell it already that this was grown very well crumbling good which means they let it dry up a little bit before they put it in the package or at least had air in the package nothing worse than getting some wet soggy weed that smells like hey you know so pass the smell test pass the field test now it's time for the taste test give her a try very nice very nice burning really good that's a good sign nice and smooth yeah and taste very good kind of has like a earthy piney taste to it I don't know what face leper is crossed with but it's nice it's always important to see how well the bud ashes give us an idea how well the buds were grown the plants were grown drained flushed all that [ __ ] it's the beauty of weed being legal in our state now as we can obviously fine-tune this stuff to a point where we can get out all the harmful things and we keep it a little more organic [Music] [Music] yeah I like getting slapped in the face from time to time so this is my strain right here I like it and I think the next strain we're gonna try out is Hollywood oh gee by Seattle Private Reserve 20 percent total tegu cannabis 19 percent THC look at that but that looks beautiful and even got a sativa 60/40 blend listed here like that I really like that 70/30 8020 sativa dominant hybrid I want to know these things so I really like that they do that and these nuts look absolutely gorgeous Wow almost looks like you dug in a way the color got purple undertones and hints of nice color there man account can't wait for that one but this face slapper I'm gonna give her a five out of five it hit good and smell good it tasted good ash is good I feel good already I'm obviously stoned already I mean what more could you want from a bud right alright until next time", "ukkhWhaNTaU": "before this video starts I would like to preface it by saying I am NOT a doctor a nutritionist or an expert on this subject matter what you are about to see is basically a 30-day experiment and a learning experience with myself testing out nootropics like brain bridge for an entire month straight I know the video is long and it's very hard to kind of put how I feel and the benefits that I feel from it inwards but maybe if you stick around you will find a little bit of insight from an average person like myself on what brain bridge and nootropics can do for someone like yourself what's going on everyone back with another episode of stuff in things and today I don't really know what we're getting into yet judging by the title and the thumbnail of the video you guys probably have a better idea than I do as of right now so I got a package in the mail from a company called man sports basically all I know about them right now is that they are a supplement company and it's a pretty pretty big box there's a lot of stuff in here so I'm gonna get into this and then I think I have a general idea of where this is gonna go but we'll see so this company reached out to me and they kind of told me about themselves what they do some products that they offer and they wanted to work together I said sure I mean it seems like you guys have some stuff that I might be interested in but at the same time I'm not a gym rat I'm not a big buff guy I don't really care a whole lot about crazy bodybuilding fitness they did tell me about this other product that they have though and hopefully that is here somewhere in the box a nice handwritten note on here Talon please enjoy this box of games we are excited for the opportunity to work with you your brother from another mother rich I always appreciate handwritten letters no matter who they come from so very cool buck and we have a lot of stuff in here first up we got some snap backs because that's all that I wear we'll swap that out for now we've got some more is this a jacket oh man I love jackets it's like a hundred degrees out today but I'm still gonna put this on regardless yeah buddy how's it look we've got some t-shirts a whole lot of drinking vessels OD green a man sports got a white one man these guys hooked it up got a red one and then we got a whole bunch of supplements I know this is really weird for something that I would typically do on my channel we got whey protein which I obviously don't ingest because I don't go to the gym but it's loopy loopy fruit loopy fruit so I might actually just try that out for the hell of it we got some iso amino in pink lemonade I might have to try that as well I'm gonna try all this stuff let's be honest we have some more with the flavor dorks not exactly sure what that's going to taste like probably a lot like this so and then we have two containers of brain bridge in sour nooks this is nootropic brain octane formulated for high-level thinking gamers students promotes energy alertness wakefulness and more so this is actually one of the things that I was excited about frying a lot of this stuff obviously relates to people who are in the fitness industry who like lifting and things of that nature but stuff like this I think might have beneficial properties to just everyday people like myself someone who's into action sports and shooting and all sorts of things like that also got two more in here these are some sort of pills this is REM PM nighttime thermogenic pills overnight fat loss hormone optimizers adrenaline system support and then what is this this is a multivitamin and mineral supplement so we got a cool package here a lot of stuff to go through but the main thing that I'm excited about is the brain bridge so like I said I read right off of the package here it's formulated for high-level thinkers gamer students promotes energy all sorts of good stuff for your brain I've heard a lot of people talk about stuff like this in the past someone is big on nootropics and stuff like this is obviously joe rogan if you ever listen to his podcast so I think I'm gonna give this stuff a try they call this a micro batch it is handcrafted and a bottle because quality matters and it was quality tested energy memory focused creativity ambition that's all things that I need on a daily basis to make these videos so suggested use as a dietary supplement take one to two servings one to two scoops with an 8 ounce cold water in the morning or early afternoon to avoid sleeplessness do not take within six hours of sleep do not take more than two servings per day on the supplement facts it has a whole list of vitamins and things that are included in here you guys probably don't care a whole lot about this stuff but some of the big ones are b6 b12 and then it has what is called LTP for mental domination natural caffeine blend and 20/20 vision support so I guess some stuff that is good for your eyes basically what I'm going to be doing in this video is testing this stuff out and telling you how it is like an episode of testes but what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to test this stuff out for a full 30 days there are 20 servings in this container I have two of them so I have 40 total servings maybe I'll let some of my friends try it if I notice anything from it basically I'm just kind of interested in seeing what this stuff tastes like first of all and then to see if there are any actual benefits from it that I notice who it smells uh I don't know what it smells like to be honest it smells good though it's not a bad smell one to two scoops with 8 ounces of cold water so I'm going to take one of these and go fill it up with 8 ounces I will be right back alright got 8 ounces of cold water in here I'm gonna go with 2 scoops to start because I think you should be able to sort of see the benefits after using it right away but like I said I don't know a whole lot about this stuff and I don't recommend doing this it's not good to put stuff in your body that you haven't done a whole lot of research on I have looked into nootropics in the past and I just it was never something that I wanted to act go out and buy so now I have the opportunity to try this and we're just gonna go all in scoop number one and scoop number two as this video progresses I'm definitely going to be doing a little bit more research so I can become more up to speed on some of the benefits and maybe some side effects that ingesting stuff like this everyday might have on you so just give it a little shake we will test this out and then I'll be coming back and kind of updating you guys probably every day every other day maybe every five days for a whole month we'll see if I actually see some benefits from drinking this stuff I just noticed that there's a nice little blade filter in here to kind of get rid of all the chunks so I'd be good for anyone who drinks protein tell maybe this stuff will even give me the energy to want to better myself and workout maybe lift some weights and then I could try some of this protein I'm definitely gonna have to try some of this stuff at some point in the next month so here we go Thank You Man Sports for sending this stuff out it's definitely sour oh it tastes like it tastes like a very familiar like type of candy that I used to eat almost like a sour sweet tart or something like that it's not bad definitely not bad I do like sour stuff so that doesn't bother me but maybe after drinking this everyday it might sort of bother my stomach we'll find out though so going back to the packaging there is no artificial colors or anything like that there is citric acid malic acid malic acid is actually what makes stuff like this sour there's green coffee beans in here there's a bunch of different stuff so I'm definitely going to be doing more research on what actually goes into this stuff Oh as sour alright that's it eight ounces two scoops of man sports brain bridge I will probably check back in a little bit and give you guys my first impression once I notice anything might not notice anything I don't know we'll see and then I will we'll continue testing this stuff over the next couple days so a minute for the long haul now alright guys I'm back checking in after the first six hours about after trying brain bridge and I have to say I didn't really notice a whole lot as of yet there was definitely a caffeine peak in the beginning and that gave me energy to kind of go around and do things that I would normally do during my day so I spent the first hour or two actually researching nootropics nootropics however you want to say it and I learned a lot now I'm not a doctor or a nutritionist so I'm not going to go into all of the stuff that I've read into and learned through videos and stuff like that however I will tell you that a bunch of people have also reviewed this stuff and it seems like everything that goes into the formula of everything that they use it all seems to be pretty damn good today is Labor Day the first day that I'm doing this so I've basically just been kind of hanging around the house with family we've been eating a lot grilling out and stuff like that so I never really had the need to concentrate and actually work on something like filming and editing a video from start to finish I did end up doing the typical stuff like I went out and rode my motorcycle for a little while I actually played a little bit of video games which I don't do a whole lot but that's basically what this stuff is used for right giving you energy and keeping your mind focused to do things like play games and do extreme sports things like that it seems like there are a bunch of really good things that will happen after I keep using this stuff for a little while and because of the ingredients and my body probably not being used to taking supplements because honestly I don't really take a whole lot there maybe a little bit of an overload on some of the stuff that comes in it but everyone's body is different it really depends on how you metabolize things the diet that you stick to whether you're eating fried food and a bunch of processed junk or if you're eating very healthy green I kind of fall somewhere in the middle there but I also am pretty active during the day I don't want to say extremely active I'm not going to the gym like I said but maybe over the next month I might start doing some stuff like that just to kind of burn off any of the excess energy that I might receive from brain bridge so as of now I think I'm going to call it a day and then I'm going to continue taking this stuff I'm going to do one scoop a day for the next five days and if I notice anything significant between now and then I will definitely check in with you guys but if not I will talk to you in about five days [Music] alright guys one week complete of drinking brain bridge and it's still tasting good so that's a good sign now I don't really know how I'm going to like word how this feels to me I don't know if it's a placebo effect because I know that I'm taking this stuff I feel like my brain should be more focused and just feeling overall better but that is actually how I feel in terms of productivity this week has been insane for me on Tuesday I filmed two videos and edited both of them to post in succession with each other Wednesday I filmed another video Thursday I filmed a video and did the podcast and then Friday I filmed another video until I ran into a problem with my camera you guys can probably see and hear a difference because I'm filming on an old old vlog camera where I first started my channel with my DSLR camera I ended up snapping off the mic input inside the body of the camera so that was all a mess I had to take that camera down and send it back to Cannon for repair but all last week up until that point I had been killing it with just productivity in general so I don't know if it is this stuff again like I don't know if it's a placebo effect yet or not but hopefully as I keep taking this stuff I'll kind of notice that things might say the same things might drop off it's really gonna be hard to tell and that's why I'm doing it for a full month after the first day when I took this stuff it was to scoops I had had caffeine earlier that morning one of the downsides was that it was super hard to sleep that night I was probably up until like 4 o'clock in the morning because of all the caffeine in the two scoops and then the caffeine that I had before that so after that I backed it down to one scoop as you guys saw and it seems to be working a lot better now I'm not staying up until 4:00 in the morning I typically fall asleep around like maybe midnight between midnight 2 o'clock so that doesn't seem to be an issue and I don't also notice any other cons in terms of like my body feeling funny or strange I thought the acidity and this stuff might kind of make my stomach feel like but it really doesn't I'm able to drink about I'm doing about 10 ounces every morning with one scoop and so far it's going well I guess I'm going to try to keep filming with this camera to a minimum so I guess I'm going to just keep drinking this stuff all throughout the week if I notice anything major again I said I will come back and update you guys but until then I'm gonna hope that my good camera comes back to me that way I can continue this video up to my normal standards you know let's keep on doing it what's up everyone I'm back after another week of trying brain bridge I didn't film me actually like shaking this stuff up and drinking it every week because Ashley's been here you can confirm that I've been taking this stuff every day right ok I even did like a scoop and a half the other day when we went to a wedding so Ashley really wants one of these shakers so I told her the only way that she'll get one is if she tries this weight not that stuff that's on I agreed to and the protein we're gonna try the protein today - you didn't get a good taste of this before do you like sour stuff see she actually drinks protein and take supplements and stuff I still like it it doesn't bother me no no tastes like candy there's not a sour that thought it was gonna be no it's not super sour but drinking it like first thing in the morning like really wakes you up 98% natural caffeine 125 milligrams per one scoop so it's like a little bit more than a cup of coffee it has a lot of good vitamins in it b6 and b12 today's a travel day for both of us she's going to Nashville I'm going to Vegas we got to try the protein now first unfortunately we don't have milk for whatever reason so protein mixture is one scoop per eight ounces so we got 16 ounces of water we're gonna do two scoops and this is a fruity loopy this smells like fruit loops feels like a fool take a moon sand all over my shoe damn it's a lot okay what do we got in here 25 grams per once good sugar zero grams one grandma card hmm pretty good that's pretty good I think it's gonna taste really good that's like what man sport is apparently known for it is really weird like I've never seen protein it's like understand right yeah oh my god you know what you should do you should do one dry scoop like we did with my pre-workout of brainy bridge yes not now I'm gonna drink too late now but I'll do that out in Vegas with Roger it's mostly protein imagine leaving that in a protein shake are too long like for a couple of days I'm out in combats no brainy bridge that's it for this stuff smells sour all the time and I like this literally it tastes like fruit loop milk like you know at the end of fruit loops that's what it's supposed to taste like it's delicious yeah it tastes exactly like like a lubricant milk yeah so it's that's protein that's pretty good and when you drink that I wouldn't I don't understand it's actually better than my protein I'm offended yeah there you go all right guys I'm gonna pack up my brain bridge I got another new on in my check baggage and I'm going out to Vegas today so the rest of this video will take place out there until the beginning of October when I have completed a full 30 days so maybe Roger and I will try a dry scoop of green bridge and I guess that's it let's do it what's up guys back it's the next day I'm in Vegas now here with my buddy Roger from qbo tactical we're not gonna do the dry scoop just yet I'm gonna let him try it first wait here he told them we're into a dry scoop oh I've been filming for the past thirty days man yeah I like sour stuff I think it still tastes good but doing it everyday who's gonna chug the whole thing damn this hour this hour do you think thanks good tastes like a warrant tastes like warrant that's true all right guys we're back for week three I have now dipped into my second container of brain bridge I'm so liking it I'm still taking it every day this weekend when I didn't take it I kind of felt like slow I was like man I didn't take that today so still going good we actually went to the gym today Roger forced me to go to the gym today I even had a protein shake man we've been eatin clean getting kind of healthy I feel good I'm feeling good so I'm gonna save the rest of this until next week when I come back it'll be 30 days complete and then I will let you guys know my final thoughts on taking this stuff every day and yeah that's gonna be it for now so talk guys in a week and I'm gonna be sounding like that oh I'm back for one last check-in I have now been using brain bridge for an entire month every day straight it just so happens that this morning I received another package from man Sports I've kind of been sharing my experience with them as I went along letting them know kind of what I thought and everything and I asked him if I could try some more flavors that way I could give you guys a better idea of what else they offer so I'm gonna dig into this package real quick and see what they send and then I will give you my final thoughts on how this whole kind of experiment thing went oh my god they sent a lot of stuff first up rainbow sherbert brain bridge Lemon Drop brain bridge some more lemon drop some new stuff called scorch energize and burn I'm not exactly sure what this is for yet this is in a pink lemonade flavor it seems to me like this would be some sort of pre-workout type of stuff they also send a whole bunch of aminos which will actually be coming in handy very soon because as you know if you've been following my daily videos I'm out here in Las Vegas and we've been going to the gym almost every single day we got pink lemonade wimps candy banana amino coffee creamer bliss this looks like oh it is pumpkin spice that's pretty fitting since it is October now and then we got some more coffee creamer in French vanilla that one would probably be my favorite we also got two more things of protein which like I said I don't really take but now since I've been going to the gym while I'm out here I will probably start trying some of this stuff out we got cinnamon toast crunch cereal flavor that's probably pretty good just like the Froot Loops was and fruity pebbles so I like the whole cereal themed thing that they have going on here now like I promised I said I would do a dry scoop of these so why don't I try half a dry scoop of each of these so I can test out all the flavors we'll start with the Lemon Drop I do have to say looking back from when I started this a month ago I was really going into it blind not knowing a whole lot but doing some research on brain bridge and nootropics and everything it really did kind of open my eyes to all of the benefits that you can have when using this stuff but you really have to pair it with physical activity since I started going to the gym with Roger about two weeks ago I did find that if I would take just brain bridge in the morning without eating anything or drinking a whole lot of water with it it would make my stomach feel pretty terrible if I was working out hard we were doing some CrossFit stuff and leg day so I would recommend doing this after you have eaten something and today I have I started switching up to take the brain bridge after we got back from the gym when I was eating my first meal of the day and it worked out much much better so here we go with the lemon drop I should probably have some water shouldn't I all right here we go half a scoop of Lemon Drop this is probably going to be just as sour as the stuff that I'm used to the sour nuke Cheers hmm oh man oh wow that is intensely sour well it definitely tastes like lemon drops it reminds me of lemon heads that used to get at the movie theater when I was a kid might be much better mix with water though now instead of destroying my taste buds even more with all that sourness I'm actually gonna put half a scoop of the rainbow sherbert in my shaker and I'll try it this way we got a little more than half a scoop I am a fan of sherberts2 hopefully this one is pretty good am i gonna be my favorite Cheers oh yeah that's good that is really good actually man if you can't stand sour things and your stomach kind of messes you up with that sort of stuff I'd recommend this this is like just like it says some type of like sherbert it's almost like like a creamsicle man that's good I'm looking forward to actually using this stuff even more going forward so that sort of takes me into the wrap-up things going back and looking at how things have changed since I first started it I really have not been drinking energy drinks all that much I might have had like four or five over the period of a month not including when I'm lying out and the evenings and stuff like that but in the morning I was never a coffee guy typically I would grab some type of other caffeinated beverage and this has completely replaced that for me when I would drink caffeine with brain bridge on top of it I was just over the top caffeine and like I said it would keep me up at night especially if I would do more than one scoop of brain bridge I definitely feel very alert and focused when I take it and when I do not take it like sometimes on the weekend I'll kind of wake up late and forget to take it until the afternoon I noticed myself feeling kind of like groggy and drowsy one from not having the caffeine but two I'm also not getting all of those good vitamins that are in it there's a lot of stuff in here that my body has probably gotten used to taking and then when I don't get that it might feel a little bit lacking at the same time I could go a day or two without this and it's not gonna hurt me at all it's not like a drug that you have to like wean yourself off of I also really have not noticed any negative side effects other than my stomach feeling a little bit queasy after a tough workout when I was taking this stuff and not taking anything else like food or a lot of water with it I can really see myself taking this stuff even more and using more man sports products as I go forward especially while I'm out here on this whole fitness kick thing with my friends in Vegas now like I said in the beginning this is a long video and it's kind of hard to wrap up my thoughts and let you guys actually know how I feel especially when everyone's body is different the benefits that I see from taking brain bridge like this might not be the same for everyone and chances are it probably won't be I'm definitely no expert on this subject matter but I have definitely become way more informed over the past thirty days and maybe some of you guys out there might want to give it a try and see if you notice anything from it if you guys want to get an idea of the productivity and focus that I've had since taking brain bridge go back just a month and watch every single video any of those videos that I filmed in the past 30 days were all while I was using this stuff you may notice some different things you may not but you probably will notice that I was putting out a lot more content than I normally was because I was just focused I was up I was awake and alert so just for those benefits alone I will absolutely be taking more of this stuff over the next couple of weeks months until basically my supply runs out and I need to re-up mmm and the sugar is really good so if you guys have any specific questions for me on maybe what is in some of these formulas or if you want to know something more personal about my experience with taking this stuff feel free to let me know in the comments down below I will try to answer them as best as possible but like I said when it comes to all the ingredients and using supplements the way they're supposed to be used I'm still not an expert I'd also like to say big thanks to man Sports for letting me try all this stuff out they are not paying me to say any of this stuff they didn't even recommend that I do this for 30 days it was just an idea that I had and I figured why not I really haven't seen a video of anyone else taking nootropics like this consistently for a month straight and giving updates so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video if you want to check out anything that you saw here that they offer of course links in the description down below and I believe there may even be a discount code so keep an eye out for that if you want to see how more of the testing goes with brain bridge and some of the other products that they offer consider clicking subscribe because I make new videos every week and I'm going to be using a lot of this stuff in my daily vlog so chances are you will see a lot of these containers in the upcoming videos well that is going to be all for today so as always thank you guys for watching and I'll talk to you the next one [Music]", "SgMY5GdMMRU": "giulia hanfling is a medical nutritionist and diabetes hypertension educator with over 20 years of experience offering comprehensive nutritional guidance and support to health care teams working with chronic disease patients she's the founder of three peaches nutrition and diabetes coaching and utilizing an approach that treats patients with compassion and as individuals she also organizes the monthly Hawthorne diabetes group for anybody that's impacted by diabetes please join me welcoming Julia Hadley okay hi thank you I call my business three peaches nutrition and diabetes coaching because I just think that the changes that we recommend for our patients should be as delicious as August peaches and I love peaches so if you can find ways to have your patients actually enjoy the process of what you're teaching them or changes that you're encouraging then you have a buy-in and so look for ways for them to kind of savor your recommendations and we'll talk about some specific ways to do that I would say there's really two different areas that I want to talk with you about a few different things let's go through the objectives well recognize who's at risk of hypertension looking at the difference between the role of sodium for high blood pressure will address three dietary recommendation systems both the - diet the Mediterranean diet and I'm going to add in some guidelines for anti-inflammation as well since there's more research and discussion about this now we'll look at the importance of lifestyle factors understand the learning style of different patients and also to support your role as an educator and this is one thing I think is very important I want to be able to give you tools and resources and tips and ideas for how to take care of your patients but what I'd also like to do is to give you some guidelines for you to take care of yourself so that you're an example for the patients that you're talking to so here's a couple considerations so the uncontrolled are going to be both age race we know that as we discussed earlier african-americans tend to have higher blood pressure same is true for the Native Americans and Hispanic population family history is a huge consideration but some of the controllable factors are going to be low physical activity a high sodium low potassium diet as well as other dietary considerations a person's weight stress poor sleep and tobacco so let's take a look at just what are some of the - on guidelines and I would say in your packet there's some links to websites that have good resources that are available for you so you'll see a lot of these as resources for you later on so the DASH diet stands for the dietary approach to stop hypertension it was developed by the National Heart Lung and Blood Association and our Institute in 2001 and it's been widely researched and expanded and is really quite reliable as one of the most effective tools for helping people lower blood pressure in a very realistic way fortunately there's all sorts of other benefits as well besides just blood pressure and I'm partial for things where you get more benefit for your effort so there's two components of the - diet this is going to be both to reduce sodium the recommendation is to cut down to 2,400 milligrams per day or 1500 milligrams for additional benefits especially for people with diabetes the second component will be the dietary modifications of having higher fruits and vegetables looking low fat milk products whole grains fish poultry beans and seeds less sugar in fats red beets and you know there's not that many products now that have trans fats in them that's been actually ruled out there's another consideration that we'll come to it later but looking at lower fat lower cholesterol and then higher in potassium magnesium calcium protein and fibers - so we know that sodium decrease is effective both for pre hypertension as well as hypertension and to add the dietary component has additional benefits so I'd like you to keep in mind that they're separate but they certainly overlap and this is actually effective even without any change in body weight so though if there's add a weight component to it to a weight lost and that can be additionally effective so we looked at some of what the limitations and the recommendations and limits are here and let's see we know here's a guy having sodium on his potato there I have a friend who always salts his food before he tastes it and so he's over and it really kind of annoys me because I will cook dinner I'm making it just the way that I think it tastes really good and then he'll add extra salt so he and his wife come over and we're having dinner and so I played everything up in the kitchen and I just add extra salt to his to start with so it served this out he's already got his extra salt on and he adds more salt before tasting it and me taste this it goes wow this is really too salty and I said yes if you just get your patients to taste their food before they add salt that in itself will make a big difference so I thought it was pretty funny myself yes we are still friends but he always tastes my food first the average American gets between 34 and 48 hundred milligrams per day we know that one teaspoon will be 2,400 milligrams and the recommendation breaks out to about 600 milligrams per meal this could be a useful piece of information when you're having your patients look at labels so it's targeting about 600 per meal and then there's always some slack for chips whatever it is okay there's eight food groups that continue are contribute 40% of the average sodium intake and this would be both candid dried soups canned vegetables pasta dishes pizza cold cuts chips and pretzels breads and commercially fried foods so here's some ways to reduce sodium these include you say frozen or fresh vegetables instead of canned garlic or onion powder not garlic or onion salt many people don't realize that there is a difference but for those with hypertension the difference is quite significant I'm using half a seasoning package this is especially beneficial for people with a very low income because if they're using top ramen noodles or other prepackaged box foods with very little cooking skills if they just use half the package then their food can still taste good but it doesn't impact their blood pressure in such a way it's a very simple recommendation using a low-sodium soy sauce adding salt in the cooking process and not at the table and I recognize to the people who salt their food at the table that only has to do with their comfort they're afraid their food won't taste good without it yes--that's she's asking it's more controllable at the table if a person adds salt then that's true but if people get their food that tastes quite bland and doesn't have enough salt to reach the a satisfaction point then typically they won't eat it and so I we lose people's overall nutrition that way it's kind of funny still a good recommendation though okay using herbs and spices including curry garlic basil cinnamon cumin and others and right now one of the darlings of the spice world is tumeric right so how many people have had into American what they're doing sure that this has all sorts of anti-inflammatory benefits and has really great flavor I would say that if you're using both ginger and tumeric that one way to get flavor out of these is to grate them but I found out that if you freeze ginger or freeze yeah ginger and freeze your tumeric and then graded it grates beautifully and it doesn't get moldy in your vegetable drawer so if you freeze those you'll be doing fine I know fun facts to know and tell right okay too much salt masks other flavors it's very important that food tastes good otherwise the recommendation to reduce sodium won't last we know that this haze buds can change and they do change and they can adapt to a lower sodium intake this is interesting that we know that for a person who cuts way down on the sodium that they're taking in that it takes about two to three weeks for the taste buds to change and the term part is the taste buds bloom or blossom and actually have all these other flavors that are suddenly available once the sodium is no longer on the plate so you can remind your patients that the taste their taste buds will change to be able to take in more flavor after a short period of time and the most important thing is just let your patients know that they will still enjoy their food okay so watch your sodium on a label and I would like to recommend that you keep some risks from tools and supplies in your office I didn't ask how many people here are registered nurses okay and how many RMA's or other office and EMTs anybody else behavioral health excellent okay great well this is one thing that I would ask that you keep in your office and it could look like this I'm actually gonna pass this very label around this is a can of soup now many people say grab a can of soup oh but the whole thing have that for lunch right that would be a common thing so but I'm gonna pass this and have you take a look at what's here we know that this is gonna say I'm gonna come over here that there's going to be 990 milligrams of sodium in this package interestingly enough we do know too that if you're trying to get say 2400 milligrams a day 990 is a fairly significant amount of that but yes can you say that louder that's considered two servings so there's actually a 1990 in milligrams of sodium so 1980 so if you're trying to get 2,400 for the whole day and one can has almost 2,000 milligrams in itself then that's a huge percentage and contributes to the higher sodium intake overall so when you're looking at a label encourage your patients to actually look at the serving size they actually eat not just what's on the label there's a difference between a serving size and a portion size and let me tell you the difference between a serving in a portion so a serving size is standardized this is the standard right here but so a serving size of standardized a portion is personal so if they have twice that much if they have half that much you have to show how to adjust the actual intake for what's on the label okay let's talk about potassium we do know that is what sodium tends to pull water inside the cells and potassium tends to work opposite and pull it back into the interstitial fluids the recommendation is to get about 4700 milligrams per day or roughly a thousand milligrams per Mille and the average intake is only 1800 per day so it's much lower than what a person actually needs and of course this is something that would have to be modified depending on the medications that a person is taking but most people do need to increase the potassium okay so here's some high potassium foods these include white beans avocados acorn squash spinach baked potato banana yogurt salmon you do want to consider produce it has bright colors and be careful with salt substitutes that can be unplanned potassium but when we're talking about bright colors in your food say they say eat a rainbow and it's a wonderful advice however blue kool-aid does not constitute a potassium source okay I'd like to look at the Mediterranean diet that's actually what fits under the dash diet component with the Mediterranean diet it builds on the same information and expands it in another way we're looking here is credited to Walter Willett out of Harvard in 1994 it's based on patterns of crete typical crete greece and southern italy in the early 60s and includes regular physical activity i would say that today the typical diet in the mediterranean region does not actually follow the Mediterranean diet per se because so much of the dietary changes that have come about there are increasing McDonald's increasing Western American style food and their health is compromised now because they've lost some of the traditional foods personally I would say if in doubt look toward the traditional foods from around the world because there's some really wonderful benefits that we have from that we could learn from other parts of the world over time and this also includes regular physical activity walking one way or ride bikes working hard physically fishing and others they're not going to the gym no no it's working into regular lifestyle and work that's a really good question I'm gonna answer that a little bit farther down okay so the Mediterranean basics are vegetables either fresh or frozen whole fruits grains beans and peas good fats oil-rich fish unprocessed meat and eggs uncultured whole dairy and a glass or two of wine per day and it's limiting vegetables sugary drinks refined grains limiting fried foods processed meats and also baked foods okay it's similar to the - diet but it adds the following recommendations which is including healthy oils the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA especially olive oil and salmon and other oily fishes see modest amounts of dark chocolate makes many people very happy one to two glasses of wine or other alcohol in moderation a whole it's interesting on cultured milk such as yogurt and kefir if placed with skim or 1% milk there's a difference between the two there and physical activity is considered a vital part I'd like to come just for a moment to have yes yes the recommendation is just to leave that off absolutely yeah and I would say that the initial research showing the benefits of alcohol came specifically through red wine and it was funded by the California wine Institute I was liked it yes oh okay I was like to track down when there's research claims who's funding the research it's a really important question to ask on that same note the chocolate recommendations were funded by Hershey's so okay you had a question kefir kefir is similar to yogurt it's actually more as a drink um they sell it at every major grocery store now on the plain yogurt plain kefir will have the best the most benefit typically it'll have fruit added to it so it may be like peach flavor or raspberry or whatever else and then when they add flavor and fruit to it then they add a ton of sugar to go with it so but many people find that the flavor of the plain yogurt is very bitter and if adding fruit buys some cooperation and means that they're gonna get additional yogurt and kefir that's a good thing okay I'd like to look at the sources of the omega-3 fatty acids typically would include both olives and olive oil for oily fishes salmon and mackerel other ones nuts walnuts almonds hazelnuts pecans seeds especially sunflower sesame and pumpkin pumpkin is the highest source of magnesium in a person scientifically so you like pumpkin seeds there and your good friend I would include avocados and also canola oil about oh gosh it's probably 15 18 years ago that there's a major article or two research that went into being published showing the benefits of both hazelnuts which is the wild version of filbert's they're the same but hazelnut sounds better they say hazelnuts and walnuts and suddenly the Oregon nut growers are in heaven their stock goes up and they're very happy and it's borne out through research so seed recommendations are those football officers I assume they're not talking yeah he's asking whether this is a recommendation for raw nuts and seeds and I would say yes if they're dry roasted then the oils are not lost but typically not you know if you buy a can of planter's or something it's got a boatload of salt added to it which can undo a lot of the benefit definitely flax seed oil is wonderful we now know that flex has additional benefits besides the oil you know by having the soluble fibers that can go with it and I have to say I think that you're right I think I should add flax to this list here and ground flaxseed is that she's saying that flax seed ground is actually better than the flax seeds whole which is true because it will go out like it goes in so if you grind it that actually you get the best benefit from flax when it's ground thank you okay so which goods to focus on these won't be a surprise I'm sure they come from lots of different directions in terms of a recommendation of legumes whole grains dairy sweets and vegetables produce extra virgin olive oil and other nuts which foods to limit interestingly enough this right here the Bliss point the Bliss point is a balance of sugar salt and fat and it's considered an ideal combination because the brain cannot really focus on salty things and sweet things at the same time this was developed by Doritos Doritos in 1957 and what they find is that when you get a perfect balance of sugar salt and fat it makes people eat more it is not a Bliss point for you it's a Bliss point for the manufacturer but it is called the Bliss point and now you see honey baked ham you see make maple glazed donuts you see bacon on Donuts why would you put bacon on donuts you know a break it in ice cream it's because it reaches that sugar salt and fat it's why they put sugar in spaghetti sauce so be aware of that interestingly enough too that if you have okay I really like toys in my office so you get some of my toys here and I would encourage you to get your own toys in your office too that if you have some soda would be this size I know I have a beginning here there it is that I just want to show you how much how many sugar packs are in one drink now this is going to be 32 ounces and I've accommodated for a cup of ice okay and would you stand up and give me a hand yeah so I go over here and if you would just pull that out seriously there are 20 packs of sugar 21 packs of sugar for 24 ounces of Pop and this is true whether it's 7up or sprite or Pepsi or whatever it is and I'm gonna pass this around so you can see for yourself so just think about emails just like open these packages add water and stir because there's nothing else in it a little caramel color or something like that so can we just pass this out here and I want to show you another way to look at maybe you think well I wouldn't drink that much do I have a smaller amount so okay so here's a 16 ounce container and I have five tubes of sugar in it and if you think about it I've been past this one too if you would if you think about it if you spill this on your hand it would be sticky right well if it's sticky on the outside it is sticky on the inside and it needs to be rinsed out so keep one of these in your office it changes the dynamic you're not telling your patients don't drink this just showing them and let them go ooh and they can make their own decision you can take those out if you want yeah what's up each to well I don't remember exactly the calculation on this but on the label it says I looked it up again last night just to make sure my numbers were correct but like one can of pop is gonna it's gonna have 41 grams of sugar in a 12 ounce container so and there's four grams in each packet so that'd be four pack are there be ten packets in a 12 ounce can of pop I would mention that care Oregon has this fabulous program about educating patients on food and over our overall health and well-being there's Cooking Matters classes some curative nutrition prenatal healthy eating classes and a gleaning collaborative so I would say make use of what care Oregon has to offer through the food rx program and I think then you won't have trouble finding more information about this I think it's quite exciting got a referral program Paul our website I think it is - some of it will be by Rick girl if it's specific to nutritionist and I'm sure the prenatal healthy eating is ready Cooking Matters classes go about every six to eight weeks it's a six weeks class and they just if you miss one the other and you just need to be a carrying member that's all they'll provide bus passes it's at the Fred Meyers a funny first dish I just want to repeat what you said for those who are at a distance and that is that the Cooking Matters classes repeats every six to eight weeks if you miss one you can pick it up next time it's for care Oregon participants and care Oregon can also provide support for transportation so for anyone who's on a care Oregon plan and she's adding that people go home with a bag of groceries for those who are food insecure and absolutely what we want to do is to make sure the recommendations that we're providing for our patients can fit their budget can fit their taste buds as well as their overall health picture okay so how big is your plate here's a consideration here's another toy I'm gonna ask you to keep in your office I like using something pretty graphic so if you have a plate like this and all of us have seen these guidelines that says get half your plate as vegetables quarter protein quarter carbohydrates I don't find that to be realistic but I do find it to be more realistic that if they have a good protein foundation of some kind get some fruit on vegetables over on this part and then carbohydrates get over here and the carbohydrates it's important to have them recognize that would include the starchy foods bread rice pasta potatoes cereals corn things like that as well as fruit milk and sweets and if that fits into a third of their plate then they actually can do pretty well I would say there's a woman who can't have passed this - there's a woman who came to see me for she was I just started her on insulin and she's 42 years old and she's going to a family reunion I had no clue what to bring so we talked this through what she decided is that she was gonna bring some green beans with almonds because she really liked green beans with almonds and whenever you go to a potluck have your patients bring something that they actually will eat as kind of like a safe food and then she did just what we talked about so she looked over the entire plate of a hot entire table before she got her plate out and so by walking around too much here okay good so um once she had already decided what she was gonna get then she could avoid the thing that you take some of theirs then oh yeah that looks really good and suddenly her plate is this big so she got some her green beans with almonds got some coleslaw had a little caprese salad for her vegetables got also some they had a rice salad that looked pretty good to her and a small amount of her aunt's pasta salad because what she really wanted was the blueberry pie at the end the line and she'd already decided on that and so she knew exactly how to maneuver the amount and then got some salmon with lemon sauce and some chicken had the skin taken off and so by the time she got down to the end she knew that her plate was going for 1/3 1/3 and so she got her blueberry pie had a little bit of whipped cream on it skipped the ice cream and just for her her blood sugar was 138 two hours later I thought you're just gonna dance on the ceiling because she was doing it in a way that made sense she got everything that she wanted but she also could keep it away that was keeping her health so if you're looking at a plate about 1/3 1/3 1/3 that will help your patients a great deal ok times have changed I think this is important since in 1980 75% of the calories that people it came from food came from meals and about 25 percent came from snacks but look what happened in 2010 40% of the calories now come from meals and 60 percent come from snacks I think this is a direct result from our dieting efforts because we say eat less food at your meal have your meals be smaller people are hungry and so they tend to eat more at other times so I think that's a real loss it's kind of the shadow side of there are dieting efforts yes in terms of nutritional value food it has less nutrition for yes we typically have more processed foods as snacks yeah absolutely thank you so encourage your patients to eat more at meal times in order to lose weight and get a grip on their health and then eat less between meals as snacks and that waistline will thank you interestingly enough with the anti inflammatory guidelines now the recommendation is to be able to go for a longer period of time between eating episodes in order that the gut can have a chance to kind of repair itself and have the peristalsis the gut motility is a very important component even during the day I've heard that overnight like kind of the 12-hour fasting period overnight for inflammation but even during the day between meals because from a metabolic standpoint it seems like that kind of eating three solid meals but then the snacking in between to kind of regulate metabolism and blood sugar is that not the case um well here's a consideration if lunch is at one o'clock and dinners at five o'clock then you probably don't need an afternoon snack but if lunch is at noon and dinners not til seven that snack is very important so if you're cold you know say two to three hours certainly with between meals then or between eating then that actually helps the gut process food better yes yeah many of them do she's asking if and he's asking if the other countries tend to eat larger meals in the middle of the day and that is true in many countries and of course then they take a siesta afterwards which doesn't really fit into our work mode here but even if your dinner is the largest meal of the day then it could still be in proportion to other meals for example if I have I'm going to borrow your notebook here for just a second so if I have basically half my food comes from breakfast and lunch and the other half comes from dinner and snacks dinner may still be the biggest meal but it's going to be in proportion to what else is around there now one woman I was trying to get her to get this idea that right now she's eating one meal that goes from 4:00 until 10:00 and it was continuous and I said you I want you to you don't eat as much in the morning as you do in the evening and she looked at me and she says I couldn't possibly eat that much so I actually meant split it so be sure that your patience here what it is that you're missing yeah you're saying there was another question yes so say princes like some days sure okay so she's asking that if she works late doesn't get home till 7:00 her family expects her to cook dinner then there's actually a couple recommendations one is encourage your family to cook dinner once a week and get them going and I would use an instant pot you know or a crock pot and thank you Chris bloom for showing me what an instant pot is he uses one so an instant pot is a programmable crock pot and so you could put these things in in the morning had come home and it would be have dinner on the table in 10 minutes I would say - there's a ship huh and they have ramones yeah they're great there's also a chef that I work with who has a very very successful restaurant and his wife they have small kids his wife thinks that he should cook okay so what he does is that he cuts his vegetables on Sundays and Thursdays and so he'll get all his onions chopped up not all of them but most of them the hard ones the onions and celery and carrots and bell peppers and these other cabbage he'll have he's all cut up Sundays and Thursdays run through his you know food processor twice a week and then he could come home from work throw some veggies in a pan throw a chicken in a pan add a sauce and he'll have dinner on in 20 minutes so a little bit of planning ahead can really help with that so try that as well okay some food for thought and that is that a snack is smaller than a meal and it's nourishing and a treat is entertainment for your mouth they are not the same thing so having an evening snack can actually help to stabilize morning blood sugar if you have some cottage cheese and peaches or you know I was gonna work those peaches in there somehow or having half a turkey sandwich or something that really nourishes you but you know a pint of haagen-dazs is not a snack that's a treat so you can show you their patience the difference there I want to look at some other lifestyle considerations here good okay I'd say move more daily get a good night's sleep loose excess weight inches in the waist losing weight can help relax and reduce stress drink water and get a dog and other stress reductions huh or a cat yes uno is a goldfish so I would like to spend a little bit of time a little bit of time on this slide here when it comes to activity there are several things that can be very beneficial we certainly know that we're not going for a walk it's a great idea and doing other cardiac or aerobic activities weight training or resistance is very valuable stretching or yoga and core strengthening I'd like to look at it this way so when you're doing aerobic exercise that gets your heart going and it it really strengthens the heart muscle itself it also encourages the blood vessels to pump harder and then relax and so we know that exercise is tremendously beneficial for lowering blood pressure as well as Lori cholesterol blood sugar producing risk of cancers and other things too so that's the heart impact the weight training or resistance not everybody's going to go to the gym and workout I mean I hope they don't but if you actually keep some bands in your office and show your patients how to use these fans I provide these for my patients in my office so just to show that how many different ways there are to use bands or to Amir have their feet involved then the resistance builds up the muscle integrity and it helps to decrease the fact that between the muscle fibers so cardiac strengthen your heart aerobics the resistance I prefer these people I'll press this do I prefer that people practice using lower weights for more repetitions rather than higher weights for fewer repetitions the stretching or yoga what that does is that it tends to lengthen the muscle fibers and it connects the muscle to muscle as well as the muscle to bone and so the stretching is tremendously beneficial especially for helping to minimize injury and then core strengthening has to do with balance or Pilates here's something to think about and that is that I would ask you to teach your patients to do how to do two things which they've been doing a long time and they probably think they're good at it I'm going to ask you to teach them how to stand and I'm going to ask you to teach them how to walk and I'd like to practice on you right now so why don't you stand up and the all-american way of standing is to kind of point your toes in and lock your knees and when you lock your knees then it pushes your butt out stomach can hang down and shoulders slouch this is kind of an all-american way of standing so have you practice that right now good you can still see me there alright and the counterbalance for that is to shift your toes so the toes are slightly out farther than your heel is yes and then if you bend just a little bit just soften your knees a little bit I'm gonna I'll stand over here by softening your knees a little bit that takes some of the pressure off of your back and if you can try well let's just stand here for a second so what I'm gonna ask you to do is to pick up your left heel and pick up your right heel and now do the same thing without moving your shoulders when you do that that helps to engage your core it helps you engage your your pelvic floor muscles there okay so now one way to look at this is that if you're if your butt is kind of tucked under and your stomach is pulled in then I'm still using my right leg and left leg my left heel then that in itself really strengthens your core muscles you can do this standing in line at Safeway you can do it waiting in the lobby for the elevator you can do it while you're brushing your teeth so if you show your patients how to stand that's really beneficial another consideration is by having your shoulders back and actually using your upper chest here one lady says I'm my heart to the sky it was so sweet so that encourages you to breathe more now one thought is if you imagine that between your butt cheeks you kind of keep a quarter there this changes the definition of a quarterback okay so how does that feel can you feel the difference there so when you're standing teach your patients how to stand they will benefit from this all right go ahead and sit back down yes she's asking if my definition of standing involves shifting back and forth in part it does because it encourages being conscious of your posture and what it does is that it uses more muscles but certainly you know this is easy to forget and sometimes you're just standing certainly now when it comes to walking I'd like to show you a couple things one is that when you when a person walks who carries a lot of extra weight they tend to use the least amount of muscles possible and what I mean by this is it could be little tiny steps going right side left side right side left side and I have to say I I stock people I follow people in grocery stores or in airports and I copied their steps to kind of get a sense of how they're feeling it's amazing what people tell about how they how they walk so that actually uses the least amount of muscles in your body but if you're going to use more muscles then start with if nothing else take longer steps and I'll show you what I mean so if I'm taking longer steps then that actually ends up I swing my butt more they'll feel quite awkward don't worry about that but it also gets the hands going in the opposite direction so right hand left foot left hand right foot it also encourages somebody to kind of stand taller and use our lungs while they're walking and as I say I tend to stock people my favorite people to watch walking are people who just bought flowers at the corner stand because they're happy and they're holding these flowers and they're like cruising along you know coming strutting and so if you walk as though you're happy and take longer steps and breathe then there's really joy in that process in what it also does is that each step becomes a way to massage the spine and it helps to decrease injuries so or decrease pain so we're using more muscles getting more oxygen it's in itself lowers blood pressure blood sugar both and so if there's a way that you could not only tell your patients to walk more but show them how to do it they will thank you for it okay any questions right now does this make sense so I'm gonna have you practice this even when you walk from the building to your car see if you can walk in a conscious way you will forget this a thousand times and I could tell you that forgetting is not the important part the important part is the remembering so let your patients not feel guilty for not doing more most people feel so guilty simply for a living but if they could just find ways to remember this and do it more often that would be great okay let's see what else we got I want to talk about on the rate of obesity and obesity is defined as the body mass index over 30 which for fire somebody who is 5 foot 4 would be 175 pounds for somebody who's 510 would be 210 pounds look what happens 1980 there's 46 states with a BMI of less than 15% of the general population only four states had more than 15% in 1990 there are two states that had body mass index average over 20% in 2000 there's 30 states that have a verage population more than 20% have a BMI over 30 but look at this and 2010 there's 30 38 states that have a body mass index average over 25% and of those 17 states are higher than 30% on BMI of 30 so where is this going this is not changing anytime soon here's another way of looking at this this is a complicated chart but you can see that the rate of obesity in 1994 was very low 2000 and 2010 is increasing dramatically and what I find interesting is the rate of diabetes and the hypertension and other conditions that follow is directly following by about five years so I would also bring over here to take a look that here this is called both the the cardiac belt or I've heard it called the diabetes belt I would also like to point out that this is where alligators live and so as one people at one person says that maybe alligators are causing obesity I'm not sure but that's a possibility anyway this chart I think is quite important and so if your weight has gone open up in the past 10 or 15 years just know that you have good company but that's another reason why it's not just in theory that we're looking at this we really need to drive this home that even even losing a few pounds can make a difference let's look at some ethnic groups the non-hispanic blacks 48% have are obese with BMI over 30 for Hispanics 42% non-hispanic whites are now at 30 and 32 percent and on Asians are about 10% but something interesting happens in an Asian population they tend to have a cardiovascular complications from obesity at a much lower body mass index and so actually at a point of 25 BMI of 25 then the recommendations for intervention are there for Asian population this is kind of curious in most groups obesity is in lower-income groups it's proportionally higher but in two groups both in non-hispanic blacks and Mexican American men those with higher income are more likely to be obese and lower-income tend to be having lower body and body mass index and part of that has to do with the work styles that both African American and Mexicans tend to be more physically active for a lower income there's some proportion there okay for the overweight patient ten pounds can reduce the risk of developing hypertension diabetes and other health problems by even up to 65% if someone is hypertensive weight loss can be as effective as some medications and I found this to be fascinating that each pound of fat requires approximately one mile of capillaries so if a person loses 10 pounds of fat that's 10 miles their heart doesn't have to pump that's really significant so what I'm asking is that you let your patients know that a small weight loss even you know 5 to 10 pounds can have significant health benefit ok encourage your patients to master the art of 5 pounds so basically it's half your dietary changes have to increase varied movement and the other half you're a good night's sleep ok so the numbers don't quite add up but you get the message that it's all there all three of those are important we do talk about having a drink we know that people who don't drink enough water are going to be more hypertensive we also know too that as we talked with that sort of thing passing around that truly if it's sticky on the outside it is sticky on the inside we know that not drinking enough water tends to concentrate on the sodium retention and minimalize capillary capacity to remain open caffeinated drinks a cos act as a diuretic so coffee pop coke or something can actually help to decrease they'll call it fluid that's available as a question about alcohol one to two drinks per day can have a modest effect at lowering blood pressure a serving equals 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine of what an announced half ounce of 80 proof or better but for somebody who doesn't drink this is not a recommendation to start I would say that sleep is precious there's just touched on earlier today we know that about 1 in 3 Americans have high blood pressure about 40 of those are going to have sleep apnea but for people who have resistant hypertension 80% typically would have sleep apnea I'm aggravated by and it'sand of blood sugars the through diabetes so the American Association of Sleep Medicine recommends that all patients with hypertension or diabetes be screened for sleep apnea and that's mentioned earlier that the CPAP using the CPAP by itself can lower blood pressure to some degree and also can lower the a1c for a person's blood sugars as much as 1.5 percent so it's it's quite significant I would ask your patients many people are half asleep when they're awake and half awake when they're asleep and we just want to separate those so you're more asleep when you're asleep and more awake when you're awake and that's where that's an important thought okay I'm just that good yeah okay here's some ideas for how to fall asleep and stay asleep set up a routine could be very helpful keeping the TV out of your bedroom can be very helpful or at least a cut off screen time at least an hour before going to bed exercising is wonderful getting out in the sunshine can help a person sleep better folks focus breathing or meditation is very beneficial check for sleep apnea I would say that lying in bed saying hurry up and sleep does not help so I would like to just right now you can show your patients how to do this too but just uncross your legs and put down your pen down and just relax for a moment and just take a gentle full breath and again at this time dicker breath had just let him take a longer time to exhale thank you this is always available to you and it seems a little awkward to do this with your patients but they will thank you for it and they will remember what you say so see if you can bring in a very gentle two to three breath breathing practice with your patients I do want to mention there's some common supplements that people take and oh I would say to be sure to ask your patients about what supplements they're on because they may be taking some things that are directly contradictory to the medications that they're on but it may not be known and they won't volunteer the effort boss most people who especially take a lot of supplements would tend to kind of keep that but I feel like it's unwelcome information in a medical setting but it's most important that we bring what used to be called alternative care now it's being called complementary care and that's the way it should be so whatever it is that they're on as complementary practices we need to know about that and have it charted so that we can make sure that these two practices are different approaches work together so someone are some good ones to go by calcium and magnesium magnesium has specific benefit for sleep as well as for blood Sugar's and other components too and specifically for high blood pressure as well so a thousand milligrams of calcium 500 magnesium Co Q 10 vitamin C omega-3 fatty acids are good recommendations and you have record of this in your chart I'm gentle breathing mindful practice I ask people what are they grateful for you know what's going well in their life and many people can't really think of what goes well they think about the problems but ask them what goes well in their life as well here's one of my sources of stress and he s my dog is the size of an eggplant he's pretty darn cute this is Lucy a pocket dog yeah interestingly enough hypertension versus blood pressure when patients here hypertension they think too much stress and so if you say you're you have high blood pressure that actually helps people to remember to take their medication with too much tension or hypertension people think I just need to relax more so the words that you use make a big difference there I'm finding a right balance and then here's your powerful message and that is first of all give them the assurance that they can manage this let them know point blank that you have faith in their ability to manage their condition and sometimes outline it you have good family support you find solutions to your own problems you have the resources that you need outline why it is that you believe they can handle your message reflect back what they say so that they know you're listening whatever possible show them what you're teaching not just talk to them like not just say go for a walk show them what this is and then have them show you what they learned whether this is how to use a blood pressure cuff correctly and this is called a teach back approach and it's actually very important I'm given instructions at an appropriate literacy level and patients will recall what's said in a medical office just make sure it's the message that you want them to take with them generally people will forget half of what's being said by the time they get to their car ok half so assume that half your message will be lost right away so drill your your points your pearls home such as hypertension is very serious it's also very treatable reducing sodium is a very effective change focus on real food give your patients realistic tools include physical activity in your recommendations be an example for your patients and also keep joy in flavor in your daily life and also in your patients take-home messages I've just 1/2 a moment I'll run through this real quick here's a case study it's just 49 year old woman Tracey's five foot five and it just all 222 pounds she has type 2 diabetes hypertension sleep apnea low vitamin D she lives with her husband and two kids for ages 14 and 17 works full-time at a sedentary job many lost you know unsuccessful diets she likes to cook but said she has no time for food preparation she wants to make lifestyle changes before adding or increasing any medication and what would you recommend here's a list of her medications some hydrochlorothiazide lisinopril metformin thyroxine and also some vitamin D so two things first of all what questions would you ask her yes or what would you recommend what would you give to her if she's been scripted sleep apnea I hunt I mean if she if she's using her CPAP that's a very important question does she walk during the day it's a great one a lot of times people think that exercise means either going to the gym or wearing little white shorts around the high school track it's like no yes what's her rules what's her goals that's an excellent question what does she want for herself yes he can build on that her own challenges are what are her challenges I appreciate that yeah cuz she'll not for herself that either you know she'll say money is tight or kids have whatever problems or whatever it is so she'll when she identifies her own challenges then you can use that as a way we'll work around right who does the shopping maybe her 17 year old can go with her dad to do the shopping or something like that so those are really wonderful questions to ask but I think that a couple things that you brought out is you know what's going on now what are the problems what are your goals whether your capacity and also I would say what do you love you know what are five vegetables that you'd had in the past three weeks that you really like go for the ones that you like you know is there a way to use a crock-pot or to cut veggies or these other things to make it realistic and practical good thank you very much we got a couple of minutes if it sounds good to everybody I wanted to also extend an invitation back to our other presenters just to come up and everyone just have a chance if there's a question anyone had they still wanted we have a couple minutes we can maybe do a little Q&A by all means we we can certainly take advantage of that if everyone's game I would mention too that I did bring announcements for the Hawthorne diabetes group it's just out just south of 28th and Hawthorne you're welcome to take this and on my website there's links to all of these on different materials so via feel free to pick up this deck it's got all the links to different handouts and bibliographies on here as well in recent times there's been some controversy about the pyramid pyramid haha in terms of stats [Music] the food pyramid was changed a few years ago so it's now it has the pyramid up it has a guy running up the side who you seen the guy running up the side of the food pyramid which so I think that one actually is much better we do know now that we used to say that fat turns to fat it's as simple as that so now we know that there's good fats and not-so-good fats and basically the quality oils that were discussing here I tell patients is like wd-40 for your heart so and we want to get those good quality oils in in order to help lose weight and improve metabolic function so the fats are actually a really important part the food pyramid it's true that I think it has strengths but I think it's limited on my handout reference there's some guidelines for dr. wilds anti-inflammatory food pyramid which is really wonderful and I think that's the one that more and more people are utilizing so is the anti inflammatory pyramid thanks for asking that was part of the guidelines that came out through the Mediterranean diet because they use full fat yogurt ooh hold that kefir and so it's just the whole thing over kefir not the whole milk there's actually some controversy depends on who you're talking for about yeah there's a lot of saturated fat that okay yes so I've been telling them so the question is whether if money is tight canned vegetables are available does rinsing produce produce coming out of a can cut down the sodium absolutely it's tremendously beneficial yeah I've been handing about I deliver on the side I do the seniors you know just their lunches at times for Adelle they they got these plastic fits every size cam in it so I women with arthritis and make sure so they fill it up with water flip it over two or three times and just princess it all out so for those at a distance there at the dollar store they have a little sieve or a strainer that you can put on top of a can and be able to rinse off the salt as well as the sugar from can produce it's a really good idea good good additional okay I guess we're good [Applause]", "4AIAdjvu4N4": "there's like not even a slight taste Wow hey youtube today we are reviewing spoken by loud pack and Smokies they're edibles that are sour blue raspberry and we have what's the other one we had our watermelon focus there we go look at that wow so pretty and you're so pretty - baby look it so we're gonna try one of each it's the other taste and then update few hours down the line see how it was let's try it watermelon window vegan and there where'd you find that oh yeah yeah they're both vegan they're both being and their dairy-free how do you open this Oh locate two green lines locate tab and pull towards the side of the bad boy how do you open that how do you open it so easily leave that how did yours look like this oh wow it's like really it's like a booty song we kind of look like those son kids like with warm Sun yes you know green reminds me of the peach a movie they say bud Wow Wow that's really good fire they taste like those found like the sour patch kids on occasion they do softener I have had Wow he stays really good touch smokey these are probably some of the best gummies I have so blue if it focuses I don't even know ready all right well this is kind of like mid video so the last video got cut off because of me being stupid and putting this too close and then it didn't or the camera being stupid cuz it didn't focus back in on our pretty faces so it's actually the cameras fault not my fault but anyway so we're just hi I decided to do it in like better lighting and redo it a little bit so you can see it all better see our faces better but this is the Smoky's blackberry I found out that loud pack it's only made with loud pack in California if it's an Oregon or like some other places made with some other distributor so depending where you live changes who makes it kind of so I don't know that makes me wonder if it's like different quality do you want to rip it open do you want to do the honors that's terrible yeah they're like make it okay purplish I know I like it never goes back again thank you how many we having - okay this time we're gonna update all three you're gonna have for for which is it's a little of 40 milligrams 40 milligrams and then we'll update we're about to watch Hellraiser and then clean our cars so we're gonna clean our cars and watch how rays and we'll update you through the process but uh cheers guys [Music] they're so nice just even as a regular candies I'd eat them like even if these how many day - right they do kind of look like morning regatta maybe I'm having 80 milligrams you sure 80 calories are you sure you way late to film yeah I'm sure eighty calories of glycerin of corn syrup of corn syrup and dextrose do you think that's really good tell me ladies cool see what happens now let's go watch Hellraiser are we gonna duck couldn't cursors oh yeah well it's still light out painter cars I've been probably update turning Hellraiser update so it's been about what an hour-ish maybe about two hours two hours yeah how's the edible feel I feel productive I know I felt pretty like lit but productive I feel like so we cleaned the car and we cleaned the car we clean the living room we clean the bathroom I clean the player with the girl we went to eat well yeah but that was earlier by like since we took the edible and now we're about smoke but yeah I feel like pretty productive not tired like though so we're gonna smoke and anyway yeah we're probably gonna update after we watch how we raise or something so far so good so beautiful baby [Music] long as it then three hours I'd say it's been pretty productive three hours I made some dink so meal it's oatmeal art and inside this peanut butter and doing stuff and it's like layered but the outside is that they just look like candy Cantonese - yeah they do the packaging gon point that tastes at some point like if you saw this on the counter you know these yeah take these oh we should take these to the movies 30 milligrams does the temper better [Music] what would you recommend this oh yeah for sure ten Blake a lot of scale to one detail [Music] recommending this like never or would you recommend this like everyone who smokes weed probably at night yeah because some people can't handle it but if you can't handle it alone these are definitely not or even this everybody yeah see you there go yeah we'll be fine I unpacked some packs of these because the flavors you got terminal anyway good job Smokies good job lab pack a plus or at least an 8.5 co-host which is a very fine I give it I'm working anyway oh yeah I did [Music] so depending on the flavor but overall I think their flavors are really cool and they have a bunch of different options chances are out of all of their options they're gonna like at least one of the flavors yeah that's definitely a good beginner so yeah I'm just quite exciting [Music] so we're gonna take off we can go on a walk and I have a send rest of our day so you should have a Zen rest of your day to do and comment your favorite [Music] I guess why not just comment your favorite out of it we'll just call me whatever you like the most and the craziest terrible story or at least impact [Music] a lot of crazy yeah Meitner probably be when I took the 5150 me curls apart and ended up on a doom starving [Music] that was little curly things and it does that it was one of those for $20 you're getting a really high-quality edible the flavor and everything is on point well we'll see you about the effects I guess what I'm excited yay we should take these in movies though definitely yeah let's do it or at least before is no if we do is doing movies by the time the movie ends will just be stupidly just eating the whole pack of it yeah", "TLJAD3uMWTA": "what's up guys welcome to Austin blood is asking drugs ASMR edition alright what's up guys welcome to hospital bugs and dad today we got something new that I've never really tried I've only tried a little bit but never really got the full length experience but anyway what we're trying today some are [ __ ] edibles but bowel cancer so what we got today I never tried this before I'm using uh-oh so the reason one is so [ __ ] bright right here is because I have a little lamp and that has a connect to it that's why I clamped it onto my tripod and so I'm just using the edge of my camera right here I mean on my desk I'm using the edge of my desk to hold the tripod and I'm just blocking in my room cuz right now it's like 1:30 in the morning I'll get back to y'all in an hour [Music] [Applause] let me do some research on this [ __ ] before I get [ __ ] [ __ ] hey Manny Pacquiao all right guys so now it's 4:00 in the morning and I still don't feel nothing so I'm gonna take a half of another we'll keep y'all updated [ __ ] if anything I still got this bad boy right here but yeah I'm gonna kick back watch moo tang and I'll keep you posted okay guys so this is an update of Houston's tank he's still asleep right here so he babe he buried uh what he buried himself actually I'm just gonna give him 48 to 72 hours to get acclimated to his tank because it does it is stressful getting put in a new environment which is totally understandable for reptiles such as him so yeah hopefully later on today it'll be out walking around in [ __ ] and so tomorrow we're gonna go get them a new UVB light although they don't need a UVB light they do seem to like it and so if you get too hot in this little rock right here he can always walk to this hide right here which is a little half tree we're still waiting for these edibles to hit and I'll be back all right guys so they have a serious talk real quick right now it's 6:00 a.m. been awake all day this is why I never really wanted to try edibles cuz I wouldn't I didn't want to spend money on something that I didn't know was gonna work on me or not because I have read some people there's some weird reason don't don't feel anything so they get no side effects or anything and I'm guessing what I'm one of those people cuz I didn't get any side effects I've I mean I've eat brownies before I know that I do get high off right homey brownies again I ate up around 2:30 it's now 6 a.m. and only how I feel it's from the last joint I just had the high I'm feeling now is from the previous joint I wrote and it's not secret there's another joint that I just wrote this was a review on the edibles I'm gonna read it as 0 today whoa it's rated at 303 just because it did taste pretty good I guess nice pretty big chunky piece of candy it was pretty good has its highs like I could rate it because I thought about getting another pen but I literally saw that said they I got it yeah it's gonna be it for long 20 I'm sure we also watched for my day one stop [ __ ] which are heavy a.m. and if you're new to the channel make sure to hit the bell button so you can see we're not upload a video hit the subscribe and always make sure to watch my videos and

you're doing absolutely and and well thank you thank you for that compliment which i really take to the heart but also you know as that in the time so we've talked i've understood through your clinical lens and your work at the doc games clinic and also your book um you know that you've noticed this connection yourself and i would love to get some some of your examples of that um that could be helpful to our listeners and our followers here very much so so i actually wrote in 2013 i ended up publishing a book the omni diet um so and yeah a lot of people thought that i wrote it because i was a nurse and it was what i do at the clinics and it ultimately became what i do at the clinics right but i started out as a trauma nurse and it's interesting that i chose trauma because um my life was really interesting i have a new book coming out in january called the reluctant called the relentless courage of a scared child and um yeah so it's about overcoming trauma fear anxiety grief um and so when i wrote the omni diet i i didn't actually start out on that journey to help other people it was a journey to help myself as many of you that's true yeah it became this organic natural progression and when we started to see how it worked in our family we started planting it in the clinics and it was just astounding our best testimonials come from people who change their diet who get their diet right wow so i said you know besides my nursing education i spent about 300 hours um you know educating myself through functional medicine and medical medicine absolutely important these days exactly that's fantastic i love that i love sharing the backstory to any of these sort of beautiful books that come out and really things that are useful to others and i know you have that mission as well um what were the things that you noticed around specific foods because i had a really interesting conversation with you recently and i've seen this in so many of my patients who have relatives they will say that a certain food that their brother had or their sister or their mama their dad had a complete and it's a healthy food they had a completely different response to you know speaking to the whole microbiome and sort of our unique responses and more personalized medicine but looking at a functional approach um can you can you share that with us as well absolutely so we actually have functional medicine doctors and natural paths work with us at amen clinics and part of the reason for that is because it's just such a huge part of getting well it's you know there's this gut brain connection which you talk about so beautifully you speak up so beautifully in your book um and when i when i actually interviewed you and we've been talking about that for a while and a lot of people are like what my gut my brain understands right but we find that when people get their gut right things are better when people come in we will often put them on an elimination diet initially and it's not because we think everyone should have the same diet they shouldn't just like you just said it's very personalized we'll actually test the blood we do all these tests on you the reason we do the elimination diet is to start from ground zero right so we do an elimination diet we cut out the the most common culprits which are dairy gluten sugar soy corn and as soon as i give that list processes everybody looks at me like deer in the headlights they're like that's everything in my house so that's one of the reasons i wrote this book and then i followed it up with a cookbook the brain warrior's great cookbook right because it actually gives people tips about how to implement things and make it easy right on a budget it's like this is this one was written for it's it's um 125 recipes for the 80d single mom who doesn't have money and has four kids awesome don't listen i show those overlaps with our books so yeah i think i i think that's so helpful your recipes are amazing um so yeah that was exciting to see that's awesome the um you know i think the guthrie connection is not something that all practitioners are embracing i think that that some i i think and i should say that differently in terms of mental health i think that people know medically that there is this connection and more research is burgeoning in the area but people are not necessarily connecting it to mental health and i think that that was why um you dr amen myself had a really helpful and useful conversation because there are people who are not making those connections and we are seeing it in mental health yes you are seeing it in your clinic you are seeing people heal i've had patients present with panic i've had patients present with really overwhelming levels of ocd that they were still functioning but it was distracting them it was making it making life uncomfortable to live and when when we looked at it in a broader spectrum way and looked at a more personalized approach and and sometimes it is in in it sometimes it's eliminating glutamate foods and msg from their diet but they didn't realize there was a connection that was driving those symptoms so i think that that is just a fascinating part of the work um now you you talked about a food last week that you tried and your daughter had a different uh was it last week of the week before i'd love i'd love to hear you tell us about that because so many people experience that and then they think that it's not related to the gut microbiome or that they wonder why it's happening yeah well and then i think you know the gut microbiome i think now is getting this you know a huge amount of attention whether or not medical our mental health practitioners are embracing it it's happening maybe a little too slowly but it's at least getting attention but once it is we've been talking about for a long time is food and mood and that's why we say that everything everyone's not the same everybody is everyone's individual not only are we going to test your numbers to see where your decision is we're going to put to on elimination diet and then slowly introduce foods back in to see which ones work best for you but in addition to that we want to know your brain type and here's why because there are certain foods that increase serotonin like carbohydrates increase the availability of serotonin it gives you this quick sort of feel good don't worry be happy feeling why if you think about it women on pms women's pms well why don't we reach for a glass of wine in a bar of chocolates right exactly but but on the flip side of that that people who have really bad adv having trouble focusing that's the wrong thing for them to reach for even smart carbohydrates they want to like really watch the amount they're eating when i say smart carbohydrates i'm referring to things like sweet potatoes the coffee muscles carbohydrates yeah right the ones that break down more slowly and don't create a yo-yo effect with our blood sugar right and so we would say you want to focus more those people with lacking focus want to focus more on a higher protein still lots of fiber lots of fruit vegetables yeah right but less than the amount of of starchy carbohydrates increase the amount of healthy fat and protein because it increases dopamine and focus so a perfect example i do best on a paleo version of keto okay it's like go goat cheese is fine but other than that no dairy um and no gluten but very keto high fat but healthy fat no trans fats like avocados nuts seeds that kind of olive oil some type of diet we talked about when we interviewed you yes and so very i mean we are like literally perfectly in alignment so i do best on that diet but with very little fruit like i want very little things that have even been even berries which i love a little bit but that's about it yeah that's about it yeah my daughter when she tried to do that program was neurotic because but when you look at our brain scans my brain is sleepy i have sleepy frontal lobes she is almost verging on ocd so she began to spin on thoughts that bothered her when she doesn't get any carbs she's not she's guessing right wow that's that's fascinating and you saw it on a brain scan which i thought was magnificent because it's it's not just that you know someone reported the symptom or told you how they're feeling you actually saw the changes on the brain scan which i i really think is and thank you for sharing that you know i think it's absolutely true because i i i read that post and i've written written and read about this as well i think that when people have you know um they have a moment of something fun that they're eating but they're eating it all the time they think well why is my doctor telling me to stop i feel good when i eat it i hear this all the time you know i feel good when i have whatever that snack is and what i explained to them is is exactly what you just described you will feel good because the serotonin that's responsive and you're responding in your brain but over time it's going to harm your brain and it's been shown on brain scans and it's going to add up and your cognition could be impacted as well as your mood so you know these are the things that we talk about the pillars of things that you build in the and the things that you remove for example there was a study of um trans fats that showed that the people who ate more trans fats had more aggression and in this day and age with with everything going on that is not something that we want for our brains or bodies so you know simple those simple changes adding back things like the rainbow colors of fruit and vegetables and i like the berries you know i i think their food are delicious i like to suggest to people that they use small amounts of fruit in a fun dessert that they want to make but by adding in fruit you're avoiding you know just plain white sugar and you using a fruit sauce to sweeten and that's your treat you know that's that's what you enjoy and so if you have a high glycemic fruit that's added in um say to a watermelon pop and we have some of these and you know in the in the recipes that's fine you know have it that day but it's not every day and you're still not adding in a ton of you know just plain cane sugar which is not good for your brain but you're adding in less um less sugar that way by having a healthier form or the other thing we talk about is eat the orange and skip the oranges again because of the added sugar that's hidden right and it's just one way to convey to people that's how you get your fiber your nutrients your vitamins your minerals and you get the whole you get the whole fruit rather than something that's juiced um now i had a question for you do you have a fun a favorite smoothie that you like i do so for the kids i will add more fruit to it okay so we've got kids and they're doing schoolwork and i've got two kids in our house who have very very busy brains and one who has a brain like mine that's a little more sweet okay so the two kids who have sleep who have busier brains i'll put a little bit of banana in it like a third of a banana and some um whole like some raw cacao that kind of stuff yes yes popular one yeah and some almond butter and they love that but for the two of us that have more sleepy brains i put a lot of fat so i'll put some either some nct oil or coconut butter and then i'll put some extra fiber acacia fiber okay i will add yeah and i'll add protein powder to all of them obviously a plant-based protein powder and then i add about a cup of greens but i only put about a half cup of berries yeah so i'll do like and i'm okay with berries it's just i know i personally feel better when i limit the amount of dessert um we make actually a chocolate bar because of this reason that you just talked about our sugar-free dairy-free chocolate bar that has 11 grams of fiber and so i find that when i eat like that it's very satisfying right a couple little tiny squares are enough so i came up with a recipe for something called nutty butter squares almond butter and the if it's dark chocolate chocolate cows it'll satisfy you absolutely and and that's what all but so many my patients say that as they as they start to embrace you know i always say the darker the better and then give them those rules tell them the brain science behind it but they actually learn that if they can sort of get off of that super sweet um palette of candy bars and start to switch to darker and darker they they do it gradually dark and darker chocolate they taste much changing they actually really enjoy it they love it and um they find that they you know they eat much less chocolate they're not going through two candy bars instead they're eating a couple of squares maybe a little you know piece of a mandarin orange or something like that and they you know because that pairs so beautifully and they're completely satisfied they're not looking for the type of ice cream or the unhealthy snacks that you know that they shouldn't be so i think um i i think it's all about uh i'm sure and i'm sure certainly you did this in your cookbook as well it's about providing some of those tweaks for people so they know from you know from your office or from the amen clinics that they can leave and they can they know what to do you know people always saying what's the one thing i can do and i always go back to sometimes i go to the spice because i do think that more people can add turmeric and a pinch of black pepper into everything they do because i think it has so many benefits but at the same time there's some simple things like eat your fruit and vegetables you know small amount of berries are my favorite fruit but eat all of those vegetables because you're just going to get in the fiber that you need um the beans are seeds legumes and healthy whole grains but do it in a way because it's going to heal your microbiome because none of us have a perfect microbiome you know we all we all try to keep that balance and avoid dysbiosis so a simple thing someone can do is you know just have more have salad with a healthier dressing you know vinaigrette with three three ingredients you know oil red wine vinegar olive oil red wine vinegar salt and pepper just a simple thing instead of buying store-bought dressing which you know is just full of additives and dyes and salt and sodium and sugar and that way you're just making it a healthier change or adding vegetables to your dinner you know but whatever your favorites are you know daniel took my copy of your book your book's amazing and what i loved about your book the most both of us were looking through the recipes the brain on food is an amazing book completely in alignment with what we do and what i loved is your recipes in there were unbelievably simple yes so um that's so when i first started when i first wrote my books i was really one of those like everything has to be 100 perfect pure like these very like exotic ingredients nice and i but then i realized oh this is just not realistic okay so for a number of reasons yes it might work it's not but if it doesn't if people can't access it or they just either can't afford it or they just can't find it it doesn't matter and so what i loved about your book was that the unbelievable simplicity of it so what i find at the clinic and what i love about what you do um we have our patients are complicated they're psychiatric patients they're not straightforward exactly you're like you're a psychiatrist so they're complicated they want to do well but it's gotta be simple so it's gotta be simple exact side of that is um the flip side of that is they there are some people who struggle because they just can't seem to break their addictions and you got to work a little harder there are other people who want to do it they will do it right they need to know what you can do exactly and so like just tell me what to eat right now exactly you do a great job of that i love my turn board is replaced on a race but you do a great job of like switch dairy for almond milk which you know exactly tell people what those replacements are and by doing that it really helps people just like make that quick exactly and one of our doctors he was fantastic he did nothing but take that list with him to the grocery store and he ended up losing 40 pounds wow so because i don't have time to do anything else exactly it's too many it's too many things i totally agree and and the other thing we did is we tried to like you said johanna you've shared with me before this very specific diet that works for you what we're trying to do is make it you know as a and you know this tana as a psychiatrist whether someone walks in and has a paleo diet or a keto diet or is gluten free or is a carnivore in terms of what they eat i i've got to still embrace whatever it is to find a healthy plan to help them heal through using nutrition and mental health and so you know what i often say is in the recipes we you know yes we have things that are not plant-based we have things that are plant-based but here's the thing you know if you see a salmon a baked salmon recipe you can do that with a cauliflower steak you know you can do that with cauliflower florets so there's always a way that you can change it up to suit your diet you know and it's it's really about the fact that when you start to embrace healthy ingredients across the board all the things you can tolerate you know obviously if you're allergic to something you know then you can't do it but that way you just you're just making those healthier changes and i find with with the clients that i see the moment that they start to feel better doing one thing it kind of can sometimes be something as simple as you know i'm gonna cut back from three um sodas a day whether they diet or not to one and drink more water sometimes it's you know it's not necessarily a food itself but it's cutting back on something and they will come back and say you know i i think i want to do more because i'm starting to feel lighter or i have more energy or i'm you know i'm not feeling like a sugar crash in the middle of the day and i'm not then going to the vending machine for a bag of pretzels you know i'm finding that i can i can have more even evened out way um do you have uh do tana do you have a favorite uh go-to meal that you that you you know will make you feel happy will make you feel less anxious make you feel less stressed or just something that you enjoy oh geez i have so many so we really like food in this house one of the favorites yeah so one of the favorites for all of us that's just so simple is salmon yeah just a simple baked salmon um you know we always just throw some a lot of greens with it so maybe asparagus or broccoli and a big salad um but for us because we are so busy we really try to keep it simple like that absolutely and that's why even my own recipes i came up with some great recipes and i don't really those aren't the the exotic ones aren't the ones i use but i love things like um like a turkey bolognese but then yes like we're replacing all the ingredients and i used a spaghetti squash for the pasta or zucchini yeah um pasta um types of things yeah those make me feel good i keep the tomato sauce on the light side right for myself because of the sugar right and so yeah and so those are some of my favorites yes fish and things like that are some of our favorites and then when we do tacos we just use lettuce wraps exactly that's that's one of my um i love using uh lettuce cups too instead of a wrap it makes it makes it still equally delicious you still get all the flavors in plus you're adding back in greens that's one of my favorites my other favorite is yeah so what i love so much though is i i'm just amazed and i'm actually sort of fascinated that you're a psychiatrist who decided to become a like a chef and become like like that to me is like the perfect combination oh thank you i i think that's the way for the future well i i hope so you know it as as as i've told you before um or we've talked about it really was the passion project for me it was well julie child is my food hero and she did this later in life so after residency you know packed up my bags and like you know i think i can do this if i can just figure out my schedule uh how how will it work for me but again there's this interesting thing that i i wish i could say i had a grand plan about it it i was following things that i love to do but i also really cared what my patients were eating because i knew that they were suffering with side effects and like you said you know these are not individuals who um have a little bit of worry they they stressed they they having problems with major medications that if they weren't taking they they would be seriously ill so you i early on in my career i worked in forensic psychiatry and i dealt with very severe mental illness and that's why i saw some of the most devastating side effects and so it really brought back that conversation from residency about what can we do differently you know that hospital food is terrible i mean across i have yet to find a hospital where the food is good for any in any department any unit so i think that you know it had to be something that i was doing in the outpatient setting and and trying to share recipes and that's when it started occurred to me well why can't i say well you could do this with your smoothie and i think what culinary school did for me is fulfill that passion around food because of course we love to eat as well but then it helped me find the language to simplify things and i know what you said i love to make much more complicated recipes but the truth is what someone needs is i need to know how to make an egg scramble in a mug and take it to work you know i love it i think that was you had one with some um i think it was either raw or goat milk yogurt that just looked amazing to me there was something a very quick one exactly just quick and easy you know that you can grab and go and and stuff that that either you can prep ahead or that you you know and by the way what i love to do with the egg scramble is i i make them throw in tons of spinach and chopped veggies like the leftover roasted veggies from the night before can go on the egg scramble you know so it's just adding back but but you know those are those are just a little the little uh the little tips and tricks do you have a favorite tea that you like to drink i do i'm drinking it now it's green tea drinking i just i and it's it's hydrating but it's also it's kind of cute i kind of keeps me sharp you know the um the polyphenols keep me sharp so exactly people say that a lot and it's it's a good it's actually a good plan so much better than i like coffee and coffee is good on many levels but i have it in the morning um and then switched to tea so i have like a quarter cap in the morning because if i have too much caffeine i'm i'm hyperthyroid so that would be yeah that can be yes so um i want to say one thing is i want to first of all just i still appreciate you having me on and interviewing me but oh my goodness i just want to take a minute because you're i feel like a rising tide floats all boats and i just was so like impressed by your book by the simplicity of it you have that gift that my husband has which is taking really complex information and making it simple and so your book this is your brain on food i was really impressed um you know for being a psychiatrist you know this harvard trained psychiatrist i i was really impressed that you took this information you really simplified it you put really easy recipes because just to reiterate that this our best testimonials come from people who change their food yeah absolutely it's such an important concept and this book is really important thank you yeah and i love one thing another thing you said when we interviewed you and i've said this for a long time is people will like jump all over you if you make a comment you make a statement about hell based on the research people that jump all over you when when that's wrong and it's like is it wrong or did they just update the research right exactly it changes all the time yeah yeah don't be attached to your message be attached to the education and the learning absolutely and so i love that you follow that and i love your book is like literally in alignment with everything we do you just have newer research and i just i love that so it'd be updated all the time and it's a similar thing you know i love the books that you and dr amon have written as well and i do feel aligned and i i thank you for saying that because you know things change minute by minute um things change all the time and when we use instagram a lot um in terms of updating people about the new research and then providing the link so if someone really is you know nutrition nerds like we are they can go read it but then they know the summarized tips that they can take home because research is changing all the time and i think that you know we come to it with humility we're not saying to you you know you have to eat 10 carrots and 10 cans is going to cure your mood by two points that's why the plan is is has a lot of general principles has food lists of things to embrace has food lists of things to avoid and then recipes to match that because we know that things change all the time and it's not that anything that book will be you know will be will make you toxic or make you sick and that's always what i feel very strongly about regarding good nutrition unless you're allergic or have an absolute medical intolerance to something would say something like celiac disease you're not going to get sick eating food you know there may be something else going on and then you need to speak to your doctors about it but that you know eating a little bit more turmeric is not going to harm you eating you know for more vegetables is not going to hurt you so i think it's that general principle with which we try to lead and understanding that you know tomorrow says someone says oh this was wrong we have another we can look at the research we can provide information for you and take it from there um but it's a you know it's a general it's a general way to feel better and and with that there's very specifics with each condition like you know the nitrates and depression people don't always know that and so someone who thinks that they're taking this meal prepping and taking a great healthy whole wheat wrap to work every day but they're putting in a deli meat that has nitrates is actually driving their depression so it's those little things that people just need to know that are helpful but but i just loved having you and i'm so glad that you found the time because i know that you are a very busy lady and um and and so we thank you and and always grateful to talk to you and just you know love your message as well so thank you and i would love to you know what i would love to do i love at some point um i know we can't do it live maybe we could do it together on um zoom yeah a along would be fun you know that's a great idea yeah we can do one recipe so i'm not going to do that we can do it from your kitchen to mine i'd love that that's a good idea i'm going to take you up on that time you're going to find me emailing you tomorrow morning so when do you want to do that triple log i'd love that we actually you know we're having uh we we launched today a brain um a brain food challenge uh to to our followers which is you know getting the book trying out a recipe tagging your friends and so just just to see if people are liking it and if they're enjoying the recipes because again it's you know we're not teaching souffle uh we just we just want you to have a healthy breakfast and have a have you know a good day of good meals so right and i think it's one of the points is that you don't have to be a chef exactly exactly you don't you know that's the that's the whole point but it was so lovely to see you my best to dr eamon and all of your family and thank you for spending the time with us we just love having you on take good care tana bye bye", "3rrc_cgSkwQ": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode we are not going to be reviewing a product instead we're going to be talking about news news and very sad news at that and that is that the edible Bonanza the edible crazy wonderful Wild West market in California is coming to an end as we know it January 1st I believe of 2018 the new regulations go into effect for both medicinal and recreational weed in the state of California and one of those major major changes coming to to the marijuana industry at large is headed headed straight for the edible industry in a really really really devastating way so what is changing one one thing makes sense and that's no more edibles that are shaped like kids candy that makes sense to me nothing you know no gummy shaped things no cartoon shaped things nothing with a cartoon mascot that'll make sense that all that all makes perfect sense to me and I'm totally ok with that but the far more devastating in the far more far-reaching consequences are gonna come in from the limits of THC henceforth each package each product can only be a hundred milligrams in total and can only have 10 milligrams of THC per serving so let me let's let's let's put that in perspective that means that you could only have a brownie can't even be a hundred milligrams it has to be cut up into ten squares of ten milligrams each and the whole thing can only be a hundred milligrams how they're gonna price these things I have no idea if they're going to be commensurate with the prices we see for 100 milligram edibles now or if they're just going to be more expensive what this does to the folks who really need those high you know folks with high high tolerances you know focuses with cancer diabetes terminal illnesses that rely on these high potency edibles for their pain and killing needs I don't know what they're gonna do it's again it's a it's a crippling blow to patients and it's equipping Bluett I assume to the industry they're gonna have to completely change the way that they operate here in California no company that I know of operates in that mode right now everybody has much more higher potency edibles and they're not divided into ten milligram parts in any way shape or form I'm just trying to think of the production and logistics work that's gonna have to go into these companies to change up their products and their formulas something like a kiva like how are they gonna break down their 180 milligrams chocalate bar and I take it back I have seen one company that's already seems to be on their way to figuring that out and that is kirova if you go to their website you can see where they now have many cookies and 100 milligram packages I assume they are coming out with this products just in preparation for the regulations but what everybody else is going to do that don't have the resources of say a you know a Korova to to shift like that to to completely change their production line the way they do everything III got to assume that's going to put them in a you know in dire financial straits so it's gonna be a big big change come January 1st and I still actually have lots and lots of questions about this so I don't know if first off everything I've read and I will provide links below I'll provide links in the description to everything I've read including the actual if I can find it the actual statute itself but right now I've seen on High Times and on Leafly and a couple other places summaries of the new regulations that are going to affect and these are definitely happening but I cannot find clear evidence on whether or not this is also going to affect medical market whether or not this is only going to affect for the recreational market or whether this is pan market and it's going to both recreational and and medicinal so I don't know I don't know if it takes what happens to all the old stock come January first if everything has to be tossed out or if there's a grace period i I have I have tons of questions left and if you are say a dispensary owner who is in the know if you're somebody who has any kind of knowledge of the cannabis law in California please hit me up I would love to talk to you on the show so we can clarify some of these laws you can email me at you can it mean weeks a tweets reviews.com or weeks reviews at gmail.com you can hit me up on twitter or facebook please get in touch with me again if you have any additional knowledge on this I would love to get in contact with you I feel terribly terribly for all of the patients that are gonna have to completely change their sort of regimen for for edibles I know a lot of patients already have their favorite edible that they you know dose themselves have everything perfectly set up to help them get you know escape their pain huh I'm I'm I'm bummed out myself um I'm not sure what what we're gonna do here a tweets we'll figure it out we'll still be reviewing edibles for sure and I'm sorry I've been away a lot recently been very busy but rest assured new reviews will be coming but as to what we're going to do January 1st we'll continue to review edibles but it's gonna have to be a change for us as well here at wheats so again guys just to reiterate come the beginning of the year the edible market that we know and love in California is going to a revocable II and in my opinion a revocable change for the worse come January 1st it's it's it's it's not going to be the this sort of great place that it was before I mean I of course it had problems the edible market like all markets had problems but I think these these new regulations are are an atrocity frankly and I hope I hope this state will we'll see the error of their ways rather quickly and and things can get back to normal but just wanted to give you guys a heads up and again if you know anybody or if you yourself know any of these laws anymore please hit me up I would love to talk to you and we can get this further clarified so guys that's going to do it for this episode here on wheats sorry for the bummer of the news hopefully things will change but for now that looks like it's the way it's going to be thank you so much for watching waits and we will see you on a future video peace", "7sa9zXckCLs": "hello everyone we are back with yet another episode here of wheats today we are taking a look at a new Buddhist best product we've got the Buddhist best 300 milligram triple chocolate brownie us this is the second Buddha's best product that I have reviewed I looked at the chocolate lover's ecstasy cookie before this also 300 milligrams really really liked it so I've got high hopes for this triple chocolate raspberry brownie let's take a look here standard packaging be sure to refrigerate it says again very nice of Buddhas best to incorporate a nutrition information and ingredients on the back not something you see in all of the edibles ingredients gold medal bread flour butter brown sugar egg cocoa raspberry preserves milk chocolate whole milk powder cocoa sugar vanilla extract and salt so all pretty normal ingredients in there and it looks like the entire brownie has about 360 calories in total not that bad what let's go ahead and open this bad boy up and give ourselves a taste all right nice and easy to open package again you never know with these edibles if that's gonna be the case or not sometimes you need some scissors handy alright so here is our brownie not the most appetizing looking brownie admittedly it's got some white chocolate chips I guess there maybe this is the raspberry preserves smells like you can smell the raspberry you can definitely smell the raspberry and no disturb or weed smell no marijuana smell whatsoever all right well let's go to taste what a politician what you could definitely definitely do the raspberry but not an overpowering way and there's a there's definitely a hint of raspberry in there the chocolates good I got some chocolate chips or the Makani or the white chocolate chips in there as well very tasty and I don't get any hint of marijuana whatsoever in the the taste so you don't like the taste of marijuana wow that's pretty good okay it's a rich brown he's a fudgy air brownie um take me some effort to eat this bad boy um but in the taste spectrum I like it but because I prefer the chocolate lover's ecstasy cookie to this but you're not gonna be disappointed with this brownie for sure no weed flavor and just generally a pretty good taste um oh also just like the chocolate livers and will keep very affordable this brownies 300 milligram edible only cost me $10 just on the low end but I'm sure you can find it for you around you know 12 to 15 bucks but yeah clip one very important duties bus well okay yeah I found this bad boy in a dispensary and Huntington Beach which is in Orange County California I think they're Buddha's best is pretty widely distributed at all um but as we know from all our earlier reviews the most important thing when it comes to an edible is not actually how it tastes it's how you feel afterwards and like miss my rubies I'll check back with you guys in half an hour and an hour and an hour or in two hours unless you know how we're feeling I'm gonna finish this bad boy off and I'll see you guys in half an hour hi guys so we are back here with our review of the Buddhist best triple chocolate raspberry brownie it has been 30 minutes since I have consumed this bad way except that crumb I just got right there um 30 minutes it feeling a little bit definitely feeling something and definitely feeling it increasing the feeling amplifying um finish off that brownie still really really enjoyed it oh not as good as I think the Korova cookies in terms of the taste I mean it's good it's very good but but in terms of value you're certainly gonna get your money's worth so well we'll check back in half an hour and see how this 300 milligrams of THC is is hitting us is hitting us in another thirty minutes we will check back then alright well it has been one hour since I consumed the Buddhist best 300 milligram triple chocolate raspberry brownie medical cannabis with hybrid cannabis product and things are going pretty well I you know going on cloud nine my guys okay sorry back on track Buddha's best in an hour after this 300 milligram edible I mean mostly the effects in my in my head right now not a lot in the body but the highest come on pretty strong and we're only an hour in so I'm expecting this to really ramp up to the next hour and we'll be sure to check with you guys back in at the two-hour mark as always well it's been two whole hours since I consumed that Buddha's best and Wow guys yeah it's the real deal I to be frankly honest I wish I had the whole thing not because it wasn't good it was great I just feel the whole [ __ ] day shot now man but if you know you actually want with the serving suggestion which is like not a whole one of these like maybe you know a sixth few one with the sixth of these of this that would be a wise investment buyer beware not because it isn't good but because it's too good no it's just right just a word of warning guys always follow the directions on the package never take a dose higher than what the package or the person who sold it to you recommends unless you know your tolerance unless you have an incredibly tolerant high tolerance or you've tried the animal before never try a higher dose than it recommends if you liked this video please feel free to subscribe and if there are a procs you would like me to

the marijuana animal review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are talking about krispity krunch II no I'm just joshing with you we're not talking about Peter Barnes but I'm on camera one because they're good too because they're high in fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's hope against hope one last time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future

community guidelines so if you're not 18 please [ __ ] off of my video thank you let's have a nice day what is going on guys stony rob here back for another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day in today's video we're gonna be doing something that i have never ever done in my whole entire life and that's eating 500 milligrams of thc so i'll be eating these wonky cups there's 250 milligrams per cup there's two cups inside of this packaging which is basically like reese's cups with can of butter inside of it if we just look at the package the packaging of it is very very beautiful looks very very appetizing on top of that today i'm gonna go get my hair done like i'm gonna get it braided i'm gonna get a fade right so i'm gonna be either extra fried while all of that is going on or i'll just be feeling normal as [ __ ] i also got a timer going up so every 30 minutes approximately i'll be giving you guys a little update telling you guys how i'm feeling right now all that good stuff related to eating 500 milligrams so i want you guys to drop a like hit that subscribe button check out all my social media links are in the description down below check out the new discord server that i made just for you guys and without further ado let's eat these wonky cups alright guys i really really can't wait to open up these wonky cups and i just want to tell you guys that i didn't smoke before this so i am like basically 100 sober and i want to give you guys the 100 experience of what it's like taking 500 milligrams and now without further ado the thing that everybody's been waiting for let's open up these wonky cups all right i came back with a glass of water just so i can like properly digest this i'm going to open this bad boy up how do you open this this was my guess i knew it wasn't gonna be a reese's cup i knew it was gonna be like a piece of chocolate i really knew like i knew they couldn't give us a regular cup it had to be a chocolate so this is the first one let's take a bite out of it hmm really does taste like a reese's cup i will be starting the timer over here you know what i'm saying so it's been about four seconds give or take you know we're not gonna you know get angry for like 30 seconds right so i'll completely finish this one they really really did a good job this really tastes like the regular old thing it just doesn't have the same shape we got the other one as you can see they are pretty chunky right they do feel chunkier and bigger than a regular reese's puff but let's take another bite off of this one cheers taste as [ __ ] just amazing oh wow i feel as if i'm gonna struggle on the eating part more than the actual high all right let's get it i just hate peanut butter inside of that chocolate i'm really forcing myself to eat this it's like some people that don't like olives and they're like forced to eat it for science like my blood insulin levels just spike at this point it's been five minutes since i ate the first one really five minutes is a very negligible time so i'm gonna check back in about 25 minutes to 30 minutes and tell you guys how i feel obviously for those who don't know it takes about two hours for the effects to completely settle in give or take some people it takes three hours some people it takes an hour you know what i mean but for me generally takes about two hours two hours and a half if in like four hours i actually do not feel [ __ ] or like it just feels light it's either a i have to go on the tolerance break or b i'm just gonna spark up a fat ass blunt but we will see by then i am praying that this [ __ ] just gets me slumped on the couch or on the chair and yeah guys i'll check back in about 30 minutes all right we are 32 minutes in and i'm starting to feel a little bit of effects right it kind of feels like i just took a little bong grip you know a 0.2 gram or maybe i took a little hit off a wax pen in class that's the type of feeling i'm feeling right now generally you don't really feel the effects in just 30 minutes so i'll check back with you guys in another 30 minutes giving us an hour total [Music] we are about one hour and ten minutes in and i feel as if the effects kind of went away it's very weird to say like honestly it's it's just a little weird so like as of right now the effects have not really changed there isn't much difference besides the way i'm seeing things it's like there's this huge freaking like no actually you know what the effects have kind of increased i would be actually a liar to say that as i'm trying to speak right now i'm having a little bit of a hard time like knowing what to say it's just my thoughts are not popping up it's like i'm going blank every few seconds so as it's starting to slowly slowly creep up i can sense that this is going to be a heavy body buzz but overall up until now i still haven't felt the full effect so i'll catch you guys in another 30 minutes oh [ __ ] yo i was checking out mr thc's live right about now but damn god damn no cap the lab just ended it's been about an hour 46 minutes since i first ate approximately the first one give or take and hmm i'm starting to feel it my mans i'm starting to really really feel it it's kicking in it's like it's coming perfectly the feeling right about now is kinda like you know smoking a nice fat wood you know like that type of feeling right about now so for some that might be a lot for others and it might be just okay but really it just got me relaxed i'm fried i know my eyes are probably so like very very small right now like they're probably very very small i'm starting to see that i've gotten a little bit slower but yeah let's see in 30 minutes also in 30 minutes it's gonna be two hours and 15 minutes in i think it's gonna start kicking in more so i'll catch you guys in 30 minutes let's get it uh it's been 2 hours and 30 minutes landlord is leaving that's good for us we can now freely express ourselves in our true ways without arousing too many suspicions i am fried i have the pasties i'm having a hard time doing basic [ __ ] that i've done at least over a hundred times considering that i have over 100 videos like i was [ __ ] up you know did i save the file did i not save the file i was just going off my mind just focuses one second and then unfocuses goes blank and goes back let's play goes back that's all i can pretty much describe it that's the literally only way i can describe it actually you know what i'm about to go on the couch and just chill there let's get it [Music] holy [Music] all right i'm on the couch i just popped here and now looking at myself with better lighting i do look extra fried a few moments later six and a half hours later oh man god damn i don't know if y'all can see the damn time but it is 10 42 that is like approximately nine hours since i actually took the first edible and i woke up from i guess a cush coma that [ __ ] was just insane guys like i went to get my hair done as you can see i got my braid up i didn't get the lineup nor the fade yeah i'm gonna go do that tomorrow at 10 a.m but yeah i went to do this and i was just fried i was on the like barber chair and like my head was just bobbing down going all the way back left right like i was not there i didn't drive to go to the barber shop i walked and that was dreadful like i couldn't even stand up straight and right now i'm just feeling groggy and what better way than to take off the grogginess than to eat some off-brand mac and cheese um holy crap i can't wait to edit this video i don't know if it's going to be a long or a short one but i do hope you guys enjoyed this one because i really did enjoy doing this one this was a crazy crazy trip if you are a seasoned stoner then this is going to give you a nice nice buzz if you're a beginner stoner if you take 500 mgs trust me my man you're going to be fried to pluto you're going to be probably fried till the next day so beware but on that note thank you guys for watching the video if you enjoyed this video drop a like hit that subscribe button this is tony robb you guys know the drill um out",

gushers so uh let's check them out am i scared no i'm not really scared i'm excited a little bit let's see if i can take them all okay here's what they all look like out the pack so i guess let's just start eating them i'll do one out of time actually it tastes like real gushers like i was expecting it to be like a candy that just looked like it but it's definitely real and uh i think instead of playing with it let's just fast forward are all of them if you're interested in getting these you can get them in california or there's certain sites where you can order so i will say they taste super good they definitely taste like gushers can you taste the weed yeah a little bit but it's not like it's going to overpower it and make you not like it so i definitely recommend them definitely check them out and i just ate the whole pack like that so i'm about to go run some errands and uh i'll take the camera with me and stuff and then i'll give you like an update in about 30 minutes if um if i'm like feeling it or if it kicks in heavy or anything like that i've had friends who've had them let me say that they weren't good and they was i guess feeling them or whatever so i'll definitely let you know on the scale like one to ten how hard it works but a lot of edibles i've tried in the past they're kind of like i don't know if i really feel anymore if my mind is just telling me i feel them so yeah my tolerance is pretty high so we'll definitely see stay tuned i'll give you the update but there you have it the sour infused gushers the weed gushers 10 out of 10 on the taste um how the package looks and all that stuff i actually put mine in the refrigerator just to keep them like from milton stuff but i wouldn't say there's nothing bad about taste wise on it and yeah it contains marijuana so keep it away from children but you know if you're old enough check it out and i'll give you update in about 30 minutes so stay tuned okay i'm in the car now chilling and i will say i'm not like seeing cartoons or nothing but i'm definitely chilling i'm relaxed you know vibing or whatever just want to listen to music in a chill so yeah so far so good if it uh increases or anything i'll let you know but it's the 30 minute mark 20 minute mark definitely recommend it okay i'm back and this is gonna be to wrap it up with the uh sour infused gushers i'll give them a seven out of ten on like you know the scale of feeling it and stuff but on taste ten out of ten so if you ever run across them i recommend it if you want to order them you have to do it online and uh you can get them in california so if you live in that region check it out somewhere there but yeah doesn't she look cute look at her shirt well you can't see it it says got firm or something but in real life it says

"PkQBlqHrTjI": "yo guys what is going on seizure here welcome back to the video today we have a unboxing for you guys this is not g-fuel but if you guys uh saw the title of the video this is the uh um it's uh it's sour strips that's what this video is it's uh sour strips these i got a 12 pack they came out with a new flavor the flavor being um cotton candy so i got a 12 pack i think it comes with three of each flavor um i'm gonna review all of them for you guys right now i'm just making sure that i got all of them one two i'm missing one more this one the i think it only comes with one of each flavor two of each flavor yeah so it comes with two of each flavors um and here they are first one is a blue raspberry right there the next one is rainbow then we got strawberry and we got green apple you got tropical mango and then you got cotton candy cotton candy of course being their new flavor all right i'm gonna go through these uh in flavors that sound from from least appealing to most appealing to me that's what we're gonna do the ordering um so out of all those i would say least appealing to me probably would have to be the rainbow or the strawberry but i'm going to go with the rainbow first so here's the packaging uh they have like these little like angry caricatures on all of the different packaging um it says actual candy up here i think that's the the parent company the brand there's all the nutrition facts if you guys want to pause that uh to read all the nutrition facts but that's it best buy they have a expiration date and everything you can actually find these in stores they actually have a store tracker on their website i can link that down below in the description for you guys if you guys want to check them out um but we're gonna go ahead and have a rainbow one they're the strips are pretty long i think each package comes with about 15 strips or so um it comes with 12 strips so yeah like a dozen strips in each package i think this was for the 12 pack i think it was like 25 bucks so like it wasn't too expensive um i'm pretty sure it was 25 it might have been more i don't really remember um but it seems to be pretty cheap considering what it is so let's give the rainbow one a taste hmm i feel like there's a g fuel flavor that tastes just like this i'm trying to think what it was um i don't know it is definitely sour though the the sour the citric acid whatever's on it makes it very sour um but yeah that is the rainbow one we're gonna move on to the next one which is strawberry um yeah i really can't pinpoint what flavor that is um it almost tastes like peach rings that's what it almost tastes like like the p drinks candy or the of course petrings chief you'll drink um so next up we have strawberry have little angry strawberries on it it's a red strip nutrition facts i'm pretty sure all the nutrition products are the same for all the flavors um but yeah let's give this let's open this and then try it i really like this packaging too it's uh resealable um yeah the packaging is resealable so you can always go back to it later if you don't want to have it did i not rip this right i might not have ripped this right because it's not opening for me maybe that'll now let me open it maybe we'll see um wow i can't seem to open this let me get my knife and just see if i could here's a hole maybe see if we can actually get this open for you guys um wow um you see it says resealable but from the looks of it it doesn't even want me to open it in the first place there we go all right we got a strawberry open pull out one strip of the strawberry right there like i said covered in like sour sugar let's give this a taste hmm that one's not too bad i like the rainbow one better that's for sure next up we have green apple i have this angry apple on it of course gonna be a green color let's see if we can actually open this one first try this time i was able to open up the um rainbow one pretty quick and just like the rainbow one i was able to open up the green one just as quick here's a green one i'm just going to tear off a little bit maybe not do half the strip like i've been doing um so yeah turf a little piece of the green apple oh oh that's like a sour that's like a sour green apple oh wow yeah it's not so much green apple as it is a sour green apple that's crazy next up we have tropical mango it's a yellow color like i said i love the packaging of all these great packaging i think they did a good job with this it's my first time ever having sour strips i've never had it before in the past um and i don't know i saw that they were releasing a cotton candy flavor and i was like maybe maybe this will be the time that i try it and then i notice that they have a 12 pack that even comes with a new cotton candy flavor and i was like yeah sure why not let's try it here it is tropical mango oh wow so that one is not too sour in my opinion um but it does have that very nice mango taste it tastes like a frozen mango if you guys have ever had frozen mangoes before tastes exactly like that spot on no difference it's a very good mango flavor second last we're going to do blue raspberry i love blue anything and especially with candy i love having blue raspberry candies um everyone's favorite jolly rancher are the blue ones so i would assume that everyone's favorite sour strip would be the blue raspberry as well [Applause] here it is nice blue color it has that blue stripe straight down it let's taste it that one has a very strong blue raspberry taste to it i actually really enjoy that i really like that and again this one i feel like isn't as sour just like the mango one um but it's very sweet it's a very sweet blue raspberry and then last but not least we have the new flavor cotton candy right there pretty sure the nutrition facts on all of them are exactly the same but there it is here goes the cotton candy let's give it a smell oh that's a weird smell almost smells like uh like caramel let's break off a piece perfect right there it's a blue and pink stripe let's give it a taste hmm all right so i don't know if you guys have ever had this before but it tastes like a maple syrup cotton candy or like a maple cotton candy i don't know if you guys have ever had that before but that's exactly what it tastes like it almost tastes like like a pancake syrup like it's very mapley huh that's

delicious the goo i can't even describe what that tastes like it it gives my mouth the flavor of right like after you brush your teeth and then you drink orange juice no i feel like that's what it tastes like to me i feel like i just tasted melted like plastic flavored watermelon like they tried to make watermelon watermelon is that watermelon they're both watermelon this is watermelon i don't know what it's both watermelon this tastes like artificial melted watermelon flavor plastic i'm going to make this taste oh god no no no no just double checking it's not sour it's supposed to be sour i don't think it says sour anywhere that's not clean it says no no yeah sour chill sauerkraut well your guys's tolerance is higher now i love the sticks they're sweet they're like a sweet watermelon a sour patch watermelons kind of if they just sold these that's what i would buy are these fun my review of these candy sticks delicious gooey stuff yes so try it if you dare there are four flavors maybe the other ones are better get all four do a taste test have your kids eat it they'll love it well kids love it nikki you're the kid yeah you're the kid i mean if your kids like the taste of

allcitycandy.com to get this and other fun candy things bye", "mJAPeC38tto": "a lot of it is just environment and because a lot of these varieties especially nowadays are just poly hybrids they're just a mix of kind of everything that's in the gene pool right you get a lot of variation because the its genes have not been stabilized that doesn't mean stable from like a male-female sexual preference standpoint it means stabilizing traits in that across a wide varying range of environments you get the same results mm-hmm and when something hasn't been stabilized those traits tend to waver a lot more depending on how much of the environment has changed and how you treat it so my question then being if you have a clone say for instance that you bought and it grows good no matter what if your room's hot cold [ __ ] you know what I'm saying it's resistant to all types of [ __ ] p.m. etc is that mean it's been stabilized not necessarily stable to begin with it was just stables next to begin with well it's it's what you're what are you determining how stable though there's hundreds of different pretty much characteristics I'm just saying it grows the same in all environments and that's that's what I thought you're listening I don't think there is anything that does that first of all right it'll just be less variable than the thing next to it new right like because the thing is like when you stabilize genes you do that by inbreeding stuff okay but by inbreeding it you're also limiting the gene pool again because you're just letting two brothers and sisters or in this case of feminized seeds like the organism make seeds with itself so that the variation of the gene pool is very small at that point and so if you do two or three generations and four generations of inbreeding you'll probably stabilize a lot of traits meaning that the seeds they resemble each other across a wider range of environments but also once you go past a certain point of inbreeding you start seeing a lot more mutations earn runts potentially herpes right you might have started out with a her me free variety but you made one wrong turn in the inbreeding process and now everything has Hermes because you picked one generation so like a variety being f5 or stay what people consider stabilized jeans or stabilized filial generations doesn't mean that you could have stabilized being a hermaphrodite okay gene can be stabilized okay meaning that it presents itself across a wider range of environmental change and especially amongst a seed population okay and then you have phenotypical variation that you actually see with a clone individually mmm so it's just where what it depends on what you're doing what you're working with what's your environment what are you calling stabilization what traits are you trying to stabilize whether that's strong root growth strong stems certain flavor or potency mm-hmm any of those traits can be stabilized and you can't stabilize them all at the same time it's really hard to because usually you find the plant that tastes really good but it has weak stems mm-hmm it's very rare that you find a variety that has every single box generous the best out of your population where you'll find one that's pretty close to as good as the best tasting one that yields or maybe has front but it's not quite as good as that really weeks thin stem like like gg4 for instance right you have to net that thing up like a [ __ ] at least from my growing experience you have to net that [ __ ] up because yeah it produces them [ __ ] greasy [ __ ] frosty bomb buds in my opinion even though it got played out and [ __ ] out the stems were super weak right and that's more than likely just a result of pop small population selection yeah if they had grown let's say five hundred to start with instead of five or whatever it was yeah they probably would have found a phenotype that has just as good a smell and flavor as gg4 which is not necessarily its best trait no but it's good it has good smell yeah leave a relatively speak good house-training but they probably would have found one that smelled way and tasted even better mhm but had better growth characteristics or didn't have if if they were looking for that trait depending on their grow environment and how they like to grow like netting stuff they may have preferred yeah that growth trade they could have had two phenotypes even in only five seeds right that had both that had the strong stems and the same smell and flavor or quality of smoke but chose it because it didn't grow as fast or grouchy it was too leafy and shaded out their canopy mm-hmm there's just a million different traits and that's just us perceiving with our senses what the genes are of the plant we're not actually visually seeing genes it's it's the the cannabis plant it has something like 10 times more DNA than human DNA in terms of the amount of information and pretty much all plants on the planet are like that yeah because they've been evolving on this planet for much longer mm-hmm and they've learned how to like create food and energy just by sitting in one spot right not even moving whereas we're not even that evolved we haven't figured out how to just like sit in the Sun and not need to eat a dinner yeah yeah they're really well involved they stay in the same spot their entire life lived just as long or longer in many cases than we do mm-hmm and are able to get everything they need sitting in one place sitting in one spot that's a pretty evolved organism yeah you think they can talk to each other there's definitely communication among the researcher well I mean there's we can't even perceive how they're doing it because like I'm saying their DNA is so complex compared to ours yeah at one point in time we thought blue eyes and green eyes and brown eyes was all one gene you just turn it on and turn it off and whether or not you have blue eyes for this and so what about the people that have two different colored eyes yeah and what we found is that's many different genes that can affect each other even genes that aren't on us in the same area of the of the DNA sequence can affect other areas just in terms of combinations or whatever yeah and from it exactly and those genes being on or off or changing we can't we're just seeing what those genes are doing we're not necessarily looking at DNA just because you have longer hair or have different eye color you're not that's just what's being visually represented by those genes that's not actually what's happening inside the organism right like the you know having blue eyes having blue eyes and all that [ __ ] is a lack of pigment right yeah it's not it's not it's not a gene for being blue and the same thing with the cannabis plant is what we perceive as being the dank flavor or strong stems or whatever it may be maybe genes that are affecting the root system and how it's able to uptake certain nutrients and that's what makes the stems strong I don't know I'm just proposing that if you need pretty much any so many things yeah that could be affecting the way the plants growing and when you're selecting for strong stems you may not have selected for strong stems you might actually selected for certain type of root system mm-hmm right that allows a plant to uptake more of this certain nutrient that contributes to stiffness of stems right whether or not that traits gonna pass down you won't know until you grow the seeds yeah so that's kind of the thing it doesn't matter what trait you're looking for or what trait you're trying to stabilize you still have to grow the seeds out and see if what you selected actually is there right", "iJwdqt7ebmE": "yeah here we go here we go again what's up yo back with another review today Oh edible gummies Mira Mira specifically Rob hots sour flavors I believe this is a relative new relatively new flavor for them I'm not a million percent sure even close to sure if it's on the REC side if it's not now I would imagine it will be soon so diving in the flavors we got inside here blue raspberry grape and green apple I don't know I had to look at it I actually know the flavors of jelly me anyway that's pretty much my favorite flavors enjoy ranchers and other candies so that was a super big plus for me I'm not really a huge tower fan so I'm really hoping they're not especially a sour yeah I was gonna enter a picture probably already did or I am now so we're gonna dive into what one thing to keep in mind is the brain all right we go is that the milligrams posted on the bottle or on the container are not necessarily the exact amount that are in your specific bottle your specific bottle will have a separate location where it is located exactly how many milligrams are in there I will insert a picture of it but it's I just keep smearing it you cannot see it at all anymore but I know that this bottle says 500 milligrams and it has 467 point 6 4 milligrams in it meaning each piece is not 50 milligrams but 46.7 6 milligrams per gummy it will always tell you the specific amount of THC that is in and milligrams that is in your container but it's not always exactly what's on the bottle sometimes it's more though I had another bottle of greens but I ate before I could review sometimes it's more the greens were 500 and something milligrams so each milligram or 5/10 I think or anyway doesn't matter because it was 51 milligrams per gummy i remember that specifically so sometimes you're getting more sometimes getting less if you're really a budget conscious person and you want to really maximize your bang for buck check out the different flavors and see what milligram is the highest of the actual bottle that you'll be purchasing we're gonna move on to the scent also it doesn't say whether it's a hybrid or indica or sativa so that means it's a hybrid most edibles are pretty much hybrids anyway I'm to get a edible specific video posted so keep an eye out for that because I'm gonna give like tips tricks all kinds of different information about edibles specifically that you can apply across pretty much all edibles sauer sorry I'm getting a little bit of the grape but I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys these two are the two that I'm gonna be eating and one of them is great the reason these are the two that I'm gonna be eating is because I licked the [ __ ] out of them getting the sub nail photo and specifically the purple one is the one that I started with so it got the most saliva on it so I'm not sure if that has affected the scent that I'm picking up the most in here I'm like rotating something like the blue raspberries up on top I still kind of get great more than anything else behind this hour cuz this hour is the first thing that I smelled so that's a little bit concerning for me but when I was licking them I didn't taste a lot of sour however in the photo you can see there's a lot of like more there's a lot of rocky material that's only on one side from what I can tell because the green one too it didn't have any on the bottom I'm thinking that's the sour so I would imagine that you could dust that off and they wouldn't be sour but tact tactically they are I'm gonna grab one that I haven't wet because that they're more sticky Wow they're mean Wow I'm having before but they are they're very soft and compression they're definitely gummies cuz they're a little bit sticky but let's see yeah they're a little bit sticky my fingers are a little sticky after that but I could be because I was also handling the ones that I licked so we're gonna let see my fingers do not feel sticky at all or the like least amount like to smile if anything so now we're gonna squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze it is sticky yeah it's sticky and that's one that was not licked but it's not super bad cuz now after I've done it a few times it's pretty much not sticky anymore so a little sticky but you'll be able to like dust it off and no big deal as long as you don't like continuously looking and grab it and grab it and grab it that makes it sticky alright let's ride let's ride so I'm gonna be doing actually 150 because I'm gonna try all three well I was Jenni myself so harshly I'm like oh you're not getting quick enough that I couldn't actually think about adding up the numbers so it actually may be more like 135 levi's I am going to put the sour directly on my tongue with this one and then the other way on this one and whichever way I like the most I'm gonna do for the blue raspberry because that's my favorite and the apple looks like it's not got a lot of stuff on it so [Music] okay I push the gummy off to the side to just deal with the sour but it's really not bad like you can see my face with like a little bit but when it's really sour it's my faces all kinds of you know I am definitely getting a great flavor I would say that there is a mild earthy flavor to it I mean hash has a very very attached distillate has a very mild cannabis flavor to it but I'm picking that up so it's not but I I mean any edible honestly any edible is gonna have the slightest flavoring whether it be hashey or earthy which this is a little bit both I'm getting it's interesting you know I'm getting the earthiness of the you know cannabis component but which is in distillate but I'm also at the end getting a little bit of the tang or the dryness maybe that's it of the hash flavor if you have smoked hash or gotten it on it and like licked it and stuff you kind of know what I mean you the smell like honest if you know what the smell is you kind of know what the taste is so they're green apple oh and as far as I continue to talk the flavor I'm left with is a very mild grape kind of a again there's it's not really necessarily earthy at this point it's an off great like it's great but just like a little okay solid metal that straight-up tastes like Ukraine Apple the end part I got a little bit of sour and as I was coming out of it it tasted like a sour green apple so that was really nice not quite as much earthy flavor in that one I just think maybe the green apple complements or goes with the cannabis ever slightly so more than the grape so more I'm not really tasting the green apple anymore it was strong when I was eating it but it doesn't really have a leftover flavor and blue raspberry [Music] whoo Smiley's an idol I ate a boy okay that was delicious it honestly reminds me of a blue Slurpee but I I honestly don't think I've ever tried a Slurpee ever but it's what I imagine a blue raspberry a Slurpee tastes like blue raspberry otter pop that's the closest that I can relate it to cuz it's not quite blue raspberry Jolly Rancher but it's blue rounder blue blue raspberry otter pop so it's a little duller than a Jolly Rancher but still nicely blue raspberry we're popsicle I swallowed unexpectedly during that so some sour got in my throat so it's not the best feeling and I did just eat on three so I'm imagining the flavors gonna be a little ol kooky but I kind of maybe I just want it I feel like I have a remanence of blue raspberry in my mouth but I might just be wanting it so much that its existing you know for the placebo effect so flavors oh dude I didn't get any hash from that no earthy no hash maybe because I like that flavor so much or it goes better with it I don't know but it tasted delicious so that you know as far as overall experience I appreciate that the sour is not super sour I almost think there's gonna be people who are disappointed but it's not super super sour but I thought it was a nice mild level of sour what yeah I still get the grape more than anything in that particular whip waft I wonder if it's because I was also thinking it was gonna be so much more sour that I smelled this no I smell sour but it's not as strong it has before that's so funny anyway I love Rob hot gummies I've had them pretty consistently there's definitely other companies that make really good gummies but Rob hots from what I've experienced so far seems to be the best thing for the [ __ ] and having good quality like great quality gummies however I did want to mention gelatin and glucose syrup is in here I don't know how that relates to either vegetarianism or veganism all right so the milligrams are definitely affecting me at this point I'd say I'm Spacey relaxed [Music] I'm frontier I was more minute early and now I'm more relaxed and I think when I get to doing the video editing it'll be easier to focus than trying to pull thoughts out of this brain it's more just do versus think which is wonderful my hands are so dry my knuckles oh my gosh I need to get more lotion I have to go okay I just needed a quick thing yeah yes I would recommend rabbits gummies I would say pretty much overall at this point different flavors you you're gonna like and not like so that's gonna be a personal thing but overall I think that Rob Potts does a good job with their gummies and the sours were delicious and not super sour and I really like that I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your day",

be careful though because there are fake versions of this this is lemonade wild cherry they also have the red which is you know the normal nerds colors and then they have a purple and they have a pink but there is no blue if you see a blue it is fake and stay away cuz there's been stories of these being laced with various other drugs so make sure you're getting them from a reputable source and make sure you really trust who you're going to but if we just get started take a look tear and share No thank you I'll keep it for myself point 9 ounces I don't know I don't know what that matters to you this is the lemonade wild cherry if you have the option of flavors I would I just love lemonade so like you know I obviously picked this one but this is by far my favorite flavor add all of them super potent formula I would honestly have to agree with them 400 milligrams per rope so I won't lie I'm a lightweight when it comes to edibles I smoke flower everyday I smoke concentrates most days but edibles just do me very dirt they really just [ __ ] me over so thoughtful portion 1/8 of the rope will be 50 milligrams so you know you can extrapolate that to however edibles match your body those are the ingredients in case you would like to know some more nutrition facts and this I did another nerd rope edible review and that one was a lot more thick and not you know like more homemade this they've they tried very hard to recreate the exact like texturing and everything the other one who's a lot softer and more gelatinous than a real nerds rope this one's a bit more hard and a bit firmer than a normal rope but these these really kick lands I gotta say hey this much about say about thirty minutes ago 60 minute activation time as I said I'm kind of a lightweight when it comes to edibles so I'm already folded and I've gone to other edibles and eaten them and you know how to like felt it obviously but these for some reason I love like these just get me in such a good mood and they give me like folded like where it's like a body high you know one thing that why is he covered in blood I'm assuming it's supposed to be the you know the rope part but this just looks kind of scary like

production of airheads is based here in the Greater Cincinnati area if you're unfamiliar with the candy it's basically a soft taffy with a big taste what really makes hurt as special as its flavor and its texture airheads come in bar bite and belt form and the factory in Erlanger has a machine for all of it we got a five-day 24-hour operation on their heads not extremely run basically seven days a week from the mixing of sugars and sweeteners to the thinning and forming process to the packaging machines churn out about 3,000 pounds of taffy and three and four million bars a day we try to taste

temperature why don't I put these in the fridge okay let's give this one a try I think these are just our belts I believe and I got a fork because I just I'm not trying to eat it with my hands today I'm so excited to try this cause I haven't had candy in a minute we shoulda like done this inside I'm like a place that y'all could see all of that but we got a little one it's our just hang him it's spicy oh it's spicy I love spicy food but my prices are too low tolerance for spice I was of a low tolerance for people who annoy me huh Oh y'all this is delicious oh this is so good easy peasy I can

all the same amount of spice but so good where did that one candy go Oh God you know I can't find it no I cannot find it you know my car's gonna smell like it's a hot day oh now where did she go that's that's something I'll have to deal with later it's fine oh that's that one was like so good and their little logo I friggin love it who they give you a plague this is dense this is a lot and I'm not going I like it's kind of filling it's like oh okay let me hit the quiz let's do a quiz shall we if you're new to my channel I like to do BuzzFeed quizzes I'm gonna leave one down below this one's candy-themed if you want to do it with me let's let's go together it says this one must go quiz will be impossible for people who love candy to answer I like candy I'm not like I'm like salivating from that that is so good um go back to those gummy bears I think the gummy bears might be my favorite I don't know if it's like the texture cuz it's just like a really satisfying texture or it's just cuz it's so freakin good okay I like candy I'm not like a huge like candy person I mean I saw these and I was like yo I gotta have them but um I don't know what this quiz is gonna be but let's sorry about that let's um let's start into a Joey first question which M&M flavor must go peanut M&M peanut butter M&M original imma say peanut butter M&M because I love peanut M&Ms alright 45 percent of everybody said the same thing um which fruity candy must go Mike and Ikes skittles or starburst I'm gonna say skittles like a stale skittle will break my mouth I love Mike and Ikes so i'ma

is my review on the nerd rope nerds rope somebody sent me a couple bucks and wanted me to review it and I'm going to review it because that's what they pay for they paid for this so what up being said let's get into the review of their nerds rope ok so you can see this like some kind of alright it's kind of like a licorice surrounded by some kind of candied crap if you will this looks like some kind of DNA like you know at size class this is what your mob real looks like ok I got a mustache [Music] alright this actually looks pretty good I I [ __ ] with this for sure yeah alright let's before I let me get a drink of my coffee really quick Wow I actually found somewhere in McDonald's in Los Angeles that the large coffee was and was under $2 it's amazing oh and my sausage McMuffin was Oh get this Los Angeles and it was at Mike Hoff my large coffee and a sausage McMuffin was barely three dollars it's great so let's get started with the review I could do without all the nerds I used to eat nerds in the candy well okay they're like the little candy crap um it's pretty good yeah really sweet I'm not like too big on these sweets do I have any nerds in my teeth I do or was that last night's food I should have rushed my teeth like that drunk anyways I give it a 7 it's pretty good candy arm I would you know if I were uh if I were a kid behind a van and I would try to lure kids into it I would definitely stock up on these for sure so very good hopefully no appeals are watching so anyways thank you for uh thank you for the money to buy that stuff for the review whatever your name is I forgot anyways uh a couple points like to make really quickly as you guys know I do reviews and then I kind of go about my daily business of life I wanted to Ross to go get a new car mouth because I broke mine because I sat on it and when I get it when I went into he says hi good morning welcome to Ross and that just ignored him and he said it again hi good morning welcome to Ross like to be hurt like look dude people all across the country we're tired of this fake corporate schmuck greeting every day every time we go into hey welcome to Dollar Tree hey welcome to this hey welcome to that weren't we don't really care to be acknowledged because it's not a genuine hello good morning it's a forced greeting from you guys that your higher-ups tell you to say and also a lot of places do that because when people come in there to steal they're less likely to steal if they know that they're acknowledged when they come in like they know that they're being watched or whatever so it's a fake ass greeting nobody cares so I ignore everybody that says oh hello welcome I don't even respond to them anymore they're so they're so fake a phony [ __ ] them anyways so I'm at this McDonald's right and the one thing about La well there's a million things that I don't like about it but one of the things about La I don't like is that the bathroom situation I hear sucks especially you know when you're in your van you don't have a home and you know you always kind of like have that one bathroom spot where it's like clean and you just stick to that one spot but like when you're when you're out about in LA it's not very convenient to just stop anywhere and go use the bathroom it really really sucks like right now I'm going to a cemetery down the way right here just to go use the bathroom I'm gonna go do a video there anyways but I'm not even gonna go use the bathroom till I get to that cemetery why cuz I know that cemetery has a bathroom and nobody ever goes there as a matter of fact the bathroom is located in the same place where what a great day Hollywood actors interred in the mausoleum so I'm gonna go visit him and go take a dump so I'm in the McDonald's and there's a guy on the can I don't know how long he's been enough so I'm like whatever so I just go order my coffee and then these slobs just start coming in there just start sliding into McDonald's and then there's like a line of like five nerds and a McDonald's and one of the Nerds this homeless bummy black guy you know the kinda like when you just walk down the street and you see him you kind of want to maybe go across the street just go away from him he starts yelling everyone like oh I've been waiting here and the other guy was like I've been waiting for 15 minutes uh here's a little bit of advice if you've been at McDonald's for 15 minutes waiting to use the bathroom how about you just go walk your happy ass over to smart and final or we got Ross over here we got Dollar Tree as bathrooms we got this 'piease apparatus clothing store which is going out of business with structs oh I love them as a matter of fact I probably to come back here and get some clothes why should I use your bathroom Jersey Mike's uh huh else you got you got a couple bathrooms over there Pizza Hut they probably got a bathroom go use the bathroom somewhere else after 15 minutes um why would you want to use the bathroom right after somebody that's been on the camp for 15 minutes and you don't even know how long they were there before you were waiting for two minutes I'm the same anyways guys this is black Megan with another review I'm kind of behind on my reviews if you want to me to review something that that you want me to review just hit that PayPal it's in the link below guys I am behind on the review so you know you ain't gonna give me like money on it like all do it review tomorrow I'm trying to spread it out I actually I might even I might even start a review channel I don't know I have an empty channel that has about 800 subscribers that I was gonna start a podcasting channel on it I never got to it so maybe I'll start a review channel on there anyways guys catch up with you later thank you for watching peace out", "uVrVyKUO5_c": "[Music] what's up friends welcome back today we have a little bit different video than you guys are used to so instead of giving you guys a exact follow the steps instructions this is gonna be more like you guys come along with me when i experiment so i like to try out different ways um that we can make different treats and a lot of times it turns out sometimes it doesn't um but i kind of just go with the flow and see what will happen i feel like no matter what you can always salvage your treats into something it may not be what you intended it to be but it'll always be delicious so for an example my intentions with this video was to create infused jolly ranchers and for them to be hard candy now that did not work out they ended up being a soft candy so i just kind of went with it and i thought it might be cool for you guys if you want to see my thought process and how i kind of decide to go with things when they go wrong so please let me know if you guys enjoyed this type of video or if you'd rather it be um here is like the guaranteed results from this step-by-step process [Music] all right let's get started here's what you're going to need some jolly ranchers or any hard candy that you enjoy some coconut oil or tincture citric acid and some infused sugar or regular sugar unwrap your jolly ranchers and then separate them into colors that you think would mix well once melted together i'm doing blue and green and the purple and reds now i'm setting up my double boiler and adding in my pink and red jolly ranchers they're mostly pink and i am using a total of 20 jolly ranchers now i'm adding in some lecithin and i'm just using my spatula because it is really hard to get off a spoon and then putting that back in and mixing it up now because i'm just doing a little experiment i decided that chamoy would taste really good with this jolly rancher mix since it's mostly all watermelon so i'm adding in two tablespoons of chamoy and then two tablespoons of infused sugar of course you could use regular sugar or you don't have to use chamoy i mean this is totally very flexible you can kind of flavor this to how you want you can put whatever creation you can come up with in there pretty much now i'm just waiting for this to melt over the double boiler it does take a long time i probably took about a half an hour to get to this point now that it's mostly melted i'm going to add in my coconut oil so i decided to add in three tablespoons there wasn't an exact reason for why i chose this amount it's just kind of like i said an experiment to see how it goes so we're going to mix that in and the oil is pretty tricky to combine with the mixture so i am going to use a whisk and just whisk that up really good just do it for a few minutes and it will come together very nicely and there is no problems getting this to emulsify just be persistent with stirring it until everything is nice and smooth like this so at this point it's pretty much ready to be refrigerated and like i said you guys can add whatever you like so if you want them to be very sour add some citric acid if you want them to have any sort of other flavor you know add it in anything is probably going to be just fine so then i now that this is all mixed together i'm going to pour it into a little dish because this is a smaller amount i'm just using a smaller dish so that i can get them to be thicker instead of very thin if they were spread out along a larger container this container had some grooves so i just filled it with some tinfoil so i could get the bottom to be flat and then place some wax paper inside of there um i had some issues with the wax paper if i was to do this again i would use parchment paper i just didn't have any on hand so then i'm going to pour this mixture into my little lined container and then i'm going to put it in the fridge to set i also just popped the little bubbles with a toothpick and then kind of just dropped it a bit to release any air bubbles um in the end because this turned out to be more like a starburst i didn't need to do that because i could have just squished it or molded it down with my finger okay so here it is after being in the fridge for probably about a half an hour and i was ready to score it because i was wanting these to be hard candy and you need to score these earlier on in the process so i'm just measuring it out and attempting to score it but it doesn't really hold my shape so i put it back in the fridge for another half an hour or so and then took it back out to score again and then i also sprayed my knife with some cooking spray so that it wouldn't stick now it's very malleable like i can reshape it really well and cutting it was fine but this was when i realized that this probably was no longer going to be a hard candy and it was going to be a soft candy so i cut all these shapes and then put them back in the fridge but they were kind of like they kept on molding back together so point being is that it needs to stay in the fridge a lot longer so i put them back in and then worked on making a coating for them so for these i thought they'd be absolutely delicious with a tahini coating so i started with one tablespoon of icing sugar one tablespoon of infused sugar and one tablespoon of tahini and then i tasted that and i felt like it needed more sugar so i added in some more sugar as well as some citric acid to make it more sour and then i tasted it again and it still felt like i wanted it to be quite a bit sweeter so i just added in the rest of my sugar and you guys there's no like exact measurements you just do this to what you think tastes good more sugar less sugar whatever you like and then i'm also going to grind this down in a food processor just to make it a little bit finer to coat my candies and then i poured it back into my container now these have been in the fridge for over an hour and while they were in there i'd go in with my knife and kind of just cut them so you can see they're still very squishy and like a soft candy nothing like a hard candy so that's a texture we're working with here now i'm just peeling them all off of this wax paper and you can see that it's stuck to the back of them quite a bit it was easy for me to get off but if i had used parchment paper there wouldn't have been that issue anyway so if you were to do this use parchment paper and not wax paper and then i separated them all and then put them into my tahin sour sugar coating and shook them all up then i put them back into the container as i was taking them out i could tell that they were very soft so i knew that these weren't going to be the type of gummies that were going to hold or not gummies the soft candies that were going to hold their shape outside of the fridge now that i've made these i've realized that in order to keep them out of the fridge we're going to need to add gelatin so let me know if you guys would like to see me do a recipe like that um but they look so good and of course i had to try one and they were so tasty like the watermelon jolly rancher chewiness with the sour sugary tahin coating and then the chamoy and the watermelon like i don't even know how i can explain how delicious that was but like so good now we're gonna do our batch of blue and greens using our tincture um these take forever to melt oh my goodness so yeah i left them on here for probably like a half an hour and then they finally were melting and make sure you guys are checking on the water in your double boiler i found that my water was going down fast and i constantly had to re-add it so just make sure you have enough water in there all the time okay so now after this has melted quite a bit i'm going to add in my tincture so we're doing one two three tablespoons and then to compensate for the extra liquid we're adding in three tablespoons of sugar i'm just using regular sugar because i don't know why i think i ran out of infused sugar anyways we're mixing that in and now we're going to add in some lecithin and i'm going to use my whisk to get that since we need to whisk this all together to get everything to emulsify so just stir that all up and get it to mix together and then i want these to be really sour because sour blue raspberry green apple like that's a good combination am i right okay so citric acid mix that in i had the candy thermometer in here because i was trying to make hard candy so we had to bring it to a certain temperature to allow that to happen um but in the end i realized it was not going to reach that temperature so i decided these are also going to be soft juice um which means i'm going to also add in some coconut oil so i'm just doing one tablespoon of this i could probably have added more but i just wanted to try using a little bit less since the three in the last recipe was a little bit soft now i'm adding in even more citric acid because i want these to be super sour like i've said before these recipes are extremely flexible if you're just making these for yourself it's not going to hurt if it's not exactly perfect every time if you're making these for other people then that's a different story but it's always fun to experiment um this is my favorite part of making all these treats okay now that we have the coconut oil in there we're mixing that all together and it's coming together very very nicely we just have to keep whisking it to make sure it's all mixed together you can see it looks nice and smooth and now we're pouring it into the same type of system the little container with the wax paper again because i don't have any parchment paper and then i'm putting it in the fridge i had intended to come back for this an hour or so later but it ended up sitting in the fridge for a couple of days because i got too busy to continue with them so now here we are with our refrigerated mixture slab i took it out of the fridge and then i let it sit for about 20 minutes to kind of soften it up so you can obviously tell the fact that it softens up at a warmer temperature means these need to stay in the fridge again it would u uh we would need to use gelatin to make them stay stable at um or to hold their shape at room temperature and if you guys are interested in me doing a video like that let me know this is just an experiment like i said a few times already so anyways so i just cut them up into these little shapes and then i put them in a container with some sugar and a little sprinkle of citric acid shook them up and then i put them back in the fridge so that was all we needed to make both of those and they were so good now let's talk about how they turned out taste wise okay so i'm just eating them while i'm talking so i can explain so first of all don't put them in the freezer because they'll get kind of wet on the outside just keep them in the fridge this green one it's sour green apple and blue raspberry the flavor is literally amazing they go so well together and the sourness is perfect [Music] that is really really good like i really like that it is very soft though it's not as chewy as like a starburst it's much much softer like very like your teeth just like go right into it so i mean maybe if you eat them in the fridge it'd be a little bit chewier but i let mine sit out um so i could see how well they would do i think it's about 24 degrees in my apartment so if the air conditioning was on i probably could get away with keeping them out of the fridge okay now we're going to try the watermelon cherry chun way one so it definitely is mostly watermelon only a little bit of cherry and we can really taste the watermelon chamois which one is really good i think the only thing i would change to the watermelon one is to do more of a sugar coating like i did for the green one um i just kind of want that like really like sour sugar to contrast the sweetness of the watermelon chamois um it is pretty oily but only on your fingers you can't really like taste the oiliness overall i rate the watermelon choi one seven out of ten and then the green one i would literally rate like a nine point five out of ten it was like so so so good i think it's gonna put some citric acid in it as well but both of them are good if i could do anything different aside from the sugar i would also add gelatin so they could be shelf stable but i don't mind keeping in the fridge anyways i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did leave a comment below give us a thumbs up and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching i hope you have a wonderful day", "SncS2NcA67M": "hi guys yeah that's cats yeah that's extremes sweetly so hard candy is airheads more sour than warheads guys or it's the candies and also warheads swarms warheads I'm sorry coming Williams was that so sorry let's see yeah it's not so business sorry band I really just laid there for my thumbnail it's a tree it's so is it's that's all it's a god no my problem is I'm going to have sensitive teeth like that before with warheads sorry gummy worms ooh sorry because you know just of course but also American chocolate so to me it tastes like it's the same so I can understand what you mean it tastes you know more chocolate than it doesn't take it tastes fake or or something is like diluted but it's mostly because of the blankey America when they say dark chocolate they would like put that in chocolate boys even if the content whether yeah only 55% but here in Europe when you say t\u00f4i chocolate it really means from 70% although some brands now I like I'm not saying they are cheating but I think they are just imitating the states and they would also put dark in their pores although so but if ever before we go to the states then now then we buy things so I can experience it again I can hear me guys she helped us thank you so much for

hmm oh yes so I really enjoyed the strain guys and I don't have too much of it left but I wanted to go ahead and kind of get it out in a review so this right here is one of the nodes that I saved I will throw a couple pictures up on the screen and if you haven't checked me out on Instagram go check me out to underscore tree show I've got a couple decent close-ups of it on there and I post all types of strain reviews and product updates certain things like that would I buy all that good stuff day to day smoke sessions live all that good stuff so if you haven't checked it out go check me out on Instagram underscore tree shows all right let's break down some of these [ __ ] and get hot first off I just cleaned the bong this is the wife's bong I felt like using a beaker today just cleaned it gonna throw some water in this bad boy real quick so this is gonna be the greenhouse 14 inch beaker got it from a local head shop that's good yeah you don't want to put too much you know I mean you

guys go check them out for sure all great people man I enjoy smoking with them a lot learn a lot from them so they all got different perspectives and it's a good thing to have different perspectives because everybody's different and everybody likes certain types of strange you don't I mean so it's cool to uh see what everybody else likes to you know alright so throw that one back in there we're gonna save that ones later oh and I just cleaned the bowl looking super sexy and nice so how's everybody doing today what y'all smoking on man let me know in the comments I did want to let you guys know if you have any type of strain review requests just throw them down in the comments guys and I'll make a video on it if I haven't already for sure I'm always down to try new strains and like trying it out for people and letting you guys know how it is all right guys let's get into this bomb super-flavorful I can really really taste that train wreck in the other notes are like a little earthy almost a little Cushing real sweet though super tasty I think I'm gonna go again oh look at that we saved a little green hit not too shabby yeah yeah alright hit number two here we go cheers guys super duper tanky feeling after I hit it real real note Sabbagh it's not a bunch of citrus but it's sweet you know I mean very very good strain though super tasty I could see it being great in a joint ant apply few smoke blunts I really enjoy that [ __ ] matter of fact let's get a third one for it guys [ __ ] here we go cheers guys good stuff though so next thing I wanted to get into guys are the rosin carts from Blue River and it's pretty much the rosin sauce I guess you could say so one of them I got the Green crack which is exquisite guys the Terps on this green crack like right when you pop it open it's nothing but citrus that hits you right in the face I mean lemon lime beautiful so one of the things that I'm real big on now guys is multi strain use so say I go and hit this beaker bung I like to take my little rosin sauce carts and just kind of hit them about twice or maybe three or four times if I feel like it didn't know what mood I'm in you know I'm saying afterwards to kind of get a little bit of both worlds you know what I mean cuz this is straight terpene you guys whenever there's squishing the rosin to make that THC a this is the jelly [ __ ] that comes out you're getting some decent [ __ ] in here you're not getting 100% of the good [ __ ] but you are getting some decent terpenes in here that do still exist and don't get burnt up from the plates and [ __ ] like that so I wanted to read out some of the steps on the green crack so we got 5.1 percent THC a fifty three point eight percent THC zero point six percent CBD we've got 0.2 percent CBN we've got nine point seven percent CBG guys and zero point seven percent THC v for a total of 70 point one percent not a bad rosin cart this is the highest I've seen yet and that's obviously it's because it's a sativa and sativas are a little little higher up in THC usually one thing I'm so [ __ ] excited about guys I just found out that [ __ ] papaya cake it's coming out in the rossignol oh I'm excited about this [ __ ] I'd only got to try the pre rolls I've missed out man I slept on the damn eighth I could have bought it I had it in the car and I was like I'm just gonna wait I'll just go down there later on and I didn't go and then I went the next day and [ __ ] come to find out obviously sold out you already know if you don't get on the computer right whenever something new hits and they announce it and you don't reserve it or you're not right at that door and the first couple customers not couple but first you know twenty customers I would say on that day you're not gonna be able to try that new strain it's just [ __ ] up how it is man I hope that they do learn and get a little more consistency out of it just because like people need to be able to pick a medication and if they want to stick to that you know and right now it's like oh I say papaya cake was my favorite I smoked it in a pre-roll I really enjoy it they don't even have anymore pre-rolls to buy up there so like it's just we need a little bit more consistency in my opinion on the myth let me know what you guys think about that also down there so first off I'm gonna try the green crack one give you guys a little visual on that oil hopefully it'll come in there we go it's definitely some fire this one is a lot lighter than the other ones like the indicas are way darker from what I've seen the Paradise weights was a hybrid and it was a little lighter but this is the lightest one that I've seen and you let's get this magnetic from the AVD seed battery on does anybody else out there got one of these seed batteries for these rising carts this [ __ ] is a greatness y'all the only bad thing is that vibration that [ __ ] kills got a little card pole right there with that true leaf symbol is see that tiny carb hole like ran around there you can kind of put your hand over that one when you get it I'm gonna throw this one on hi guys alright guys so green craigrostan sauce here we go Cheers man it's Turkey as hail y'all it's literally like you know what lime peels taste like like if you were to bite the outside of a lime peel that's what it would taste like it's a fire super Turkey I had to go in for a second very good the only thing man I hate that haptic feedback dude I hate feeling that [ __ ] vibrate the whole time she hears man I wish that they would make a seed battery without that [ __ ] but anyways right now it is what it is and I'm saying it's pretty sleek looking though dope little I guess flat style not bad I don't there's some stickers on or something you can alright let's jump over to the other one I'm gonna show you one more image of that one that was the Green crack rosin sauce blue river I'm gonna take this little magnetic so I'm gonna read out the percentages for you guys on the LA Confidential we got th CA is coming in at ten point two the THC is coming in at forty four point three CBD is coming in at zero point two THC V is coming in at zero you got zero cbn and you've got three point eight CBG for a total of fifty eight point five see what I'm saying like that one was seventy the Green crack and this one's in the 50s usually the indicas and the hybrids I guess you could say are down in the 50s and from what I've seen the sativas are a little bit higher so from what I've experienced myself guys these medicated me great I don't know I mean I know 50% is low but you get access to those actual straight terpenes fresh out of it you know I mean there's no solvents inside of this nothing like that let's check out that LA Confidential one you see what I mean how it's a little darker see how amber it is super dark still fire still smokes really good and doesn't taste bad at all but it is just a little darker almost like ambarish like burgundy ish weird all right guys let's try this LA Confidential here we go I'm gonna be stoned as hell cheers guys now the LA Confidential a little more piney a little more sweet definitely got a little earth in there too though it's good though very very good I haven't tried the LA Confidential rosin yet guys so I've even had access to that I've never seen it I've had my card for two different doctor visits now so it hasn't been around for a little while but obviously they got the true wax in it but they haven't had the actual rosin for a little while um super fire though I I don't know man this one is fire over the greed and crack in my opinion just because I know that one's like way more Turkey but I'm an indica guy man I like that lowdown pine old-school earthy dank smell you know what I mean and I just like the buds that are like that so in because they're more my style cushy style but this [ __ ] right here is fire I really enjoy these though I need to start using them more I got a couple of them over there I got a the paradise weights when still I haven't even really smoked that one it did taste a little fishy sometimes you'll get some that do taste a little fishy or you'll have like a weird aftertaste of fish it's really odd it's out of nowhere I know that sounds crazy as hell but you will get like a little fishy miss to it it's odd I mean obviously it nothing's in it because it's straight mechanically separated with a squishing but it just tastes a little odd sometimes I don't know shits fire guys I enjoyed all of these products the Rambo trainwreck though was yeah it was one of the fire ants for sure this note right here I tried to save the prettiest one be able to show you guys hopefully you can kind of see it's definitely some fire not bad at all I don't know move I don't get a lot of access to him because it's a 4-hour trip it's to there and to back for me to hit move so but both the flowers that I've gotten from him so far well all three because I got that pre-roll to orangeade was fire um the triangle cush this last batch hmm it was some killer guys then it's just thankee as hell but the rainbow trainwreck I really enjoyed it good one for the daytime if you want to kind of be moving around and at work and not you know I'm saying to to up in like sweaty and heart beating fast you know I mean how some sativas do get you like that not full-on anxiety or nothing like that but like just kind of like where you're sweating and you're just kind of like whoo what the [ __ ] you know what I mean go go go kind of racy but this one right here guys super fire a little tiny bit more sativa leaning not bad at all though real cute you could smoke it and go to sleep mmm anyways guys let's take this dab of some of this LA Confidential true wax hopefully

"time to strap on some sour today with walking to candy aisle guys Jeff here with a review of sour straps the sour strap candy sour yeah sour straps candy um this is this is sour straps what this actually is is it's something you may know says this is a knockoff of the what is lovingly known on Internet's as the gay bacon that's right the official version is the airheads extreme strap candy and and it's just like a flattened fruit is what this is wild fruits flavor and this is a knockoff from ye olde Dollarama mm-hmm mm-hmm that here there it is imported by by the dollar Rama so this is the this is a knockoff in the at the dollar store of the airheads extreme essentially and airheads is of course a Canadian company so it makes sense that we would knock it off in our own country I don't know if you watch the epic food Epic Meal Time guys you'll you'll of course see them use the the gay bacon as they call it quite regularly in their in their foods and it's uh it's great you know I always get a kick out of watching them please I kind of stay trying to remember last time I had some though it's been a while wow this smells pretty good and I gotta say what do we got we got a lot of strips of strips of these sour straps in packaging so here we go we got sour straps it's got why is it only have three colors I mean it's in four strips you think that they could get a yellow in there huh god it's just coated oh that's probably the sour of course that's the sour I was like it's coated in sugar but it's like sugar probably mixed with the sour crystals right and this I think is just a flattened fruit shoe and it's a very thin one at that - red green blue and green again so I could be like a green apple and a lime but I'm going to guess it's probably just the same flavor twice and then no blue and red Oh strappy goodness I'm going to try to see if it says what the flavors are hmmm where's that shape contains wheat soy milk eggs yeah yeah well it's just a mash of gumminess huh what's this is just in green some French um I don't know I don't know what the flavors are you despite all this sugar and sour and guys this is not very sour the fruitiness super gross let's try that again okay so you bite it the initial taste is actually sweet all the sugar hmm wow that's very very slight on the sour very minimal I'm really surprised at how little sour that is um so you first get the sugar crystals and then you chew it you're like um sugary sweet great we're really just chewing that sugar crystals are gone and then you're chewing through the - the fruit chew the sour strap the strap part of it and it's well it's not terrible it's okay actually um and then there's a little teeny little aftertaste of sour and that's it personally the virtues okay I don't know maybe that first bite just didn't hit me right um the Fruit Chews okay this fruit this these fruit flavors whatever they are are mixing together not bad hmm well that wasn't so bad I just ate a whole limb I could eat another one mmm mmm what if the epicMealTime guys ever get use the fake Fitness users fake if they only stick to the legit airheads brand anyway seems alright I don't I'm trying remember this is actually something that I've really eaten I think I must have but not for a long time I don't think I've ever eaten this sour straps version but hey first time for everything right and parked outside if we can do anything to push forward the quality even if it is in our candy by promoting the gay bacon then why not hmm like I say the fruitiness it reminds me I'm trying to think what a runs oh it's it kind of reminds me of the lots of fruit shoes that I had somewhat maybe dunno couple months ago I'll put a link at the end lots of fruits lots of fruit each is or ever it's called like a good pretty good flavor actually and this is whatever this medley of fruity flavors is it's not bad that's really like the bulk of what I'm getting here the sugar whatever this outside is if this is out sour crystals on the outside there's nothing to them I think it's just sugar and whatever the sour is I don't taste it at all so my guess one complaint is that if you looking for sour this is not sour in the slightest but for our fruit chew it's okay I mean it's got a little extra sugar on the outside which is fine except for the fact that my fingers are just coated in sugar crystals now still this is actually something I can recommend surprisingly it's not bad walking in the candy aisle is going to rate the sour straps I'm going to rate them a 4 out of 5 they do what they well they don't do what they claim to do because they're not sour but they've stumbled upon I'm not a bad candy I mean I guess it's a 4 it's a week 4 because it doesn't hit the sour and it's really is way too messy but the flavor is pretty good like surprisingly so that's my take on it you guys let me know what you think in the comments below you guys like seeing the knockoff products here also I've been thinking about doing some of the reviews of some of the the funny dollar store knockoffs of some of the bigger chocolate bars and anyway I just haven't haven't done them yet really but I might do more in dollar store fare even though most of it's just you know bad clones of regular candy and chocolates anyway let me know what you think in the comments below if you would like to see that and unless I hear a huge outcry I probably will start doing that at some point or other but thanks for watching this one that was sour straps click those links and I'll see you guys next time alright so on bye", "rVcAB1C-yig": "[Music] hey guys welcome back today we're gonna be making infuse pika pika style candy so all the candy I'm using in the video are infused gummies that I have made in previous videos and I will link how to make them all below but of course you could still use this recipe even with regular gummies the combination of chamoy and tehy is so amazing I'm so in love with it I'm pretty much covering all my candy today and my favorite ones were the gutters oh my god is so good with the gushers I absolutely love it I ate so many of them so I had to make some regular one to two so I didn't eat too many of the infused runs a lot of things recipes use something called a Lucas candy usually it's a mango or watermelon flavored one now in Canada is really hard to find so I just looked up the ingredients online and figured out how to substitute it and I'll show you guys how to do that in this video [Music] here's what you're gonna need a variety of infused candy or not infused it's up to you all of these are gummies I have made slash infused and I have videos for them on my channel so I'll post the links for each of them below some Tajin chamoy and powdered sugar now these next ingredients are optional but they're commonly used in pika-pika style gummies it's definitely not essential but it does add a nice little extra flavor as well as a bit of sourness if you like that if you're familiar with making these gummies you've probably have already guessed that that ingredient is the Lucas candy powder all commonly in the watermelon or mango flavor unfortunately that's not something I could find in Canada which is really disappointing because it looks delicious and I really wish I could try it but I looked at the ingredients and pretty much it's sugar salt citric acid and chili powder as well as artificial flavor that will be mango or watermelon depending but since I can't find it we are going to use sugar citric acid and chili powder if you like you can also use watermelon or mango flavoring oil but I did not have any on hand you'll notice that I haven't given any measurements and that's because this recipe is entirely to taste but I'll try to give the approximate amounts that I was using here I have about 1/3 of a cup of icing sugar and I'm gonna pour in some chamoy now less is more because you can always add more but you can't take it out once you've added too much so if you do add too much just add in some more icing sugar to compensate you want very little you want this mixture be very sticky I used approximately one and a half tablespoons of joy so once I mixed it all together I'm going to put in the microwave for about 20 seconds to melt it so I can stir it and get this really nice glossy delicious looking mixture and then we're just going to stir and press out those clumps of icing sugar now I'm adding in about three tablespoons of regular granulated sugar if you're using one of the mango or watermelon Lucas powders you don't need to add the extra sugar and the citric acid and chilli powder I'm going to add but you can if you like - like I said it all comes down to personal preference with taste so you add whatever works for you and now I'm heading about half a teaspoon of citric acid my taste testers told me it was a little bit too sour so if you are sensitive to sour maybe use 1/4 or 1/8 of a teaspoon now I'm adding in chili powder that's about half a teaspoon as well more of this would have been good it doesn't make much of a difference if you're using the Tiki in any way I recommend adding more if you prefer it to be a little bit more chewy and spicy if you wanted to use the watermelon or mango flavoring oil you would added min now just a couple drops will do now I'm just grabbing a little container that has a lid and I'm throwing my first set of gummies which is the peach rings and then I'm gonna drizzle on just a little bit of this mixture again less is more you can always add more but you can't take it back I've made this before with too much and ends up just being a goopy mess so just do a little bit really less than you think you need and then shake shake shake shake a bunch and if it still is not coated then you can add a little bit more I use a very small amount on this you can see they're all very well covered and then now we're going to sprinkle our tajin on and again this is to taste so you can add a little bit shake it up try them and see if you want to add more you can add in some extra sugar some citric acid some chili powder it all comes down to what you like you can experiment with different batches and see what your taste preferences are muy bien they look wonderful the hardest part of this whole thing is trying to not eat them all while you're making them but I had to have some restraint since they are infused on that note for extra strong candies you can throw in some tincture or infused oil or infuse sugar or anything along those lines into your chamoy mixture and that will make them extra strong although I don't recommend using coconut oil because I think you could taste it but tincture would work wonderfully and I do have a great recipe for it which I will post below as well anyways I am now doing the exact same thing but with the gushers and my favorite today rego adding some extra sugar and then some citric acid and some chili powder and I'm pretty sure I'd go and grab more sugar off-camera because I just like it real sweet and then we go shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake until they're all nice and covered oh yeah looking good looking good and then we're gonna add the Dean this is where I should have also been adding the extra sugar and the chili powder citric acid etc I don't know why I added it with the sauce in the end it doesn't really matter but it is important to do the sauce first and then the tahini after when you have the extra sugar or the citric acid or chili powder really doesn't make much of a difference so yeah so we're loading that up with some bean shake it up and there we go beautiful while we're here let's get a little close-up of those beautiful peach done means absolutely delicious you can almost smell them through the screen now on to the last gummy fruit snack is that what you call this root by the foot so we're just going to spread our chamoy mixture onto the snack got me I don't know why I don't know what to call this the candy so we're just going to spread it onto the candy and then we're going to sprinkle on our Tajin and I also of course went overboard and added a bunch of citric acid and I think a little bit too much tajin I found this one was like a little bit salty and like I love salty so it was all good but just a heads up less is more you can always add it after but you can't take it off actually you probably could just take it off by kind of sweeping it off with your fingers but that makes mess and we don't want that and I spoke too soon our last treat is the infused nerd rope so I'm gonna do these one by one because I'm not sure how well the mixture is going to be able to get on it just because of the larger shape that it is and my make sure it's starting to be a little thick and harder to get to evenly distribute so you could also throw it in the microwave for another 10 20 seconds to just kind of make it a little bit liquid here and a little bit easier to spread now we're gonna add in our Tajin and sugar so you guys the chili powder etc I kind of just have a mixture going on the side there and then we're gonna shake it up and then repeat the same process with the other nerds rope and there's our last one excellent they look wonderful I am totally in love with Mexican style candies we don't have a lot of this type of stuff here in Canada so please let me know for something you guys think I should try that I would like if I loved this type of thing which I totally do [Music] it's so good with the spicy on it spicy and three everybody loves spicy and sweet thank you guys so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video and if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thank you guys so much have a great day [Music]", "4QPc0vY4eTE": "what's up everybody welcome back to the official 420 channel man and today um i was super pissed the other day because i was filming man i

the way i could describe it is that uh my everything was in slow motion for me everything was moving kind of slow-mo but my mind was awake my my you know my my i was awake my mind was awake but everything was just in slow mo it's like it's like laying like on the grass you know or it kind of reminds me like a fluffy cloud you know probably laying on a fluffy cloud or a nice soft bed you just want to stay still and that's how it felt like man it was awesome totally [ __ ] out of this world man the dang gummies just a joint not even a pre-rolled pre-rolled cone that's a spider man this isn't just about the dang gummies man my experience with them man that video would totally bend up by today but like i said man i got [ __ ] up you know on my brother's face signed me my family kept

you can't talk about the title i am doing another hair gummy review but i was requested by somebody to do a part two of girl girl let it grow but i couldn't find the gummies anywhere like i went to my local walmart two times nothing i couldn't find them so i didn't buy them because i don't really trust it anywhere else than walmart because that's where i got it i don't know where else to get i'm not gonna be searching everywhere for it because i am busy and i'm always doing something and i never have time for literally nothing like i'm barely recruiting this video and i already have two weeks of doing this that's how busy i am because i literally forget or i'm just busy but the gummies that i'm gonna try are called vita fusion beautiful hair with biotin so far from taking it for two weeks i really like it because i feel like okay when i was taking the girl girl letter girl i think that's how you pronounce it but i think that's how you pronounce it but when i was taking those like not a lot of hair was coming out of my hair and like for me since i have a lot of hair and curly hair i literally lose hair like every single time like every time i shower it's like a lot of hair coming down a lot and i was thinking the girls will let it grow that means like i felt my hair was healthy and not a lot of hair was coming out but with these like i don't know i feel like more hair comes out than usual i don't know if that's normal i don't know or maybe it's because i'm stressing right now it could literally be anything the vitamins that it has is c and e only two which i don't like because i like having a lot of vitamins when i think vitamins what does it even make sense but so far the length of it being two weeks um didn't really grow that much i don't know it really didn't grow that much in my opinion i'm gonna put the picture up right now to see if the good girl or not i don't know the girl or not but i believing that it didn't grow because i don't see something different but see i think that's it about the vitamins i mean i'm gonna be taking pictures every week even though i haven't took a picture this week i'll be taking pictures every saturday to see how much my hair oh yeah my hair is curly naturally this is my real hair my real hair i personally don't like my hair because it when i say that a lot of people are like oh my god i wish i had your hair girl you know the struggles of my hair you don't know the struggles like to get like this that's all i have for right now so i see you if there's another video series so this is part two of the first video this is part two this is my little update or whatever this is the update about beautiful beautiful hair gummies let me rate it first because let me tell y'all we know let me tell you guys everything and then i'm gonna rate it okay so in my opinion for one month because tomorrow's a month because i started taking on february 14 and tomorrow's march 14th but today i'm taking the video because tomorrow's monday i'm not gonna have time at all to do the video so i'm doing it today um for me in my opinion as it had been a month and i understand that it's a 50 days assignment and i'm doing 30 which yeah but um in my opinion it did not go that much as much as i wanted it to be as if being a month even though i know you're just like but it's just a 5 minute of 50 days well you guys probably won't say that better i know other people or like maybe i just need that but i don't know it being 30 days i feel like it didn't grow i mean it did grow i mean it did work like the gummies of course but it didn't grow as much as i wanted it to be for it being a month i don't know if you understand that or not and my hair is um not brushed right now because if you guys understand curly hair if you guys know curly hair is that when you brush it out or you straighten it or anything it's longer than when it is curled um i know my hair looks short right now it's not really that short but i wanted to not brush my hair because when i had took the picture i barely realized that my hair was not brushed and when my hair is brushed and when my hair is not brushed there's a different length so i wanted to compare the length of it being not brushed and when because when i took the picture it was not brushed and i didn't realize until yeah but i'll put the picture again like right now so you guys let me know if it did grow or not i haven't seen the picture but i feel like it didn't grow in my opinion well it did grow but not that much as i wanted it to grow i don't know if you know what i mean but yeah as my hair falling out in the shower i mean i would say it was normal like i wouldn't get that much and i wouldn't get that little it was completely normal like if i was not on anything it was normal and my rating for it's gonna be i would say a seven out of ten seven out of ten because it did make my hair grow but then as much as i wanted it to grow in a month i know this video is so lame and everything because it's mostly based on my hair and it's not the thing that i can like say or entertain but if there's any recommendations for any other gummies or anything you want me to try let me know in the comments so if you leave a comment down below i'll most likely get to it because obviously i see all my comments pop up if you guys want me to try sugar bear i'm so down and try sugar bear i heard like reviews about them and i want to see so that is it for the video let me give you guys a 360 of my hair so you guys can see the length and everything is my hair in the front and then [Music] period so that is it for the video um thank you for watching and you guys can give a subscribe or you guys give it a like or comment down below do whatever you want bye love you guys", "djMATlvDxbM": "what's going on everybody I'm Justin I'm Rachel and welcome to foodie duo [Music] [Music] Hey yeah hi guys so so happy new year 2020 is gonna be a good year for everybody hopefully foodie duo moves up in the ranks and we're just gonna really focus on bringing the quality so guys today is our first video of 2020 and we have a special review today sure do today we are reviewing sour strips we actually found out about sour strips through long story short short story long I said he did find it through a short story long it's actually dramas podcast it's actually a really good podcast go check it out um and he had a guest on it and his name was max tuning right yeah yeah max tuning so he's like a he like started in the fitness industry and then he started and he made his own candy brand and it just dropped he's only been making candy for I don't even think a year yeah I think 2019 was his first drop but it sold out like how much yeah it just shows you how hard it is to combine this candy people are actually taking this candy and selling it on eBay selling it for like $18 a pack so we didn't do that we waited for the new drop because we're gonna be reviewing every single flavor and they have a new flavor that just dropped uh I think early this month so we're gonna be reviewing every single flavor and he said that he's just so tired of like he's such a sour candy enthusiast that he would get it and things like this it's not even sour this is not even sour and here he just got tired of it so I don't know what that means gonna be sour okay guys we had to dust this guy off earlier a lot of power you okay take her for a spin I'm so done sometimes I just want to this is our first choice Justin's just gonna train grab one from the floor try no trying here the blue raspberry hey brah actually excited yeah we really went to some good quality though did it like this is really good sour strips artificially flavored candy okay presentation is there oh I just want try it oh do you taste cotton candy in there hmm no first bite is sour but it gets good it's so really sour it's sour it is so it is sour that's why they called sour strips that are actually sour actual candy actual salary next flavor give that back mom are is strawberry oh that's definitely stronger I'm just glad these are strips and not roll-ups you know because that stuff is so annoying sometimes I'm not a big roll up guy all right I'll get the one with the more sugar on it oh these have more sugar at field three two one no miss a not as sour as blue bear boo boo Oh still sour the Blair's a little more sour I was like it sounds naughty minute I don't know though I I think I might like the blueberry one better I don't know they have so much flavor sponsor a straw but my stomach you guys how many sit in your car and it's called it's like negative degrees outside oh we don't eat a lot of sour candy we don't so I think I'm a little bit more sensitive yeah like yeah like my facial expressions say different but I don't think it's that sour I enjoy it like it's sour you enjoyed it isn't it the perfect mix huge shout-out to you guys this is by far between the both of them the best sour candy on the market that I have personally tried I don't know about you [Music] this is the one I'm most excited for and why is that I love rainbow I think it'll be like a makes or like maybe it's gonna taste more like candy like that sour like comes in and out it's a colorful flavor party who doesn't shake it shake it okay damn it son oh my goodness thank you bro I'm all about this whole thing yeah there's a green on there so I'm wondering I think it's gonna be like a fruit punch or something no no let's see really cool I'm taking this one hand me a harness and illusion I got only two different flavors okay I did too what were yours it was like a mango I'm like a mango but you got that and then at the end you had a different one it tastes like M&Ms in a way not M&Ms skittles oh my gosh oh not not M&M skittles like a sour scope but a better quality skills yeah dude I support you you just so proud of you even know you are I've been so like oh we know him I know it's crazy as we bought this candy like a month ago not even a few weeks ago and we've been just we've had so many videos because restaurants be messaging us we've had so many people messaging us for reviews and stuff so I'm so glad we're able get to this we wanted to make it a mission for this to be our first video of a little bite asleep like a different almost a different flavor I think every other bike we got one more flavor and it is their newest flavor that they just dropped December 2019 yep it's the newest flavor of them all I got some insight on this flavor because of his Instagram story and that story is that I'm dragging on tropical mango okay he won it you know what he wanted to do with this he wanted to call this mango margarita like he didn't want his parents like seeing their kids eating it and being light so he decided to compare it to like a mango margarita don't you like yellow right now like the yellow like it stands out packaging was good [Applause] you choose choose wisely all right look sour this is their newest flavor and I'm excited because this came out just recently it's that means they've had more time to perfect it so texture might even be better Wow something to think about genius I don't know yeah holy Camino oh I do what I want really sour sour does not exist oh good legitimate it tastes like an alcohol drink it does it tastes just like you know like it tastes like you're taking a sip of alcohol like if you if you just put this on the end of a mango margarita yeah I'd be so happy literally that's what it it does it does it taste like that Nick Topher right I don't know it I don't know if I like the flavor the best is there I still don't know honestly if you like margaritas is there's not a lot of mango candy out there let alone a sour mango candy rasa megwin candy I had I think was a Mexican daddy basically we're gonna rank them one through four on like our favorite flavor and guess like sourness mm-hmm it was hard just kind of hard to choose so guys my fourth place is gonna be strawberry really yeah you didn't like shopping I'm just not a strawberry I'm not I never get strawberry like ever I can fill it up but it was probably at least sour one two shake it up and then I'm gonna say my second player my third third third place let me say rainbow because they were I don't know I can't I just don't know what they tasted like that's like I guess it's like the best thing about them is yours what is that I have no idea and then I'm gonna say third place second place I'm just like sick is the main go and I'm gonna say may go because I'm learning to fruit and I've never had a mango like margarita yeah I can tell read first is the blue I just blueberries good like Justin said it can taste like cotton candy yeah like in the very end after this hour is gone it kind of tastes like cotton candy and I'm a sweet girl and this is good fourth place for me honestly would be this one's hard for me right I've a fourth place for me with the mango the newest wave with newest flavor like I hate to say but I'm honestly I'm here for honest reviews and like there's something telling me not to do this just cuz I feel bad because it's a newest flavor the flavor room is there I'm just not a tropical mango guy and that's what this is it's actually called tropical mango it was wrong and then I'm gonna do the rainbow a third place and the reason is is because there's so much of that mango flavor in there I felt like it did not taste like that though it did it it did not like I tasted mango though and maybe else cause I was excited because we were about to try the newest flavor so there's that and then strawberry second place I actually really like the strawberry I did and I'm not a strawberry guy that's the crazy thing so and then her first place blueberry for so everybody takes a dump for me we agree about to do a booty grenade about to drop a bomb on you fools we've never done a foodie your name before you're never feeling Rachel's not even taking part in a lot of these kind of tests I literally just came up with it so that's kind of you're gonna swallow that process that's our house a little Mingo

the day's video figured I would do a review on medicated nerds sorry people are always around one weird thing but I did pick up some of these medicated nerds says THC infused gummy rope covered with tiny tangy crunchy nerves says for medical use only warning to keep out of reach of children and animals and it says instead 400 milligram 400 milligram THC per row and in the back it says 60 minute activation time which that's honestly up to who ever since there's eight doses eight doses here okay as you can see this way it comes like there was some other flavors but back here you can see in their group there it is actually let's just open this up pop right into it they go boys we just say opened it smells good yep let's try it okay how do you exactly gate get the rope out of here is a question try see if I can't just push it up I think it may be kind of stuck on the sides we'll try to loosen it I want to eat this I will be doing the video afterwards there I'll let you guys know I want this [ __ ] edible and it's pissing me off back into the open there we go okay very good boys okay I'm day girl you can see some of it let's just take a bite pretty good really chewy [Music] pretty good ok it does taste a little weak at first I was gonna say it didn't really have a wheat taste but yeah you can kind of like at first it tastes really good tastes just like candy and then afterwards you can start to taste the cannabis tastes good then it's not like hard like I was expecting like some edibles sometimes like the gummies are kind of hard in stout this is really fresh we made about that much of it so far I have boys but like I said I'm gonna finish this off I don't know if I should actually know what shad just opting I'm not gonna eat all this cuz I don't know how strong it is I'm gonna try to gauge it still do have some things to do let's take one more bite of this all right wait about half of it so the whole thing is 400 milligrams I did at least 200 pretty good I really can't complain camera show you guys it one more time knock some of these nerds off they're like just shown mm-hmm your boy exotica loves candy but yeah just in there a nerd rip see this is why I can't have candy cuz all right boys I'm gonna enjoy this how does he get back to what I was doing before and also I got some new hot meds actually my first time seeing him in the tube but there's the QR code it's got the scratch just get the code and verify it or whatever or see the testings that's what the cartridge looks like pretty nice clean oil but yeah I'll be doing a review on that this one's actually Wi-Fi og um I don't know if this is gonna be the one I try I may actually give this away but if I do try it away guys no I made you a review on it but anyways guys I'm gonna come back in another video let you know what I think of the Medicaid inner nerd ropes if if I recommend them if they're good I'm actually not gonna smoke or take any dabs or anything I'm just gonna chill let this take its full effect again we'll see how I felt but I will let you guys know if I don't make another video I will let you guys know in the description below so if you want to know just

but anyways it's been your boys Annika I'm out", "4bQ73U0LTgo": "Oh guys welcome to CCC I'm Shane I'm Dave and we're back again for another strand review we got some fire lined up today we are checking out one of my all-time favorite strains from archive sea bank this is the face on fire yeah this last fire I actually drew this out in Colorado in my tent in my little apartment no gasolina guy so we'll just stop and do the gas tank so please we need some gas and we got the base on fire is Wi-Fi 43 white fire og right by the jungle boys now this was in John the boys cut basic 4 and 3 so that yeah they did like a heart explained this one though right there cut but the cut that they have that they write all right they got it from you know who does the Wi-Fi I didn't know it oh gee rascal oh gee rascal does the left foot and then jungle boys got like 250 seeds and then popped it and got 43 boom and it's crossed the face off there you go face off oh gee one of my favorite oh jeez that I haven't had in a long time yeah my favorites from archive you guys have you been watching this channel since 2014-2015 you probably know that we've always been big fans of archive seedbank and in fact everything that he has really pretty much almost everything that he's ever put out has been pretty [ __ ] fired yeah no lie the guy's got heat and we do have a relationship with him that we've had for probably not a decade or so so we hope to come up with the names for some of those perps trains like the grimace the perpetrator there's a couple other ones I forget but uh get some good fortune eggs but anyway this is not perfect no it's already steal your thunder I'm gonna rip away I totally forgot where I was I think I was somewhere in Denver and I was growing this stuff and I did a seed pop yeah ten seeds the home he upped it up with the dark guy and we did letters instead of numbers so it was f ofc I just remember that's what we called it I don't know why but it kind of ran off the tongue f ofc you could say fo f three rings off the tongue the same way number three or C was beat gaseous thing in this handgun and I'm not even lying that [ __ ] was so far so sad I lost that cut similar to this definitely similar to this when I popped the top on this I was like whoa all there it is it looks crazy definitely good lung expansion on this [ __ ] kind of hits you right in the chest on that first rib my second time smoking today wake-and-bake this morning went to the gym got in the sauna opened up the lungs like that and now that I came home and I'm hitting this mm-hmm it's uh it's really hit no joint tastes smooth he's gotten over there I want to get on that level but that joint is really smooth maybe I was just hitting it like soft cuz I was talking but and bit off a little more than I could chew on them when I'm about to break it all for a he's calm tends to be a little bit more on the dry side where is that one over there is a little better for the big grips but definitely a good flavor out of this thing the flavor is insane man it's really just how it smells I mean I guess we didn't even really talk about the smell on this one it's it's got a lot going on right yeah definitely got that OG spunk but there's like some sweetness in here to a more sweetness than I'm used to with that funk like you know how the period of Malibu and the Hollywood pure coach that we used to rave about it all the time you know how that [ __ ] always had a crazy sweeter for having like og and pine-sol II back see in that whole that whole thing it only surprised you with the sweet least getting some of that with this too I do my best to listen to you there got most of it oh my god that step so am I ready I got some money expander guys yeah this stuff up it looks pretty similar to what I was growing in Colorado but it does have a little bit more color I don't know we're just like purpley stuffs coming from but I do like it cuz we got a great gang over here it definitely has left a little bit of color though like if you look right here on this bottom line right here some pretty others and some darker hues in there it's not like straight grades but there are hues in there purple which I like which my cut didn't have it was straight lime green but and I would say mine had a little bit more rounder thuds these are a little more pointy so I would imagine this is leaning a little more towards the Wi-Fi because from what I've seen off the faceoff it's like a little more rounded the top I'm saying this one always crushes those far as people go all right I feel like this is a great Oh G just to grow if you want something that's gonna give fire and product and also you know be a joy to grow along the way it's about a 70 day flowering strain pretty indica heavy tsunami as far as the effect on this one pace is [ __ ] amazing this is one of the best matches I've seen I just have to say right now yeah yes pick this one up over at fair leave once again come the heat this stuff [ __ ] man I'm I gotta admit I was more excited to do the review or just to get my hands on this weed right then I was for [ __ ] almost anything in recent memory just because I already know I [ __ ] with extreme heavy but we haven't had it I didn't smoke did since we're gonna call Rob yeah that's been a few years for me as soon as I saw a homie I have this I was like damn yeah it's been a few years since I had this so it's definitely a treat and I gotta say we just said it on the when we were sitting on the couch earlier I can't even talk right now stick factor 1 million 1 million don't still be there tomorrow I think we're starting to develop the Chris speech impediment because like every time you how come these videos we're getting so high I can't even talk but I was saying we're sitting on the couch over there and we're like damn this weed just gives you the munchies and it gets you so high but it didn't so like yeah yes a has definitely been I think we've both seen a little dip in production while we've had this week torn up like you said consuming a lot more junk food and getting a little bit less done so yeah I would say that this is definitely a heavier smoke maybe something that a lot of people out there would choose to save for like the weekend or a time when you really ain't got much to do for the day you know super pretty too but it almost looks like the crew don't win like maybe just a few days longer I don't know now that I'm just looking at the buddy right here let me know if you guys agree on that some of the larger ones like that kind of have almost like some of those hairs still have almost a little bit of a white look to it as I'm adding almost but I still s it still everything smells amazing probably blasts into like blonde blonde blonde you cannot disagree with that and yeah I'm gonna just go into rating this stuff right here since I got it in my hand pack up of another bomber to rate the effect at the end but just know what it's better than joint or the bomb hunt a straight-up yeah I'm gonna try and make that decision right now but bringing the looks now just cuz I'm looking at it and I just broke this off I mean it's so hard like I'm gonna give it a 9.5 though just because of what I said actually I'm gonna give it a 9 just cuz I think it could have got filled out a little more and I don't think it got taken to its full potential so I think that's gonna be the biggest knock round honestly is the looks in my opinion even though it looks amazing I'm just judging it super critically and I think that maybe some of the bigger buzz just could have finished album yeah these smaller ones aren't don't have it yeah that one looks a little bit different than some of these smaller ones right yeah alright you know I'm just going off of what I see right here on the table it's mellow the smell this fills the room 10/10 on this man for sure not on words 10 on the smell I'm gonna keep smoking in here now I'm gonna rate the you know the taste in effect ooh yeah this one for me I say looks I'm gonna go nine and a half smell 12 I'm like there's some times you can give a couple bonus points right like there's some weed that had like other stuff is is a 10 when it's that strange which already has a good smell grown to its maximum potential right like that's a 10 but then there's some strange that the flavor is just so intense and it's same then even those other strains which you know may taste great groans their full potential is never gonna coat your palate and linger the same as other strains and that was one thing I always liked about a really really really good Oh G visit the flavour [ __ ] would linger right anger the Phrygians gassy pine-sol fuel e funky lemon F [ __ ] like that that og that's the one that just stays around 15 that's after you done smoking and that's this one right now be honest like this taste it really came through like Shane said this smell I gave it a 10 year 12 it comes through in the taste out of 10 so and the effect I'm gonna have to give it 10 dude like you guys are gonna start knocking us forgiven but we smoked funk around here and we like to only pick up fire when we can because you know we are spending our own block on this stuff so yeah I'm gonna give this stuff and overall a 9 overall nine nine point two and I'm a part isn't even equate on that that's what I'm I agree with the buzz one thing I noticed right away is this is a very quick onset hits right away right like usually when we do these videos it's almost hard sometimes to rate the buzz because I almost feel like it was finished in 20 minutes for the buzz to fully appreciate when you get that initial one I got the instant sweat on this one obviously we're behind the lights - but it's booking it's just angry yeah I'm sweating over here I feel it upstairs I feel like I look like this a little bit of like a little bit of pressure behind your eyes on those kind of a weird way to describe it but in a good way not in a bad way you know saying like it it's almost exactly I feel heavy but yeah it like puts you back like three inches farther you know really was it yeah I'm just I felt it right away so books on this one's crazy I've been rambling this entire video yeah I don't really know what else I could look for maybe like you said it but some of them were just a little bit tighter or maybe just a little bit more developed or finished looking but I don't even know if I cannot get you know if this stuff looks amazing taste amazing smokes amazing I'm glad you have a nine and a half oh my god that's a good call I gave you a nine point something he hated or not going five I think you can tell that we're a little high so we're gonna drive need some lemon I like you when I get some food because I'm really hungry where's all our in-and-out burger eaters out there I think that's what we're gonna go eat so another strangler Vidya of the CCC I am

of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "mabfxc09iq8": "hey guys welcome back to my channel today I'll be sharing the super easy recipe and this seems to be the latest craze right now all the kids are eating it everybody's buying it and do you know what I'm gonna share with you my simple version of it because it's so easy to make you're gonna need a bag of gummy bears and this is the party size it's twenty eight point eight ounces and you can use whatever gummies you have at home I also have these sour watermelons like GE but you can use sour patch kids you can use lifesaver gummies whatever kind of gummies you have use it anyway powder is basically plum powder it's a popular thing here in Hawaii and they have different brands as well but this Brown seems to be the popular one here you're also going to need lemon strips the Jade Brown is my favorite one if you can't find that they have different brands I found these as well they're called Rocky's and they also have local kind snacks some one that you don't want in don't get this don't get the lemon peel because this actually has seeds in it and you don't want that in your candy we're gonna also need one lemon juice from one lemon and just a little bit of sugar as well so let's get started the first thing you want to do is go ahead and blend your lemon strips in a blender the consistency that you want and you want it really fine and shred it because this will help to quote the gummy bears at the end when you're ready for alright so next you want to go ahead and juice one lemon and I have this little gadget here alright so I have my lemon juice and I actually measured this this is equivalent to two tablespoons of lemon juice so you want to go ahead and pour that in a bowl you also want to add one tablespoon of sugar two teaspoons of leaky moy powder and you want to go ahead and mix this until the sugar is dissolved completely so the sugar has completely dissolved at this point you want to go ahead and give it a little taste to see if you want it sweeter and if so go ahead and add in another tablespoon of sugar but I kind of like it this way because the gummy bears is already sweet and the lemon strips have sugar in it as well so I'm gonna just stick with one tablespoon next step is to add the entire bag of gummy bears go ahead and give it a good mix and make sure that the gummy bears are evenly coated with the lemon syrup [Music] here is a close-up of the final product you can see that every single gummy bear is covered with those lemon strips and that's just how I love them and I also went ahead and put the gummy bears and these little plastic containers cuz I'm gonna just give it out to family and friends anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this easy recipe give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below and feel free to share my video if you want to anyways thanks for watching guys and I'll see you guys next time Aloha", "-zVLOgUrfWo": "you know that imma keep it cold with you i feel like breaking rules on the edge looking now with no parachute you know what i'm dreaming about is you playing around without a clue oh", "S4zjNt10xYA": "hey lovely people so I just wanted to do a quick update and review of stony patch stony patch edibles because I noticed that in the video and the first video I posted about this edible a lot of people were telling me this isn't what they were getting so poor oh wow like the first five times I went to go purchase this in DC they came in a cube shape like this there was just like cubes and very chewy like they're just like a barian gummy type of edible now this is the first time so I've been purchasing these things for a couple of months now and this is the first time I'm actually getting the pack that people are talking about which look exactly like the original sour patch kids and they look like this okay so I'm just gonna eat one right now this is the first time I'm seeing them looking tasting and feeling like actual sour patch occasion I have to admit that when I tried these compared to the ones I had been getting before these the ones that look like sour patch is are less powerful less potent I got what I would eat like - I really wouldn't feel anything but these I would need like a half of one of a half of one of these squares and it would be good the texture is different as well so I really don't know what's going on according to both packages they both have the same ingredients they both say they are in compliance with the CA prop 215 SB 4 xx section blah blah blah I'm sure there's some type of DC law but I don't know um so yeah maybe I would have to eat more of the sour patch kids ones in order to feel something but the other ones we're buying like I am not sure why they're such a difference but yeah I just wanted to make it update to let you guys know that I did I finally know what you're talking about when you're saying oh my pad looks just like the sour patch cake okay I get it I know I know what you're talking talking about now but when I like I said like when I first started getting these for the first time they look like the squares like this this is like what I was introduced to when I was interested introduce this Tony fetch as a product so yeah I'm wonder with that Bell no idea everybody look it up anyway if you have any questions comment below

like every flavor they have and it smells so good and now airheads came up with these suckers man I don't know how new these are these are the airheads soft filled bites air has Italian candy I never knew that I was like American base was Italian candy I'm sure they have factories here you always have the same basic flavors you see it back here they have the blue raspberry green apple they got the cherry watermelon orange and strawberry flavor right here so without further ado your Boise snacks is about to go in on these suckers first I'm gonna try them like individually make sure each of those suckers a good tear from the side always tear a bag of candy that doesn't have like the rip on the ends you tear it from the side and you could turn it so you'll have like an evenly slot to open to

green then you have the watermelon which is a little darker green so don't get it confused you know I'm saying think they're all watermelon or green you could taste it you could probably taste it this

mattified potato chick acid benzo a number dyes sit two dextran that's not like a transform you're getting ready to transform it to a bigger robot I don't know what it is in the middle but it is

yo guys you'll ever see this make sure you snatch this up man here's your Boise snacks you", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the kirova Saturday morning cookie thanks for watching [Music]", "gtJ1uSs17kw": "[Music] hey y'all welcome back to my channel if you're new here my name is Taylor and I am a personal trainer in Dallas and majority of my channel is based around fitness nutrition at the occasional clothing hall in the occasional vlog and today we are going to be reviewing giving my unspun serd unbiased honest review of sour strips and if you don't have social media then you have not been bombarded with ads and I mean this is the whole craze right now this is what everyone wants to get their hands on sour strips sells out like that and they only do restocks every so often I think they just had their biggest restock yet when I purchased mine earlier in the week so definitely look at all of their social media follow everything that you can if you're interested after this video I will get into the nitty gritty details of exactly what I think about these sour strips and they're supposed to be really really sour so if you are just as excited about this video I am let's not live anymore and let's get right into it this company was built by max tuning and I believe a few other social media influencers as well and they came together and created a healthier version of candy this candy is supposed to be a better alternative for you it's supposed to be actual candy that doesn't have any of the unnecessary ingredients in the candy so I'm super excited at their most recent restock I purchased the variety pack that costs $19.99 I believe you can purchase individual packets or individual flavors for Less I think it's like $9.99 but I went ahead and wanted to share everything and all my thoughts with you so I purchased the variety pack and I got six flavors I received two strawberries two rainbow in two blue reds and to be honest with you I don't know which one is the fan favorite yet because I have seen everyone enjoy every flavor so they say so let's go ahead and look at the nutrient facts before we eat this there is a hundred and seventeen calories per serving there are four pieces per serving or 32 grams and there's three servings per package the total fat content is 0.7 grams which is incredible and the saturated fat is 0.4 grams zero trans fat the sodium is very low the total carbs are 26 grams the total sugars are 20 grams includes 20 grams of added sugar so it's 40% of your daily sugar and protein is a negative 1 gram so if you're looking for a low sugar high protein choice then this would not be it but if you have a sweet tooth then this is your go-to so let's go ahead and open oh my mouth is doing nothing um let's go ahead and open blue rats all right [Applause] here I go okay you have to give it a second that's our I can like feel it in the back of my mouth that is sour not as summer as I was hoping but it's pretty sour I love the warheads and I love sour things that is sour it'll get you back there don't get Jeff let's go ahead and try strawberry strawberry has the same nutritional fact and so does the rainbow as well the sour strips are pretty long in size and there's four pieces like I said per serving so it's a pretty good serving for such little calories I'd say for candy at least the strawberry I keep thinking I'm ready to talk and I'm not the strawberry is not as I mean it's hard to say I don't know if it's a mental thing because I always assumed that something blue it's gonna be more sour as I'm like salivating everywhere the strawberry is not as sour as the blue I don't know if that's like a mind thing or what but it's definitely so sour and just give it a minute because you bite into it it's not that bad and then you have to wait a little bit and then your mouth starts to really get crazy in the back they're sour but you want more like it makes you want more so on that note let's dust off our hands and try the rainbow this is the last flavour that we are going to try today and you think somebody said that it tastes like peach rings but I'm not sure so let's think I think the rainbow is beautiful I think that it's really nice I'm telling you these are really big strips so I appreciate that because they did not skimp us whatsoever on the sour dust or the size of the candy so I appreciate that all right let's try no eyes are watering let me go drink some water and get my eyes to stop watering and I will give you my conclusion so let's talk about blue razz I definitely think that it tastes just as blue raspberry should taste it really has that really yummy candy flavor but it's not overpowering the sourness the sour dust that I keep calling it is everywhere I mean they really tried to make it worth your time and your money to make a really good candy and I love this stuff already very sour if you like sour this is your go-to and it's much more sour than I thought like I said it does hit you like a little bit more intense after a few bites so be weary of that but honestly this tastes great and I'm not a big bluegrass fan but this is awesome moving on to strawberry this is such a good strawberry flavor there are so many candies that are trying to be a strawberry flavor and they're just not this stuff is so good the thought that went into this product was probably very very very extensive and I appreciate it I am more of a strawberry girl than a blue rascal on any other candy but this is gonna be really tough to beat I think I would reach for both of the flavors and be totally happy with either one the last flavor is the rainbow flavor the flavor is hard to describe I cannot figure out exactly what it tastes like but it definitely has a very distinctive flavor it's extremely sour it's extremely fun to look at and I think that these are definitely worth the money even though it is $20 for six packs of candy it seems like they will last you quite a while if you're sticking to the serving size I honestly don't think that you would be wasting your money if you did give these a shot if you do tag them on your social media they've seemed to be really good at really posting your stuff and showing your support which I really like has a lot of brands you can tag all day and they won't show any love back so I really appreciate that and I'm definitely going to be a returning customer my mouth is still salivating so I think I need to either eat Muller break but that concludes the video I'm so happy that I was able to film this and finally get my hands on these during a restock so like I said set your reminders if you're interested in trying these after this video and don't forget to hit the like button

time just kidding [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] okay so we are here at 7-eleven this is the back of a 7-eleven my Telus blue as you can see we had some sour strips that we tried I got one of each flavor we got rainbow we got strawberry we got what is this one tropical mango and we got blue raspberry now the blue raspberry was take some photos with it so I've already tried it it's delicious it tastes like a like a blue raspberry Jolly Rancher honestly this mango martyr margarita won this one I'm so excited to try cuz this was like one of those special edition flavors the rainbow the rainbow had also really good reviews I'm super excited to try this one all right know this strawberry one is going to be kind of boring I feel like but since its max shooting I'm excited to try it anyway so if you guys don't know sour strips is made by somebody who started a YouTube channel a few years ago his name's max shooting he's kind of grown into this huge youtuber and he has multiple businesses he runs a clothing line and one of the things he started was candy company so I really like the packaging if you guys can see this the packaging is very nice it's small this is about what's to say three servings per package the macros on these are point seven grams if that's a less than one gram of fat people about 20 grams sugar in this and it's about less than one gram of protein now of course they're gonna vary per sour strip but they're all pretty much the same comes out to about 117 calories for pieces it's 32 grams which is about one serving size which is typical for any sort of peanut butter for smaller serving item like a sour strip so I'm gonna go ahead and try the second shot location okay for the instagrams but we're gonna try this our story about flavors let's try it just water and it smells really good it smells like smells like skittles so it's like the oh my god this is so good this is definitely my favorite flavor flat bar Wow stay some time to try the tropical mango flavor I'm gonna rip this open these each costs about 360 I believe $3.60 or three dollars six cents of it like that pretty cheap so we got I got four of them for about $12 you like that math yes I'm freezing right now but I'm gonna go ahead and try this mango one so let's go ahead [Music] tastes like soap this one holy my mom is not used to sour things but this is really good this is just like mango max always thought that this tasted like margarita and it does mr. Cordry that's it okay final flavor this is strawberry my favorite flavor usually see how this one tastes max don't let me down big boy we got the strawberry one here we go [Music] this might be my favorite one this one nothing like a good strawberry flavor to end this vlog I know it wasn't really like a vlog but I wanted to test these I wanted to try these out I've been seeing these all over social media so I thought it was time just try they're about three dollars each who got one of each flavor [Music] got one of each flavor and yeah if you haven't yet hit that like button and subscribe see you next week", "DGlNc6tjTT8": "the cannabis edible one of the many glorious ways to consume cannabis they're tasty they're filling and best of all they get you high so you've been thinking about trying a cannabis edible for the first time to see what all the hype is about you should know that eating cannabis edibles to party your relaxed can be a fun and rewarding experience but remember THC does have the ability to intoxicate and should therefore like anything else be used responsibly I have before us the ultimate guide of all you need to know to guarantee an awesome edible experience ladies and gentlemen I give you the puffs puffs posts official guide to edibles I shall start us off with a story that is all too common among so many edible users and me Gwen Gwen wants to try cannabis edibles for the first time and enjoy a healthy dose of THC with her friends tonight she's inedible and eagerly awaits the euphoric effects she waits and waits expecting to feel something at any moment a full hour goes by and still no feeling of a cannabis hi she waits and waits another full hour still nothing by now Gwen is growing impatient and suspects that the edibles she ate just aren't potent enough for her she eats another edible this one should do the trick no more than five minutes go by and suddenly Gwen is hit with a full-frontal TC sensation she is consumed too much and the effects are overwhelming her she spends the rest of what should have been a fun night feeling over intoxicated what went wrong here did the edibles do this - Gwen or an a momentary lapse of preparation did Gwen do this to herself to find out what happened here we need to delve into the rules of edible consumption and examine just how Gwen broke these rules rule 1 know your notes unlike alcohol cannabis THC is a very safe non-toxic substance with no known lethal dose however much like alcohol when somebody ingests more than they can handle there can be some undesirable side effects excess of THC beyond one's threshold can result in a temporary increase of anxiety agitation elevated heart rate or even vomiting one of the biggest mistakes when made right off the bat was eating a cannabis edible without inquiring what the dose was one thing to remember for your first time is to start low and slow with a more manageable 20 milligrams of THC eaten will give you higher than 20 milligrams of TC smoked so you may have to dial your usual dosage back of it most health experts recommend a conservative 5 to 10 milligrams of THC to start you off just because your party animal friend can down cannabis animals like their potato chips and function fine doesn't mean you should immediately follow suit understand that everybody has different limitations when it comes to metabolizing THC the process of knowing your dose is crucial to gauge how much TC you can consume comfortably without erling yourself into a sour experience know your limits stay within it rule to wait just wait there is a difference between smoking and eating cannabis when cannabis is smoked your lungs absorb the cannabis right away and you feel the high instantly but when you eat cannabis it is processed through the liver and may take anywhere between one to two hours to feel the full effects another one of Gwen's many errors was failing to recognize this waiting period she mistook the delayed process of the edible digestion as it being ineffective in doing so she overcompensated by doubling her dose unnecessarily now any negative sensations she feels off the first edible will compound two hours later when she fully digest the second one she what when should have done was relaxed sit back eat Cheetos and let the edible run its full course so if you take an edible and you were waiting to feel for its effects but they never seem to arrive don't worry just wait some more give your body the appropriate amount of time to fully digest the edible and then decide whether or not you want more THC in your system rule 3 know what to expect so you've taken the appropriate dosage that best suits you and you've exercised patience and waiting for the substance to run its course good job the effects kick in the process of liver digestion is much more thorough than lung intake and your body will therefore absorb more properties from the cannabis at best you may feel a very cozy and content feeling or experience a heightened libido and increase sensuality rule 4 there is a time and place for edibles especially if it's your first time try not to drink alcohol while on edibles whose can magnify the effects of THC potentially making the user too hot I also would not recommend driving working or operating machinery after you take them since they can't intoxicate you instead it may be wise to reserved an entire day set aside for them like maybe the weekend or on a date you can just sit back and relax these conditions are optimal because you can feel the effects of an edible six to eight hours after ingesting them so be ready for a long day of fun taking an edible before you go to bed is also an option since the effects can combat insomnia for many people just like baby pictures and recounting your last trip to Las Vegas there is a time and a place for edibles so I hope you learned a thing or two from our guy remember when trying any new substance do your research find out the ideal dose for you educate yourself on what you can expect to feel and know when the best time to consume them is with all that being said I wish you all the best of trips follow these rules and I can guarantee you a safe and fun edible experience every time thank you very much for watching and follow us like us subscribe to us for more news cannabis thank you", "vLm9VAXFl6I": "and so I'd still take my life in it a fruit roll-up what's up guys welcome back today I have yet another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if there's any videos you would like to see I hope you guys enjoyed this video please

here and I'm gonna revisit it for you they're called sour patch fruits and this particular bag of sour patch fruits is almost empty it has my two least favorite flavors in it which are the cherry and the grape I really like the lime I really like the orange really like the lemon and I'll really like the water Helen so if you haven't gotten these or having seen these or families I again tell you  check it out they are awesome they are awesome but one of the flavors in there my mouth is watering as i say this i know i say my mouth is watering I say it all the time I say it every night absorbs are sorry my mouth is watering when I think of one flavor in particular are they more sour than the normal ones they are just a sour kiky but the flavors are so bright and fruit I mean they're really fruity like the line doesn't taste like a green Sour Patch Kid it tastes like a line the lemon taste like a lemon I don't speak French I'm sorry I read Spanish really well and I can respond minimally but death these are fruit fruit flavors now my mouth is watering and you see my mouth water perhaps the first fruit that would have given us a hint about these fruits you and I share back as we hate each other service I bought them today left them in the car so comforted him all I heard skinny mall thanks so much West Coast gee I'm feeling a little drag alicious tonight with my dark eye makeup and a big hill so perhaps something about chocolate hearts we called the brown hearts when you're in a candy cast we call them root beer or chocolate hearts oh I got that one I got that one all your sweetie thanks so much wesco stream i knows the stitching hey Holly I've been passing these up because they're gonna be gone in 20 minutes yeah they're awesome french translation so perhaps the first clue that we had on sour patch fruits were the one flavor in the bag that was initially sold by itself hi Terry thanks so much for joining and that slaver was watermelon and i have to tell you the watermelon is in the bag of fruits but this is my favorite flavor within the bag so i had to pick up this box of watermelon sour patch fruits because i just love them to pieces now I've seen peach sold separately peach is not in the fruit mix I've seen cherry sold separately cherry is in the fruit mix but here are the watermelon once the fruit ones are so awesome here are the watermelon sour patch from the watermelon box now here's the thing the watermelon in this mix are totally pink these are pink and green so I'm wondering if it's gonna be the same flavor profile let's check them out here they are they're really big smells water Melanie it's sweet not sour Wow not the same as the watermelon in the fruits bag these are really really chewy they're almost kind of begging my mouth it feels like yeah so I'm disappointed in these these watermelon ones are not the same as the watermelon in here and i bought this box thinking I was going to get the ones in here and I love the ones in here so I'm really disappointed thumbs down and I was gonna buy a big bag of you so it's good to get it by big bag so for those of you who are fans of the watermelon sour patch here the fruits are different I don't have a whole bag of which to show you right now but these fruits are so flavorful oh you are good what's your favorite flavor this watermelon is less sour it's a bigger piece of candy it is a chewier piece of candy it is not the same as the watermelon in this bag which I love so once again i highly recommend the sour patch fruits which are still hard to find South cooler I am

this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much for joining me today you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "eQAf6JKXLyw": "today Kevin and I have some candy that we're gonna be trying for you I have the airheads dummies it says original fruit but elevators anyway and these are the trolley sour bright all-star mix so we probably had everything in there but they put it in a new mix on it and I don't know that we have had everything in there is a lot I remember the hands so it moves a little llamas an honorable star I remember the sloth that's a sloth we had those long I don't think it's an octopus we had another movie so even if we have it's okay we'll try them again they were both bought at Walmart the trolley were a dollar I'm sure the airheads were a dollar eight so there's blue raspberry cherry watermelon orange green apple and strawberry so six different flavors interactive shapes for playful taste combinations there's three and a half servings 1/4 cup 30 grams a hundred calories so this is one of those that you would have to go way to find out how many you get there they're balloons well there's faces and like here's some sunglasses you stick it on my face oh look I have a little orange balloon and he has green sunglasses elbow Tom uh-huh - whoops oh I like that ya know that there's all kinds of different stuff to play with so let me take a picture real quick of some of these and we'll be back okay we did get all the colors but we only got one red so that's why I went ahead and took a picture for you all because once we eat it it's going to be going so which one would you like to try first let's try the one red one let's go for it the other ones we could travel without vitamin half-decent tube yep to top they're all the flavors are good the flavor is good but it's not really really powerful no but you can definitely tell us chair you can definitely tell it's very it it it's not as strong a cherry it's like a lifecycle no but it's oh no I take the thing line about put that magenta cami who knows what's good though you want to do blue raspberry yeah you know a mess - I know I've got sunglasses these are the places where do you think these are mighty Italy mm-hmm there are products of Italy I did not know that the food was good again folks there I like the I think the blue resident was stronger than Jerry yes it really is and it was a nice difficult blue raspberry watermelon is the next it's dark room mm-hmm it's a dark green there's a dark green in the light brown mm-hmm now that flavor was strong mm-hmm that's incredibly strong mm-hmm that means Jolly Rancher watermelon you've ever had Jolly Ranchers that's what I grew up eating back at being a kid of them and the 80s we had a lot of jolly rancher so everything compares to those huh the square of Jolly Rancher Danny okay orange is next I got a post kind of this time it's a good strong no it's not my favorite orange and I don't I don't know that I've ever season of hot orange before it's not my favorite orange but it's not a tangerine yeah yeah I don't know that it's a true anymore no more pain jury yeah I don't mind it okay green apple is the light green hmm there's a little man on the bike and he's orange and he has paint sunglasses and a bloom I like the green apple none of these are like over the top besides that watermelon that watermelon no there are strong as most other good yeah the last one is strawberry and that's pink hmm and I like that yeah honestly it surprises me I like it I don't know I've ever said this but yeah the orange ones my least favorite problem the problem is it isn't a true orange but I don't it's not that I mind it it's just not my favorite the strongest one in that whole bunch was the watermelon yeah and what it would be your favorite out of all those probably watermelons these are saying losses Kevin's trying to put something together for you and I'll have a picture of Kevin's little creations here that he's doing on play at the end well I guess I'll have to take a picture of it right now because I have to now people are gonna want to see your creations I'll take picture of them so what was your favorite the watermelon was your favorite um I would say the blue raspberry or strawberry was probably my I like watermelon and also that I liked the apple juice box okay so these are these are prolly sound also a mix there are crawlers sloths octopus llamas and tiny Deadpool but yeah so three and a half servings per by 1/6 cup of 30 grams you have to Wayne is 100 calories and I'm gonna do whatever this video is going to be cut when you see cuts there's gonna be more cuts than normal because I have to take a picture now because if I doubt we're gonna eat everything and then you won't get to see what all came in the bag so those Hamas are cute yeah I don't remember having one thing you've done are they conjoined they are that was about the tail so so when you see cuts it's not because something funny happened or looser so we made a mistake or something it's because I'm taking pictures that's a slaw but it's funny that the llama and the fall will look like though the exact name Piper they do they're the silent alarm how big is this three-and-a-half sorry in this bag I don't think you get a lot at this one you want to get the scale just for everything you're talking about like one one of these off the buses and feed that hunt and while we have over here because I wasn't gonna ask him before to get up but I know you all love when we measure stuff I didn't show it's very interesting let's do these folks these you get 30 grams essentially oh it's the same thing it's nice to have a visual let's do just all the Ling's so we have something to number of balloons that you get yeah yeah Bob okay so you get 5 of the boiler boiler and that's the ideal of accessories it's going to be a blended by 2 accessories probably ok nowadays you can't pedal money okay an octopus flaw right that was perfect so you get basically four pieces yeah now you can't pick the biggest for No yeah the biggest you have all fall I'll pick the biggest pieces in there and it's gonna be the same color yeah go to 40 if you get the big ones yeah there you go so about four what did you get too big too small yeah okay so I you really don't get that much in this bag what do you want our post mm-hmm do you want to see if I hand is the same as a small are you going try five-and-a-half cuz you're got the bottom always why don't I do a worm and you do a hand sure are you okay hmm public Peter lang go I'm glad I got the one that's totally magnetic mmm-hmm PG no our new man goes with that PG and they are I like we've tried yeah I don't it probably was supposed to have grape in there but purple I didn't taste any grape and all the only thing I taste in there is and I go there the hand so those were the same yeah you want to buy so we really we're only getting like four four white box right it's okay what do you want next thing possibly cake he didn't want to get eaten I'm like oh the red and the blue hole I honestly there's a bubble pencil icon yeah yeah hold on we might have a berry it mix it knows yeah that's good I like that it probably does have a berry mix mixed in there but it takes a little bit like bubblegum to make I like that okay bye for these now these are basically all green bullion and then you get a lot of yellow so let's try one of these by now can you buy now know much about it that is a lemon law Nomad flew on the strong side but yeah there's a little bit of funkiness there yeah yeah this one it looks like the same thing except the the one with primarily green this one's primarily yellow yeah I like that weird no that's not no yeah I don't like I have no idea what that is the only going in there is the red the blue yeah I don't like that that grew the gray it's not lemon lon I said that at bars have private consistent colors but yeah there was some kind of funkiness in there that was really bad I don't care for those at all something about us honestly the only ones I did care for were that blue and pink the llama room it looks big to me because it did have a berry bubblegummy type flavor so sleepy I personally would pass on colors this because I would not want to eat one of them's yellow and green yeah yeah those are mango so that was spunk I don't like yeah I like they're good so we're good these that was it again aren't they the best gummies I've ever had no they're not my favorite at all but they're very good and for a dollar eight for the amount that you get I think it's a really good amount gonna goodbye a page of these and take it with you in the car and the movie theater or whatever and you're gonna have a lot so definitely worth the price I think so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "dNfrNTZ5Sz8": "[Music] okay today we're here to review these uh three um they're kind of unusual jelly beans they're flavored like uh normal candies so this is jolly rancher uh jelly beans this one's sour patch kids jelly beans this one is nerds jelly beans let's try this one first this is jolly ranchers i'm not sure if they're the different foods will taste differently really for original flavors this is a purple one red pink orange green purple light blue i think nope i think they do taste all the flavors taste different i mean the colors taste like the flavors and they're all colored like the outsiders colors like the inside not quite as um um the flavors are not quite as prominent as like the jolly rancher flavors but they're pretty close [Applause] actually as you chewing more the flavor comes out more this one's supposed to have five flavors let's see one two three four five so there's red yellow orange green and blue blue raspberry you gotta get past the sugar first and then the sour comes in that one was a lime one that one wasn't as bad as the blue one was red one's pretty sour too that was red berry orange is not as bad [Applause] nothing's not as bad either no they're stuck twicky [Applause] okay these are nerds big chewy nerds let's see only three colors nope that's the same thing i think there's only three colors all right orange four cups these are crunchier on the outside i'm trying to remember what things did i used to eat them all the time what was that one the red one was a little sour yellow's a little sour too nerds are a little sour so yeah these are a little sour these are more sour because they are sour patch kids and then these are just kind of a normal rancher type flavors [Applause] and each of the colors are different flavors so it's not like i don't know you probably could just grab a handful and stick it in your mouth they're they're not that weird flavor is not like uh jelly bellies or sometimes you can get some weird flavors in there but yeah these are all good if you're kind of tired of all the the normal jelly beans where they all taste the same every color tastes the same try getting these instead because they're different and i bought these probably actually i think two of them i bought at uh five below i don't remember which two and then the other one i bought at i think target or something so if you find them they're probably only here for easter so get them all you can or wait till after easter and get them for 75 off so anyways let me take another break with this

grapes and i'll just drop the melon like this a piece easier to squeeze so now i'm cutting the lemon just squeeze it and i'll put the lemon on top of the grapes now i pour it in the lemon on the grapes and i got all the seeds out so now i'm going to mix the grapes with my hand with the lemon so it becomes sour but yummy so now i'm going to test the grapes they're really yummy they're really yummy they're sour but they're really yummy they become sweeter when you swallow them but they're sour but that makes it chilly it's really yummy okay so it's my turn to try them and i'm really

on the on the youtube membership program or on patreon now let's go ahead and get into this video here we go all right guys so let's go ahead and get into today's video today we're going to be doing our own homemade nerve ropes this video has been highly requested for quite some time so we're going to go ahead and make it happen today now there is an easy way to do it and there's a hard way to do it of course i'm going to show you the easy way to do it today if you guys want the like the harder way maybe we can do that at a later time but today i'm going to show you the easiest way to make your homemade nerd ropes so the first thing that we got to do is i'm going to show you what we need we're going to be using some is it haribo i don't know is it haribo hariba let's go haribo we're going to use haribo um gold bears this is what i was saying about the easy way and the hard way these are ways just to take these bears right here we're going to melt them down in the microwave that's the easiest way the hard way would be the harder way i was ashamed to be to go ahead and make our own gelatin just like you would do when we're making our gummy bears you can go and make your gelatin that way as well and do it but we're going to go ahead and just melt these down and do it the easy way and of course with nerd ropes you're going to need some nerds so i went to the store and i got some nerds so as you can see right here i have a baking sheet on the baking sheet i have some parchment paper what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take some aluminum foil and what we're gonna do is we're gonna actually make kind of like you can call it like a mold and that way we able to we'll be able to distribute our nerds and make our our nerd ropes the way that we want to make them all right but first what we got to do is we have to take some aluminum foil and we're actually going to make our mold you can say so that way we'll be able to distribute our nerds evenly let me show you what i mean you're going to take some aluminum foil we're going to make kind of like an accordion shape let me show you all right so you can see we have a piece of aluminum foil and we're going to do an accordion shape what i mean by that is you're going to hold it like this you're going to fold it like this and then we're going to [Music] hold it back like this we'll do that back and forth all right so you see we folded it back and forth now we just want to open it all right so that way you can you guys can see what i've done i've just made you can basically say like a w or m whatever that way we have places where we can actually put our nerds right we can put our nerds in here are you guys getting a good picture this way i don't think so let me raise up the camera and get a better angle for you guys but i don't think you're getting a good a good angle let me raise you guys up some there we go i think i made this a little bit too long i do believe i can fix that though there we go so i made him too long but i fixed that just by tearing off so now you can guys can see better what i'm talking about so what i'm proposing to do is [Music] now you see we have peaks and valleys in the valleys we're going to actually form our nerd ropes you see what i'm saying so what we're going to do is we're going to pour our nerve ropes in here right for the bottom layer and then what we're going to do is we're going to put these bears inside of this measuring cup and melt them down in the microwave at that point that's where we're going to medicate it now as far as how to medicate this you can use tincture you can use coconut oil it's up to you we're going to use some coconut oil today but if you got some tincture use that and as far as how much you want to use it's really based upon how strong do you want it i'm going to use two or three tablespoons of coconut oil for this but it's really up to you about how much do you want to medicate it if you're talking about how much thc you're putting in it that you know it just depends on how strong did you make your oil how strong did you make your tincture and then from that you can go ahead and you know put it in accordingly so let's go ahead and do the first part of this which is putting the nerds in here i'm gonna take a box open them i'm gonna start putting them in here i got seven boxes so hopefully that's enough [Music] if it's not oh no [Music] oh nerds all right [Music] and i said i'm going to try something on this last one what i want to do is i really want to take some spray and like spray it in here [Music] because as you can see i did these without any spray right here and so i'm wondering how how they're gonna be as far as sticking to the aluminum foil in the past when i've used things with aluminum foil and it's sticking it's been really hard to come off i'm just really trying to make sure they got an even coat so let me do that coconut oil cooking spray and i'm just going to [Music] and that's going to be our test to see if we should have sprayed it i just thought about it right now all right so look take some more of these nerds put them in here all right so we're pretty good on that i have four rows ready to do four ropes i bought a lot of nerds so i can now always do more batches so now what we got to do is we're going to take our bears right here we're going to put them in this measuring cup pyrex measuring cup put it in the microwave we're going to melt them down and then that's when we're going to take and our fused oil and medicate this up obviously if you don't want to medicate it just don't use the oil don't use any tincture if you want to make fantastic nerd ropes just like this that'll be just fine so yeah here we go all right so there's two cups in this bag we're going to use one cup right now like i said i'm doing this in batches so that way everything will work out the way we want it to so i'm going to take a cup of these gummy bears there's two cups in the bag we're going to take half of this and let's go ahead and put this in the microwave and melt this down and i'll show you what it looks like when it's finished this is two and a half minutes in the microwave and so you can see it's melted down now look at that so we're gonna do now that just melts it down we're going to take our coconut oil you can use tincture if you have tincture and like i said depends on how strong you want it i'm gonna do two tablespoons you know what i really you know what three tablespoons why not three tablespoons in there we're going to stir it up make sure you stir it up nice we're going to put this back in the microwave so we can warm this back up and keep it liquid once that happens and we take it out i'm going to put it in this squeeze bottle to make it easier to do the lines for the nerd ropes there's a lot of ways that you can do i've seen people pouring it cutting bags and that kind of stuff i think the easiest way to do is going to be with a one dollar squeeze bottle that you can get from the dollar store if you need a link for this i will put it in the description for you but yeah back in the microwave we go all right guys so we're out of the microwave now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take this and i'll pour it inside of here to make it easier [Music] so now we got this in here let's go ahead and do some lines that doesn't sound right let's put some lines in here so we can go ahead and medicate this go slow all right guys that's pretty hot so i'm going to use my magical butter glove in order to do it [Music] there we go very nice [Music] and this is going to be the easiest way for you to do it so you can control what you're doing what i like to do is just go down one time up one time and that'll be good enough [Music] it's like the easiest way to control what you're doing you can put exact strings in there perfect look at that look at that beautiful that's the way to do it without any of the waste and what's so great about it is in this squeeze bottle if it goes down in temperature all you got to do is warm it up a little bit and you can continue to do what you're doing all right guys so now that we got that done before this dries up let's go ahead and put some nerves back on the top of this [Music] all right guys so now you can see that we have everything covered there we go so now we have our [Music] gumby mixture in between the nerds and now all we got to do is just let them sit all right guys so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put these in the refrigerator for 30 minutes and then i'm going to take them out and take them off the take them out of the mold here and show you what they look like so yeah give me 30 minutes we're going to put them in the refrigerator and we'll be back in 30 minutes all right guys so it's been 30 minutes inside the refrigerator all right so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to attempt to peel these off see if they're set [Music] look at that it doesn't matter about if all the uh excess nerds fall on the tray that's why we put the parchment paper down look at that yeah i told you guys this is the easiest way to do it nero nero all right so these have been coming off pretty easy here doing it the way that i did it these are the ones by the way these are the ones that we didn't put the the spray down this one right here is the one that we did this right here is with no spray nerd rope nerd bro all right now this one is the one with the uh with the sprite and they came look the one with the spray came right off so i would say guys you might want to use this break because the one with the spray came right off look at that [Music] alright guys so i hope that you found this video helpful before we get up out of here i do want to do today's subscriber spotlight

"BuvQMBdyOvE": "can you go down yep okay so welcome to the first honest non-biased uh not review but i would say it's more of an opinion about uh sour strips so this will be the first video and we are going to be going over sour strips i'm sure you guys have heard of them i hope you guys have heard of them and the thing i can't understand before i start is how it's taken me over a year to finally realize that these things ever existed and i'm pretty upset about it this is the starter pack so if you have not heard of sour strips uh just take a look at this video okay not that one but this one what is going on guys today is a big day it is my birthday i turn 30 years old which means i am gonna be feeling a little more achy when i get out of bed i get a senior citizen discount everywhere i

yeah just give my opinion about the candy itself okay so i am a candy lover but i am not gonna use that in my biased opinion on this product uh yeah so let's just dive right in we are starting with the strawberry [Music] first opinion they are sour and they're definitely sour and they taste just like strawberry well this one does indeed so let's move on to the next one okay so i'm just gonna run through these uh yeah so just cute the time lapse but before you do i'm actually gonna break this in half have two so i can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on much healthier all right so keep the time lapse [Applause] [Music] much healthier okay okay that's better one we know it's a great product two we know that it's sour hence the name sour strips but three we're going to rate these sour strips based off of uh basically just the flavor just which ones in my opinion are better than the other ones okay number one it's gonna be mango number two is uh it's not really a flavor but rainbow three green apple four blue raspberry five pink lemonade and six yeah cause after five is six strawberries so that's my opinion of the product itself but every time that i eat it um yeah it reminds me of kevin oh yeah oh so with that said great product tastes great it's sour it is a genuine sour candy go try it so there's a link in the description below it's no affiliate code it does bring you to the website if you want to purchase any um yeah i suggest you go get them wait before you guys go two new flavors just got here they are duos they are double berry and they're apple berry so i did already try them and um if i had pick between the double berry or the apple berry", "PBcVVvQerHY": "hey it's anna welcome to my channel star patch kid and today i'm gonna tell you exactly what happened when i took apple cider vinegar gummies for a month straight let's get it let's go all right guys so the company i will be using my apple cider vinegar gummies from is called nutrit and i've never tried a product like this before this says it's a metabolism enhancer an immune booster and cholesterol control gummies dietary supplements all right so this says experience the sweet side of apple cider vinegar welcome to neutral trek where every evidence-based formulation unlocks the goodness of daily essential superfoods into forward-thinking study-backed supplement safety crafted in our gmp fda registered facility this nutrient-rich supplement is no different we're known for its superior b9 and b12 potency it supports the optimal balance of happiness and wellness you'd expect from raw apple cider vinegar without the bitter aftertaste this is 100 vegan non-gmo that is a lot of information which is pretty good to know so let's get to the back it says standard standards gmp products made an fda registered facility non-gmo vegan and gluten-free so if you're gluten-free or gluten-sensitive honey like celiac disease this is for you if you guys didn't know i am a diabetic so i do tend to develop um gluten sensitivity so this is definitely a good product for me honey okay so suggested use is to take two to three gummies per day two gummies equal to one shot of apple cider vinegar i think i'm gonna stick to two there is actually 60 pieces in here so let's see what it looked like on the inside now i actually used to take apple cider vinegar shots all the time when i was overweight and trying to lose it it was actually a really really big help in my weight loss so looking at the bottle in here it looks kind of like the box which is kind of cool they have like a black and green thing going so let's get the top off and get into what these gummies taste like all right so i've got my safety seal up and double sealed y'all know how i feel about that so okay this one was easy to get out oh oh okay it kind of smells like fruit and vinegar i don't know how i feel about that yet but i'm used to taking apple cider vinegar shots so let's see they're actually really cute you guys let me see if y'all can see the inside there's like a variety of colors let me see oh there's an apple on it i don't know if that just stands for apple cider vinegar or if they're supposed to have a specific fruit taste but let's see y'all oh they're shaped like little apples i wonder if they're all the same color [Music] it kind of tastes like cranberries okay yeah that's what they're all the same color it actually tastes really good it tastes like cranberries if you like cranberry juice you would really like it it also low-key tastes like peach these are really good oh my god all right guys so i am about to take my very last dose of this of this apple cider vinegar gummies now y'all saw me take my very first bite now you'll get to see me take my last ones [Music] all right i'm back so what was my experience like using nutritrex apple cider vinegar gummies now when i first open the bottle it smells like vinegar so i didn't know what i was getting myself into but when i tried these gummies when i tell you they tasted so good but let me tell you exactly what happened while i was taking these pills so well these gummies so i'm a type 1 diabetic but i typically get times when i crave sweets all the time i curb those cravings a lot i try to keep them down but i find that since i started taking these vitamins it's curved my cravings for me i haven't felt the need to really have anything sugary or sweet at all times like i usually do i've cut down a lot i think i've only gotten just one slice of cake the entire month that i was doing this and i didn't even finish it that's not like me usually i try to get one cheat dessert in at least once a week or every week and a half but this time around that did not happen what else happened was that as a type 1 diabetic my digestive system has already been affected so i don't eat much i eat very little portions and i eat once a day this is not because i want to it's because my body physically cannot handle food okay so it's really hard for me to actually eat on a regular basis i could go literally weeks just living on water and juice that's how bad my digestive system is but while i was taking these vitamins i realized that it was easier for me to snack a little bit here and there throughout the day and i've been having actually a lot healthier snacks i've been having you know some granola bars uh natural ones of course i tried like i said i haven't been craving sweets as much so i've been eating a lot of fruits i've been eating a lot of well not a lot i've been um eating some granola bars like nature valley some kind bars i've been eating pineapples a lot you guys know i love my citrus every single time i cook dinner i tend to add vegetable based um i usually try to go for a larger amount of plant-based items on my plate um but yeah it seems like i've been eating a lot less carbs than i already was eating which wasn't much to begin with a lot of times i found myself craving natural things like i've made soups a lot vegetable soups have made chicken soup it's like in my household making soup is usually something we do once a month but i've been living on pretty much a healthier diet it's literally i'm not saying that this completely changed my life no it's just from curbing my cravings from helping me with not craving sweets it really helped me to want to eat the things that make me feel good if that makes sense so i really appreciated um having this vitamin now the thing is i'm already a really skinny person typically i weigh anywhere between 115 to 130 pounds when i started this challenge i was about 122 pounds and the last time i went to the doctors unfortunately i can't record all these things because being a diabetic i have to be in and out of whatever appointments i go through because of my opinion because of the pandemic so the last time i did check i was at 1 15 and that was only about two weeks into taking these vitamins so other than that i did not take it specifically to lose weight even though that is the purpose of it i've taken apple cider vinegar shots in the past and that helps my weight loss i don't know if this um if these pills have helped me lose a lot more but i know for a fact that within the two weeks that i was taking it in my diet changing a little bit i did see you know my weight go down a bit i do feel like my clothes feel a little bit better on me um i'm back to a size four because after having my son i was a size like six went to a size four and then went back up to six after starting these gummies i went back down to my size fours i'm not able to fit into the clothes that i got when i originally lost my pregnancy weight so there's that another thing i will mention about this is that i do feel like it was successful now i will be showing you my before and after obviously and you could judge for yourself but again i wasn't really taking it just to lose weight if that makes sense my main goal is to tone my body i actually got into working out again after starting this medication i mean after starting these vitamins i also did the gal in a day by accident um when i first started taking the pills i found that i was drinking a lot more water than i usually do i've actually reduced the amount of juice i was drinking also i find that literally the these vitamins really help i've been really i mean of course as a diabetic i have to be conscious about these things and i did notice the change when i really took the time to you know take the vitamins every day and actually you know realizing that i'm feeling good about myself and the other thing is i have somebody else who tried it and i noticed that they are also losing weight actually i could just say it because i just remembered i've already introduced my fiance to the channel um he decided to try these out of curiosity and ended up liking them too but i did notice in him specifically that he has gone down quite a lot so that's how i know that this product actually works you guys already know that i would never come on here and lie to you about anything because that's just who i am i cannot do that like we don't do fake here okay that's practically my motto so i do genuinely feel like this actually does help with weight loss and helping with lifestyle a little bit so with everything that has happened following me starting these vitamins me doing the water challenge me you know getting into yoga working out stretching every morning i've actually been doing these things religiously so all these things all together do add up to you know the results that i have today but it all again started as a domino effect of me starting these you know vitamins so this is pretty much what happened to me when i took the apple cider vinegar gummies for a month straight and i hope that if you try this product out you also enjoy it but again this is not a sponsored video um so i'm really hoping that anyone who gives this a try you know let me know let me know in the comment section have you ever tried apple cider vinegar shots have you tried the gummies have you tried the pills what have you tried what have you done to help yourself lose weight or maintain a health a healthy lifestyle so yeah usually on here i do beauty content unboxing and all that kind of fun stuff so if that's something you're into please be sure to

necklace perhaps a bracelet or they can be stretched out like that now how do they think of these things and how do they make them let's watch call it colorful and crazy twisty or tasty nerds rope stretch the imagination network has quite quite something it's a gummy Center covered in rainbow nerds it's like a big delicious strand of DNA nerds ropes are fairly new but regular nerds have been around since 1983 the most popular flavors are great and strawberry and if you like them tart they also makes our nerds and flavors like lightning lemon and amped Apple usually one box of nerds has two flavors but the Nerds rope is like a cluster of five colors and flavors grape orange lemon watermelon and strawberry it's it's quite an experience Willy Wonka invited us into his private factory in Itasca Illinois where nerds ropes roll off the conveyor in not feet but miles we're to line up all of our nerds rope so we make it one day and then we have over 60 miles of nerds rope believe it or not it's thought this sugary strand came about by accident the word round the factories that one day there were load of nerds laying around and somebody was experimenting with some gummies that mystery inventor apparently dribbled some of the gummy mixture over a pile of nerds and then he went to lunch and then when they came back they discovered this amazing thing and then they said about how to how to create this so that lots of people could enjoy and they were very successful before you can have a nerds rope you have to have nerds nerds are just this iconic amazing candy that have tons of character I mean I think when you see the me big mango get just it just blows your mind more than a hundred fifty million of these tiny crunchy candies coat the ropes each day the sugar spins and pans like this and slowly grows into lots of uniquely shaped nerds check out these naked nerds this is what they look like before they add color meantime the gummy Center cooks with gelatin sugar and a special ingredient citric acid for fruity flavor this is not a shower of nerds it's more like a storm countless little candies cover the long sticky red ropes then they cut them and cool them down and within a few minutes a conveyor leads to the finish ropes to a container called au bord and that you board allows us to be able to wrap it so it'll maintain its shape as we send it out each rainbow-colored creation slides into a shiny foil wrapper as for what happens next well that's up to whoever opens it no Jeff is just one of those super super creative candies I mean it's just like pure imagination I would say it's a one of a kind so the next time your kids want a colorful candy edition to play dress-up how about a nerds rope ring or belt for candy bling nerds ropes make a funny fashion statement ten and even better edible accessory", "VEiE_EhsW6Y": "a warning from police in Westchester County tonight about cannabis candy they discovered some during a bust last week and now one police chief wants to warn parents that these marijuana infused treats could easily be confused by kids for the real thing Marcus solace has a story police admit it wasn't the arrest of the century an alleged low-level marijuana dealer busted in Tarrytown this week but it's more than buds that were seized there's THC in liquid form attachments for e-cigarettes and what's most troubling for the police chief edibles in the form of gummy candy I feel very strong that there is no need to put it in the form of something that's very attractive all to young children Chief John barber Len says the issue isn't whether recreational use of marijuana should be legal in New York as it is in several states and most recently in Canada his concern is the marketing of certain products containing THC there's two issues here hey is it an attraction to younger people that really shouldn't be making that decision and B what is the possibility of accidental exposure the chief points to a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found in Colorado the number of children hospitalized due to accidental exposure jumped 34% so could the sugary stuff be mistaken for something harder the similarities are striking down to the same shape and coloring of the products so if I was to put this on my counter with my ten-year-old daughter home what's to say she's not gonna pick it up and he didn't think it's a gummy worm from CBS who was to say the difference a difference he says parents should be aware of", "kKXvenwafZU": "[Applause] hi guys welcome to my channel I hope you're having a good day today today I have the toilers ball and Peele I have the airhead extremes and then I have the air at extreme bites let's get started oh they're so good they're chewy let's try the airhead extremes I loved the level of sourness of DOS it's not too much but it's very good these are the bikes mister actually he brought me of my favorite candy these have little lines in them but you can't really bear that and I realize people with OCD they will not like if I just bite these I wanted to get the rainbow ones these are definitely more sour than the bites you guys hate me if I bite it [Applause] that's a lot of gummy candy just a few more there's the end of the video I hope you enjoyed watching make sure to subscribe like and follow me on Instagram as well I'll see you in

jesus and all my other homies today to talk moana that's right we're back with wanna uh surely i'm not gonna take the time to link below uh the video where i screwed up reviewing them before so we are here to review them in earnest today they're watermelon hybrid gummies uh this is a vegan gummy from wanna coming in at 20 bucks from my dispensary so this puts this at the uh highest end of the gummy um edibles at my dispensary so a bit of a premium for the wanna gummies um but nothing else too fancy here pretty basic packaging from wanna with their hybrid watermelon gummies we're gonna do it nice and short and quick here so that we don't upset the j-man we're going to pinch here as it says open it up and there are our wanna weed watermelon gummies manufactured by high life farms we've got our wonderful lab testing results and all of our stuff my cameraman is currently being uh pulled away by the dogs at this moment but that's okay here we go here is our watermelon gummy looking really nice and square how wonderful watermelon sugar weed aftertaste not bad pretty good well i am now my own cameraman again um and these wanna weed gummies well if you've had a weed gummy before you know what to expect um a lot of sugar to mask the taste and a pretty hefty cannabis aftertaste but i have certainly had worse uh and haven't had too many that are quite a bit better in terms of taste but it's not about how it tastes about how it makes you feel and for that guys i'm gonna come back to you in about two hours after i finish another whole hell a lot of a hell of a lot of these gummies and once i do i'll come back and i will let you know if these wanna weed gummies are as good as we all wanted them to be ugh anyways say hi stay healthy we'll see you back here in just a bit goodbye welcome back to wheat skies i'm back from paradise on earth or what was it called jesus's cameraman do you remember desert christ park welcome back to wheats guys i'm back from desert christ park or something like that the place with all the jesuses uh where we first tried the wanna cannabis infused watermelon hybrid gummies and these are pretty good gummies uh i'm not a hundred percent sure they're worth the 20 premium uh they are uh sort of better quality than the cheapest gummies for sure uh but whether they're the uh sort of eight dollar premium i'm not a hundred percent but they are definitely good quality and if you are concerned about um healthiness in your gummies excuse me guys there's a dog who's really just insistent go get them get out of my face um so if you're really concerned about your uh health and all that these are vegan uh and they are all natural flavors and colors nothing artificial here so uh they also claim to be artisan quality whatever that means anyways uh good quality stuff still pretty high from these uh it's been about three hours since i had my last one and still i am quite high so that is a pretty good endorsement right there and then anytime we have a product we like this much i'll take that camera person she's driving us all crazy go get just get out of our face just just just kid it's it's going to make it worse anytime we have a product we like this much i like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that's not weed related so i'm out here in the middle of nowhere in the middle of uh god's country and anytime i'm out in the desert i think you know area 51 ufos sci-fi and we've been doing board games recently so i'm going to give you one of my favorite board games of all time one very cosmic and theme and that's cosmic encounters plays like five six seven eight players uh it is too hard too difficult to explain right here but i can tell you it's going to be one of the best times if you have friends who are into board games if you've never heard of cosmic encounters and you have a group that is willing to um do something different give cosmic encounters a try don't even remember who designed it right now that's because of wanna gummies and these wanna i was gonna make another one a pun but i'm too high so just you know uh know that that is an endorsement and that's going to be endorsement as well for cosmic encounters on your local board game store or online in some way i guess we're still in the middle of a pandemic board games are a weird thing to endorse but um they're an optimistic one and i'm rambling thanks guys it's been a it's been a blast here i'm sorry about the dog i'm sorry about all the jesus stuff you know uh we're just uh we're out here on vacation having a good time here on weeds stay high stay healthy we'll see you soon", "v6fgHX6u6K4": "[Music] and the fruit loop one [Music] how does it taste so much better now like that butter just adds a whole new new layer what's up guys welcome back for those of you who are new to this channel my name is elena welcome and for those of you who are already subscribed welcome back um we're going to be doing a video on how to infuse cereal so we're going to be doing it with both tincture and with butter this will work on pretty much any type of cereal i'm going to be showing you guys or like demonstrating it on these three these are just these props um but yeah it'll work it'll work on all of them so let's start with the tincture um because that one is a little bit more simple so i just have a pan here with some parchment paper or wax paper parchment i guess and let's do some of the cinnamon toast crunch [Music] i'm just gonna do a little bit because i already have some of these made and it's not difficult to make more as i need it [Music] and then let's also use this one [Music] which we never had this in canada for the longest time it was only in the states and then we got here and i honestly wanted to try so bad i was so excited for it before it came to canada and when i tried it i'm just like it's not that exciting like [Music] the crunchies don't taste different like so the berries don't taste different than the cap'n crunch crunches dude you know what i mean like it just like tastes the same i really want to try the cotton candy one how is that one we definitely don't have that here i remember in the states you guys had cotton candy oreos back in 2015 because i was there and i bought some of them and they were like the best oreos i've ever had hopefully they'll come back one day okay so starting with the tincture we have our um captain crunch and our cinnamon toast crunch and this would all be easier being done in something like this because partly through this we're going to need to like turn it over and it helps having in here because you can kind of just like shake it and move it around um but the problem is that i personally only have this type of size of one and i want to keep them um like as spacious as possible so i can get um as much airflow so if you have a bigger one of these that would work well or if you're just doing a small batch okay so um so i already put some of my tincture in a little spray bottle i ordered these on amazon um i'll put a link for something similar but you can use this i'm just like one from the dollar store any type of spray bottle or even those little um like ones that are made for olive oil that kind of mist when you repetitively press them um i've used those as well but kind of like this better surprisingly um yeah so i just poured my tincture into a bottle now i'm gonna spray my cereal with my tincture and then see and this is where it's tricky because you have to flip it around and like you can do it one by one which is really easy for the cinnamon toast crunches especially because they're easy to just grab and turn around but that's a lot of work for doing like larger batches but yeah you could just like shake it flip it with a [Music] flippy a cookie a spatula and then i'm just going to turn these over like this [Music] okay so i think it's actually best to spray them close together so that nothing goes on the paper and it mostly goes on the cereal so then we'll now that we've turned them we're going to spray them some more and you can use as much or as little as you want i mean if you're going to add a lot a lot i would definitely um let them dry in between so we're gonna do that anyway so now that like we have them sprayed i'm gonna spread them out so they have good airflow and then we're going to let this dry um and the alcohol will dry pretty fast especially if you have um moving air wherever you are don't put in the fridge something you want to leave it's an open area so the alcohol can evaporate so then we're just going to leave this until they are pretty dry and then we can spray them some more so we can keep repeating this step until i mean you can repeat as much as you want um it's really that easy no need to put them in like the oven or anything like that so that's how you make them a tincture now we're gonna make them with some butter so we're gonna start by melting some butter i am going to be using a microwave you don't have to you can use a double boiler because every time i use a microwave in my videos i get a million people saying not to use a microwave and i just shouldn't use a microwave but i like using the microwave and i've still had good results like yeah maybe if i use the microwave and everything turns out really weak then maybe i wouldn't use it but then maybe i'm wrong maybe using the microwave um is making them weaker and maybe stronger if i didn't use it uh but i don't really see how the microwave would make a difference i don't see heating it up using the microwave versus anadele boiler would make a difference like i don't really i don't get it so somebody wants to explain to me in the comments and give me like actually the proper explanation and not just like this is what i heard and this is why but like i don't know i'm not flipped it i just like i'm lazy [Music] so i like the microwave but i'm open to listening it's just i need some more solid proof before i change my lazy ways you know okay so i'm just cutting up some um these are this is the butter that i have in um they're in half a cup blocks and i don't want too much right now so i'm just cutting um one of mine into like [Music] so i'm going to go and take this maybe i do want a little bit more let's see how much cereal we're going to do so i'm going to be doing this one oh wait no i'm doing this one i'm gonna be mixing it in here and let's start with let's give the cinnamon toast crunch last because i think the cinnamon um coating is gonna get into the butter and we'll transfer onto the other cereal so let's do fruit loops first the colors on these are not as nice to me i feel like it's probably because they're like colored with like natural colors now or something yeah no artificial flavors of colors does it like that mistakes i feel like canada is like more strict with their regular food regulations just like a lot of stuff tastes better in the states [Music] so let's do it cheerios and then we'll do this one next but i'm gonna i'm gonna go microwave this microwave i'll be right back i'm just gonna sneak back in here and add this other half because i feel like we're gonna need it and i like my stuffed buttery okay so i melted it for about i don't know 40 seconds there's still a couple little chunks i'm just waiting for them to melt with the remaining heat in the butter and so i have my um fruit loops [Music] i'm just gonna pour some of this over and i'm gonna take some of my butter and just drizzle it over not all of it you can always add more right and i'm going to put a lid on this and shake it up sounds a little broken but i don't think they are so we put a little bit in there and we shook it up and i feel like we can add a little bit more so let's just drizzle a little more in there [Music] and shake it up again [Music] oh yeah that looks perfect [Music] sorry i just had a little photo shoot here for the thumbnail um uh yeah so i shut up my butter and um [Music] and those are all shaken up and good and actually this the butter kind of hardens a bit probably because i have the air conditioner on so well i'll show you so i have this tyrex container and i had already treated the oven to about 220 degrees i've done this at 200 degrees i've done it at 250 um i kind of just the results are pretty similar either way so then i'm going to pour that into my baking dish and you can see that the butter kind of hardened in here i'll show you [Music] like that so i'm gonna actually put this whole thing in the microwave just to melt kind of that so that i don't have to like scrape and eat it with the spoon by myself after because i don't want to waste it so yeah i'll just melt that down a bit okay so i melted a little bit of butter and now we're gonna do cinnamon toast crunch which is my favorite actually it's not my favorite i love lots of cereals [Music] and then we're going to pour some butter over it yeah see i did make a little bit too much butter but not that much maybe i'll make some popcorn after and pour that on okay and then i'm just gonna um i don't know well let me zoom in okay so i have my uh slimming tools crunch and my butter oh i'm probably screaming into the camera right now um and i'm just gonna pour that over just a little bit to start with and we're gonna shake that oh my god that was so close to spilling that i can't believe i actually saved that okay see you do this in a plastic bag whatever okay uh [Music] i feel oh this one's gonna taste so good with the butter i can already imagine i'm gonna add a little bit more just a little bit i can you guys know like what am i trying to say like have you ever had that chex mix type thing that's made with um butter in the oven and then it just has that i can't even explain how delicious this is going to be this city into a french one it's like this is what it's about like buttered bread buttered cinnamon bread okay so that's how it looks the lighting is kind of weird uh maybe i'll zoom in when it's on the in the pan i'm just gonna put that in there don't worry it's just me eating this getting my little raccoon fingers all over everything now see what should we use this for cause this is like a mix of like cinnamon sugar and butter i feel like this probably tastes good by itself yes that tastes good by itself oh that is tasty it kind of tastes like frosting but anyways we have our butter coated cereal and it kind of has like a uh textures like i don't know how you explain that let's see uh like a butter texture essentially um so i preheat the oven to [Music] 220 degrees like i said and i'm going to put this in there and we're gonna let it cook for about 10-15 minutes so let's go bring that with us from the kitchen [Music] so i'll turn the lights on and what do we have 220 [Music] and we're gonna put this in i'm going to set a timer for about 10 minutes and we're going to come back and flip so it looks like these have dried a bit but not fully um if you're more patient you can just do this for the day and just come back to it every like hour or so and just spray and then um let it dry and then just do that every hour so you can really layer it up but for the purpose of this video i'm just gonna spray it again here and like i said before you can repeat this process as many times as you like i'm just this is gonna be the last time i'm doing it just because um for the video [Music] although like probably off camera i'll probably spray some more but it just depends on how strong you want to be and this isn't a perfect dosing um method like this isn't like some fancy like exact dosage and like it's not guaranteed the same results every time um but it's just a nice way to kind of just have the little snacks on hand so we're just gonna leave this out to dry we're gonna do that so we can get some better air on it and then that is pretty much good to go once it's fully um crunchy again [Music] okay so 10 minute timer went off and bear with me because i have uh i'm doing this one hand here so i'm just gonna pull this out looking good smells good oh very cinnamony um okay and i'm just gonna like if you just had one flavor in here you could uh how do i say this like [Music] flip it you know what i mean but because i have two i want to keep them separated and this would work better if you had it in a bigger dish so that the heat could get to the more evenly these look like halloween colors that's not what fruit loops used to look like like where's the red ones is it isn't it because red food coloring is supposed to be really bad or it comes from like cockroaches or something i don't know it's like why are you bothered by eating a cockroach when people eat like meat they're just like what's the difference so put that back in and let's do another 10 minutes [Music] and then we will come see actually let's do 15 minutes again like it doesn't really matter usually i put this in the oven between anywhere between like 20 and 45 minutes um and just flip it every like 10 or 15 or so um just just try different types and see how you like it it tastes maybe a little bit different if you cook it for you know half an hour instead of 45 minutes or 20 minutes instead of 45 but you could just take um some out at 20 minutes and then takes about a half an hour and kind of just taste each one and see how you like it the best and you can kind of figure out what your favorite way to do it is um from just one round essentially okay 15 minutes is up so it's been there for a total of 25 minutes oh my god that smells so good like i'm pretty sure it's just the cinnamon stuff it smells good but it literally smells like pie something like that i don't know it's really good oh sorry camera i put that can i put that there so yeah we're just mixing that up i think maybe like 10 or a minute should be good so just throw that back in [Music] and then 10 more minutes [Music] okay now our 15 minutes is over i'm going to turn off the oven and pull these out i think these are good to go let's just bring them over i am just going to lay them out on the parchment paper just to dry i mean i'm sure they could dry in the dish as well but i feel like they'll dry a little bit better here yeah so you kind of have them mixed together [Music] the rest of that here so we're just gonna leave these out to dry i'm just gonna separate the pieces that shouldn't be in the piles there kind of annoying um yeah see there they're not like they're not fully dry but they're just about dry it's all ready oh let's try the fruit [Music] lips sorry yeah so just leave that to dry and then i don't know i think it'll be good in like half an hour and then you can pack them all up once they're fully dry and they are ready to use whether you eat them by themselves or were you for milkover obviously i'm interested in eating them by themselves they're really good but thank you guys so much for watching i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did um i feel like i need to get a new ending because i feel like i say the exact same thing every time i hope you guys like this video and [Music] thank you guys so much for watching i hope you like this video please let me know if you did don't forget to give it a thumbs up leave a comment tell me what your favorite cereal is and subscribe thank you guys so much i hope you have a wonderful day see you guys next time i'm back because i forgot to taste the tincture ones i guess because they're not fully dry but or are they okay they're pretty much dry they can dry out for a little bit longer um honestly like not as good as the butter because well you can still taste the alcohol in a little bit like it mostly evaporates but you can still taste it a little bit and butter is there anything you can add butter to that doesn't taste good like obviously not dumplings like adding butter fruits actually you know why adding butter to fruit like in the oven is good it's like apple crisp you know but the better one's better and crunchier and buddier okay that's all it tastes kind of like reminds me of pie [Music] because the butter [Music] and the frugal ones how does it taste so much better now like that butter just adds a whole new [Music] layer", "3QMf4ZOpJKU": "my name is Willie Christie I'm a wellness consultant for the cannery west Henry West is a new dispensary in West Los Angeles today we're talking about edibles customers come in here with all sorts of different requests whether that be dietary requests or different methods of ingestion or uptake or effect whatever you're comfortable with chances are we've got it for our first edible I want to talk about gummies gummies are the most popular edible and we've got the kiva camino gummies today they're cannabis infused gummies but they also add terpenes which is unique that gives it more of a indica or sativa feel just really nice tasting Class E gummies these are wild berry it got a pineapple habanero flavor a blend I'm apricot and my personal favorite the sparkling pear Prosecco next we've got sublingual strips sublingual strips are a small tab that you put in your mouth and let dissolve on your tongue you may know cookies and brownies as your typical ingestion method but what's unique about these is that those other edibles take up to two hours to take effect whereas sublingual effects you can start feeling it in 15 to 40 minutes you don't run into that this isn't hitting it's been an hour and nothing's working I'm gonna slam some more and then two hours it all hits and you're done and finally we've got tea now cannabis and tea have been a match made in heaven since time immemorial I find that this slightly caffeinated green tea is a really nice chill but focused way of ingestion it's absorbed through the stomach so this is another faster method than digestion and what I find with tea is that as you sip it it comes on in sips as opposed to like a boom there are different types of tea this is a caffeinated green tea there's non-caffeinated herbal tea this has a little blend of CBD as well really nice for chilling out so those are some of my favorite edibles on the market right now feel free to come by the can we stop in and check them

syringe needle all you need to do is use your syringe needle to get some tincture and put it into each of your gushers now if you measure out your tincture in advance you can know approximately how much is in each so if you do a tablespoon of tincture you can divide it by however many gushers you end up filling and that's how you can figure out how many milligrams is in each gusher i have not

is summer k here on youtube it is summer cake fit if you follow me on instagram or twitter and summerkay if you follow me on pinterest um today i'm coming to talk to you guys about a new product that is pretty hot on the market by one of my favorite brands sports research and i'm going to get into the details of what it is but first if you guys are new to the channel make sure that you click the notification button and subscribe so that you don't miss a thing and then give this video a thumbs up if you like it so that youtube knows to suggest it to everybody else plus it's free it shows me that you guys are really supporting me um but i just wanted to talk to you guys about this product because if you found me from the goalie gummy um apple cider vinegar gummies then this is going to be something that you might want to listen to or if you've been following me you know that i use sports research products such as sweet sweat of course but i also use like their collagen peptides um their pre and post sweat that they just came out with then you might be interested in this too because this is something that is going to have to do with both so i'm going to go ahead and be honest with you guys i have been using this and i like this um better and i'm going to tell you why not saying that goalie gummy is not good because it is of course good i have a lot of testimonials from clients from people that i know that love it and it's various benefits that it's off that offers so i'm going to let you guys know why i'm going to be using this one instead and not just because it's by one of my favorite brands but there's some actual reasons why okay so make sure you listen up to this video once again don't forget to click the like button and don't forget to subscribe so that you don't miss a thing alright so this is the apple cider vinegar gummies by sports research so first of all i like the taste better than the goldie gummies but let me tell you why the goalie gummies has b12 in it it has pomegranate it has a beetroot powder it has a folic acid in it you know it has a superfood blend in it so it's going to taste a little bit different so i like that taste as well but this here is apple cider vinegar um and nothing else so the difference between this and the goalie gummy first thing off the bat is that this just has straight apple cider vinegar the goalie gummy has a super food blend in it which i love but the reason why i'm going to go with this one is because in my multivitamin i already take folic acid i take b12 and everything get all my minerals and everything and then i also take a b12 supplement separately um they both have the mother in there so that is one of the main things with both gummies the similarity is that they have the mother if you're taking a tablet or if you're taking an apple cider vinegar gummy and it doesn't have the mother in there then you are pretty much just wasting your time because that's the good stuff okay so both of them have the same amount of apple cider vinegar in there um so of course it's not as much as the liquid but it is a good alternative if you can't take the liquid i drink the liquid so i'm not too worried about that that's why i said that i might want to just do this one because i have everything that i get in my multivitamin but then i also take beetroot powder separately which i can do a video over that if you guys are interested in the benefits of what beetroot powder is because it is very good for cardiovascular it's good nitric oxide booster so it is something that y'all might want to be interested in but um that is the main reason on why i'm interested in doing this here um this is by the sports research brand so of course you can use my discount code fbs10 so that you save it check out if you are interested in trying it but just make sure that you look at it yourself if you don't want to just go by my video and see if it is something that you might want to give a try okay so um i forget how much the pricing is so i don't know the comparison on that but this here is the same thing you take two gummies to get the serving size this one has 20 calories it has four grams of carbs um three grams of it is sugar so you can check and see how that looks for the goalie gummy and then it just says to take two of them daily so since it is the same serving size as the goalie gummy go ahead and take however many you would take if you were taking the goalie gummy and if you haven't tried that yet then just go ahead and give this a try make sure you use my discount so that you can say but if you are still interested in taking the goalie gummy and you haven't started taking that yet i have a discount code for that as well and i'll put both of them in the description box so that you can check it out um if you have tried this already because some of you guys are ahead of the game you know sports research so you have already tried these apple cider vinegar gummies leave a comment let me know how you feel about it how you feel about the taste i like this taste better than the goalie gummy but like i said if you want the full benefit of the superfood blend that is in the goalie gummies then i would stick with that one if you already take that like myself already take a multivitamin of b12 separately and i have beet root powder i just happen to have beetroot powder um that i was already taking then you know you don't necessarily need all of those extras that are in the goalie gummy because it is in a small complex form and you can just take apple cider vinegar and then take everything else separately and get a fuller blend um so that one is completely up to you but mainly i just wanted to talk to you guys about this so you can see what is new on the market so that we can see um how we feel about the taste and everything and get feedback so that people that are coming to these videos um know what to expect because people are really looking at the goldie gummy video and i get a lot of people that say hey does anybody have feedback so i love that i can send them to the 30-day update and they can see the testimonials that you guys get and they know that hey the goalie gummy is legit so same thing with this if you guys want to go ahead and give this a try you know i love sports research i back up um what i talk about i'm going to be using this just like i use my sweet sweat and just like i use the pre-swiss so let me know leave it in the comments and don't forget to hit like don't forget to subscribe and turn the notifications on and i'm always at 1500 so i'm so excited for that thank you guys and also make sure that you check out the outfit that i have on because it is going to be launching soon it is from my line um i'm so excited this is actually one of the favorites the great set and the leopard set that i have is fan favorites everybody likes it i've already sold a couple of them so make sure if you guys check it out whenever it

legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

definitely check them out well until next time you guys don't usual stay fresh put one of them down why because i'm not dealing with you at target like this tastes good", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef

little bit go with the flow um i would probably my one big tip i would take these at night uh because they do kind of make me a little bit sleepy so i don't know how good they would be with like um you're at work or something like that but i mean it works for i mean it could be different for anybody but for me um like the 3g i can take and i still got energy and stuff but if i take it and i'm in the mood to sleep they help me sleep uh these do uh help me chill out at night and i think they're more suited for night but they say you could take them any time during the day uh 19 the taste is fantastic if you like the red ones i mean the red ones are good but these are just they taste like fruit snacks like i could eat all these and i don't know i'd be super chill then but uh yeah the taste is very very good so for nineteen dollars uh they do relax you uh is the upside they do make you kind of just chill yeah yeah it's the upside uh the downside for me is uh i got a little bit sleepy but it nothing big it wasn't like going to knock me out or anything i was just like uh kind of lethargic or maybe i'm just super chill and i'm not used to being super chill i'm a super uh you know wound up dude who knows uh who [ __ ] news anyways um is it worth it yes these are good gummies uh 19 dollars a little pricey i think especially for 60 gummies they want to take four days so that's 20 bucks about 40 bucks a month if you start these so that's your journey um anyways so is it worth it yes uh they're cool give them a try guys let me know what you think if you've had them anything like that um and subscribe", "Lx1es3XK7vk": "hey everybody gets me for girly here and we're back for the third day of the 20 days of 4/20 I'll get that right eventually today day number three I told you we're gonna do a trio of edibles so sure enough we're coming at you with some Dixie citrus blast gummies now I've had gummies from this company a couple times before I think the last time I had them they were like the sour ones so maybe more of that little citric acid type of like twang and your your gums you know but these are the citrus ones and they have one or two other flavors but not the sour this time over at relief and Burton but majors relief that is but you know I figured I loved all the citrus strains so I'll probably love this one too and sure enough well I'll give you a little spoiler this isn't my first Bagley's so I do sure love them and the one thing I don't like about all the froley proof packaging is that right there but you know it is what it is don't eat the silica package just you know fYI these come in at I think 20 milligrams for peace it's 200 milligrams per bag and they're pretty tasty tasty now these say it's made with high-quality sativa oil sativa indica distillate is that what we're talking about cuz you know it's hard to really make that claim when you don't have any terpenes left in it but they work and they work really well and I'll be honest I taste pretty darn good too so shout out to Dixie I think that's made by Joyce labs absolute southern here mmm now if you like that lemon the orange kind of that flavor gummies give these a try pretty tasty until next time guys good luck going grow big", "4PIqcs__TBA": "what does it ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it's your boy Goblin and today we are coming in with a hoot and a holler a true banger if you will today at work homing in with a story talking about the time that I ate 1600 milligrams of edible THC I hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you do and also I want to apologize for the inconsistent upload schedule the past a week or so I was actually up in a hotel in my old hometown linking up with some homies those guys tune into the streams probably got to see a few streams with the homies actually making some content with them and I also got a new car so if you guys want to see that a it's a post on Instagram baby link will be at the top of the description smack that follow button baby get me to 40k dude I might suck you a it would be nice dude I really want 40k thank you but without further ado we're back on the regular schedule here right so we can upload the day after tomorrow streaming every day baby you know what it is back on the grind hey let's dive right into it so those you guys who are my livestream viewers actually got a glimpse into this story because I did a livestream while I was high as [ __ ] on this [ __ ] I did a livestream like right when it hit me right I ate this [ __ ] and then I went live so we'll get to that part in a little bit but let's backtrack a little bit from that so I don't remember exactly how long it ago it was I feel like it was like a month ago actually damn time spent flying on quarantine dude I don't even remember dates cuz every day is the [ __ ] same it's like Groundhog Day to you this [ __ ] sucks but either way so I wake up one day and I faithfully check my dispensaries menu every day right because a the selection is kind of limited because I'm in Illinois right so wreck just got legalized here and everyone is buying weed because everybody's home so like it's it's been kind of a shortage do you like the menus are much more limited that they were even two months ago you know but I wake up one morning and I check my local dispensaries menu and they've got some RSO on the menu now for those guys who don't know what RSO is it stands for Rick Simpson oil and it is basically an edible concentrate it is I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who like isn't a very experienced smoker because it is just the worst tasting [ __ ] ever like you have to actually just love how weed to put up with this if you were if you're one of those people who like oh I get the artificial carts cuz I don't like the taste or like you know like you only eat edibles and like you know you hate the taste of weed RSO is your worst enemy right but if you're a guy who just likes to get stoned you like your [ __ ] all-natural RSO is the way to [ __ ] go when it comes to edibles right so typically Illinois has a not typically just the rule in Illinois it's a really stupid one it's recreationally the edibles are only allowed to be sold and up to a hundred milligrams of THC per container which at least for me I'm a bigger guy and I smoke a lot that dose is nothing like I might get buzzed if I slam the container but that's [ __ ] alright however RSO is a loophole to that because it is it is edible right like it hits you the same way as an edible your body processes it just like an edible but it is technically a concentrate so dispensaries sell RSO in like proper dosages like each syringe right one gram of RSO had about 800 milligrams of THC in it right which it was a very clear like no-brainer if you're going edibles in the state of Illinois from a dispensary RSO is the way to [ __ ] go right a hundred percent but also a a little a little bit of info for all you young uns out there maybe you haven't gone to the dispensary yet listen if you have a good Street weed plug [ __ ] the dispo weed right right now in the state of Illinois it's taxed I'm not saying this this applies across the country just in Illinois the weed here is tax the wax is really good but only if you get it from a company called revolution right here's my dispo tips for all young and out there right the edibles in my opinion are the only thing that I fully advocate for from dispos even with the hundred milligram dosage cap I still advocate for dispensary edibles over street edibles all day simply because the dispo edibles are made by [ __ ] nerds right like these are these are dorks with a crazy expensive kitchen equipment who are like passionate about getting fire [ __ ] edibles right so they're not like cooking in mom's kitchen with the windows open in the ceiling fan on making some like really low quality oil to make their [ __ ] brownies with right this shit's the real deal so that's just a little tidbit of info from you guys right the edibles only thing really worth getting including especially the RSO so me seeing that they've got these gram syringes of RSO on the menu I booked my appointment immediately right I booked my [ __ ] right there set my time slot you know because all the dispensaries are making you like schedule an appointment to come pick up now and I get over there for my time right I line up at the disco and listen I paid the tax alright a lot of you guys out there are probably gonna cringe when I say this price I paid over a hundred cent like oh it was like over like a hundred and thirty or forty dollars after tax I think was almost 150 actually after tax which for Illinois for two grams of RSO that is like for Illinois disparate prices that is a good deal for any other legal state that is horrible right Illinois prices are so jacked right now it's insane and they're they're like not getting better whatsoever but either way so I'm at the disco you know I go through the line I pick my [ __ ] up and I I go in pretty much every day not every day but like I'd say like at least four days a week I'm at the dispensary right because I like trying all the different stuff they have for streams and stuff right so they know my name you know I go through they call my name up and I'm talking to the cashier guy about the RS so he's like oh dude we finally got this [ __ ] in dude he's like I put some on my cereal this morning I'm like I'm thinking about it I'm like dude that sounds [ __ ] awful like RS oh and your cereal that sounds rancid right but I didn't care right and I was also really excited about this because this was a restock of the RSO they had some a couple weeks prior but they were only selling half gram syringes this was a restock and of the full gram ones and the half gram ones sold like like they were sold out same day they were gone fast as [ __ ] right so I was hyped to get these right I'm talking the guy I'm like oh yeah man I just put it on [ __ ] bread last time and smack that share a little bit of ham you know and what we're kind of talking about our methods I you know say goodbye to the guy leave the dispo right very friendly face is there hop back in my car go back home and I only got to figure out how to consume the [ __ ] because you can technically just like drop it on your tongue but it's very unpleasant it coats your entire mouth it's just this thick layer that you can't get rid of no matter how much water you swish around and that tastes just lingers so for me RS I was kind of like shrooms you need something to put it on to get it down the hatch quickly right you don't want to be chewing on it too much you know so I'm thinking to myself and I go over to the grocery store right and I'm looking around and I'm at [ __ ] Walmart they don't know how stoned I was to think this was a good idea but I got the like Walmart Walmart has like big make this like sushi it's like this really cheap fake sushi but when you're stoned it's actually like it's like one of my like little like I tell nobody about it guilty pleasure snacks the Walmart fake sushi low-key when you're [ __ ] up it's okay it's like five bucks dude they're fake California rolls up I know everything in there's not real I don't care dude I'm [ __ ] up and it was $5 I'm in right so I grab one of those you know and I go check out you know and I'm thinking to myself I'm like okay this could work if I just put the RSO in each of the pieces of sushi and then I just slam it down it would be easy I don't have to take maybe one bite of the sushi if even you know like there's some some smaller pieces in there I can maybe just down the hatch straight up you know but maybe we'll see how it goes right so I get home you know I sit down at my desk I bust out these syringes I open up this thing a sushi and I I don't know what it was but I just didn't really like process how this was gonna taste like there was not one point in my mind where I was like oh dude putting putting wax on top of fish probably is not gonna taste good I was just like bet man let's [ __ ] go so I'm taking my syringes and I'm a Kimbo with him I've got one in each hand I'm just loading up these [ __ ] pieces of sushi with it dude and it's looking like a monstrosity it's literally looking like somebody shat on my sushi bro like RSO is not like clear it is very dark right it's very dark and almost like if you were to see RSO and not know what it was you look at it be like damn that's the worst wax ever bro you paid tena gram for that like but once you know what it is you understand right so either way I put it all in the sushi and I'm like okay bad we're looking good right I take this first piece of sushi I bowed I boot up a YouTube video to watch down the hatch first ones fine the second one I take a bite of it so it was a bigger piece and everything fell apart now listen with the sandwich it was a lot easier because the sandwich I put the RSO on right and I took a bite and rs I was trapped between pieces of bread so like it was much easier to get down and it helped to reduce the amount that got stuck in my mouth and my teeth with the sushi my teeth just came into direct contact with the RSO and as soon as that happened it just coated my whole mouth bro it like for those you guys out there of eating RSO did you guys all understand like listen there is nobody here who's gonna be like oh yeah I I enjoy the taste a hundred percent some people like it more than others but it's not something you would eat if there was no weed in it right like it's not something you just pop on your tongue as a [ __ ] snack right we're all just there to get high and we suck it up for the taste right so I think this bite the [ __ ] coats my mouth and I'm like oh my [ __ ] god dude this is horrible but by that point it's already like two tasted cut in her mouth so I'm like dude I just got it slam through the rest of them so I'm putting these like god awful tasting pieces of sushi in my mouth and it's so rancid like the fake fish combined with the RSL I'm gagging but I'm chucking water to force down my gags like I'm like bro this is awful I'm torturing myself I better get stupid [ __ ] high for this right so I down all my sushi and then I just wait right I hop on my runescape I game a little bit and I scheduled my livestream so my livestream would take place about two hours after I ate the sushi right and edibles take a very long time to hit me a very long time so that two hours went by and I go live and I'm like not really feeling it right like I'm like getting there I'm like like I felt different but I wasn't stoned and I'm starting to get a little worried you know even though I know that I take like three hours to feel edibles at least like two and a half I still tweak whenever it hits the two-hour mark like I'm selling all I got scammed you know so I'm sit there on stream and I'm just chatting and all the sudden I just like I I I don't remember doing this at the time but I actually went back and re-watch the vaad like the day after bro oh my [ __ ] god now listen I said some irresponsible [ __ ] this stream so I had to I had to delete the [ __ ] [ __ ] I so stone I was saying political [ __ ] listen I was saying things that should never be said but either way so I'm on the stream and the [ __ ] just smacks me right and I remember I like I'm sitting in my chair and I start almost getting like nauseous from how like body high I'm getting I like I felt like I was actually like g-force was applying to me and I was being like pain like I felt like I was almost stuck to my chair but being thrown through the air at the same time you know like I felt like someone strapped me in and sent me flying through a catapult bro right I'm trying so hard to talk to chat but it gets to the point where I can't even comprehend what these [ __ ] are saying like I'm barely functioning my eyes are so low and then it really happens for me when I smoke like when I smoke it even when I dab right I don't really get red eyes but this [ __ ] it looked like I just went to young thug's funeral I was sobbing dude I was absolutely teary-eyed out of my mind right it was horrible dude you know what I'm saying like no not horrible it was it was [ __ ] lit but I wise dude holy [ __ ] but I'm sitting there the only thing I could think is like dude holy [ __ ] and I remember like telling chat over and over I was like guys I'm so [ __ ] ripped right now any of you guys were here for this stream if there's anything I left out cuz the details you know i stream everyday dude so I'm not gonna remember every detail of every stream if there's any like funny moments for that stream I left out dude comment about it bro comment about the [ __ ] but either way I'm [ __ ] up dude so I going through this live stream right I'm chilling I go onto his live stream and and finally I end the live stream but the nights just getting started like I only stream for like an hour hour and a half then I get off and realize like oh yeah I'm high as [ __ ] so I stand up for the first time since the [ __ ] hit me after finishing my stream and it's just like I just jumped into a [ __ ] pool bro like I stand up and I just I just get hit with this full body like oh you know like this holy [ __ ] dude and I'm sitting there and I'm like just my whole body feels like it's just pulsing dude I'm so stoned I'm out of my [ __ ] mind bro I like I don't think I've ever been and this high quite honestly this might be the highest I've ever been dude looking back on it like oh my [ __ ] god right so I go downstairs and I pop open my freezer right and I have the great value hot pockets in there now listen controversial take great value hot pockets better than name-brand and they're way cheaper they're like half the price they're literally like a buck sixty for a box of two of them dude cannot go wrong I slapped both of them hoes in the microwave dude I start chugging waters like a [ __ ] animal dude I start chugging waters like Bear Grylls fresh out of the [ __ ] Sahara dude I'm slamming these shits like an absolute dehydrated madman in my kitchen dude there's water running down my chin my eyes are red they look like I'm crying the microwaves [ __ ] going if anyone walked in on this they would think damn this is the worst like midlife crisis I've ever seen dudes microwaving great value hot pockets his eyes were watering any slammin waters and he's in his underwear like damn this guy's [ __ ] right oh yeah I did I didn't add that part but as soon as I got off stream I just ripped my clothes off bro I don't know why I just want to become fear so I was like yeah bro well cruise around the boxes for the day you know I'm saying so my hot pocket and I go back upstairs I lay in my [ __ ] bed I'm sitting on my bed I remember I'm so high that one of the things I'm watching right is I'm walking I actually went an impulse bought the game after this but I'm watching Cabela's gameplay like the hunting game because I had some like nostalgia trip cuz back when I was a little kid I used to go to my neighbor's house and play that this Cabela's hunting game on like ps2 and it was a blast and for some reason when I was this high I was having that nostalgia trip so I'm sitting there watching like no commentary gameplay footage of dude shootin [ __ ] liens on like a 15 year old game just having the time of my [ __ ] life but like honestly if you guys go through like Cabela's ps2 youtube videos you might even find me getting lit in the comments from like a couple months back but like Jesus [ __ ] dude so I sit there watching Cabela's videos right and then I do something that I haven't done since the xanax cereal video for those guys who remember that video the xanax and raisin bran crunch video I have this thing where like sometimes when I get really sent I want to play The Sims Sims is a game that I only play when I'm my [ __ ] rocker dude like I have to be stupid [ __ ] up it's a game that I only play when I'm that sent because I can't comprehend any other games but Sims I understand because it's just people being people you know so even though I'm wasted I still know how people are you know but like everything else I can't comprehend so I immediately I get on my PC right and I forget then on this computer I have a nice little pirated copy of The Sims 4 so I pop open my origin and I try to launch the sims 4 and they're like oh yeah you have to you have to [ __ ] purchase it because it shows up in my library because it's pirated right and I'm tweaking out I'm like oh my [ __ ] god dude I do where's my sims dude so I buy the sims 4 immediately broke by the [ __ ] out of it I'm pretty sure I bought a bunch of different DLCs to just some ridiculous [ __ ] make a character play the [ __ ] for like maybe an hour got off late in bed my intent was to continue watching Cabella videos but that didn't happen I crashed I was out but the craziest part about it is that after I crashed right after my my very stoned hot pocket Cabela's YouTube and Sims for purchasing session I then proceeded to go to bed wake up the next day and I was still left over hi dude not like as intensely but I definitely did not wake up sober like I woke up feeling like I was a little bit stoned still you know which Loki was [ __ ] sick I was very happy about it I hope you guys enjoyed this video let me know in the comment section below what is the highest dosage edible you've ever taken a this was my highest dose I've ever done hope you guys enjoyed a look at that 2000 milligram going soon dude I had a lot of fun off this 1,600 now honestly the highest I've been in recent memory and possibly the highest I've ever been if I really sat down and thought about it but hey hope you guys enjoyed this video drop like if you did it thank y'all for watching I will see you guys next time peace", "BIJp94p_3kc": "[Music] Hey ladies thanks for watching and welcome back to our channel today's video I'm gonna be doing a little bit of a review for precede for those of you who don't already know precede is a conception friendly lubricant so a lot of lubricants actually are detrimental to your ttc process because they have spermicides in them which obviously killed the sperm you don't want that a lot of them are also way too thick the consistency of them creates an environment where it's much much harder for this firm to actually swim or to get anywhere and while some women might want this quality and a lubricant most of us who are trying to conceive do not want that so I figured I would give Christine a try I am NOT putting a lot of stock in thinking that this is just gonna be the one thing that just like that gets me pregnant no I don't think that but I do think products like this can potentially a you know almost act as like an escalator of sorts for the sperm to the uterus so proceed is supposed to mimic your own cervical mucus not everyone gets that ideal conception cervical mucus some people are a little bit more on the thick side some people are a little bit more on the creamy side and some women just never see egg white cervical mucus so I do think that this is very beneficial in the sense that if a woman is not normally producing egg whites cervical mucus this can definitely be a good substitute for that enough information let's just jump right into the review because I'm sure that's what you are all here for so because pre-seed is a fertility Flint because pre-seed is fertility friendly it is a little bit more on the expensive side it is $20 for a 1.4 ounce tube of the actual product and the Box also comes with if you get it in this combo pack the Box also comes with nine applicators now I don't think that for what you're paying there are enough applicators and the reason why is because you can use an applicator one time an applicator is meant for single use only so here's one of the applicators and still in the pack because I don't want to contaminate it I really don't want to be taking it out and handling something that is going to eventually be in my hoo-ha I just yeah that's staying in the pack so when you get an applicator it's very small it's not uncomfortable at all it is made out of plastic but you only get nine and I feel like because they are for single use only you may need more than nine when it comes to depending on how much you're gonna maybe dance you throughout your fertile window you may need more than nine applicators especially if you do it more than once a day what I found is that but proceed a little bit goes a very very very long way the box or the instructions tell you that you can draw up to the three grand mark I would give you guys a warning to not do that if you're starting off and just using pre seat for the very first time do about a two max the reason I'm saying that is it is a very slippery product I actually learned that I only need either one to one and a half grams in this tube to be effective I did notice that if I use too much I lose sensation when let's just be real when you're having sex you do want to have certain sensations and I feel like if you use too much product you'll definitely know because you will lose a sort of sensitivity it's not uncomfortable but it almost has won't say a numbing kind of quality to it but you'll just lose some sensation so definitely less is more when I use less that was no longer a problem it's almost like you are just producing more of your own fluids it doesn't feel very foreign even though it's wet it doesn't feel so like a foreign consistency or a foreign substance I know some women said their husbands did not like it and did not appreciate it and it made their counterparts feel very weird personally didn't have that problem my husband didn't have a problem with it at all I don't even think he could tell half the time when I did use it or didn't use it so no problems whatsoever there the one thing that I do have a complaint about has nothing to do with the actual move itself the problem I actually have is that there's not enough applicators so the applicators are for single use only so you're all supposed to use them one time and also not only that but they have the stipulation if you take some of the proceed out and it's into the tube it can only sit in a tube for 30 minutes before you are supposed to toss it it's considered no longer viable to then go ahead and insert it if it's after that 30 minute mark so let's say you made a plan of baby dance and you had the loop all ready to go and had it drawn and for whatever reason something came up or something didn't work out well not only now have you wasted product but now you've wasted an applicator that you're supposed to just toss but that being said that would be pretty much my only complaint thus far like I said I haven't had any problems with anything else down there I had it hasn't caused me anything like a UTI or a yeast infection or anything like that so I think it's definitely compositionally I think it's a solid product that is made for the female anatomy and specifically not to further upset the pH balance so I think that's a good thing but like I said the only thing that I would change if I could would be for them to put more applicators in each box you're spending a good portion of money and you're going to run out of applicators long before you actually run out of the lubricant itself a lot of you may be wondering if you haven't been following our journey well did pre-seed work for you I don't know yet I don't think there's ever gonna be that one specific thing that works for someone and that's the only way it can possibly happen you only have a very I want say a very small chance but you only have about a 20% chance each month of getting pregnant in any way and that is affected by so many different back I don't think anyone can say oh yeah because I didn't use that proceeded that's that's right there why I didn't get pregnant somewhat I may believe that if you do that's perfectly fine if that is your belief and that's your feeling the do what your intuition tells you to do I personally don't think I can rate the quality of this product based upon just if I got pregnant this month or the following month I think for all intensive purposes it doesn't irritate me it feels good to use and it feels natural to use and I have peace of mind because I also know that I am not killing my husband's sperm instead I'm actually aiming them if at all possible so even if it didn't give them a big boost or aid them very much and making their way to my egg at least I know that I am NOT slowing them down or holding them back so I would say for me personally that's a plus I know a lot of people are like well if it didn't is that's not the thing that's gonna get me pregnant then why bother using it and I can understand that but I think I will continue to use it I still have plenty left so I'm definitely gonna continue to use it mostly within my fertile window but I might even use it sometimes when I'm outside of my for a window just because I do like the consistency of it so I hope that was informative for you and that is all I have for you today if you enjoyed this video go ahead and give it a thumbs up and if you are already not go ahead and subscribe to continue following our journey to conceive baby number one I hope you enjoy the rest of your week and hope you have a happy holidays bye", "UfXchhtG5NY": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you decide what products are worth your hard-earned dollars at your dispensary and which ones are utter junk and today we are talking about one of my favorite companies when we haven't had a chance to review a product from in a while because they haven't had anything new coming out but now thanks to the new regulations here in California that make edibles be a hundred milligrams max and ten milligrams per serving Korova one of my all-time favorites has come out with a brand new line here they have the Korova Saturday morning mini cookies ten milligrams per cookie at it for a hundred milligrams total so ten cookies in here at ten milligrams each it's a huge package it's so much bigger than their normal packaging which is crazy its its massive and it was only ten bucks but then again that's a bit that's more expensive than their one hundred and fifty milligrams cookies that they used to have that were just single cookies but it's big packaging because it is holding ten little mini cookies in here I really like the packaging it's very handsome I really quite like it a lot it's got the new props on there keep refrigerated bla bla bla bla bla but shows you know it's compliant with them new regulations and then here on the back it's got it finally has nutrition information corroded before I don't believe actually had nutrition information on their packaging but they do now and it's got like the ingredients and all that fun stuff on there and now they have this child resistant packaging that is very tough to open because I've tried opening one of these before and they're quite difficult to open especially if you've not encountered it before I'm super excited to try these it actually I've been wanting to review them for a while they've taken me some time to find they're not in available and a lot of dispensaries yet which is odd because you know supposedly next month is when these regulations take effect although I believe you have until July to like get rid of your old stock of stuff but yeah I assume you'll start seeing these everywhere soon but I've been wanting to review these for some time because I assume they'll be as ubiquitous as kirova in no time so here's that obnoxious child-resistant packaging you have to place one thumb in the middle of the zipper and place one thumb into the back panel zipper and pull gently apart it's easier said than done you know what I'm just gonna cut into it because I hate it I hate the child-resistant label packaging I'm a child I'm too down for it dumb child here we go here are the mini cookies ooh they're handsome quite like them aesthetically they look a lot like the full-size versions don't have very much of a weeds odor chewy and kind of crunchy but good nice pretty good very little canvas ace if any at all I'd like it just as much maybe even a little bit more than their 150 milligrams Saturday morning cookie it's great it's got the rice krispies in there good cookie good cookie taste it's a little bit chewier and crunch here than I was expecting it to be but it's not bad it's not bad not a bad combination at all i I'm not dreading having to eat nine more of these so guys I'm going to finish the rest of this bag off I've got a lot more to get through and then I will be sure to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process I'm probably about two and a half three hours or something on my way to go see a movie and as soon as I get out of there I will let you know how I'm feeling thanks so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours since I had the kirova mini cookies medical cannabis Saturday morning cookies 100 milligrams THC 10 cookies and I am more than pleased to report that kauravas unrivaled potency is in still intact this is a strong hundred milligrams in these 10 cookies here in fact my only complaint about it is and it is a complaint well I guess my two complaints there the packaging sucks I don't like this child restraint and packaging because I'm I'm stupid I'll fully grot to that and you know I'm not I'm an intelligent person but it's annoying it's hard to open even trying to follow the directions it's not like the childproof pill bottles that are very easy to take off that's a minor complaint the big complaint is it's a lot to consume for one person I know these are designed for 10 servings and they really are because it's a lot to consume it's I mean you can see how big this packages and it's packed to the brim with those cookies it's for our calories of cookies which isn't a whole lot but at the same time ten of those little mini cookies it's not a insignificant amount it certainly feels like more than one of the normal size but still I'm gonna recommend it especially for this new wave of products that are coming in that are going to be these ten milligrams servings of ten servings each this is probably going to be really great III heartily recommend it if you cannot find if the any of the other Korova still lying around if your dispensary is only prop to 1/5 compliant grab these you'll be happy you did if not go ahead and stick with the original batch because that's gonna do you better but but these are a fine replacement it's not the end of the world for edibles but you know it's not it's not going to be the same same world we remember anyways guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching thank you so much and we will check you out on a later review peace that's okay", "vbOrbgFYOsQ": "and now for the last step of my morning routine a shot of apple cider vinegar new from nutri cost apple cider vinegar gummies

when you hearing [ __ ] in your ear don't ever underestimate don't ever ask me edible", "NM60zEAYLFo": "hello friends welcome elites the marijuana review ship formerly the marijuana edible review show now we're covering everything we're everywhere we're doing at all welcome to weeds guys we are here to help you make sense of your dispensary we are here to help you understand what products to spend your hard-earned money on mostly edibles but we do a little bit of everything and today we are proving that because we are doing our third cartridge review third yeah one two three third cartridge review here on wheats we have reviewed rove and we have reviewed crafted and now today we are going to be reviewing the cartridges from the fine may be fine folks i'm not sure if they're fine folks or not we'll find out i know that i did not enjoy their edible candy so far but without too much more preamble we're talking flavor x today flavor x blueberry cush indica 500 milligram cartridge i picked this up for my dispensary here in a Long Beach for a $35 so not super cheap but not crazy expensive either sort of a little bit higher than average for the cost of a cartridge so in the back we see the ingredients are ultrafine cannabis oil and terpenes and that is it but I don't see any other necessary lab results I see what's distributed by and in compliance with but I don't see their lab results they said they're voted best tasting and highest potency but they don't tell us who gave them the honor of being the best-tasting and most potent cartridge which is always to me a sign of trouble when somebody says we're award-winning but we're not gonna tell you what award we won okay enough of that let's not prejudge here let's let's judge on the merits and not by past experience or by crazy packaging so let's talk about the packaging first and foremost this is without a doubt the cheapest packaging I have seen for a cartridge I mean it's just designed to sit on a shelf it's not fancy at all let's compare it to a rogue box which I have right next to me here I mean look at the packaging for this road cartridge in comparison it's it's amazing it's so fancy it's so nice so incredible this is pretty bare-bones stuff but it's not so much about the packaging it's really about what's inside that packaging that counts so let's see what's going on here this again is blueberry cush not flavored in any other way all terpenes so it's all natural or so they say in terms of flavor so here we go we've got it inside here pretty standard issue cartridge looking let's open her up it tasted terrible okay so here's the cartridge they say this is a half gram of oil in there it doesn't really look like a half gram of oil to be honest but otherwise a pretty bare-bones cartridge looks about the same as any other cartridge except there's is that plastic or glass I think it's plastic there instead of glass which is a cheaper material does not look as fancy as some of the other cartridges certainly not as classy as say the crafted cartridge but let's open it up and who cares if it looks doesn't look fancy as long as it tastes and hits great so this is just your standard 510 battery thread got it plugged into my fancy vape pen here let's give it a hit so first things first not the easiest draw in the world you have to really pull out that drop to get it to come out but once you get to come out it's nice and clean the taste the taste isn't doing much for me to be honest it's not terrible but I have certainly had better tasting cartridges it's not gonna make you gag or anything it's just a very neutral very very cannabis e tasting one it definitely don't taste the blueberry cush it just tastes like your standard-issue babe cartridge certainly nothing I would vote best tasting it's also a little hot it's a little hotter than some of the others I'm going to turn down my voltage on my vape pen mine as an adjustable voltage here I've got it about a third of the way up so I don't think it would be that coming out that hot but it does come out a little bit warmer than some of the others and with taste again is okay well and after a good solid five puffs there I'm feeling pretty high I'm probably at a 3-4 somewhere in there so not an outrageous bout in line with other cartridges this one is an indica and right now I guess I'm not excuse me I'm not feeling particularly in the couch at this moment it's not hitting me as hard as I would like to be to be entirely honest it's not hitting me as hard as I would have hoped and it's certainly not hitting me like indica normally does it's not making me sleepy it's not making me tired it's just there's a sort of vague head hi there on initial inspection um in terms of taste and postin see this is this is not in the running for the best of the best I don't believe I am would not I would not discount it just yet I want to count it out but for the price the taste in the the potency this is not among the best I've ever had if I'm being entirely honest but but we will get the complete review I am going to finish this cartridge off and I will come back to you once it's over with to give you my wrap-up thoughts because you can't really tell after just five hits if this is going to be worth it so guys I'm going to a puff on this for the next couple of days let you know how long it took me to get through with how much usage and if my thoughts have evolved or changed over the next couple of days but right now I would tell you probably stick with so far I would say Rove is the best cartridge I have tried and it is also the cheapest and the best tasting so I would stick with Rove if you see it but I will let you know if my thoughts change so guys through the magic of editing I will see you in just a couple of seconds but for me it'll be a couple of days thanks for watching see in just a bit peace [Music] hi guys welcome back to wheats this is our follow-up for the flavor ex blueberry cush in the cartridge here and my thoughts have really not evolved a whole lot since my initial impressions this is not my favorite cartridge this is not the best cartridge I've ever had not by a long shot it's not a complete disaster but man I I think there are quite a few ones that I would suggest over flavor X I'm trying to get the camera to focus in there so you can see here all done all done for both so in every kind of metric it was just kind of middling to me and that's you know it wasn't that great in terms of taste it wasn't that great in terms of potency it lasted about two days of pretty heavy usage so it wasn't too disappointed in terms of capacity but the cartridge design was not that great the packaging was pretty bland all in all I gotta say flavor X is not what I would be reaching for and the my first choice for cartridges in the future and I'm trying to remember how much it costs I believe it was $35 and I think I might have said that in the first half of the video as well so it's you know it's it's a little bit on the expensive two side to for a half gram cartridge especially now that they charge taxes and things here in California so I'm gonna go with a pass on the flavor X cartridge you know if that's all they have at your dispensary I don't think you're gonna you know be out too much if you pick it up but but I think there are better choices for your money still so far from me I would go with Rove as my as my choice du jour of things that we have reviewed so far I think I might try to give another flavor X maybe one of their sativas a review in the future to see if it changes my mind at all but right now it's just not my favorite cartridge if I had to score between 1 to 10 which I've never done before I'd put it firmly at the well you know it's I don't like scoring things out of 10 especially something as subjective as a as a weed cartridge so scratch that sorry for even bringing that up but just on the whole just to reiterate one more time I've had better tasting cartridges I've had more potent cartridges I've had cartridges with fancier packaging not that's a big issue so it's it's gonna be a pass for me flavor X and especially this blueberry cush cartridge here I think you can do better for your money out there guys and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you guys watching as always thank you so much guys out there and we will see you on our next review peace", "qfdpEsrfu84": "[Music] give me a w w give me an e e give me an e e give me an A hey give me a t t give me an S s what does that spell wait sweet sweets hello everyone welcome to we it's the marijuana review show or we hope you guys make sense of your in dispensary classic classic review today we are taking a look at an edible and a brand I already know that I love quite a bit that is we are taking a look at our freshly legal review of Kiva Kiva their new 100 milligram a THC ginger dark chocolate bar with a hundred milligrams of CBD as well as you guys probably know if you tuned in often I'm not much of a CBD guy um but I am a THC guy so this one's a little bit more expensive than the standard Kiva because of the addition of the THC everything that cost me 25 bucks at night dispensary in Long Beach plus taxes so it's quite expensive but I hope it's going to taste as good as all other Eva products are and even most importantly I hope it's going to be as potent as Kiva has been now you can see the crazy packaging and has to go through this Kim in a sealed bag with a childproof seal and then this itself is in a childproof bag sealed and you always have to figure out how to open these and I can never figure out how to open them because I am NOT a smart person it's some point so we're gonna try to figure this out together you do this and that and then you pull away and then you say [ __ ] it and you get scissors that's how that's actually how it works you try what it says on the back and then used to get scissors and then surprise surprise on the inside is the exact same thing with all the pertinent information on it as well it's got lab tested results nutrition information all the good good stuff you want to see on it and that great Kiva minimalist card word packaging I really like their packaging design I'm outside of this unnecessary bag it's minimalist its well-designed and it does the job so I'm excited about this I like ginger like chocolate I'd loved every kiba flavor I've ever had and they've all got me a very very high so let's see if the tradition continues and here we go can't really smell anything just yet each piece contains five milligrams of THC so I guess this is gonna be twenty little squares or rectangles in there and there we are there are our 20 rectangles with some little design on it and oh it smells a lot like ginger that is a heavy ginger scent let's give it a taste it's like a symphony in my mouth and the conductor is weed it's good guys don't know matter that's what much else to tell you um except if you don't like ginger you are not gonna like this because this is heavy on the ginger flavor I happen to be pretty a fan ginger so I enjoyed this the chocolate itself is great quality there is a slight cannabis taste to it nothing overpowering nothing that's gonna make you throw up but if you hate the taste of cannabis maybe avoid but for me please punch mmm okay well I've been in there sixteen rectangles to get through but don't worry I'll finish off all of these and then once I finish off the last one I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling okay it'll probably be closer to three because I'm on my way to go see bad times at the El Royale is that the name the new Drew Goddard movie the guy did cabin in the woods excited about that so I'll cut you guys after the movie and I'll let you know how this kiba there are a lot of pieces of packaging here key the ginger dark chocolate bar is hitting thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you in just a bit and welcome back to weeds it has been about two hours 45 minutes and change since I last seen you guys and I come back to you surprisingly conflicted about the kiva ginger dark chocolate bar if you will look at my eyes they will tell you I am quite high and I do feel very relaxed very at ease very peaceful however I don't want to say I feel high per se I feel just sort of more easygoing and more relaxed and I might be confusing this I might this might just be a total placebo a factor I've sort of gotten into my own head and the confirmation bias type thing um I have heard however that's for some people CBD counter affects the psychoactive properties of THC and this can make you feel the CBD sort of effects and you know the more relaxing effects of THC as well but not this sort of more whoa man kind of high aspects and I think that might be what happened to me here ah for some people that's gonna be great that is going to be a jackpot that's gonna be exactly what they want for me it's not what I was looking for I was really hoping for more of a the classic head-high experience especially seeing the movie I just got out of Drew Goddard bad times at Hotel at the El Royale something like that I can't remember all those nouns so I was hoping to be really high for that movie because Drew Goddard likes to spend some crazy yarns and said I was just really chilled out and and you know I was a little disappointed unfortunately this is not gonna be the Kiva for me however I am NOT gonna give it a disapproval or I'm not gonna give it the thumbs down because I think for this a certain customer one who perforce prefers the more gist chilled out relaxed style of weed might really love this for me however it's just not exactly what I was looking for not what I was hoping for but that is not Kiva's fault I I knew that that was a possibility going in so just wanted to give you guys that heads-up that the CBD seems to be pretty effective in here so if you love CBD and THC maybe give this one a shot if you are like me and like the sort of Moorhead high this sort of more psychedelic sort of side of I wanna you'll want to stick with the traditional Kiva's which I have no problem recommending wholeheartedly so this one is a little bit mixed for me unfortunately but again that is not not an endorsement or not telling you to avoid it so I'm going to before I bounce here though guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something that I do not have mixed feelings over and that is another Drew Goddard movie because I did have some similarly mixed feelings to this key lebar about bad times at hotel Royale something elroy out whatever the name of the movie is but his second movie I think cabin in the woods from 2012 is a fantastic movie I'm sure you've probably seen it and I'm sure somebody if you haven't has spoiled it for you but if not check it out it is an utter utter riot one of the most inventive movies and years just an absolute blast love that movie two thumbs up for Drew Goddard cabin in the woods one thumb up one kind of half cocked for the hotel Royale and about the sort of same for that keepa bar I think that sort of sums it all up I'm still pretty high just not the same high I wanted to be and that's gonna do it for real this time thank you so much for watching weeds guys and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "EwYbSIXtwyQ": "hey gamers what's going on I don't do that hey gamers what's going on Sheamus here back out again with another review this time it's gonna be a little different um before I proceed remember hit the subscribe button hit that like get back give this video the golden like a thousand likes can't wait that goal so this review is gonna be a little different we got your oh I didn't even notice I grabbed the holiday nerds rope nerds rope delicious candy you guys know I'm in candy man too many candy hitman we send about candy we do all sorts of cool cool quirky stuff so anyway I got this nerd rope because I have a friend named Alexis I'll reveal to you about her don't want you don't want any of the crazy fans to dock sir because I know how I know how rap you guys get I know how passionate you are and I got to tell you I love the passion and love the enthusiasm I appreciate all the support you got to give me over the years but I don't want you I don't want you to attack her for this even though she she deserves the worst I've discovered she eats nerd rope by picking off the nerds and eating the nerds separately leaving the gummy untouched until the end because the gummies not really untouched it's gonna be all over your hand until the end it's disgusting so the recent candy man too many candy ep the Tony Hawk's candy cigarette candy taste land EP I called her out in it because you know what she she deserves it uh and then she fired back at me but I was gonna get a lawsuit against me valid and this expires this month um and that I should try it out before hating and you know what I am a hater but I'm gonna try it out because because you know what I want to prove her a wrong I want to prove to her how vile and disgusting this is how perverse this is now I didn't realize I got a holiday nerds rope so before I proceed I'm gonna eat it normally give a little mini review of that so this how you should eat innards root this tastes exactly like a nerd rope I guess the only holiday part is the UH the coloring - candy coloring I realized now I got candy shards on this end I'm gonna have to do a little role reversal here so so I got a clean slate no Holly nerd rope I like it's festive I'm big Christmas fan well big holiday fan I'm sorry for the the goddamn PC culture out there yeah I don't want any letters I don't when he attacks and he boycotts so I'll say I love the holidays okay you know it's Christmas I love Christmas um it's good I liked it a holiday nerd rope I'm a little scared to do this just because there's so many so many nerds on here I just seems like so much work at first I thought she ate it like corn on the cob which frankly at this point I think would be better because it's faster because who the hell eats nerds like two at a time not me I don't do that so I've removed innards from one side of the rope so far well this tiny section I just feel like it's a lot of work I took my hands are gonna get sticky cuz it's gummy you know it looks terrible drop it nerds everywere silly me it looks like a baby he's been chewing on this for a while it's a visually disgusting I don't like the way if it just blooms around like that I'm eating nerds point out of time 2 at a time 3 at a time not not my favorite thing in the world I like to really just count him down drop it nerds everywhere see let's make something this I'm gonna eat that on the floor come on it's just I'll uh in a little bit I'll stop I'll go into the gummy see how that is I'm not eating the whole rope like this inform the camera that uh I love long dry reviews you know it's the back mode in my channel but I'm not gonna put you guys through that you may have noticed um I just uploaded a review for an amount new game fuels I had those I dropped another nerd uh found a new review for the mountain dew game fuels I don't remember what I thought about them oh wait no I didn't really like them in retrospect yeah the pineapple one it's not just sat around for a few days before I really finished it and then I didn't finish the other one I don't think had those at Evans house ballers lounge 2.0 shot down to Tevin had a great time by a meet Mina family mean bim's we went down Gainesville Florida it's not a good time okay yeah I'm getting like fuzz of this thing's just I don't like this I really tried to go into there's an open mind but it's just so difficult to do when there's fuzz getting caught in like my candy I like my candy clean usually alright that's enough so who we got so far really looks like someone's has been gnawing on this for a long time I felt awful yeah I'm not Alexis I'm so I love you I'm sorry but I just can't I can't do this this is bad I just feel I feeling so gross talk about a review of you lashes method for eating nerd wrote he's got one time I give it bad", "qqK060xvpIg": "[Music] hi there guys so good it's really good to see you welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you make sense of all those millions of seeming products at your dispensary all those bags with all those candies and gummies and cookies and cakes and whatever and drinks how do you know which ones to spend your hard-earned money on which ones did you avoid that's what weeds is here for that's what we're here for and today we're gonna let you know if it appears 100 milligram Rocky Widow is worth your money I don't believe it's going to be this little guy cost me ten dollars for one hundred milligram edible and I think I'm going to wish I spent my money elsewhere the rocky rope again is 100 milligrams from a tap here I've reviewed several that appears before found them to be lacking too severely lacking so I hope this one is just simply lacking and up here I found it to be bad on the really bad to be on the taste dimension for most of their products they taste they have that really astringent app weed aftertaste that it's really bitter and acidic kind of taste so I hope this would taste better because it's basically just a nerds rope I think it looks like the Nerds should hopefully mask the flavor of the gummy on the inside also I don't know I guess the gummy is the only part where the THC actually is and the Nerds on the outside don't have any or doesn't contain THC so you can see it here at standard-issue nerds rope up should they call it the rocky road so I'm going to eat the whole thing in front of you guys here I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know if this is actually worth your hard earned money um alright so without any further ado I'm gonna shut up stick this in my mouth hole here we go and there comes the weed taste and that comes stronger I was about to say oh it didn't taste so bad the Nerds are kind of like a cool cruel prank they mask the original flavor I go oh it's sweet and tasty and then you get into the jellied rope and then then comes that after flavor but it is not as bad as some of the other gummies that I've had like their standard gummy bears are way worse way worse tasting so this one for gummy is not bad I can totally get through this one all right you guys get the idea I think I lied when I said I was gonna eat the whole thing in front of you because it's gonna take longer I thought chewy but I won't finish it and I will come after you guys in two hours - what - no that this ed up your rocky rope and I'll finish this little nerves at the bottom - it's worth your money so thank you so much for watching weights guys we'll see you in two hours at pure I'm sorry just not what $10 I'm not high at all 100 milligrams of THC supposedly I have one more at appeared to review and I think that will be my last foray into and a pure in not there any worse than any other like your infused creations or voodoo sours I don't I don't think that they're necessarily and worse they might even be slightly better in terms of taste and consistency well I think voodoo tastes better but maybe in potency consistency in potency but who knows gummies just do not work for me why and and be though your mileage may vary you may gummies gummies may work for you animals manifest themselves weird ways and different people but they are not for me and I would not recommend them to anybody they don't taste good they don't get you high or they don't taste good to me they don't get me high and I just don't find anything pleasurable about them so I'll do my one last at a peer review that I've got and then I am going to say that we have reviewed enough and appear to know that ah that they are not for me and probably shouldn't be for you either okay guys that's gonna do it for this episode and this review here on wheats thank you so much for watching sorry to blast that appear so much here but again it's just done I can't help it it's you know if I'm not high I'm not high thank you so much for

Varmus [ __ ] but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you where the [ __ ] is another [ __ ] guys please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say it cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that so you can get a notification anytime so don't forget the follow up [ __ ] over on Instagram this cannot underscore me cannot under [ __ ] score me alright so if you don't like the word [ __ ] mother pregnant you should probably go to another [ __ ] sample I'm gonna just tell you that [ __ ] right now alright so hitting my little uh my extreme cubing dad my weed man came through the other day I want to say you sailor sunday driver I'm not 100% sure but the shade is bomb and any other boy with a little ounce of shape for Christmas so that's dope what kind of lead man gives you Christmas yes what kind of nanos Matt he's [ __ ] right here I ain't gonna front they probably the dopest they're probably the dopest edibles in my opinion that I've had that's on the market that I've had sorry he's gonna need no booze on the market I'm saying it was on the market that's I've had okay so I really like them it's a hundred milligrams and the whole thing and it's five milligrams each dummy now a lot of [ __ ] be like oh 100 milligrams etting she got it had thousand milligrams if you got a thousand [ __ ] from the [ __ ] shop it probably wasn't a thousand milligrams I don't give a [ __ ] what you say or what you think it probably was not a thousand milligrams now some people can't take that [ __ ] don't get me wrong but most people can't because I've had a lot of people that has say a hundred that ain't [ __ ] I ain't got I'd do a thousand I'd do 500 and then they'll take like 10 or 15 of a real actual tested gummy and number uh gonna be [ __ ] up so I don't want to hear that [ __ ] so you know but don't get me wrong some people's tolerance is stronger than that [ __ ] you know cuz I also know that because my tolerance is like probably 40 54 where I like my high to be and if I wanted I could go 60 70 and still be like oh I wouldn't like out there but I could see people being over 100 but my point is you give them up like as a try on the dole singing it yo [ __ ] is to hide I think you need to take a month like a break if your tolerance is too goddamn much so anyway in Tunisia's ah let's see you got twenty gummies in here so I can say it's 100 milligrams one gummy is a serving and so you're looking at 23 servings in this [ __ ] no I'm sorry so many free calories per gummy okay when you're looking at the fat to zero fats about six grams of sugar and I mean six rounds of carbs and four grams of sugar so if you're on a keto diet this definitely is not the one for you and if you are vegan this is not for you or vegetarian this is not for you and the reason for that is because this does have gelatin in it which is weird though because the main ingredient is going to be agar but then they put gelatin in it so you could have just stopped with the agar instead of putting the gelatin in it and this is why I say this for companies that'll do this I give you when I come into the dispensary and they'll ask hey do you have any vegan gummies right that's understandable I've never remember you might have had a [ __ ] come in and say do you have non vegan gummies even make sense so the average person I'm talking probably 95 plus percent of people do not know the difference between a vegan gummy and when it comes to the taste so if I was a company I would just make all my [ __ ] vegan because it don't matter who will eat it because now it can get to anybody because no one's looking for the gelatin the market is not looking for the gelatin so I would just change that up if I was you [ __ ] because they have some that are vegan and those are good and there's no difference in the taste so to me they might as well just do all of them as vegan so I don't know why they only do a couple of women beginning some of them not but that's that so the other dope thing with this company is that they do them in sativa indica and hybrid so I like that because now you can get a little specific with your filling and your effects of [ __ ] and some companies stick to just doing this shit's hybrid which i think is it I think it makes sense because you know if the person walks up and that's the only gummy there some people would not [ __ ] with it if it's in the car and not [ __ ] wouldn't fit sativa but if it's hybrid they're like all right let's go [ __ ] it let me get it so I see the positives of that however the ones who are able to beast like specific admission I see there should fly off the shelves way quicker then a hybrid ones so this one right here is a cran a crammed pomegranate punch weird [ __ ] I don't know but it did taste good and the other cool thing with this is that it's enhanced nano molecular technology that they put in here in gummies and what man no molecular means whoa I don't even understand how that makes it react faster because it makes it react faster but what that means is that's just like a way of like I guess you could say measuring like how the speed of your molecules changing inside of your body so I think what's happening here is that they've sped up the process somehow of making the molecules in your body change for you to feel that humming um it's scented at two hour waiting game these [ __ ] is like probably 20-30 minutes if that like I got to give it to a one what was it last weekend for some reason I couldn't sleep welcome to 1:30 was up like a [ __ ] and I had to go rock climbing at like 10 o'clock or so I was tired as [ __ ] didn't want to go because I hadn't had any sleep whatsoever so I took ten milligrams of this [ __ ] and this [ __ ] was like a six hour energy drink like it was dope it really worked there was no crash I was like goddamn that [ __ ] is pretty bomb and so I like that versus that two hours you don't know when is gonna kick in type of filling cuz I've had that [ __ ] happen before once and some edibles cup but god I took the [ __ ] because it took so long for dumb [ __ ] to kick in I'm sitting there and I'm like mm-hmm hey y'all see that leprechaun run by look how things are turning out of nowhere you forgot you took some [ __ ] so uh I like these because they react a lot quicker so I definitely say give these shits a try now let me show you what they look like they like in little coin shapes and they are gluten free for all you gluten-free [ __ ] out there so it's a little sugar sprinkles on top of it mm-hmm so I'm fine and taste of them are really good no no she was bomb man actually there's really really good so it says that the candies Awards I never saw this really the winner most accurate formulated edible I guess that you mean it's pretty consistent and what they're doing in it I guess it's on mark of what is supposed to but yeah I got a really say my Anisha it's a pretty dope and another thing is some people don't like it we on 5 milligrams per they like oh how come I can't get nothing stronger it's still a hundred milligrams in the package whether I gave you 10 10 milligrams or 25 milligrams it's still the same [ __ ] amount and I personally like when they can chop it down like that because first of all some of these gummies are just good goddammit and I like that [ __ ] so I like to be able to eat more than one and that's one thing the other thing is you have more control over your dosing so let's say you want to go 25 instead of going 20 or 30 like 20 is not enough but 30 is too much so you just want to be at 25 I ain't the one for biting the [ __ ] in half and then putting that [ __ ] back you got me [ __ ] up I don't think that smart I don't think that's a sanitary I think this is like a nasty bout [ __ ] you put that [ __ ] back into the bag with the rest of my fingers now you'll slime it and touch the other ones he you nasty so for me I like to go put five milligrams and so I can like micro dose my [ __ ] and I can have more than one I will say this does give you a little bit of after cannabis he tastes but who gives a [ __ ] it's [ __ ] candidates like I hate when people be whining over to flavor like my Adeline fat and in my mind I'm like I would like to taste the vodka but I'll still take a shot I know you know like oh I just love that case well you say you like the taste of survive that is because it was smoother than the dog [ __ ] you started on back in the day so get the [ __ ] out here so you don't get a little cannabis taste just you know manna lemon woman up and grab you chronic leaves and [ __ ] take the tents guys damn it but even with that being said it's really just a good good gummy but you do get a little bit aftertaste a little bit weak but anyway so definitely I say [ __ ] these if you find these [ __ ] I say get them I'm gonna ask the the company when I see them why they don't just do it all it just you know Eggar and just make them all plant based versus doing the gelatin I say this ain't no like oh go on and be vegan and about that this is literally just to me from a company standpoint it'd be like if I was only in the company I would just make it where I know everybody can get it but I wouldn't even promote them as being safe vegan I would just put them out on the shelf and let them be what they are so that would be me if I was the one doing it but anyway that's the end of this video I hope you guys enjoyed it like I say have you seen these [ __ ] make sure you get them and before you get out of here make sure you subscribe and hit that peace you can get that [ __ ] notification alright and go follow me over on Instagram so anyway I'm out of this [ __ ] y'all keep the love going y'all love each other y'all keep the peace going and be peaceful too each other and I would see our [ __ ] a [ __ ] slated piece the one I want to hit the sequel we in the jungle smokin we in a jungle smokin", "2VNYCOaQFSY": "[Music] hopefully 71 the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this web view we are taking a look at the final product to review from a cushy punch their 100 milligram sativa variety flavor is strawberries the strawberry 100 milligram sativa variety of cushy punch we've looked at their 200 milligram TK o which I found to be kind of lacking and then we looked at their 100 milligram indica and in an experiment we also look at the 100 milligram hybrids and I found both of those to be not too bad so I hope that this is on the better end of the cushy punch I hope it's as good as the other two 100 milligrams I found those to be much better than the 200 milligram sort of surprisingly I would just go with 100 milligrams in terms of cost because I think it's about just about as potent as its 200 milligram brother so without further ado let's going to open this up and eat her down and what's gonna happen after that guys after I finish this I'm going to come back to you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part about the edible review not necessarily how it tastes but more about how it actually makes you feel so here we go looks like a like a little jam packet or a little jelly packet or a little butter packet it's got four little blocks in there and after we get it plopped out you can see it with its four a little squares but we're going to ignore the little squares there just plug the whole thing in my mouth and one go mmm not bad definitely a little bit of what we taste so much better than the infused creations or the what's the other one I can't remember the name off the top my head but any of those ones that are just like the gummy bears with the basically just like THC oil sprinkled on the outside this is a lot better this is more like the flourish although I don't think it's quite as good as the flourish so now that I've slurped it down I'm gonna wait two hours to see how I'm gonna feel you guys however have to just wait a couple seconds I'll be back right after this break here and I'll let you know how I'm feeling see you then it's been two hours since I had the cushy punch that's the name of it the cushy punch should sieve a hundred milligram THC strawberry flavored gummy here and I gotta say this might be the least hi I've been from one of their hundred milligrams it seemed like the hybrid and the indica hit me more that might just be because I've heard this about um because she punched before that they're not the most consistent some are code and some aren't and that might just be the case with this sativa I'm not not high just more at like four four and a half somewhere in that range instead of the six five and a half six is the other ones so a little bit less than before but again that just might be this particular batch where it might be that sativa doesn't quite hit me as hard but it still is better than my original impressions of could she punch way back when when I had their TKO at the very very beginning I still don't think it would be the first thing I reached for at the dispensary but it won't be the last thing I go for like my opinion used to be so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching it as always and we will see you on the next review peace okay", "-Yn9dXRFT4Y": "the Joe Rogan experience what was the last second ellic trip you had any I did mushrooms couple months ago yeah how is that it's [ __ ] awesome where'd you do him um did him with re on the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger registered on some Micro dos versions of mushrooms that I have to add two of them and they were it was great it just made things a little bit brighter have you ever microdose yes you know does that all-time hey white oh really Ron white so micro dosing [ __ ] yeah cuz I'm on this new drug it's called mushrooms and I just take a little bit every day woah yeah I know a lot of people to do that yeah a lot like dozens dozens of people who microdose including fighters I know a lot of fighters from microdose yeah I forgot today was even on any I was like I was just like oh this room looks like cooler yeah I just feel so oh yeah I ate that little piece yeah you just feel a little better and you're like what is all I took mushrooms yeah I forgot [Applause]", "qRcT79nQM6s": "[Music] [Music] welcome to true buds TV for a trochee review they say medicate with confidence I say that's [ __ ] this is my least favorite purchase I bought from a dispensary in the past year it looked really cool I got really excited when I saw it here so let me open it up comes in this little container you take that and it has this little thing here little bar I don't know if you can see it cut into different increments there's four increments here it says 10 milligrams apiece so it came with 10 total little increments for a hundred milligrams the first time I had three and I didn't really feel [ __ ] the next time I had three again I was like maybe it was an off day or whatever I didn't really feel [ __ ] today I'm gonna take the four and I'm hoping I feel a little something because the last two times like I said I am very very disappointed I personally will never be buying trochee again unless they like make it right send me a sample like you got a bad batch try it again it's really potent please let me know your thoughts if you have tried this and are on the same page and think it sucks please leave a comment to help others and if you think it's good maybe I just got a [ __ ] up batch but I'm gonna take these four here you take it and you let it dissolve in your upper lip here sit it there until it dissolves now let's take a look at the pack here so solvent free sugar free gluten free vegan so capital Coca Inc are the people who produce this stage-three tested total 97.1 eight milligrams of TB gut of the THC there 0.35 milligrams of CBD lemon and lime peel I mean the flavor is good but things seriously didn't I really didn't feel it so for here if I don't feel 40 milligrams my sweet spots usually 20 to 30 if I don't feel this then this product is complete [ __ ] so here are the instructions I'll read the side your serving size pop chogi under your upper lip between cheek and gum wait a few minutes to feel the tingle in the back of your throat that's the cannabinoids absorbing into your body enjoy the facts within 30 minutes wait an hour before dosing again so it's currently 5:40 I'm gonna come back to you here a little over from 30 minutes we'll do like 625 and I'll let you know if I'm feeling anything and then I'll come back in an hour let you know what I'm thinking please trochee let me feel the 40 milligrams don't just [ __ ] me over completely because I wanted to love your product maybe that's why I'm pissed because it looks so cool and it was appealing and now it just kind of sucks I'm hoping these 40 milligrams proved me wrong though see you guys soon let it dissolve up here 6:28 over 30 minutes later and I'm trying to see if I feel anything like I'm really digging in myself like do I feel it like I think I do feel a little something you know being a sativa it might be a little more upbeat but like I'm still legitimately struggling to see if I truly feel it if I feel stoned at all and I don't really maybe slightly I'm gonna come back to you and a half an hour so make an hour in to see if it really does much because for 40 milligrams typically I'd be like ripped off my ass so I stand where I stood at the beginning of the video come back to you in 30 for a final answer on these trophies here see what happens well-well-well 720 now was really hoping something would start happening but it hasn't trokey you seriously let me down during this time I went on to trying to find some stuff I really couldn't find much I know the website wasn't working which is the case with some other edibles I've seen but that in itself is a red flag to me if you have a website on the back and it's not working and I can't find you that's a little [ __ ] up so I'd recommend steering your elsewhere here I'd go for any other tincture that I've had on this channel instead of this any other edible I would honestly even do an lol edible over this even though those suck trochee man you guys got to step it up I don't know what's going on did I just get a one-off shitty product I highly doubt it but I can't ever see myself buying another one I was like oh I'm gonna try another one from you but no not but thank you guys for chillin you know yes I'm not that hard to please when it comes to this stuff does it get the job done you know if I take 20 30 milligrams how am I feeling am I feeling really good am I feeling it at all you know it's not that hard I'm not the biggest critic here so that's why I'm bashing trokey today don't [ __ ] with it spend your money elsewhere buy better [ __ ] just trying to be real with the guys give you the real [ __ ] that I'm thinking and I hope you like and respect it and if you do give this video a like I'll catch you later - yeah this is true bus - yeah this is true [Music]", "fdvWwr1lF80": "thanks for rolling up until the morning certified quiet smoking one of my mornings maybe would it be looking at these edibles right here these are uh sours this is a pink grapefruit um this whole package is 450 milligrams of thc the uh the uh pieces themselves are little little squares little gummy squares with a like sugar coating on them um they do have a lot of grapefruit flavor um the thc flavor kind of like sits in the back of the taste um last night i took three of them oh i was pretty pretty pretty pretty smooth for those bruh yeah it's pretty smooth off of those i didn't smoke because i wanted to try to like get get the whole effect of them um about about an hour and a half two hours in bruh that was [ __ ] crash bro woke up still feeling i mean a little bit a little bit uh good i mean so so so they're definitely good but what i'll say is this um edibles are not something to be kind of like just um taking willy nilly uh if you want to start dabbing in edibles what i suggest you do is start off slow like i took one way a half hour take another one wait a half hour i took another one um and about about a half hour after that i started feeling the effects of it and then that she just put me to sleep so though you don't want to um just jump in from the edibles and just like like like pop mad at me especially if you don't know how they're going to affect you because they affect everybody different but i will say this oh if you uh want to try some edibles over you just find these sours give them a try that means you think in the comment section if you've tried these showers let me know in the comment section how you uh thought they was the [ __ ] uh it's pretty dope for me bruh um if i see them again i'll grab some more [ __ ] they not like uh something i'll be searching out for but when i see them i'll grab

and there isn't a grizzled Sheriff and his loyal deputies around to keep you safe from all the bandits welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I get a lot of questions about people asking for tips for determining if an edible is potent as advertised so today guys I'm gonna share with you five common sense tips on how to avoid getting scammed when it comes to buying edibles getting scammed at the dispensary is pretty easy it's a nascent market with little to no regulations and zero accountability there's also lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of money to be made so lots of money and no accountability equals sleazy scores for scammers and fraudsters and it's bad enough when dispensaries and growers mislead their customers on what strain or how potent the flower they are buying is but at least the customers can see the product they can verify its weight they can smell it or whatever other rituals they have to test their weed sure they may not be getting the premium product that they are supposedly paying for but if they're buying an amount they will generally get that amount edibles however are much easier to scan customers with a customer can't verify that 200 milligrams or whatever listed on the package is really 200 milligrams they don't see the edibles getting made they can't see it being packaged if you want to buy a product you've got to take the company at its word that their product is potent is advertised store that your dispensary isn't gonna sell you a shitty product and good luck with that so I don't want to scare anyone away from edibles because they're [ __ ] awesome there are tons of great and reliable edible companies out there and more certain to come soon and experimenting and trying new products is half the fun but before you go and buy something expensive you've never seen before try utilizing these five tips to save yourself some money and some heartache so tip number one don't trust weed maps or your bud tender for their recommendation both these places especially weed maps is swamped with a bunch of bots and fake reviews that amp up a lot of really shady companies like lol edibles or infused creations all those have been pumped up by their respective companies and they mislead you and also speaking of people that mislead you your bud tender may very well mislead you they may have some kind of sales contract or sales target for some specific edible or they may have some kind of relationship with an edible manufacturer and they may be just be trying to sell you something that is not very good I've certainly seen it happen many times I've seen a lot of bud tenders Hocking lol edibles saying it's you know the second coming do not be fooled by them do your own research ahead of time don't trust weed Maps don't trust your bud tender know what you're looking for add of time so tip number two is in this case you want to judge a book by its cover or you want to stick to those reputable brands and what I mean by judge a book by its cover is looked at like the packaging is the packaging nice is the packaging fancy does it really show off the edible and all its glory I'm just talking about canna Co I'm talking about Korova here these guys have great packaging vibrant packaging that really shows off and sells their product and generally speaking the fancier the packaging the nice of the packaging the nicer the product maybe because they have the money already from being a bigger brand to invest in their packaging you know I'm sure it's the dog wagging some tail here a little bit as to what comes first but really take a look at the packaging do not buy anything that's just in like a plastic ziplock bag with a sticker over it it's usually going to be a bad product you want to take a look and make sure it has respectable packaging faziz that's usually a pretty good indicator that it's going to be a decent product so again judge a book by its cover and stick to those reputable brands stick to the big-name guys out there the big-name guys are big names for a reason again that's gonna be your Korova that's gonna be your Kiva that's gonna be your Kanaka that's gonna be your flourish the big guys are big again for a reason and they all have nice packaging so again look for the fancy packaging stay away from crappy packaging it's usually a pretty good indicator that what's inside is just as what's it's just as crappy as what's on the outside so tip number three is baked goods are good and chocolate is the best so I'm gonna go ahead and combine this with don't be a dummy stay away from gummies that is mostly true almost all gummies are bad with a few very notable exceptions like flourish do not get infused creations do not get at up here you're gonna see a ton of prepackaged edible or gummy edibles out there and they are almost always terrible with again a very few exceptions when it comes to gummies if you see flourish go and pick them up but outside of that stay away from the gummies there are usually a little bit cheaper than other things usually sometimes even substantially more so but that's for a reason because they are not as potent as advertised so stick away from the gummies State stay close to the baked goods your cookies and your brownies not even the Krispies like the rice krispies treats the fruity Krispies i'd stay away from those as well I don't find those to be as potent your brownies and your cookies are your best bets but for the absolute best bet go with the chocolate bars that is the best way I have found on all of my reviews for getting THC and the most potent gram for gram has always been chocolate bars kiva bang for twenty two phones say all those great ones there's so many out there and it's usually if you can find a chocolate bar it's gonna be a fun fun ride so again tip number three baked goods are good chocolate is the best stay away from gummies alright so that brings us to tip number four and that is to look for independent lab testing results this is a big one if you can find on you package or somewhere actual lab testing results that is he and don't just look for them to say lab tested look for the actual results you'll see tons of edibles out there lying about being lab tested and then this that and the other but if they don't have that actual result printed on the package it's no good plenty of people will lie about being lab tested or they'll get one product lab tested and say their entire line is lab tested if you don't see the actual results it's wasn't lab tested just go with that so look for that lab tested results look for independent verified results printed on the package or if not printed on the package printed it on a sheep close by something that will let you know that is as potent as advertised so again if you can find those lab tested results and it comes up as potent as advertised go and pick up that product it's gonna be good to go and then finally our fifth tip here is the most important one and the one that I cannot stress enough and that is you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles if there is a deal that seems too good to be true if you see a 500 milligram rice krispies treat for ten dollars don't go running for your wallet to pick it up and buy up the entire stock because they're lying to you it's not gonna be 500 milligrams it's probably not even gonna be twenty milligrams it's probably just gonna be an operation to fleece you out of your money if something seems very expensive there's usually a reason for that if it seems out of line it's probably because it is high quality stuff made with quality cannabis and quality ingredients and it's gonna stand apart the best edibles out there do cost a little bit more but they are absolutely worth it and almost invariably true if a product seems to be too good to be true in terms of price it absolutely will be so stay away from anything that seems to be too good to be true in terms of pricing and make sure that you know edibles are expensive guys so don't be surprised when you have to pay 22 bucks for a hundred and eighty milligram chocalate bar that's just gonna be the way it is out here but again you get what you pay for so if you pay that premium for that chocolate bar that fancier looking brand you're almost certainly going to be rewarded in terms of potency or taste or whatever the case may be so you absolutely get what you pay for and guys those are our five tips there just to run through them one more time don't trust weed maps or your bud tender for your recommendation do judge a book by its cover stick to those reputable brands number three baked goods are goods chocolate is the best stay away from gummies number four look for those independent lab testing results and then number five you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles what you pay for is what you get so if the deal seems too good to be true it very likely is and guys that's gonna do it just follow those five tips and you should be ready to enjoy some high-quality edibles and if you guys have any other tips

on his face he's like yo Don how much lunch money you got today man so automatically I'm like god damn boy I just got a school man why is you begging me for money already dog can't I'll live he's like Don chill just just tell me how much lunch one you got man so I'm like 500 this is Jamaican dollars of course and at a time $300 was a reasonable amount for a day's worth of lunch money but my mama loved me a little bit extra so you know she'd often give me 500 just for context back then I 100 Jamaican dollars was equal to like one American dollar so I told him how much money I got and then he is like cool cool okay okay you should go half with me on a brown so I'm like brownie what brownies is there like a bake sale going on or something just like done no bro I'm talking about Leroy's and brownies dogs so I'm like oh snap Leroy that big dark-skinned dude I'm good I know Leroy he looks like the kind of guy that would scratch himself and then put his hand back in the batter without washing his hands I think I'm gonna have to take a hard pass on that one and Jeff was like done you know about these brownies huh I'm like what about them then Jeff's eyes lit up in that special way that people's eyes light up when they know a secret that you don't you leans in and whispers God these are magic brownies I look at Jeff and I'm like you're kidding he doesn't even say anything just stood there smiling I gave Jeff all of my lunch money you see by this time a lot of dudes in our grade were experimenting with magic but they were only using magic inhalers and that didn't really appeal to me but I was still curious about magic so when Jeff told me about the magic brownies I was like that sounds lazy so yeah I was like sign me up so Jeff takes my money in dips ow 10 minutes later he comes back to me enhance me my brownie wrapped up in foil paper he tells me that I should wait on till lunchtime to eat it and that I should only eat half so I'm like cool I got it I was pumped I couldn't wait till lunch fast forward to lunchtime and everybody has brownies like Leroy Maybank that day man so I'll find Jeff and I'm sitting with him and a group of friends and then we all ate our brownies so we're sitting there in 15 minutes or so passes and I'm not not really feeling anything also lunch was gonna end in less than 30 minutes so I started to get a little impatient on top of that I spent all my lunch money on this dang brownie tomorrow was Heike hungry I didn't have anything else to eat so I hate the rest of the brownie the whole thing I eat the whole thing I even lick the icing off the foil paper man so I'm sitting there and then Jeff comes over to me and he's like yo dumb and how you feeling bro and then I'm like hungry man and a little disappointed I had to hold brownie still pretty hungry and I really feeling any magic as soon as I said that Jeff's face changed from happy and magical to extremely concerned he was like on no I told you not to eat more than half bro have have you ever had magic before I'm like no but I don't see why you're trippin I had no whole brownie like 20 minutes ago and I still don't feel anything and right after seeing that I hear somebody need to get me a doctor man somebody help me man yo take me to the nurse dawg I look over to where the noise was coming from and I see this dude let's call him Amar'e screaming and running across the schoolyard then he gets tackled by some of the other students they bring him over and my man's is tripping hard he was sweating mumbling gibberish trying to take off his shirt just completely losing it so I'm like yo what happened to him and then one of his friends was like man that boy had a whole brownie dog I guess Leroy made this batch extra strong made this batch extra strong I'm instantly begin to panic I mean I was going to die and certainly I was I was going to die obviously here's why Amar'e was one of those dudes that was known to take part in the use of magic inhalers after school so you understand what I'm saying this this guy was an experienced magic user he was an experienced magic user and was still going insane I on the other hand have never used magic and I ate the exact same amount of brownie as he did I was so there I am just panicking internally awaiting my certain death I was sweating profusely I look sick just from the worry and anxiety then Jeff comes over to me and is like yo Don how you feelin man then I was like oh no bro I still don't feel anything too crazy man and it was like as soon as I said that BAM give me and here's the thing when it comes to eating management unlike inhaling it when you eat it he doesn't gradually come on to you one you're fine just chilling and then out of nowhere it's like a magical fairy comes over to you and bashes you over the head with her magic bit sending you straight into lala land I was on it was so bad that I ended up skipping all my classes after lunch there were three distinct feelings that I remember from being under magic spell the first was that time was moving in slow motion and I don't just mean my sense of time which did happen the last 10 minutes of lunch felt like an hour but I mean visually the best way I can describe it is like a visual echo for example let's say someone wave their hand in front of my face it was like their hand left a trail of hands as it moved along its path it completely tripped me out the second feeling was that my sense of touch became hyperstimulated I remember just sitting on the floor in complete agony because the wrinkles in my uniform hurt when my skin rubbed over there like I would rest my arm on my pants and the bulges in the fabric fell as if they were trying to pierce through my skin absolutely awful the last feeling was severe anxiety I can honestly say that this was the first time in my life where I experienced a real traumatic panic attack I was so worried about what you ask I remember in particular I was dreading that my mom was going to pick me up from school and see that I used magic and then kill me so for like the four hours between lunch and when I was supposed to get picked up from school I just sat on the floor Hannah can that my mom was gonna be just so disappointed and angry with me but here's the thing my mom never picked me up from school and I mean never she has a nine-to-five job she's a manager at Bank she's never picked me up from school but for some reason I was convinced that she was coming to get me and when she did she was going to murder me in front of all of my friends but of course instead a taxicab pick me up the same taxicab that had been picking me up every day from school for the prior three years so when I say that it made no sense that I was convinced that my mom was gonna pick me up I mean I have absolutely no idea I thought that but that's what you'd imagine community especially when you eat it at 14 years old so I get home and I immediately just went a bit I slept for like four hours got up and then proceeded to eat all the food in the house all of it like everyone's dinner that my aunt had cooked that afternoon and put in the fridge like four plates of food my G I ate all of it and then went back to sleep moral of the story kids don't do magic man it's a powerful stuff big shout out to the best squad on the internet man the sauce squad it's your boy

you where you wanna be [Music]", "szIfo0BJMs0": "[Music] there's a color-changing pineapple behind me see know what that means it means it's time for weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode I'm gonna help you make sense of one thing I have never understood at any of the dispensaries I've been to because I have seen this product at practically every dispensary that I have been to and I have never ever picked it up because it always seems like such a bad deal to me and that is cheeba choose as I said I have seen these at practically every dispensary of it around but I have never actually picked them up because they just seem like a tremendously bad value so this is their extra strength hybrid and chew at a hundred milligrams of THC see if we can actually get that oriented properly for you probably not oh there it goes um so yeah you can see hundred milligrams of THC 520 milligram doses but let's look at the back and you can see that price tag they sell this for 15 bucks I got a discount for 13 to 13 dollars for this tiny tiny tiny little thing now I do like small edibles I do actually have always have an affinity for potent things in small packages that's what she said but this just does not seem like it could do the job hundred milligrams isn't that much especially for 15 bucks and it just doesn't seem like it could pack that much of a punch in something this small I mean I've had like the punch bars before which are quite small or I've had the bang the bite and each of those actually had nearly twice as much THC in them as there's this thing did and they were considerably bigger even still so I do not know what to expect I'm hoping because they are everywhere they're sort of ubiquitous that means that there's some reason they're so popular and they're as potent as they are but we're about to find out together all I know is if this ends up being a disappointment I'm gonna have some harsh words for Chiba Choo so I'm gonna shut up now open this up pop it in my mouth poll tell you how it tastes and then I will be back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling although for you it'll be just a couple of seconds okay so I'm unraveling it here comes in it is definitely a caramel I don't know how you would split this in five doses otherwise it's pretty pretty mushy it smells good it smells like a caramel I'm just gonna plunk this whole thing right my mouth I'm gonna do it in two bites just do it in one here we go well maybe actually cut some music in my new tune there we go down the hatch so it taste is good you've got to give him credit for that wow that was a really good taste in caramel perfect sort of consistency very little cannabis taste I was happy with that but what I'm unsure about is how this bad boy is actually going to hit me for that guy's you're gonna have to wait a couple seconds me on the other hand I'm have to wait a couple hours to see what its gonna do to me I will let you know I'll see you guys in just a bit peace it's been two hours guys since I had the Chiba juice and it's just as I feared Chiba I'm afraid I do not choose you it's it's about as bad as I had hoped um yeah I can't say I feel nothing I would say I'm at maybe a three two and a half somewhere in there um so you know not high at all you know I feel something maybe there's sort of the effects after you had smoked a joint an hour later or something just like the echo of a high so it's you know it tasted good I like the taste of the chima choose it's just too expensive for what it is and does not provide enough of a high I have tried other 100 milligram edibles that I've hit harder than this and that 15 bucks for this thing it's just it's it's too much I cannot recommend the Chiba choose at this point I don't think I would be reviewing any more Chiba choose just because you know one and done with this one maybe unless you guys really have some wrong feelings about other ones or if there's something you really want me to review from cheap at you let me know but otherwise this one is enough of a bummer on its own then I don't feel like I have to run down there their entire catalogue I think they have more projects than this I think anyways that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and I will see you on our next review peace pretty good", "LoSj93WkAIY": "is it mukbang or mukbang a crap-ton of edibles basically we got hot chocolate looks really good right there we have krispies I'm actually really excited for you guys to see what these look like and then you know if you I drink one of these this morning I told you smack but no you know what like no like no but you know what you're gonna be twisting on and I guarantee you I don't care who you are you have to be in human for it to not get your ass um the chocolate the chocolate is vicious I don't know if it's the way you digesters in your system but the chocolate is just ridiculous man I just want to get you right there guys look at this yeah just kind of get an idea of what these look like here I like these right here left on me a little light in my home he owns here really he's cool as hell they're so sweet and top honestly do that go solid nine they don't taste nothing like weed they taste soft um they're sweet and I don't know it's just the only reason I don't give it a solid 10 because it's really sugary but I mean I guess is how shooters are you know the full of sugar but just personal preference like I'm not a huge sweet tooth so sometimes I'm like things that are hella sweet like I think my favorite kind of edibles like sour edibles cuz I like yeah because he is a sour patch kids mr. CPK what about you though one time I'll give it a ten yeah this is all good today's nothing like we ever like I can keep eating without realizing they're edible that's the best parts they don't taste like we honestly I hate eating everyone cheers boom so that come on your day we got a gang that stuff you guys um we're gonna go ahead and go for the crispys way softer but like let me taste a real with strawberries yeah you know the one seems like I mean the other ones are basically this plus the true texture and step over it so it's obviously will be a little harder but these are really soft I taste like yeah it's just like cereal man tastes like waking up like cereal everybody has the dry exactly what it tastes like you know what like hey you ever had um was it called alright only with a KO and I'll be having the dry like strawberry fruit on it just like that that gonna be so baked if this it's getting to one of these five words we have guys um hot chocolate Mexican style hot chocolate to be exact this is it up here not sure if you guys can read it or not but chocolate they I will eat that and has a dope-ass quote it reads you are not lucky to be here the world needs your perspective they are lucky to have you that is pretty tight man and that's from Antonio he hit on the hot tea hey what hey Antonio song bro he's the president and CEO of the Hispanic Heritage Foundation shout out to you Antonio saludos package is forgot like all of this stuff right here so you can measure out what's going on is this is a reflection of what the chocolate bar is you know but yeah so you get the chocolate bar like this and now you actually got to be a little slick with how you open it but you're just basically Shawn do that and then want to open just get your fingers up in there man and start busting it up buzz down tatianna you know anything snap them and croc on my how's it taste like that have you ever like as a kid took a little bite of that chocolate sounds like a dude's like it is crazy it even leaves out texturing your mouth and soup the same huh the little powdering stuff that you get from it bomb it tastes just like it I mean for lovely that don't understand we're talking about this like Mexican style hot chocolate it has an old lady in front of it it's like a yellow package and when you bite into that hot chocolate before cooking it this is what it tastes like BOM mmm mmm please make like childhood memories mm-hmm so long by far I think my variable from everything we've tried what about you so far mm-hmm you think so Jill that's really enjoyable right there and I thought this is the perfect get high to snack because it's easy to swallow down and eat like I you remember eating edibles back in the day that just used to taste horrible and you're literally like forcing yourself to try to eat that [ __ ] this thing will have you coming back and eating more than you should it was nice is that you can just come up and close it and it'll still right back up you know keep your product fresh it's pretty cool all right guys so check it out we have or chat die here and he will not be no two completely different colors here but I'm excited to try them out let's give them a good shake we're gonna go ahead let's do this one we're gonna try out or tap that man probably the one I'm most excited about just cuz come on Oh to check that that's traditional as him but who has that murder watch at back oh my god yeah but you should be those who compete right you have both of those what do you want or chatter on Micah go check them I think so too the one thing is like it is a dairy product so not everybody consumes Dariush it but or chopping this is so good has a little measuring bars and stuff to the side so you can measure everything know how much you've consumed they got 100 milligrams in here Babur about 30 milligrams in which is these which is a drink this is each tickle mark indicates 10 milligrams Oh each tick mark I thought I'd take them work yeah I'm already feeling it low key ow it is just like oh yeah you got goddamn she scarves like 30 milligrams down mm-hmm has a kick to it as far as explain it to them like it's I don't know her sweetie like it's not bad it doesn't taste horrible and it doesn't taste like wheat but it doesn't have a kick to it you could tell something in there yeah you know what I feel like it's the best way to describe that it was like that it's almost like having an alcoholic drink and then when you have lunch a little stronger so you know you're sipping alcohol went towards compared with having some drinks where you're just like drinking away then you can't even taste alcohol you're just like this tastes great you know that's kind of like your chat dies the chat that's really hard to even know it's anything in there like to be I think the best thing that was just shaking especially like this one so you make sure that yeah well you do get to like the last drink you could get intense good I want to like freeze this up I don't know if it would break off in you the THC but imagine freezing and making lollipops popsicles no lollipops which I'm way to make them yeah or you go Mexican style and then like you need a little stick or a stick and you get plastic bags plastic bags and then you just fill up the plastic bag you put the stick in there you put a rubber band around it and then boom homemade but look man if you guys enjoyed the video make sure you guys smash that like comment down below let me know from all the food you guys saw which one do you think looks the best you know sounds the best also make sure you guys check out her channel I'll have it someone your on screen and down below in the description yes so she actually filmed her piece of these edibles as well make sure you guys go check that out you know what I'm saying yeah kangkang okay also let me know guys what and what do you they're bombs they're my favorite chips I'm asking the people", "N_-egbS8RaE": "so what is up guys it's your boy Shelton with another fire a video from waking baking this morning we got another surprise for you guys this is a good surprise to this deposits airheads this morning we got some areas I got this actually before I left to go to Miami because I went to Miami to a car show which was canceled because of the got-dang coronavirus ladies y'all this is airheads they'll see them crystals on that area is a hybrid strain it originates from the United States obviously it may taste fruity spicy earthy sour piney when smoked this strand can make you feel you for your creativity calm numbness appetite gain and pain relief negative side effects can include slight anxiety and slight dry mouth I can't see no side effects the smoking yeah get some ice in here on the girl so I'm sorry I can't remember your name right now but somebody had asked me why I prefer smoking bone over blunts of papers and I had told because it's aesthetically pleasing you know it looks better to smoke a bong than to watch me sit back smoking a blunt or smoking a bowl but or smoking on paper but the other reason is is that I smoke a bong because this gives me the full flavor I don't know people tell me that when they smoke blunts they can taste the weed really good I can't taste the weed but with to a blunt I don't know what it is and papers saying to see me distorted distort the flavor by making it harsh or something to me you know and I put a lot of weed when I rolled a j2 when I rolled a Jiang I probably put as much in a jet in a joint as y'all put in a blunt pipe on a 1.7 maybe 2 grams but anyway we're gonna go ahead and get in here on this area you see how it takes up I wish I'd have brought this to Miami with me I probably would have smoked it all I know what I smoked at all anyway on the way to Miami on the way back from Miami I had a blowout I don't know if you guys seen the video yet but I had a blowout tire blew out and now they're attempting to charge me for the tire and the tow service and I had to wait on the side of the road for four hours man for four hours on the side of highway I'm gonna dispute that anyway let's go with this airhead you guys let's get a good flavor there was a lot of different flavors that said that this could possibly taste like - excuse me um would it say a fruity spicy earthy sour piney all that let's get up in it I love that cool him when ice comes dukes I taste all that I definitely taste plain I guess I could've been spicy I tasted it sour in the earthy and piney maybe I'm just tasting all that because I just read it but actually this is a really really full flavor of gosh it's nice that is really flavorful guys that tastes so good Wow hence the reason why I smoke out of a ball so I can taste it all this is like straight flavor like straight from here to here straight flavor man I can't taste that in a blood I really can't but I know but I know I'm at the smoker blood would you like yes I was so disappointed about the car show we drove before they had five hours to Miami just to go to the Miami cars & coffee show for you guys I'm renting a car and everything we get down there man I should have recorded I should have showed you guys what cars and coffee and Miami was like so um they had like maybe eight cars there maybe twelve cars tops I was like you [ __ ] serious man but one thing about it I got to see a Lamborghini uris in person that was the first time I've ever seen one and that was a pleasure to see y'all tell y'all if you ain't never seen a Lamborghini yours oh my for those who don't know what a Lamborghini your citizens for Lambo truck oh ok you guys so definitely on a scale of one to ten one being the worst ten being the best for flavor critique of this area Wow I'd have to give this a eight a high eight for flavor this tastes really good job I I'm speechless oh my god you guys go look at the video with the meaning of being on shrooms oh my god that video is so hilarious cuz I was so high when I made that oh my god I wanted to see something so bad because I had took some shrimps when I was here before I left to go to Miami and the blanket was like literally moving my whole blanket was on the floor that my dog lays on the blanket was just moving and I was like oh because I never seen [ __ ] on shrooms cuz I always underdose so I'm just high enough you know I don't really like the see [ __ ] or at least I didn't think I did so anyway I get there in Miami and I took some shrooms and I'm tripping but I wanted to see something so bad that I kept taking shrooms it's kept taking him I wasn't seeing nothing and it was like I was just so high I was i god that is really nice oh yeah so yesterday I also tried to make a live video with tick-tock so I'm going on I'm on video live and uh I'm talking about weed and I'm smoking and showing the weed and all that like everybody else does and the video just stops I mean it wasn't a pedo it was live the live feed just stops boom I was like what happened oh you're gonna get some tick tock guidelines and you're banned forever from blood from live-streaming forever you know chances just you're just banned forever from live-streaming you've mattify we go take the live streaming off your page I was like are you [ __ ] serious everybody else makes videos with [ __ ] them smoking weed or or something about we what dude even show this plants and in nothing that's it that shit's good the only difference with everybody making the videos with them smoking on it none of them are black I'm not raising what black people can't be racist I'm not prejudiced but it's just odd to me that the minute that I put one up there it gets taken down they they've just taken it down just because it's me not because I'm black just because it's Shelton never know but I felt like those because I was black that was wrong anyway we're not here to talk about [ __ ] tick tock we're here to smoke some weed y'all [ __ ] with y'all oh yeah I'll tell you in a second Wow good lord gracious ah damn it Sammy wow that is [ __ ] delicious I taste everything that they were saying piney sour sweet bitter trees leave us a taste at all I taste car tires in this [ __ ] this [ __ ] is awesome the highest creeping a feeling right behind my hybrid here we go I gotta go back in because this is so delicious [Music] that's really delicious now on a scale of one to ten one being the worst ten being the best for the high of airheads I don't think the highest is anything spectacular it feels like a normal exotic high you know like it's just I'm high don't get it wrong I'm highs you know what if whenever you're in doubt of being high it'll smoke some more nose when you look my boy it starts sweating look at Wow listen I can't a boy I don't know no that was this we got me speaking in tongues so as I was saying the high really as I'm talking getting higher so we're gonna put a little bit more in here take my lure here which I'll then I've seen do all of the work I don't even know if y'all can hear me I'm talking solo and [ __ ] so here we go it's better than talking like this I'm just playing I taste the sour that time wow that flavors just y'all there's so many different flavors but let's do try this again on a scale of one to ten one being worse can't be in the best of the high of Ariat I would have to give it a strong seven yes we'll go to strong seven with this so the flavor outweighs - hi hang on a second y'all almost it no I'm not gonna do it because I almost did this in one little tape oh all right I don't think I've paused it once let's keep going no need to follow song okay yes that's definitely strong seven hey I appreciate you guys stopping by I

much the same thing wheat hot cheetos and these have a hundred and fifty milligrams in this whole bag this has 500 milligrams so you got a great fight I also got oh my gosh I am so excited for this you guys these are sour belts candies and I love blue raspberry like flavored candies like airheads the blue but skittles the blade skittles is a happening but like anything blue and this is blue so I'm really I'm really stoked and I've heard from a lot of people that these were really really bomb so they hyped me up they hyped me up when I went to go get this stuff I was hyped up to try this because I guess you only eat one or two strips and you get super high but I have a high tolerance so honey a 300 milligram one or two bites is not gonna do me justice but if it tastes bomb I'm with the ships and then this is more my style you already know we might beat us this is a freaking la lucha that lon mmm okay so I really want you to this like right now okay I also got for the last but not least you guys oh by the way this has a hundred and ten milligrams so a little bit over 100 milligrams my everything really so last time we did a lemonade edible for the drink in the first new thing and then for this time I really needed to freakin go in with the 1200 milligram THC syrup because I've tried to CV syrup I've tried codeine I tried it all you know and I even tried filming a video trying this but in the fruit punch flavor and YouTube decided to delete my video so you know LBD famine stoppable honey and I came back with a great flavor so when I went to the dispensary and they had grave I was like put back on my shopping list cuz I gotta try so I'm really hyped up for this honestly like I'm pretty pretty pretty pretty hyped it's 1,200 milligrams this is the most potent edible I've ever seen on the market and that I've ever consumed you guys have seen probably my previous videos of me eating a thousand milligrams brownies trying to do my makeup and all kinds of different things and I really am NOT a fan of brownies and you know I like the rice krispies treats but they just don't hit me as hard you know sour belts are bomb but I usually like little gummies or something but something like there's like a beverage gets you so [ __ ] up you guys if you ever want to try any of one of these edibles please try the syrup do yourself favorite so I'm just gonna hop right in by mixing up our syrup because I'm just so hyped so I have my double cup my my sprite with my sprite and yeah oh actually I'm gonna take a thumbnail damn taking it thumbnails kind of hard okey-dokey well I literally could wake up the whole neighborhood anyways step yeah just so you guys know like what time it is it is 12:30 exactamente 12:30 exactly so let's see how long it takes for these edibles to hit why don't we first gotta you know consumed that no mm-hmm so I have this syrup I'm gonna just shake it because I bet you it's been sitting for a minute make sure you shake that hole nice and dandy Wow look at the cap it looks like th season there alright I'm gonna show you guys up close personality wait it off when you have no groups and you don't want a nip slip it's kind of a brown I wish it was a prettier shade okay so I used a lot I don't know if I'm gonna like this one I'm licking the syrup and taste a great I don't know okay so a lot of people like to come at me like dest you swear like you're sipping lean Jaime its [ __ ] syrup same base okay therefore you're supposed to make like I want my [ __ ] to be mixed honey mixed Loki I'm making a mess [Applause] pretty mother [ __ ] bomb I can literally see the THC in my soda like it kind of looks green like if I wish you guys could see it but it literally looks like wax on my ice it looks good though it doesn't look like what the [ __ ] is in my cup it looks like ooh that's bad again me so so far so good you guys I would give this syrup a 10 out of 10 if I had to pick one edible that's like my favorite edible technically it would be the syrup because [ __ ] bring your spray whether you're going to [ __ ] Six Flags [ __ ] Disneyland like no I'm just kidding I don't know if you're a lot of bringing drinks to Disney but sticks legs I know you're allowed to bring your own drinks honey so best believe I'm putting this in like a little canister my hydro flask I actually just recently ordered a hydro flask for college and I guess I have a six like season pass so if any of you guys are trying to go please hit me up cuz I ain't got no homies to go with and I'm fine I bring this Sara you know pour up and a hydro guess you popular okay um I don't know should I smoke or should I eat the rest of the edibles this is a mute thing I guess I should just use edibles you know I have to try that you guys I I've been dying to try these hot cheetos like I said I've tried different brands and other Browns were bombed on fire so let's see if this Alito's friends compares hmm ooh smells like like a [ __ ] spicy cheese ball with a little bit of weed it doesn't really smell like weed though that's what it looks like got a [ __ ] hot cheeto this [ __ ] looks like our normal hot cheeto it tastes just like the other ones hmm these ones were a little bit cheaper cuz the other ones I tried were 300 milligrams these are only 150 milligrams so less potency the artist Lee is still super bomb hmm smoking a blunt eating your chips and then sipping your [ __ ] lien just kidding tasty syrup it doesn't get better than this you guys like Yuki a highest [ __ ] by sipping this this tastes so good it tastes like a grape flavored sprite I love it I kind of want to add more syrup you added to do it just so I could be like really [ __ ] up you killed me cuz this is 1,200 milligrams like the big if I wouldn't take any of the other edibles and I just drank this I would be dead I would be dead but the fact that I'm eating this and I'm eating edibles like Wow I never even added up the amount of milligrams that I'm consuming but let's see 150 the syrup is 1200 I probably won't drink the entire bottle of syrup because I want to mix it also in this sprite I'm going to a family party later at a pool best believe I won't be chilling by the pool with my sprite so later I'm gonna finish the rest of that but right now I'm putting like just the perfect amount I actually added a lot more so I'm gonna mix it so 1213 50 and then the rice krispies is 500 milligrams so B 1850 and then the sour belts these are three hundred so that'll be 2150 yeah and then this is a hundred and ten oh my gosh oh honey wait twenty one fifty plus one ten twenty one fifty plus one and 21 carry the one twenty to sixty right I'm already feeling it now I'm just getting back right am i right I believe it's around 20 160 so 2,000 160 milligrams that's insane other thing mmm and these chips are so bomb if you guys like to medicate but like microdose EPS look like a sandwich and you'll be chillin won't I'm obsessed with these chips homie bomb but else is gonna say oh yeah somebody tried commenting in my other neat thing video saying that Oh a thousand milligrams ain't [ __ ] that's equivalent to one gram honey honey honey let me just sit my soda these are spicy I got the extra flamin hot ones they had regular hot ones and I got the extra hot superbomb um honey what the [ __ ] you talking about 100 1000 milligrams is one gram I'm not trying to call you out or anything much love to you but you have nothing but good intentions but that's just insane hundred milligrams is equivalent to one grab so eating a 100 milligram edible like this most likely since its 110 they used about a gram and a half maybe probably less than that excuse me they probably used about a gram to make this to make this now they used a hundred grams to make it a thousand milligrams but it's actually more than a thousand to this 1200 so there's more than that for this 300 milligram edible it's around 3 grams do you feel me you feel what I'm feeling so yeah 500 about 5 grams so as a human as a [ __ ] Union who smokes every [ __ ] day you know once I get to the first second balloon I'll be chilling so it's about 4 grams in you know the third blender mice so that's around five grams of weed so evening around 500 milligrams of an edible will get me pretty chilling but like I said the Rice Krispies don't usually hit me but that's why it 100 milligram edibles don't really hit me because if I only smoke one blood one gram I'm not gonna get that high cuz I have a high tolerance but for someone who never smokes and eats even 20 milligrams of an edible will be super fun but you know it's not always about the number it's kind of about well what's your what's your past like what's your what's your tolerance like have you tried edibles before did you smoke a lot but you've never tried edibles like yeah oh okay so I'm trying to open these and I'm super excited to try these these are the styler belts damn if I can even open it wrong it smells like cotton candy let's try it I know that flavour rx makes some like these I mean my sister tried I may really like them hmm sour I don't like sour candy but I did it for the bike for the milk bank drop them on the floor five-second rule hello wrong number wrong number the [ __ ] why you calling my phone yeah so I was told that if you eat one or two of these you'll be [ __ ] up so I'm kind of gonna save them so I can eat one or two and see if I get [ __ ] up but today I just wanted to try them out and they're pretty bomb you guys like they don't taste like weed at all none of these edibles so far it tastes like weed I hate edibles that tastes like weed I've gotten hate in my past videos where I eat the 1000 milligram brownie because people are like why are you gagging so much like it's not even that bad the honey of course you're not gonna [ __ ] know because you ain't the one eating it but when I was eating it it tasted like I was eating weed and that [ __ ] tastes bad you know this it tastes like I'm eating a [ __ ] airheads and I get high smoke it was so that shit's pretty tight same with the chips it tastes like regular hot cheetos you know it doesn't taste like I'm eating them a nug so I feel like that's really important when it comes to edibles it's just like at least for me personally is like one is it gonna get me [ __ ] up - is it gonna taste like [ __ ] cuz I don't care if it gets me [ __ ] up if it tastes like [ __ ] tastes like [ __ ] and I don't care if they taste bomb if it doesn't get me [ __ ] up you know that's again [ __ ] up so this is the little logic become behind the life beam des and me picking my edibles knees are pretty bummed I like the blueberry I like the flavor it doesn't taste like weed aiyo there's a little hit of an aftertaste but not really stay what's on my Cheetos you know like you're gonna get those little aftertaste but it's not bad at all if I could tolerate it you could part ollar a because I have a really bad like if it tastes like weed I won't eat it I'll give it away straight up and that's right today I didn't buy any brownies because brownies and cookies no matter what Brad how potent it is you know I've eaten the thousand milligram IV the 100 milligrams from the best friends from kirova to enjoyable - lol edibles like I tried it all and I'm just not a fan of the cookies and brownies especially because when you make a fresh batch of cookies at home how long do those cookies taste bomb for you guys for the first [ __ ] five minutes that those cookies come out the oven after 5 minutes those cookies taste like hard [ __ ] breaks and they're not bomb same with the [ __ ] edibles they're gonna have it in the refrigerator for months weeks months years and then you're eating it and it's hard and it's just it's not like a fresh bomb [ __ ] cookie so until I find a company who makes a bomb cookie that's like super potent I'm gonna stay away from the baked goods I really like these though these are really really really good really good and I'm not a fan of sour candy I'm not a fan of candy I have a sweet tooth too but I have it in a way where like I crave hot cheetos I'm not one to crave chocolate or sour candy and like skills like every time I go to the gas station I don't buy candy I buy water and chips super spicy chips and water so I don't I don't pass out I want to spark my blood already but I still have two more edibles to try freeze so I'm gonna try this one I'm super excited for this one this says Tama reand oh so this is a tambourine dough you guys if I ever have a me angry I'm gonna have a pinata and it's gonna be filled of these you know let's give it a gander my shirts already [ __ ] up this should taste like [ __ ] there's like a bunch of the product in the cap like that's already my 50 milligrams right there homie the [ __ ] this edible is too messy honestly it's not even that it tastes bad it's just that it's so hard to eat pbbbbbt I remember being little and thinking that was so fun to like push up these like normal candy I says it has sugar chili THC extract caramel citric acid I'm an enol egg corn product that's so weird I don't like it I'm kind of like like I don't know it's kind of like when you think about it it's like yeah like caramel and like what else did you see corn acid the [ __ ] Beach I bought this for you guys honestly I thought that maybe you guys would want to see it and it was like unique and it was cheap so 300 milligrams but honestly I don't really [ __ ] with it I wouldn't buy this to be like Tiki I wanna get high like no [ __ ] I'd rather just buy a topic rather by the sour Bell just cuz that's so much easier to eat like this it's already coming out from like the bottom right here it's all over the cap okay you guys have one more edible to try and that is this Wow crisps fruit [ __ ] so it looks like this I tried all kinds of different brands of the same Mountain milligrams oh I guess smell the weed I get smelly smells beautiful these are my favorite he's like if I can eat this every day I would Bob this is pretty bomb I really do like it it tastes a little bit like weed though out of all the edibles here I think this one smells the most like eat and taste the most like lead so really full all right you guys honestly [ __ ] the [ __ ] my camera just stopped recording for some random ass reason probably cuz I'm taking too damn long but let us spark my roach I haven't smoked all day and I honestly do love smoking obviously do love smoking but like I'm not an addict no but like you know you could eat edibles all day you know get high as [ __ ] whatever whatever but I like smoking like I like smoking my ganja and chillin so we finally get turned up on the life being dead you kill me I know you do wait I think I was imminent just to get to the big bucks ain't got no bad intentions just occupation I don't know how to so I'm gonna go do something productive like that but I hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm gonna take a little bite of everything before I go whoa first book is 10 o'clock so I'll be back at 10:30 and then it would be like an official power ok maybe at like little past we'll see yeah it's so [ __ ] saying hey I really want to go to sleep like I feel so [ __ ] tired I just I probably look all like dead right now but um I have two little Tommy Party and I looked at the address you days and it's so far cuz I live far you know and make family looks like so it's like far it's like driving on ago they do we owe you no honey there are red ants there are red ants [ __ ] girl and um I'm just gonna say that I'm high as [ __ ] and I'm really scared to get bit by rhythms which love for me to you guys every day and really cool a bit stay low stay obviously positive so if if dad told me okay in case you guys I swear everything you I got it look cute but now show me myself my dog I feel um I guess a lot I can't because it's called my block camera he's like [ __ ] lost the battery that was traveling so I said it was a camera but that's the battery charger so I'm just you see that physical account it is a literally 8 very right now it's 8:31 it's a while I've just been sleeping all day you guys I didn't go hello [ __ ] family party I [ __ ] slept I wasted a [ __ ] brand-new pair of eyelashes I don't know how to feel about it but my family just pulled up so I'm gonna go before this gets awkward so will these guys be sure to thumbs up the video if you guys liked it and I majored a little bit brighter [Music]", "6O5gl_8aTOc": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] you", "VmNSto519TE": "hey guys welcome back to my youtube channel today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make at home nerd ropes basically so one of the first things that we have to do is we have to get our supplies guys sorta head to the store okay I made it to the storm at Walmart and I'm gonna go inside and get some gummi bears or worms whatever I can find and nerds and that is all you will be needing at the stores so let's go see ok I'm back in there and it's pouring outside cuz I assume my brother wants some and my family wanna try some so I got three nerds cuz you know they always cheat you and then I got a huge bag of parbo harrybo I don't say it gummy bears to melt oh my god for shattering that's what I'm gonna be doing it's so loud so he goes oh when I get home because I'm soaked right now and I'm just gonna drive home I'll see you when we got there hey guys I'm back from the store and by the way it was pouring like pouring when I was driving on the roads were flooding so if you don't know what organ is there you go um but yeah so I've got all this fight got three nerds big bag of this and I've got these to sort the colors of gummy bears and this should just put the Nerds it first things first let's open up these nerds and see how much is in it and import into this we have this much nerds I almost call them M&Ms we got the Nerds in there now I'm gonna sort the different colors out we've got five of them right here and there's five colors I looked on the back yeah there's pineapple lemon raspberry orange strawberry and you guys gonna say this is gross but just [Applause] well that's mg okay oh I guess I'll just sort of how I go this one will be green I'm gonna put you guys on a little time lapse while I'm doing this [Music] you [Music] now I have them all sorted out voila we've got clear pineapple yellow lemon green strawberry I don't know this I believe is cherry and this is orange ugly so and then we got our nerds now now we have to go melt them in the kitchen so let's go I'm in the kitchen now and I'm going to melt the red first because it's the biggest but before I do that I need to fill these empty ones fill the bottom with nerds so once the red is ready and just drop it on in there and then cover it with nerds so the red is gonna be our first experiment and then we'll learn off of that so let's put her in the microwave through like 45 it is see if I'm asked to put it in for longer yeah but it's almost melted like okay so it almost melted focus Queen yeah see look uh yeah so we'll probably do like maybe one minute would be perfect so we'll wait about kailyn's cooking our stupid food and I'm gonna fill these up I'm going back in for lunch city 30 but now I know the other ones going for like a minute but these artists spell it much so we'll see girl she was bubbling okay so it's definitely ready okay now we put now you put the layer over the top well I think I'm stupid dude look at that there's the layer of that on top on top gummy bears and there's the bottom and it didn't run through so I'm gonna put this in the freezer now Green Green is up next we're gonna do one minute death it's kind of the same it's a little less than red but one minute should be good I'll watch the other one was bad it's too long Oh again one minute is too long I repeat one minute is too into the freezer the green goes why laughs there she is okay I'm actually gonna be on my phone while my camera's charging so we've got orange yellow and clear laughs we've got these here I don't know what to do with like the rest of them melted so I'm just gonna leave it over here and do not I repeat do not put the gummy bears in for a minute it is too long and it will bubble over and then you're gonna have to clean the thing what we're gonna do yellow this time and we're only putting this in for 30 seconds and I'm watching it the whole time the other time I said it was but I forgot and now I'm actually gonna watch it because I'm scared so let's do a third you know what's your 25 I'm scared perfect timing they are all melted okay the freezer the lemon goes see there you go okay oranges up my favorite color we're doing 30 seconds okay all right Gina going in the freezer last one we'll put it in for 30 seconds damn clear pineapple going in the freezer and I'm gonna leave them in there for like 20 minutes so it's 148 I will come back at 1:00 no I will come back at 2:08 guys 208 they're in there and I don't know what to do with these so I guess I'm just gonna clean them okay you have all the containers soaking in hot water with soap and I tried to scoop out as much so good in the trash and I don't have very many nerds left all right everybody we it's been an hour later so when you guys do this make sure you wait an hour because it actually takes a long time for it to rego back let's take it all out and go off of the last one you did just so you can make sure that you have all so I got him out this is how mine's doing so far it's peeling up like that it looks like really cool look at mine yes I repaired it yeah I'm reporting an anime that looked beautiful totally killin candle at this just shut out look at mine mm-hmm mine's better she's excuse me mind spoke jeez she's focusing on hers that was cheating and look the Nerds are going everywhere now we have a bad kitchen problem yeah all right well um um I'll see you guys when I get in the room with these and I was gonna try and cut them but no okay guides so we are back in my room and these we've only done two so far we're gonna let the others sit till their room temperature so they'll go back down to being a gummy instead of like frozen cuz they're in the freezer so these ones do you ever like peel out as you saw and yeah so I guess I'll just eat it like a burger bun but here they are holy crap that was a cold one just very good it was really good very sugary like but look the inside it turned to a gummy now it's back at room temperature and it did taste like a nerd rope just there's a lot more rope as you would say the gummy part also very good if you look at the inside red on the inside if you like sour gummy stuff what does mean I like sour gummy stuff as a candy if I chose and these are really good for that but if you don't feel like chocolates and stuff this is not your thing so it's not Kalyan Singh it's probably not gonna be my mom's thing either but I didn't video though in the last part because I was cutting out the rest of them so we've already done these two those are a lot bigger and I cut these down to small pieces so right here we have a pineapple crap right here we have orange and right here we have a woman and I'm excited to try the lemon the orange it is very good very good lemon here we go lemon is my favorite so far it is very good don't let me down pineapple does that lemon that was really good lemons like my second padbole my favorite that is so good this was actually really fun to film and I think it'd be fun to try it too but just don't eat like the whole thing or you might have a heart attack so don't do that because it is a lot of sugar literally gummy bears and nerds are literally just sugar but that's literally what it is so like girl make sure you eat something else with that and drink water so yeah this was super fun stay tuned for more videos because I've got a lot of fun videos coming up and I just got a new computer for Christmas and it can hold Adobe Premiere Pro so I'm gonna be doing

upside down and click click the red button okay guys and hopefully you guys try some of this easter spring candy happy easter", "xbg8gGtJoSY": "[Music] hey guys what's going on it's zach with top shelf so today i'm going to be reviewing the keefe life h2o kiwi strawberry it's a pretty interesting little drink they've uh they've got it down to calories down really really low it's down to 50 calories for the entire container or uh was that five to five calories per dose so that's pretty crazy 1.3 total carbs for the entire bottle uh 1.2 grams of sugar these bottles come with these little serving caps and it's a little it's uh looks like two little over two of these is one dose says the bottle says 35 milligrams so i'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna pour it over a little glass of ice the kids got me this for uh for christmas so i'm gonna go ahead and use this here i'm gonna pour it over a little glass of ice see what it looks like almost perfect so it's uh clear it doesn't really look like water like they say it is but let's give it a little taste very good very light tastes almost like a propel which is pretty cool so those are always good to drink so the whole bottle they claim to have 191 milligrams of thc per bottle which there's 10 servings per dose which makes each serving about 19 milligrams um zero cbd cbda there is four milligrams of cbd in though which is pretty cool so they're starting to get those up um cost for these roughly about 40 dollars a bottle give or take depending on the dispensary you go to and the taxes they have so it's really not bad it's a lot easier to drink than that root beer that's for sure but you know you could always add these take a you know your morning coffee i don't know if you like any fruit or whatever fruity flavor in your coffee but add this to your your coffee or your mixed drink or something like that you know you don't know you don't have to drink it straight like this but it isn't bad drinking like this [Music] either [Music] so there it is so we'll let you know how it is here in a few minutes so in the meantime while we sit and hang out wait and see how it feels i'm gonna edit some videos for the next show [Music] yeah so i was reading checking some stuff out guys and i found out some interesting stuff about keith so uh last year they sold over a million products last year um it's pretty cool you know to to hear that a cannabis company is selling a million a million products in a year um their uh their first product was a uh like a five hour energy style a healthy five hour energy style um shot that was uh kind of like a full keefe drink but it was just in a shot so would have been uh that would be pretty cool if we can get something like that in the market in the future um you know they uh they're actually working right now with a former blue moon brewer to make a non-alcoholic thc beer so once i get the recipe and everything on that down that might be something that might be interesting to try you know i don't know if it's going gonna be a regular thing i can't imagine a cannabis beer uh beer is an acquired taste so i have a feeling that would be a uh extra acquired taste but you know that's something that they're working on you know my who knows it might hit the missouri market one day um some other cool stuff i found out was the uh the reason or so smoking cannabis you absorb the most cannabinoids than any other method of absorb of consuming cannabis um that's including thc the reason why some people will take an edible a small dose edible and feel it a lot more is you might absorb more of that thc but that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to metabolize it the same way when you're using edibles you're metabolizing that thc a lot differently it's going through your liver and it's running through your body a lot different than as if you're inhaling through your lungs so that's why some people will have those quite a bit different experiences on edibles um for me you know it's uh my towel like i've brought up in the last one my tolerance is pretty high i drink the uh the entire 200 milligrams um and all i'm feeling it um you know it's a pretty it's a it is a little uplifting energetic you know i kind of feel like doing stuff i've been sitting here editing videos stuff for our next show so it's a it's kind of energetic but at the same time i'm relaxed i'm feeling good you know i'm not ready to pass out at least yet you know i'm about an hour and so it's a it is very it's a very good drink i think would be a good drink during the day you know it's not a put you to bed kind of drink or anything like that even though i'm sure i'm gonna sleep good tonight but we shall see maybe i'll add a little bit of that to the end so i've been working pretty good today helping mix up the dirt the dank and working on the on the house we're putting in some floating hardwood floors taking that drink i was actually really surprised how how much it took the pain away you know with smoking it usually does help a lot but it doesn't usually completely take it away and right now i'm feeling fine helping my knee pain and everything my shoulder pain i'll give it that it did take the full bottle for me so you know for me one dose is a full bottle and 40 bucks a bottle it's a little much but if you're if one or two doses for you is all you need you know it's a little more cost effective but it's still you know it's better than flower prices but it is still up there so they still need to work on that um flavor-wise it's it's on point i thought it would taste pretty good obviously you can tell by my eyes i'm definitely feeling it morning number two it was pretty it was all right you know i slept pretty good kind of woke up with a little bit of a uh edible hangover i guess you could say a little bit of a headache um but other than that it was pretty it was all right you know i'd give the whole drink uh let's say a six out of ten um it was decent price was a little high but drink itself was pretty decent um i felt it um taste give about a nine out of ten taste was right on point uh let's see the effects keith root beer that i did a couple weeks ago i actually felt more off of so the the fact that this was a double the thc and i didn't feel quite as much it's kind of kind of let me down so i'll rate that one at six um obviously the health wise it's very very low sugar all that stuff so we got to give that like a nine compared to them root beers with 31 grams of sugar i mean if you're gonna get a drink and you want to stay healthy definitely get one of those kind of drinks so all right you guys take it easy stay lifted [Music] you", "jccXdajjJME": "i'm building a team of like-minded people who want to

toxic me back again and today we don't got a cannabis review and we have got a bond review what we have got it is a lien review people don't know what lean is it says on here THC glean syrup so ste HD syrup slash mean basically lean it's there's no me like a codeine version the Americans are drinking and the kind of his community has made th e version so I decided to make my own and I learn how to make it and I mean well so this one here is blackberry push so nice bit of blackberry cush lean here and we have 100 milliliters and in one hundred hundred milliliters we've got a hundred milligrams of THC Rosen when I said I don't know if you guys can see it because one light pardon me he's so bright but we've got the stickers on there we've got the little telling us what is inside of it little diagram and then we've got the warning sticker on the back so yeah so nice little bottle sweet watches but I'll get into this if we can see it's got some scissors so she doesn't know so just yes perfect winter all right nice little bit there and what we do is I'm gonna open it up and show you guys on the top there is a seal I don't drip out oh there is metal see it on the top he's just to see her so don't split up because sometimes the cups int they're the greatest so I didn't decide it two-seater and how I done that there's a little trick that I learned so I'm not gonna explained by my show people one day on video so if people want to see it up in the comments but yeah another thing as well why does no boxes of Clairol boxes got rid of all the boxes for this year what could I do every year now is the new boxes I'm going to start building up because I'm other ones were looking a bit tatty so I decided to do that no good again to this then what we've got is four cups cuz how small the Cubs on we got enough gonna fit all four in lie to you though because I don't know how sweet the syrup is so the first one and put the others to the side the first one what we're gonna do is just a taste test one justice managed to put in so we're gonna go about halfway at this one may be called work probably actually them do a quarter on each but if it's not sweet enough because we're using lemonade so show you guys the cutter nice looking like raspberry red I would say he's probably about cool so yeah if we look at that nice whereas we looking right syrup nice-looking one so we never need fresh ball and soon and that will taste test see what it tastes like obviously we're gonna need to stir it so I'm gonna use is City making dirty drink I've got fresh syringes I live by boxes of them for a juice is the THC stuff and stuff like that we've got the 10 mils kind of got the meal swim just juiced up just mix it up frost over a little oh wow mmm that's nice mmm that's really nice got lip there from this passing me you spoke a little bit but yeah it's really nice the flavour that first taste it's definitely a raspberry definitely a nice raspberry and then you get like more of like a mad you know the Miller couch that's nice really nice hmm-what lemonade it's very syrupy it's very sweet I understand where's your syrup oh yeah you can definitely taste the weed now it's like because this one's made with Aris oil is more of like a resin so imagine or smoking hash you get that more resin he tastes that's what this is more like so instead of being more like a queen marijuana like infusion when you're infusing a better boss is more of a like a like I said a resin pure resin so but then there's definitely okay and you get that cush flavor so that's nice really nice what word do you know just to get this quickly done because I'm gonna do half of the video or like say corporate a video no cut it off let it kick in a little bit so the videos not so long and then after it's been cut off and kicked in a little I'll come back and explain to you guys exactly how I feel and let you guys how I let you guys know how I feel because most of my videos they take ages I don't like them take too long half an hour's too fun for me so I like roughly around about 10 to 15 minutes so there's a good time nice strong oh and because this is made with RSO oil it is quicker than basically edibles edibles take between 45 minutes to an hour to kick in this takes 15 to 20 minutes to kick in so it's a lot quicker in the time so yeah it's like basically their time that it takes to kick in lot quicker instead of taking that 45 to an hour and why we're filling up all four like I said it was going to try down them off getting into our system as quick as possible hopefully don't spew up because the syrup tastes like crap it's alright it's nice don't get me wrong but it's too sweet and when you've got stuff too sweet it's not the best mix but oh wow that last one I've got much in compare to the rest the rest is Michael just like red color that was more of a pinky color so I say you know who's got lesson that's why I like the red coloration syrup and like I said before we used our I mean we're just put out on the side and because we've used it before already just next month remember soil so you've got a mixer and the same as the circus more like Sarah Foyle to both oil base erupts and the are ourselves oil base so it's all gonna float and the water is gonna be on the bottom and the oils gonna be on the top so you want to get rid of a mixture a bit more and mix it into it so let's try go for these [Applause] - pardon me - more but yeah this is worse than drinking alcohol like I said cuz the sweetness is how cause a bit more bitter you could down it off a bit quicker this is a lot different to you before I down off the mother - so I don't make me to feel - sick after it is but it's nice with the bitter taste so lemony is probably better all I made something like none because you want more of a bitter taste in it if it's sweet so even though the video just cut off I just put the drink down now we're gonna down off these two before it takes too long again and it'll be back Oh pardon me not a sport so it don't all for now and the first two it's probably about ten minutes I'll say five ten minutes into it now so we've got a video quickly we're gonna sit down have a little relax for about two three minutes I'm going to be back to explain as we start feeling it rise up so see you in a couple of minutes guys safe you're safe guys it's a caucus meet back again and it's been about 15 minutes now Wow roughly we've got about a million half and I'm feeling nice perfectly nice and high nice and Medicaid age this is like imagine edibles bar say a little bit stronger than edibles because it hits you in quicker time so imagine an order effect and you know and if you aren't that edibles before then you know won't know what I'm on about yeah but if you have then you will but when you meet edibles I said quest kit builds up without of all this it does the same that amount of time so you feel it a lot quicker pardon me still broken and I'll just stop there just me ago looking at my bomb for about a minute and I realized oh [ __ ] I'm looking at my baggage for making her so I feel hi that was nice it's one of the best highs I've had like I said first time try and lean so it's really really nice that's one of them nice medicated eyes instead of feeling stoned when you smoke weed you feel stoned because it's a different high this is a lot different if you took edibles or lean it's well I would go in and take a hundred medical straight away start off with about coal power so what I done in one of the cups that's about twenty five a four to four quarters twenty five an inch that's probably a little bit more in each one of mine and less in the last one so I don't know why I'm measuring but I feel nice anyways before you leave it here I'm gonna say like a real box gonna say but yeah believe it here I've got some nice things for the Q&A coming oh that's still happening I'm just getting those different things it's gonna be a Q&A slash one man versus half homes video on live so this could be a mixture of CBD and teaching so keep your eyes peeled for that that should be coming up soon very very soon although need as many questions as possible for the Q&A so chuck me questions as much you can about my life about weed about youtube about anything I'm doing on YouTube and I think any platforms of YouTube sorted your platforms if you're watching both platforms then ask me stuff about them as well but this is really good for concentration I'm okay I feel focused I'm not stirring and mumbling as much as I would on weed so ourselves pretty bad for me I'll say Don say make sure you smash that like it's much bad a lot of it I know I'm keep saying it on all of them but I just want the videos to track its many likes I literally it only gets about 10 to 12 bucks at Norman I want it to hit over 15 to 20 so come on we could do it everyone good yeah all its just clicking a bug but yeah I felt me sick because his syrup and I can feel yes sir squishing onto my stomach I'm feeling nice and medicated I'm gonna say make sure you subscribe turn on the notifications the little bar like on makes you click it yeah so you'll know when you click the notifications it's just little icon right next to subscribe I'm gonna say it's talks at me I feeling so stoned I can already think none so yes focus that makes you focus but in certain ways you wrong now she'll could be sterner stuff so I'll stand over here up to certain things I'm just looking at random stuff seven countries in mind that we staring on for a while and I've taught me forget what I'm saying but yeah it stocks at me and I feel top knee high I'm medicated makes you stay how I'm medicated and without of you peace guys see [Music]"}
